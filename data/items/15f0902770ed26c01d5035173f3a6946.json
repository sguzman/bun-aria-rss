  "description": "The first game of the 2020 season is in the books with the same team that won the final game of 2019, emerging victorious. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech break down the Chiefs 34-20 victory over the Texans in the opener. The final score doesn't truly showcase how dominant the champs were on Thursday night. And it wasn't your typical performance from Kansas City. Patrick Mahomes was very good as usual, but it was diminutive rookie RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire that stole the show. On the opposite end, David Johnson looked a bit rejuvenated but Houston was still clearly missing the big-play threat of DeAndre Hopkins. How did Bill O'Brien manage to screw this one up?
