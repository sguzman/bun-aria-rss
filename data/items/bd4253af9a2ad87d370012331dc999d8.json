  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/angelamwebber\">Angela</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AubreyCello\">Aubrey</a> Webber are the musical group <a href=\"http://www.thedoubleclicks.com/\">The Doubleclicks</a>, bringing geeky music to nerdy folk. The sisters never intended to form a band, but when Aubrey joined her sister Angela in Portland a few years ago, her cello coupled with Angela's singing caused enough of a stir for them to join forces and write songs about Dungeons & Dungeons, the Curiosity rover, and not dissing the geek girl.
