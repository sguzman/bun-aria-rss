  "description": "<p>This week, in Skamania, Washington, where a bloodbath is discovered, in a local home, on New Year's Day. There are several bodies, and several loose ends, including a missing teenager, and a sick grandpa, who is incapable of speech, and can't be relied upon as a witness. The scene is horrific, with the walls, bathed in blood, but the crime scene, and everything else in this case, are handled terribly, possibly because it was literally the Sheriff's first day on the job! Missing evidence, botched tests... So, was it a stranger, or a teen, murdering his whole family & committing necrophillia on his big sister? Either way, there are no good answers here!</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that Washington takes it's timber very seriously, that some people who don't have any friends, also have an awful lot of friends, and your first day on any job shouldn't include finding three dead bodies!!</p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p> </p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p> </p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on...</p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p> </p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
