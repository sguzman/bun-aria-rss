  "title": "65 - When Does God Answer Prayer?",
  "description": "In this episode we visit a question submitted from VOX Community regarding prayer.  When does God answer prayer? Why does He answer other prayers and not yours?  Why does he seem to answer our small prayers, and not answer those in the trenches of tragedy like Aleppo.  We offer a couple bad answers to these, and perhaps the right one.  Looking forward to your comments and thoughts!\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nInvest in and support the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
