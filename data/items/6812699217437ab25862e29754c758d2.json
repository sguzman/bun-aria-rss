  "description": "We could say a lot about this episode of Deep State Radio but there is really nothing more that needs to be said beyond the fact that this discussion featuring Pulitzer Prize-winning military historian and author of \"Churchill & Orwell: The Fight for Freedom\" Tom Ricks, Stanford's Kori Schake, Georgetown's Rosa Brooks, the New York Times' David Sanger and host David Rothkopf, columnist for the Washington Post, is the best discussion of the rapidly deteriorating situation between the U.S. & North Korea that you will hear anywhere.  Warning: It is also really really depressing and should only be listened to in the deepest reaches of your silo while drinking copious amounts of box wine.
