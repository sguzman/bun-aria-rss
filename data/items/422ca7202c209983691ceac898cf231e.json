  "description": "Time after time, COVID has delivered worst case scenarios. So why, now, would we rely on our hope that those scenarios--new variants, failures of leadership, new outbreaks--will not occur? Will the holidays bring people back together? Or will they see a worsening situation? What should our leaders be doing that they're not? What should we be doing to take care of ourselves? We talk with Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett and former senior Obama WH official and practicing physician Dr. Kavita Patel.
