  "description": "This sucks. I didn't think I would have to consider rebroadcasting any of these interviews that I have done over the course of the past few years but Jon Bunch passed away recently and I immediately thought this was appropriate to revisit the incredible conversation I had at Jon's house back in 2013. My thoughts go out to his family and everyone affected by this tremendous loss. He was one of my favorite vocalists of all time and we should all collectively thank his memory for his contributions to our little scene.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
