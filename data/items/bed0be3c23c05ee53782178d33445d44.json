  "description": "<p>The world's largest erector set:  the Lustron was a house you put together with a screwdriver.  It was metal, yet would never rust.  It was ingeniously heated and insulated.  It came on a truck ready for assembly.  A brilliant design produced only a few years after WWII, the Lustron now has a cult following to repair and preserve them -- or assemble ones long in storage.</p> <p><br /> Author Tom Fetters is King of Lustrons, the go-to guy for anything about these unique houses.  He also has interests in railroad history and dirigibles. His book The Lustron Home chronicles the history of the Lustron Corporation—how it started, why it failed, and what Lustron means to post-war America.</p> <p>Virginia Faust is by day a realtor for Howard Perry and Walston and by night the research engine behind North Carolina Modernist Houses (NCMH), scouring the state to document Lustrons and other livable works of art.  She developed a special love for Lustrons from growing up in Ohio where they were plentiful.</p> <p>Find out what Frank gets in the mail!  Finally, the difference between a blimp and a dirigible!  And opportunities for owning your own Lustron!</p>",
