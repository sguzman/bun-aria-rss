  "description": "<p>We continue our interview with Dublin police Sergeant, Misty Carausu who was key in getting Denise and Aaron cleared of any potential charges and bringing the&nbsp;true&nbsp;offender to justice. Misty takes us step by step on her relentless search for more information on MM, based on her instinct that he had been involved in other crimes. She talks about her numerous calls to other police departments, calls to the FBI, follow ups on other similar cases and complaints, collecting all kinds of evidence — yet many times her efforts were brushed off by the very people who should have been welcoming her leads. Laura and Jim share with Misty their theories about the primary motivation in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>LINK TO VICTIM F BOOK</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SUPPORT OUR OTHER SHOWS!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>CRIME ANALYST -&nbsp;Across The Forgotten Victim series, Laura Richards analyses and deconstructs the murders and attacks on lone women committed by Peter Sutcliffe (known as PS throughout the series) in the north east of England in the 1960s and 1970s.
