Biden visits Alabama and incorrectly says we sent javelin missiles to Russia. Comedian Dave Chappelle gets tackled while on stage. And lastly, we love donuts and hate \"May the Fourth\" be with you.\nSponsors:\nHome Title Lock: Everything is stored online these days - including your home's title information.
