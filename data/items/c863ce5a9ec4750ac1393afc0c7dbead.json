  "description": "While police departments around the country are springing child rapists from the slammer, law enforcement is turning a decidedly less lenient eye on another group of miscreants: Christian pastors. We will examine why preachers are getting arrested while the criminals run free. Then, everyone from politicians to grocery store workers are jumping to take advantage of this pandemic. We’ll take a look at ethics in times of plague. Finally, Joe Biden—remember him?—launches a podcast, and much like the entire mainstream media, he refuses to mention the #MeToo allegation against him.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
