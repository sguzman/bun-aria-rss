  "description": "Hey y'all! We're here with part one of Flirting with Forever by Cara Bastone! In this episode, Melody is a big nit-pick and Erin is an enthusiastic stan, but we both LOVED the book! We've got a grumpy Public Defender hero and a small business owning, ray of sunshine heroine. It's the first time Erin has seen her profession reflected back to her accurately and the hijinks are excellent overall. \n Plus, we're doing a Patreon fundraiser this month!

Make sure to check out their organization and head to our patreon for tons of bonus content! \n Bonus Content: Mel *didn't* forget her partner's birthday, Mel gets to live her giantess dreams, Erin doesn't love this role reversal, and so much more! \n Lady Loves: \n Erin: get you some vitamins!
