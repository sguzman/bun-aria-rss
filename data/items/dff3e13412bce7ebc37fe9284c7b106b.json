A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nThings still getting weird, Oct 4th 2016\nWith the Presidential Election of 2016 barrelling down on the American People, we continue to see the confusion and irational behaviour pouring forth in to the American lexicon. From not speaking about things to teaching and enforcing restrictions and limitation on language we are building or allowing to be built a second generation of people that are incapable of dealing with others, afraid of words and lack the ability to identify and manipulate situations that require substantial interaction between differing peoples. Join me as I examine instances of this in the political field and higher education. \n\n Podcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
