  "title": "210: Meditation, Therapy, and \"Murderous Rage\", Dr. Susan Pollak",
  "description": "Dr. Susan Pollak found refuge in meditation at a young age, introduced to it by a family member. Describing herself as an anxious and neurotic kid, she noticed how meditation offered her some relief. Pollak has remained fascinated with meditation ever since. She earned degrees in comparative religion and psychology, becoming a psychologist, and for decades she has been integrating the practice of mediation into psychotherapy. In her new book, “Self-Compassion for Parents,” she explains why parents need to care for themselves first in order to provide the best care for their children. For those short on time, she’s created meditation practices that take just a few minutes and she explains how even small moments of mindfulness can make a big difference.\nPlug Zone\nThe Institute for Meditation and Psychotherapy: http://meditationandpsychotherapy.org/\nCenter for Mindfulness and Compassion: https://www.chacmc.org/\nThe Art of Now Blog: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-art-now\nWebsite: https://www.drsusanpollak.com/\nSelf-Compassion for Parents:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Self-Compassion-Parents-Nurture-Caring-Yourself/dp/1462533094\nAdditional Books: https://www.drsusanpollak.com/books.php\nAddiction-Related\nJudson Brewer, MD, PhD (Habit Change): https://www.brown.edu/public-health/mindfulness/people/judson-brewer-md-phd\nG.
