In 2019, MRC and executive producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara attempted a pivot to the small screen with a more faithful reimagining of King's work. By dialing back to the origins of the series (see: 1997's prequel novel <em>Wizard and Glass</em>), Mazzara envisioned a multi-season arc for Amazon and director Stephen Hopkins shot the pilot in Croatia. Sadly, the streaming giant passed on the series in early 2020, leaving the 60-minute pilot in limbo. Fans were in turmoil. Recently, however, <em>The Losers' Club</em> was fortunate enough to screen the pilot, and gathered together to palaver over what they saw.</p><br><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> The Losers also spoke to Mazarra himself, who regaled them with insightful behind-the-scenes anecdotes and piles of notes for what could have been future episodes and seasons. Without spoiling anything, Mazarra truly remembered the face of his father, and the entire saga more or less amounts to a painful What If? in King's Dominion.
