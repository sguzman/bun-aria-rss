We also aim to help teachers get their classes excited about writing. Our mission is based on the understanding that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one attention, and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success. Last year our tutoring centers — located in Ann Arbor, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC — served over 29,000 students.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6639995574951px; line-height: 20.1599998474121px;\">For more information: http://826national.org/chapters/ </p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 12px; color: #22242f; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.6639995574951px; line-height: 20.1599998474121px;\">Visit The Time Travel Mart online: http://826la.org/store/</p>",
