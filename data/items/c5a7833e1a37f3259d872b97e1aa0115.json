  "description": "<p>LIVE from the VFW post in Florence, MA: It's the Kirk Minihane Show, with special guest Jared Carrabis. We delve further into the simmering romance between Mr. Carrabis and the 25-year-old YouTube star with whom he is infatuated. The Steve's a Liar Guy supplies an instant classic parody song. Jared reveals that he has starred in not one, but two sex tapes. We present Commander Tom with a check for $30,000 and he gives Kirk a size small leather vest. Dale answers his phone be cause he's old. (As this recording is taking place, Steve from Providence is more than 40 miles away.)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
