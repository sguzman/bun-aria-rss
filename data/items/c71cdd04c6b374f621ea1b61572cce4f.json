  "content:encoded": "<p>awhile ago i posted\n   <a href=\"/blog/2010/08/06/my-list-of-cool-machine-learning-books/\">my list of cool machine learning books</a>,\n   but it's been awhile so it's probably time to update it...\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/mml.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://mml-book.github.io\">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>\n   by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal & Cheng Soon Ong.</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is my personal favorite book on the general math required for machine learning,\n   the way things are described really resonate with me.\n   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the\n   first half.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/laalfd.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/\">Linear Algebra and Learning from Data</a>\n   by Gilbert Strang.</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and\n   <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/\">his freely available lectures</a>\n   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with\n   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/itla.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/\">Introduction to Linear Algebra</a>\n   by Gilbert Strang.</b>\n</p>\n<p>this was my favorite linear algebra book for a long time before his 'learning from\n   data' came out. this is a larger book with a more comprehensive view of linear algebra.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/ts.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/\">Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers</a> by Allen Downey.</b>\n</p>\n<p>this book focuses on practical computation methods for probability and statistics.\n   i got a lot out of working through this one.\n   it's all in python and available for free.\n   ( exciting update! as part of writing this post i've discovered there's a new edition\n   to read!)\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/dbda.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/\">Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</a>\n   by John Kruscgke</b>\n</p>\n<p>on the bayesian side of things this is the book i've most enjoyed working through.\n   i've only got the first edition which was R and\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS\">BUGS</a> but i see\n   the second edition is R,\n   <a href=\"http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/\">JAGS</a> and\n   <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\">Stan</a>.\n   it'd be fun i'm sure to work through it doing\n   everything in <a href=\"https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro\">numpyro</a>. i might do that in all\n   my free time. haha. \"free time\" hahaha. sob.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/eosl.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/\">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a>\n   by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is still one of the most amazing fundamental machine learning books i've ever had.\n   in fact i've purchased this book <em>twice</em> and given it away both times :/ i might buy another\n   copy some time soon, even though it's been freely available to download for ages. an\n   amazing piece of work.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/pgm.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b>\n   <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models\">Probabilistic Graphical Models</a>\n   by Daphne Koller & Nir Friedman</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is an epic textbook that i'd love to understand better. i've read a couple of sections in\n   detail but not the entire tome yet.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/praml.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/\">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>\n   by Christopher Bishop</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is probably the best overall machine learning text book i've ever read. such a beautiful book\n   and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf\">the pdf is FREE FOR DOWNLOAD!!!</a>\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/mlapp.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1\">Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a> by Kevin Murphy</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is my second favorite general theory text on machine learning.\n   i got kevin to sign my copy when he was passing my desk once but\n   someone borrowed it and never gave it back :(\n   so if you see a copy with my name on the spine let me know!\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/homl.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/\">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is the book i point most people to when they are interested in getting up\n   to speed with modern applied machine learning without too much concern for the\n   theory. it's very up to date (as much as a book can be) with the latest libraries\n   and, most importantly, provides a good overview of not just neural stuff but fundamental\n   <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a> as well.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/mle.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php\">Machine Learning Engineering</a> by Andriy Burkov</b>\n</p>\n<p>a great book focussing on the operations side of running a machine learning system. i'm a bit\n   under half way through the free online version and very likely to buy a physical copy to finish\n   it and support the author. great stuff and, in many ways, a more impactful book than any of\n   the theory books here.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/itdm.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php\">Introduction to Data Mining</a>\n   by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach & Vipin Kumar</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is another one that was also on my list from ten years ago and though it's section\n   on neural networks is a bit of chuckle these days there is still a bunch of really\n   great fundamental stuff in this book. very practical and easy to digest. i also see there's\n   a second edition now. i reckon this would compliment the \"hands on\" book above very well.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/salp.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/\">Speech and Language Processing</a>\n   by Dan Jurafsky & James Martin</b>\n</p>\n<p>still the best overview of NLP there is (IMHO). can't wait to read the 3rd edition which\n   apparently will cover more modern stuff (e.g. transformers) but until then, for the\n   love of god though, please don't be one of those \"this entire book is\n   irrelevant now! just fine tune BERT\" people :/\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/no.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5\">Numerical Optimization</a>\n   by Jorge NocedalStephen J. Wright</b>\n</p>\n<p>this book is super hard core and maybe more an operations\n   research book than machine learning. though i've not read it cover to cover the\n   couple of bits i've worked through really taught me a lot. i'd love to understand\n   the stuff in this text better; it's so so fundamental to machine learning (and more)\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/dl.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/\">Deep Learning</a>\n   by Ian Goodfellow</b>\n</p>\n<p>writing a book specifically on deep learning is very dangerous since things move so fast but\n   if anyone can do it, ian can... i think ian's approach to explaining neural networks\n   from the ground up is one of my favorites. i got the first edition hardback but it's free to\n   download from the website.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/pr.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-robotics\">Probabilistic Robotics</a>\n   by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard and Dieter Fox</b>\n</p>\n<p>when i first joined a robotics group i bought a stack of ML/robotics books and this\n   was by far the best. it's good intro stuff, and maybe already dated in places given\n   it's age (the 2006 edition i have) but i still got a bunch from it.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/tml.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">TinyML</a>\n   by Pete Warden & Daniel Situnayake</b>\n</p>\n<p>this was a super super fun book to tech review! neural networks on microcontrollers?!?\n   yes please!\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/ec.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Evolutionary+Computation%3A+Toward+a+New+Philosophy+of+Machine+Intelligence%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471669517\">Evolutionary Computation</a> by David Fogel</b>\n</p>\n<p>this is still by favorite book on evolutionary algorithms; i've had this for a loooong\n   time now. i still feel like evolutionary approaches are due for a big big comeback\n   any time soon....\n</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h2>in the mail...</h2>\n<p>the good thing about writing a list is you get people telling you cool ones you've missed :)\n</p>\n<p>the top three i've chosen (that are in the mail) are...\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/ciis.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/\">Causal Inference in Statistics</a> by\n   Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour & Nicholas P. Jewell</b>\n</p>\n<p>recommended by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/animesh_garg\">animesh</a> who quite rightly points out\n   the lack of causality in machine learning books in the books above.\n</p>\n<p><hr>\n   <img src=\"/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/itiala.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/au/academic/subjects/computer-science/pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning/information-theory-inference-and-learning-algorithms?format=HB&isbn=9780521642989\">Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms</a> by David MacKay</b>\n</p>\n<p>i've seen this book mentioned a number of times and was most recently recommended by\n   my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danesherbs\">dane</a> so it's time to get it.\n</p>"
