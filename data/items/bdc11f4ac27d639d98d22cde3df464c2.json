  "description": "<p>How do you get your man to say he loves you?  Tig and comedian Phoebe Robinson team up to answer that question and find themselves at odds with an old-time advice columnist who thinks women should not go looking for love.  Phoebe, who is also the host of her own Comedy Central series “Doing the Most with Phoebe Robinson” and of the podcast turned HBO special “Two Dope Queens” and Tig share a laugh over forgetting what they're talking about right in the middle of their conversation.  And they have some fun advice for a listener with a cranky grandma and another one with a parrot interfering in his owner's love life.<br><br><strong>OUR SPONSORS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Betterhelp</strong> - <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/tig\">betterhelp.com/tig</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Sakara</strong> - <a href=\"http://sakara.com/dontask\">sakara.com/dontask</a> and use code: <strong>dontask20</strong></p>\n<p>Need advice?
