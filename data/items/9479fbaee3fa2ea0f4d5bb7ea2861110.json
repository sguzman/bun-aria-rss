With the sheer amount of claims, I don’t know which one specifically got it taken down, which is why I opted not to appeal and instead took this as an opportunity to make the video better and longer than it was before. I’ve added more analysis, full coverage of Donda, and of course done my best to remove every bit of claimable music I stupidly included the first time. I know this isn’t a completely new video, but I’ve gotten numerous requests to bring this one back since the day it was deleted. It’s always been a personal favorite of mine and I wanted to do what I could to restore it. I know some ppl won’t care but for the ones that do, I hope you enjoy. Thanks for reading this mess of a tangent. \n-\nTRACKS USED (in order): https://controlc.com/dce4d88e\nOTHER RESOURCES: https://controlc.com/7a94b8e2\n-\nSTALK ME ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/jaubreyYT\nOR INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/jaubreyyt/\nGIVE ME YOUR MONEY: https://www.patreon.com/jaubrey\n-\nTIMECODES:\nintro - 0:00 \nhumble beginnings - 2:05\nthe accident - 6:38\nthe college dropout - 9:51\nthe telethon - 14:48\nlate registration - 17:38\ngraduation - 22:37\nthe loss of donda west - 27:32 \n808s and heartbreak - 30:30 \ntaylor - 38:05 \nexile - 39:26 \nour lovely sponsor - 42:49 \nmy beautiful dark twisted fantasy - 44:30 \nfashion/watch the throne - 58:38 \nyeezus - 1:02:11 \nfamily life - 1:07:57 \nthe life of pablo - 1:10:27 \nmental health - 1:17:30 \nprodigies - 1:23:44 \noaf - 1:29:11 \ndrake vs kanye - 1:34:56 \nye/kids see ghosts/yandhi - 1:38:26 \njesus is king - 1:42:29 \nkanye 2020 - 1:45:02 \ndonda - 1:46:06 \nthe rest of ye's 2021 - 1:57:57 \nconclusion - 1:59:01 \n-\nSPECIAL THANKS TO: https://bit.ly/3nK8bCu",
