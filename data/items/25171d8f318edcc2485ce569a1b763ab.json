  "description": "We start with how to draft RBs at different spots in your draft. From picks #1 (1:40), #5 (5:50), #8 (9:15) and #12 (16:00) we show you different ways to approach RB. And Ben and Heath join the show today to tell you why you should take late-round fliers on a number of RBs. But Adam suggests this strategy didn't work in 2019, so why will it work this year? ... ADP review begins with the Top 6 RBs (26:00). Does this include Derrick Henry? Does format matter? Then we get to the rest of the RBs we expect to be drafted in Rounds 1 and 2 (34:25). We're talking Aaron Jones, Miles Sanders, Joe Mixon, Nick Chubb, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and more. Next up, we talk the Round 3-4 guys (42:00) like James Conner, Melvin Gordon and Chris Carson ... Getting to the next group (48:00) with David Montgomery, Devin Singletary, Kareem Hunt and more. And then we just talk about everyone else for the rest of the show! Maybe you should consider drafting both D'Andre Swift and Kerryon Johnson, or both Darrell Henderson and Cam Akers. And find out the other players we are targeting late in drafts ...
