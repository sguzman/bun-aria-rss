  "description": "<p>As you may know by now Eric Hanson from Hammer + Sickle passed away this week. Today, The Cigar Authority will be joined by Hammer + Sickle Nation Sales Manager Erik Wentworth as we reflect on our very close friend. We’ll do this while smoking a Hammer + Sickle Hermitage in the first hour and a Moscow City that was limited to just 1,000 boxes of which Dave was personally gifted a sign box.</p>\n<p>With FDA Regulations in place and creeping ever closer we will look at a post made on Social Media by a well-known cigar maker. We will discuss this and ask the question if the bigger guys wants to bring a stop to the smaller family owned companies.</p>\n<p>We also have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
