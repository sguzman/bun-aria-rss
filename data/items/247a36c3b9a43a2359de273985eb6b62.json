That might mean playing with your grandkids on the floor, carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, or being able to be present emotionally and mentally for your spouse. Thinking of these detailed goals helps us reverse engineer our lives to achieve the quality and longevity in life we truly desire. It just takes a little thought and planning, and of course the right actions to make it happen.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Today’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy, Dr. Peter Attia, shares his own story of setting those kinds of goals, a process called backcasting, and how he overcame obesity and pre-diabetes by establishing a foundation of healthier aging. Dr. Attia is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. His approach focuses on increasing lifespan by delaying the onset of chronic disease, while simultaneously improving “healthspan,” or quality of life. To do this, his practice applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, techniques to increase distress tolerance, lipidology, pharmacology, and endocrinology.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
