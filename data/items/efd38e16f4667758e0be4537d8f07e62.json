  "description": "See the full interview at http://usefulidiots.substack.com\n\n“By the time Biden won the presidency, I was struggling to square what I was learning about the family's business dealings with the folksy image I had of him and his family. I just wanted to tell the story in full.”\nAuthor Ben Schreckinger dug up the history of a family dynasty and put it into his book The Bidens, which explores the Biden family, Joe’s childhood, weird Delaware loyalty politics, the shady business dealings of Joe’s brother Jim, his son Hunter and, of course, the 2020 laptop story.\nBut what makes this book truly interesting? This tell-all book is inconvenient to both sides of the aisle because it’s just as critical of Trump, the Republicans, and even some Fox members (looking at you, Tucker).\nSchreckinger is an equal-opportunity offender, and that’s part of what makes The Bidens such a great book.\nAs Matt Taibbi puts it: “This is reporting. This is what it looks like. I kinda forgot what it felt like. It’s a great book. And incriminating.”\nWatch for yourself. Can you get a handle on what’s actually going on in the family?\nPlus, drunk Kamala in space, Laura Ingraham’s kryptonite, and we take the Washington Post conspiracy quiz.\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
