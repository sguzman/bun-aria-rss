  "description": "Attorney General Merrick Garland has made it clear he intends to hold the former president responsible for any crimes related to the insurrection, and recent polling shows a majority of Democrat voters are hoping the current president won’t run again in 2024. Next, Stephen finds it hard to believe that St. Vincent has never been invited to play the National Anthem for her hometown team, the Dallas Cowboys, so he sends this open letter to the team to encourage them to right this wrong. And please keep an eye out for Amanda Seyfried’s missing tortoise, who escaped from his theme-park-like enclosure at her upstate New York farm recently. Stick around for more with the star of “The Dropout,” which is streaming now on Hulu.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
