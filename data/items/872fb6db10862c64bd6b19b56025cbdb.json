  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about a leaked report describing eleventh-hour Russian influence operations during last year's US elections. An alleged leaker is already charged and in custody. The UK's investigation into last weekend's terror attacks continues, online as well as in physical space. Apple hints it's helping out. The attackers seem to have been known to authorities. In its continuing campaign of online inspiration, ISIS claims responsibility for the destruction of a church in the Philippines and a lethal standoff in Australia. Violent anarchist groups seem to be following the ISIS playbook in cyberspace. Some thoughts on wolves.  Rick Howard from Palo Alto Networks on government cloud deployment. Andrea Little Limbago from Endgame has results from a survey on Americans’ perceptions of the US government’s cybersecurity capabilities. And the DarkOverlord is back.",
