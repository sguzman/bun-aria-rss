From corporate lawyer to ambassador of sweat and swagger, Robin brings the heat with unique personal style and an unwavering confidence that is matched only by her unlimited vivaciousness. In the event you missed it, I highly recommend going back and listening to our first conversation, <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-99-robin-arzon-how-to-undo-ordinary/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #99.</a>&nbsp;You also might want to go back and read (or re-read) the <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-99-robin-arzon-how-to-undo-ordinary/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> I wrote for that one, because it's kind of awesome.</p><p>Longtime listeners know Robin is all about story. The power of story. How to properly own your story. How to properly tell your story. The capacity for story to catalyze positive change in others. And the capability we all inherently have to let go of whatever negative story we tell ourselves about ourselves — and instead form an entirely new one.</p><p>To recap, only three years ago Robin was living a completely different life — toiling away as a corporate lawyer at one of the world’s most prestigious law firms.&nbsp;But a near-death experience being held hostage at gunpoint several years prior gave her the courage to not only begin a new chapter of her life, but to — you guessed it — tell an entirely new story about herself.</p><p>Robin jumped out on her secure career without a parachute, soared on faith arms spread wide and glided down to a graceful landing on the downtown streets of lower Manhattan like a glorious bird of prey clad in blinding color and a pair of chartreuse running shoes.</p><p>How do you describe someone who defies definition itself? Robin is so many things I struggle to find words to capture a spirit that can only be properly understood by experiencing her first hand. Nonetheless, I'll give it a shot. Today Robin is&nbsp;a NYC-based urban, bridge-running force of nature; an accomplished ultramarathoner (she once ran 5 marathons in 5 days across Utah); a running coach; a cycling instructor; and a consultant to some of the biggest brands in the world, like&nbsp;Nike,&nbsp;Adidas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Puma. Not enough?&nbsp;She's also a lifestyle entrepreneur as well the co-founder&nbsp;and publisher of a relatively new magazine called <a href=\"http://www.undoordinary.com/\" target=\"_blank\">UNDO</a>. Where sweat meets culture, it's a gorgeous, high quality production that can be found worldwide in places like Urban Outfitters.</p><p>But Robin is not immune from obstacles. About a year ago, she faced a unforeseen new challenge: Type 1 Diabetes. Not one to let her illness limit, let alone define her, Robin navigates this setback with the poised demeanor she meets everything — simply another opportunity to empower and inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and, in Robin's words:</p><p>do epic shit.</p><p>As a father of two little girls, I am inspired by her&nbsp;shining example of positive female empowerment. It gives me hope.
