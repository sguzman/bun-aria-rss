  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the IRS has distributed 90 million stimulus checks to 158 million households totaling over $240 Billion. This was completely unnecessary and the democrats have another vote-buying scheme lined up to distribute even more wealth. These tyrannical fascistic Democrats are at war with the American way of life. Then, President Biden breaks his silence in an interview with George Stephanopoulos, of all people, and contradicts his 2019 statements that the border-crossers need to surge the border so they can be heard. Now in the friendliest interview ever, Biden tells Stephanopolous that he never told any migrants to come to the border. Later, Julie Kelly from American Greatness calls in to discuss how bail is being denied for some of those arrested for involvement in the January 6th riots. Kelly reports that the charges are an overreach as they're charging people felonies instead of misdemeanors. The prosecution even went as far as outrageously saying that because the defendants didn't accept the outcome of the election, they are flight risks and will not accept the laws of the US as a result either. Afterward, US Senator Ron Johnson joins the show and explains how the left is attacking him with out-of-context smears. Johnson added that the left is trying to paint all of the voters that supported President Trump as armed insurrectionists and he refused to allow these lies to go unanswered.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
