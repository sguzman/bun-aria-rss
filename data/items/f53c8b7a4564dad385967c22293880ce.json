  "description": "<p><em><strong>Insulted - Part One: Bastard</strong></em>. Tim has been asking for a while about the human side of Jesus. While we celebrate and teach heavily on the deistic part of Jesus, being one with God, we know very little about the human part of Jesus. Mike and Tim begin a series today looking at part of that, through the insults and degradations hurled at Jesus in the gospels, and what they meant at that time. What do they show us? How was Jesus's lineage in question? What did His birth say about him, culturally? What was in question? Why did Jesus's birth play out the way it did? What are the cultural implications?</p>\n<p>First, Mike and Tim read a couple of emails responding to the topic of being cruciform as Nurse Practitioners, etc. and prescription addiction, from two listeners who work in similar situations. And another that offers a different perspective to the Jordan Peterson/masculinity conversation, from a listener who has been made to feel unwelcome in church communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
