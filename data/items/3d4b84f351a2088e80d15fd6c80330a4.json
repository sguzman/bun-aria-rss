One of the most prominent, that is still being supported by our government policies today, is that we need three servings of dairy a day to get enough calcium and achieve optimal wellness.

Cow’s milk is not nature’s perfect food for human adults, despite what the lobbying efforts of the dairy industry say. On this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy,</em> I was excited to sit down with Dr. David Ludwig, whose research I’ve followed for the past 20 years and has helped shape the way I practice medicine.&nbsp;</p><br><p>David S. Ludwig, MD, PhD is an endocrinologist and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Dr. Ludwig is co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center and founder of the Optimal Weight for Life program, one of the country’s oldest and largest clinics for the care of overweight children. For more than 25 years, Dr. Ludwig has studied the effects of dietary composition on metabolism, body weight, and risk for chronic disease. Described as an “obesity warrior” by <em>Time Magazine</em>, Dr. Ludwig has fought for fundamental policy changes to improve the food environment. He has been a Principal Investigator on numerous grants from the National Institutes of Health and philanthropic organizations and has published over 200 scientific articles.
