  "description": "<p>Jenn Cole lost her friend about a week before we recorded this. I really wanted to get into the feeling of grief that comes with loss but I'm so intrigued by suicide that I just ended up wanted to know all the details leading up to her friend, Chris, taking his own life. This is a serious subject but I treat it with the same lighthearted inquisitiveness that I treat any other subject. I hate getting caught up feeling the same emotions as the subject. So, while I have a general respect for suicide, I don't let the idea of it make me sad. So with that in mind, please enjoy this really interesting conversation with someone who just lost a friend.</p>",
