    "media:description": "What is a matrix? What are matrices used for? Why are they important? What are their applications? What do they represent? \n\nThis lecture introduces matrices as representing linear transformations of vectors. We define linear transformations, learn how to visualize them and how to describe them analytically, and then learn how they can be equivalent to a matrix multiplication. We give the general recipe and tricks to remember matrix-vector multiplication.\n\nKing's College London - Physics Programme -\nYear 1 Maths Video Lecture\n\nCONTENTS:\n- Why are matrices important?
