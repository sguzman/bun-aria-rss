  "description": "<p>Torsion in the concordance group $\\mathscr{C}$ of knots in $S^3$ can be\nstudied with the algebraic concordance group $\\mathscr{G}^{\\mathbb{F}}$. Here\n$\\mathbb{F}$ is a field of characteristic $\\chi(\\mathbb{F}) \\ne 2$. The group\n$\\mathscr{G}^{\\mathbb{F}}$ was defined by J. Levine, who also obtained an\nalgebraic classification when $\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{Q}$. While the concordance\ngroup $\\mathscr{C}$ is abelian, it embeds into the non-abelian virtual knot\nconcordance group $\\mathscr{VC}$. It is unknown if $\\mathscr{VC}$ admits\nnon-classical finite torsion. Here we define the virtual algebraic concordance\ngroup $\\mathscr{VG}^{\\mathbb{F}}$ for almost classical knots . This is an\nanalogue of $\\mathscr{G}^{\\mathbb{F}}$ for homologically trivial knots in\nthickened surfaces $\\Sigma \\times [0,1]$, where $\\Sigma$ is closed and\noriented. The main result is an algebraic classification of\n$\\mathscr{VG}^{\\mathbb{F}}$. A consequence of the classification is that\n$\\mathscr{G}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ embeds into $\\mathscr{VG}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ and\n$\\mathscr{VG}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ contains many nontrivial finite-order elements that\nare not algebraically concordant to any classical Seifert matrix. For\n$\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, we give a generalization of the Arf\ninvariant.\n</p>",
