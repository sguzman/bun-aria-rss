He went on to play at Boston College and Fresno State, two seasons in the NBA (including one with his hometown team, the Boston Celtics) and seven seasons overseas before losing it all to the disease of addiction. With the unwavering support of his family and friends, Chris has been sober since August 1, 2008, and he now shares his story with the goal of making a positive difference in the lives of others. His recovery journey has been documented in the Emmy-nominated ESPN Films documentary, \"Unguarded”. Through Herren Talks, Chris has spoken to over 1 million students and community members, sparking honest discussions about substance use disorder and wellness. In 2011, Chris grew his vision of support for others when he founded the nonprofit Herren Project. Through the organization, Chris and his team empower schools and communities to make healthy choices, while also guiding families through recovery. In 2018, Chris also founded Herren Wellness, a residential health and wellness program that helps guests lead healthy, substance-free lives.</p><p> </p><p>Kate Kennedy from Be There in Five podcast helps Kate review Taylor Swift: Miss Americana on Netflix.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reality Life with Kate Casey</p><p>Patreon: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.patreon.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Cameo: <a href=\"https://www.cameo.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cameo.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Twitter: @katecasey</p><p>Instagram: @katecaseyca</p><p>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/</a></p><p>Facebook.com/loveandknuckles</p><p>Amazon List: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca</a></p> \n <br><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
