  "description": "<p>In this hour of The Herd with Colin Cowherd, Colin finally gets a chance to react to the Super Bowl. After some reflection, it's clear to Colin that even though Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady is sometimes mistake-prone, he has inspired and elevated this Buccaneers team to a level of Super Bowl contender. Also, Colin is seeing the \"Brady Effect\" take hold in Seattle--Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson wants some say in who the team brings in. Plus, Colin explains the \"Crowded Bar Theory\" as it applies to the Green Bay Packers and outgoing Texan defensive end J.J. Watt. Finally, Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated's MMQB joins the show to discuss some possible player moves in the NFL. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
