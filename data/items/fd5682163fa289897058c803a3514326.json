  "description": "<div>This week, the gals break down what's behind a psychotic break. Topics include a synthetic-pot-head, a pathetic virgin with a god complex, and a dangerous big brother (with great eyebrows). This week's episode is paired with the budget-friendly Twisted Old Vine Zinfandel, so break a ten to buy a bottle, and wash it all down with some antipsychotic meds!<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
