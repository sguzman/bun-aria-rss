On this episode, we're going straight to the source again to unpack the economic devastation of the Tulsa Race Massacre with Tracy Manning-Gibbs, descendant of a survivor. We'll dig deep into the lingering trauma and financial consequences of white tyranny – and chart a path forward to rebuilding our communities.
