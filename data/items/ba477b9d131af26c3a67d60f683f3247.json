  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP uses a wheelchair and needs to take the bus. There's only 1 spot on the entire boss where can lock his wheelchair in, and of course a Karen is sitting there. He politely asks to use that spot, but the Karen freaks out and says that she and her precious baby need the seat. Eventually, the bus driver even has to get involved and starts screaming at the Karen to move, but she just won't listen!</p>\n<p>🔔 Subscribe: https://bit.ly/2E3A8i6</p>\n<p>💬 Discord: https://discord.gg/VD6eYD3</p>\n<p>🎧 Podcast: https://link.chtbl.com/rslash</p>\n<p>⚓ Send me a voice message: https://anchor.fm/rslash</p>\n<p>📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rslashyt/</p>\n<p>♪ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@rslash0</p>\n<p>🛒 Merch: http://bit.ly/rSlashMerch</p>\n<p>🎁 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rslash</p>\n",
