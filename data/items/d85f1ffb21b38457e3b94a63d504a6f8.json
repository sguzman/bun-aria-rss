  "description": "I love antique quilts and reading about the people who made them. It’s a joy to open Lynn Miller’s website Vintage and Antique to read the stories she has written about quilt makers from the past. Lynn often writes a series of articles so it’s very fun to dive deep into the background behind either the maker or sometimes the collectors.\n==========\nI’ve been lucky to get to know Lori Kennedy of The Inbox Jaunt (she was our July 18 Splendid Sampler Designer) and today we are going to dive deep into tips & tricks she has for machine quilting. Her new book is fabulous, you must get it! Also we are going to talk about learning to quilt as all five (yes 5!) of Lori’s adjust daughters are learning right now.\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
