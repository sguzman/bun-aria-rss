  "description": "<p>“Rise above your past!” ⁣ ⁣ If you’ve ever wondered who inspired me to become the man I am today, look no further than today’s guest! It Is truly an honor to have Les Brown joining me on The Ed Mylett Show! ⁣ ⁣ He is BY FAR the greatest motivational speaker I’ve ever seen. He’s an author, former radio DJ, television Jost and former member of the House of Representatives. I have literally listened to HUNDREDS of hours of Les Brown’s content and he has 100% changed my entire life starting from when I started listening to him when I had just got out of college. ⁣ ⁣ This interview is so powerful and so moving I KNOW it will change your life forever! ⁣ ⁣ How does a man labeled mentally retarded at a young age, who was only allowed to drink from segregated water fountains and ride in the back of the bus go on to literally change the world? By BELIEVING that someone else’s opinion about you does NOT have to become your reality! (Although he didn’t start out believing that) ⁣ ⁣ In this interview, we dive deep into how to win this battle we call life and how to keep yourself motivated to stay in the fight. We talk about the keys to THRIVING during these difficult times and how to unleash your story of greatness that already lives within you to become the ultimate version of yourself.⁣ ⁣ We get tactical about the superpowers of communication and how you can use the very circumstances that you think disqualify you from winning to achieve unimaginable business and personal success.⁣ ⁣ Les even shares a never before heard tear-jerking testament to the power of love and forgiveness. ⁣ ⁣ If you want to “live a life that will outlive YOU” this interview is for you! ⁣</p>\n",
