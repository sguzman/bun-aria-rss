  "description": "<p><strong>Ashley Hamilton</strong> is a landlord, multi-unit investor, reverse flipper, hard money lender, and everything else in between. You may recognize her name from <strong>episode 331, appropriately titled “</strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-331-10-deals-20k-year-waitress-salary-ashley-hamilton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>10 Real Estate Deals on a $20K Waitress Salary</strong></a><strong>,”</strong> which became one of the most popular <em>BiggerPockets Real Estate Podcast</em> episodes. If you haven’t heard of Ashley, here’s a quick rundown: As a<strong> teen mom</strong>, Ashley was working hard daily to provide for her kids. With only a<strong> $20K/year salary</strong>, she began <strong>buying rental properties, often in cash</strong>, in the Detroit area. The last time we chatted, Ashley had ten units.

Since then, she’s <strong>rapidly expanded her rental property empire</strong>, growing her portfolio by many multiples and expanding into other businesses like consulting and hard money lending. She’s even developed her own version of the BRRRR strategy called <strong>“reverse flipping</strong>,” which <strong>makes high interest rates a non-issue</strong> when trying to refinance out of your property.</p><p>She gives some killer tips on <strong>keeping </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/tenant-turnover-solution\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>tenant turnover</strong></a> low, why paying taxes isn’t such a bad thing, and how <strong>betting on cities like Detroit</strong> can make you much wealthier. One surprising thing about Ashley is that she built the foundation of her portfolio on cash deals while making a below-poverty salary. <strong>So if you think money is the one thing stopping you from
