  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Part 8. Matthew 5:38-42. An eye for an eye. This one is fun. Jesus continues to flip the script on what we know and have held to be true. There is a lot, a lot here, so give yourself some time. Jesus is purposefully upending many common held practices in regards to revenge and reciprocity, resistance and passivity. What was Jesus saying when he tells them to turn the other cheek? To offer their cloak? To walk an extra mile? What does this say about the Kingdom that He is establishing? How is it at odds with the common practices of the time, and well as today?? Where does this fall in line with what He has said prior in this sermon about anger, coveting, divorce, etc.? This kingdom is a table with many seats and each sits as high as the next. \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
