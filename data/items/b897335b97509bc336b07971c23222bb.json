  "description": "<p>This week, we explore a new frontier of violence, delusion, and all around crazy. A man who was deemed too crazy even for Russian prison. He made a name for himself with his MMA antics, then made an even bigger splash with his robberies, violence, and racism. He has a lot of opinions, only some of which are relevant to the planet earth. From mental institution escapes, to brazen criminal behavior, to the most abhorrent political activism imaginable... All topped off with some of the most insane quotes ever to come out of a CIS subject's mouth. He's psychotic, he's scary, and he's hilarious to make fun of! Start a gang of robbers, escape from the institution, and start a crazy political movement with Viacheslav \"The Red Tarzan\" Datsik!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
