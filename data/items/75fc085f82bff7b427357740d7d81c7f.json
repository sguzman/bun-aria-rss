Also, after discussing a scene that happened on “Insecure”, we opened the phone lines to see if any of our listeners would ever sleep with someone they are not attracted to. Moreover, Charlamagne gave “Donkey of the Day” to a man that killed his mom because she wouldn’t let him have a puppy. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
