  "description": "The Dak Prescott reports and rumors continue to run rampant this offseason and of course, the Pick Six Superfriends had to address the latest offer out there, a reported 5-year, $175m deal (7:10). What do those numbers actually mean and how could they be affected by a potential loss of revenue and drop in the salary cap? Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough are on the case. Then, on the heels of breaking down Pete Prisco's Top 100 NFL Players list, the guys examine Sean's annual list of the Top 25 Players Under 25 (34:15). Who was snubbed? Too high? Too low? Just right? The guys offer their analysis of the full list.\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Bullhorn and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @JohnBreech, @seanjwagner\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
