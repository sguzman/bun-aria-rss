While it's clear that sparks are flying once more between Bingley and Jane, it's less clear what Darcy is doing there. Why show up if he's not even going to try to talk to Lizzy? She's working herself up trying to figure out what is going on - she needs to pause to rest and regroup her thoughts. Let her story help you take your own pause and take you on a journey into restful and restorative sleep.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Jane Austen Bedtime Stories podcast! Each episode is a section of a classic Jane Austen novel, read in soothing tones and set to calming music to help you fall asleep.</p>\n<p>With everything that is going on in the world, we find comfort in the familiar. For so many of us, Jane Austen's works are like a warm hug. So snuggle up under the covers and let the comforting words of Jane Austen lull you into sleep.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Music [\"Reverie\"] by Scott Buckley – www.scottbuckley.com.au</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support</a>",
