  "description": "One of the best things about my job is getting in early on the biggest trends. I recap some of the biggest bull markets we’ve seen over recent years, from commodities… to crypto… to the Internet of Things (IoT)... and much more. [0:30] Smart investors were able to make life-changing gains off of all of these trends… But there’s one I believe will be bigger than any we’ve ever seen before: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ordinances to fight climate change. [7:19] I lay out some data on why ESG is set to create one of the biggest investing opportunities we’ve ever seen in the history of the markets… including how the government is forcing upside. [11:48] And I share several companies set to profit from this trend, ranging from solar companies to automakers… including where I just personally invested $100k. [15:30] Speaking of energy, as the price of uranium moves higher, a subscriber asks if she’s missed the window of opportunity. In short, no… and I explain why you want to scale into these positions over time. [23:40] Interested in being a newsletter analyst? I explain why you need to find your own style… and my plan on starting an investing clinic over the next few months. [27:43]   Enjoyed this episode?
