  "description": "International theorists like to game out every possible scenario. What would happen if you applied their methodology to dealing with the fictional public policy challenge of a zombie infestation?\n\nIn Dan Drezner’s Theories of International Politics and Zombies (Princeton UP, 2011), he looks at each of the major international relations schools–realism, liberalism, neoconservatism, etc.–to determine how they would react to a zombie attack. In the book, Drezner combines a strong understanding of international-relations theory with a comprehensive knowledge of the zombies. He also uses charts, cartoons, and humor to make his points. In the podcast, I ask Drezner to apply his approach to the question of how President Obama would cope with a zombie attack. We discuss all of these things, and have our share of laughs, along the way. Read all about it, and more, in Drezner’s humorous new book.\n\nPlease become a fan of “New Books in Public Policy” on Facebook if you haven’t already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
