    "media:description": "All the engineering behind the Endeavour Shuttle's 26th and final mission.\nðŸª’ Use code PracticalEngineering to get a precision razor from Henson and 100 blades free: https://bit.ly/3CWiWJP\n\nEndeavourâ€™s 26th mission was a lot slower and a lot shorter than the previous 25, but it was still full of fascinating engineering challenges. This October marks the 10-year anniversary of the nearly 3-day trip, so letâ€™s reminisce on this incredible feat and dive into what it took to get the orbiter safely to its final home.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
