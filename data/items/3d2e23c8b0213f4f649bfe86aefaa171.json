The pair soon discovered a flaw. Although the mechanical shuffling action appeared random, the mathematicians noticed that the resulting deck still had rising and falling sequences, which meant that they could make predictions about the card order. </p></blockquote>\n<p><i>New Scientist</i> <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523525-500-coming-up-trumps/\">article</a> behind a paywall.
