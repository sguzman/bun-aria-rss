  "description": "Church planting, even under the best of circumstances, always requires grit and determination. Planting in one of the most progressive cities in the US at the turn of the millennium required even more. But if Mark Driscoll struggled with anything in his ministry, it wasn’t a lack of will. \n\nThe earliest days of Mars Hill were a whirlwind of activity – launching new campuses, preaching as many as seven times a Sunday, assimilating new people, and developing new ministries all at once. The church quickly proved to be a magnet for spiritual seekers of all kinds – eager Christians looking to build, apathetic Christians needing renewal, and non-Christians hearing the gospel in a new context. \nOn this episode of The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill, we take you inside that hive of activity to examine up close the ways God was at work. You’ll see Mark Driscoll not only as a preacher and a movement leader, but as a caring pastor. \nYou’ll also see signs of volatility in Mark’s ministry. Tensions in the Young Leaders Network start to build and a pivot in Mark’s own convictions pushes them to their limits. Meanwhile, inside Mars Hill, a throwaway remark at a friendly dinner becomes the catalyst for intense, life-altering conflict.\n\n“The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill” is a production of Christianity Today\nExecutive Producer: Erik Petrik\nProducer, Writer, Editor, and Host: Mike Cosper\nAssociate Producer: Joy Beth Smith\nMusic, Sound Design, and Mix Engineer: Kate Siefker\nGraphic Design: Bryan Todd\nSocial Media: Nicole Shanks\nEditorial Consultant: Andrea Palpant Dilley\nEditor in Chief: Timothy Dalrymple\nTheme song: “Sticks and Stones” by Kings Kaleidoscope\nClosing song: “Did I Tell You the Bullet’s Still There” by Bill Mallonee\nLearn more about your ad choices.
