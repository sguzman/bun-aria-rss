  "description": "As far as meditation teachers go, they don't come more highly regarded than our guest this week, Jack Kornfield. Kornfield trained as a Buddhist monk in the monasteries of Thailand, India and Burma. He has taught meditation internationally since 1974 and is one of the key teachers to introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to the West.  You might think this meditation master is unflappable, but you would be mistaken. Kornfield discusses how he, one of the preeminent teachers in the field, still encounters difficult times, including how his marriage ended in divorce.  He also delves into the role psychedelics play in the mindfulness movement.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: https://jackkornfield.com/\nBooks: https://jackkornfield.com/books-audio-programs/\nPodcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heart-wisdom-with-jack-kornfield/id923017416\nTwitter: @JackKornfield\nFacebook: @jkornfield, https://www.facebook.com/jkornfield/\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
