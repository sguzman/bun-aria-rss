  "description": "<p>Are you perfectly confident about yourself and your art? Do you sail through life with no self-criticism? In most cases, the answer to this question is a resounding no. As artists we are all alone - making things that just seemed like a good idea, even though no-one asked us to. There is no roadmap and there are no instructions. So it's natural to be filled with self-doubt. Am I doing this right? Is anyone going to like this? Is this even art? This week, Louise is musing about the importance of self-acceptance. This is more than making ourselves feel good - without self-acceptance, we can't make the work that lives inside us - the unique, compelling, personal work of which we are capable. And if we don't trust ourselves, how can we expect buyers to have faith in us?</p>\n<p>Find Alice and Louise at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
