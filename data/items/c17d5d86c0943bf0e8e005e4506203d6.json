  "description": "Wait...there existed a time before an emoji existed to convey every thought and emotion our brains could formulate? Who are we without :) and :(? On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia takes us back to a 1982 college message board to explore the roots of our favorite keyboard accessories. I mean c’mon, where else would the emoji be born if not amongst college students? For those of us missing live music, we’ll also be transported back to Central Park 1981 for the highest attended concert of its time (Hint: This iconic duo had no need for emojis in giving us all the feels on “Bridge Over Troubled Water”).
