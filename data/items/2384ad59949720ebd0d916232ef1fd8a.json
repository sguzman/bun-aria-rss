  "description": "<p>It's that time again my friends. We've reached the end of another season. As I reflected on the different methods of food preservation we've covered over the past several weeks, I came to a surprising realization. There was one common thread between every preservation method. Can you guess what it is? Yes, that's right! Salt is the one constant for all your preservation needs. In today's episode, I cover the different types of salts, why salt can turn your food colors, and how the coarseness of the salt effects overall taste. I also share my favorite salt I literally use on everything. As this season comes to a close, this is a great time to talk about this wonderful ingredient that ties everything together.</p><p>- Since salt is obviously one thing I can’t grow here on my Wyoming homestead, I always buy Redmonds in bulk. It never goes bad and I keep it in a bucket in my basement pantry. I have this bag (<a href='https://shop.redmond.life/products/real-salt-bulk-25-lb?_pos=3&_sid=68645354b&_ss=r'>https://shop.redmond.life/products/real-salt-bulk-25-lb?_pos=3&_sid=68645354b&_ss=r</a>) in there right now.

I have learned over the years that not all salt is created equal and having the good stuff really does make a difference in your culinary adventures. Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too. Since I can’t grow salt myself (obviously) Right now, Redmond's is offering 15% off your entire order just for my podcast listeners.
