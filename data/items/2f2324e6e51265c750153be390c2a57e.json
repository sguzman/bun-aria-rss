In this US alone, upwards of 40% of food is wasted. Sadly, because of quality standards that emphasize appearance, spoilage, transportation, and other challenges, the majority of that is nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables that should form the bulk of our diet, and that many people have little access to in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>And the issue of food waste is farther-reaching than you might think. It’s an incredible waste of resources—the water, land, energy, labor, and capital needed to grow it are all wasted, too, when food is thrown away. Plus, food waste is a major contributor to climate change in several ways. But there are also many things we can do to turn around the issue of food waste and the way it impacts our climate and food security.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman discussed some of the solutions with Walter Robb, former CEO of Whole Foods Market. Walter has a long and varied entrepreneurial history ranging from natural food retailer to farmer to consultant. He is a mentor and advisor to the next generation of American food companies and he is dedicated to transforming our food system.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman further discussed issues and solutions related to food waste when he sat down with his business partner, and host of the Broken Brain podcast, Dhru Purohit.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Find My Formula, the world’s first personalized nootropics company.
