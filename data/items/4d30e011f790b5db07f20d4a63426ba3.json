  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, America has become a collection of police states where the Bill of Rights is effectively nullified and citizens can get arrested or fined for engaging in activities that have no plausible chance of spreading the virus. Is all of this worth it for the possible reward of safety? Also today we cancel AOC for claiming that the virus is targeting minority populations because of racism. And I read emails from people who’ve had run-ins with law enforcement because of the stay-at-home orders.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
