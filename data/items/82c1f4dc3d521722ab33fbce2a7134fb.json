  "description": "Their courtship will go down in history with those of Romeo & Juliet, Tristan & Isolde, and Goldman and Sachs.  Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have had their spats to be sure...but what's a little pre-nuclear foreplay between true loves.  Now, all that is behind them it seems and we are heading for the steamy consummation of their relationship somewhere in Singapore...possibly, fittingly, in a a Sheldon Adelson-owned hotel room.  If only Shakespeare were alive today to offer up a sonnet, something to honor both of them.  Maybe something like Sonnet 29.  You know the one: \"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes...\"  But don't despair.  Who needs Shakespeare when you have Ed Luce, Rosa Brooks and Anna Fifield of the Washington Post.
