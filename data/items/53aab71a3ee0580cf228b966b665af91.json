  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left has its expected psychotic breakdown in response to Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s death. They’re claiming that it would be an assault on the rule of law and democracy for Republicans to confirm a replacement before the election. That’s absurd and laughable. I’ll explain why. Also Five Headlines, including the tragic suicide of a bar owner who was facing prison for defending himself against a rioter who attacked him. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel all airlines and airports after having to endure their completely arbitrary COVID regulations last week.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
