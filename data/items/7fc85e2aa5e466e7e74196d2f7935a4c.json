  "description": "This week, Glenn sits down with Senator Mike Lee of Utah who has spent his career defending the basic liberties of Americans and Utahns as a tireless advocate for our founding constitutional principles. Senator Lee acquired a deep respect for the Constitution early on. His father, Rex Lee, who served as the Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan, would often discuss varied aspects of judicial and constitutional doctrine around the kitchen table, from Due Process to the uses of Executive Plenary Power. He attended most of his father's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, giving him a unique, hands-on experience and understanding of government up close. He serves on Judiciary, Commerce, and Energy Committees and is currently the Chair of the Joint Economic Committee. He is consistently one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate and also one of the nicest and most well-liked on both sides. He is also a New York Times Best-Selling author of 3 books including his latest, \"Our Lost Declaration: America's Fight Against Tyranny from King George to the Deep State.\" They talk about everything from Thomas Jefferson and the Constitution all the way to John Roberts on the Supreme Court. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
