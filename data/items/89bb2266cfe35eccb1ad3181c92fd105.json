    "media:description": "Most difficult archery record ever made!\nThe purpose of my officially controlled record attempt, was to try make a record that could be compared to the heroic shots of historical super archers?\n\nThe record attempt was filmed with four cameras from different sides and the keyhole from the side in slow motion so you can see the arrow going into the keyhole (there is a small clip at the end of the video) but it looks coolest from the front Camera!!\n\nEveryone can try it themselves, it just takes a keyhole so it's easy to try.\n\nBow: Şimşek Sipahi\nArrows: Carbon arrows without feathers (otherwise they won't go all the way through the keyhole)\n\nI have been training for a long time to shoot through keyholes\nso much so that up to the record attempt I dreamed of keyholes.\n\nI just watched Dude Perfect’s Archery World record and it got me super excited!\nI love it when archery gets attention and new world record really helps with that!\nSo big shoutout to Dude Perfect and James Jean and congratulations on the world record.\n\nLars Andersen",
