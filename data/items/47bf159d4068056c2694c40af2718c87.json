Dan talks with three “chefs.” Two are real, and one is a faker with a made-up resume. Dan gets five questions per chef to determine who’s legit, and who doesn’t know their bass from their elbow. The best part: You can play along! Can you spot the fake chef?</p><p>The Sporkful production team includes Dan Pashman, Emma Morgenstern, Andres O'Hara, Tracey Samuelson, and Jared O'Connell.</p><p>Transcript available at <a href=\"https://sporkful.com/2-chefs-and-a-lie-canadian-prime-minister-edition\">www.sporkful.com</a>.</p>\n",
