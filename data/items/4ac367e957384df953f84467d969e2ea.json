My advice is to arrange things as best as you can and hang up some artwork even though they aren’t quite right; just enough to make it feel like home. My house is a mess right now, so I’m trying to live each day one at a time. I’m bringing in simple things like branches, flowers, candles, and good music and meals. Focus on experiences and bringing the outside! It’s so hard and we get it! It’s definitely a mental exercise in patience when you can’t quite make the space the way you want it, but find the joy where you can.\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nLauren Liess on Instagram\n\nPure Style Home\n\nLauren Liess & Co\n\nBest House on the Block\n\nHabitat: The Field Guide to Decorating\n\nDown to Earth: Laid-back Interiors for Modern Living\n\nFeels Like Home",
