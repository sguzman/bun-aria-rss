  "description": "Today we are going to give you a refresher on what we are loving for countertops right now and kind of break down all of the different types and price points for various usages. We discuss various different materials you can use for your countertops, including quartzite, which can go really well on bathroom surfaces, and then marble can look great, especially over time as it becomes more worn, as long as you take care of it, it will look great. Soapstone, wood, and concrete have their own looks that are useful depending on what your style is, and then we discuss going to the slab yard and how you can pick out your preferred features. <br /><br />Countertops, quartzite 2:18<br />Marble 5:50<br />Grove 10:27<br />Soapstone 11:32<br />Wood 14:21<br />Jess’s parents’ bathroom 20:13<br />Concrete 25:55<br /><br />“Give yourself some flexibility. Just have an emotional reaction to whatever is speaking to you. Just understanding some of these, I think usability. I think it’s important and hopefully whoever is selling these to you will also kind of lead you in the right direction as well.” 22:16<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
