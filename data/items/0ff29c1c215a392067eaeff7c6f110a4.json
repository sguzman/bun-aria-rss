Wilson writes that Queen Elizabeth was a constant in a country that has changed so much, and he is joined on the Edition podcast by Graham Viney author of <em>Last Hurrah: The 1947 Tour of Southern Africa and the End of Empire</em> (00:59). <br>\n<br>\nAlso this week: <br>\n<br>\nMichael Hall takes us inside the Royal Collection and discusses the Queen’s relationship with art.
