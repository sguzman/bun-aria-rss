  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, race hustlers Colin Kaepernick and Ibram X Kendi both thoroughly embarrassed themselves over the weekend, exposing the emptiness and absurdity of their worldviews.

And a Southwest Airlines pilot allegedly says \"Let's go Brandon!\" over the intercom on the plane, and this is apparently a crisis. Plus, rumors are swirling about Joe Biden's meeting with the pope. I feel duty-bound to discuss those rumors today. \nRead the Daily Wire’s bombshell Loudoun County exposé here: https://www.dailywire.com/news/loudoun-county-schools-tried-to-conceal-sexual-assault-against-daughter-in-bathroom-father-says | Support the Daily Wire’s investigative journalism for only $4/month — use discount code REALNEWS for 25% off your membership: https://utm.io/udQ0u\nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
