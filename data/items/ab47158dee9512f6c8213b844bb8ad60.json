  "description": "<p>The only way you can save MORE money is by either earning more, or by spending less- and spending less (aka frugality), is a much smarter decision! Don’t be tempted to just work harder and earn more money, because as soon as you stop working, your income stops! Frugality is the better answer. It isn’t restricting, keeping you from spending money on the things you love to do. Instead it’s freeing, and it is all about consciously deciding to not spend money on the things you don’t love, in order to give you the ability to spend money on the things you do love to do, whether now or off in the future!</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we popped open a Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek, which Joel picked up during his recent trip to Europe.
