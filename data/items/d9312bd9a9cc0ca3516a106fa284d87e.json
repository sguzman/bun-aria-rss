  "description": "In addition to flying, landing, and returning from the moon in 1969 — NASA's Apollo 11 crew helped with a series of scientific experiments. One of them was to leave a special instrument with lots of little reflectors on the surface of the moon. The goal of that experiment was to beam a laser at the moon. Today on the show, Scientist-In-Residence Regina G. Barber talks to host Aaron Scott about the lunar laser ranging experiment — and how shooting that laser helped us better understand one of Einstein's theories. <br/><br/>Follow Aaron on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronscottNPR?s=20&t=LZC5iZ-kLp3mGuhgDIdYbA\">@AaronScottNPR</a> and Regina <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScienceRegina?s=20&t=LZC5iZ-kLp3mGuhgDIdYbA\">@ScienceRegina</a>.
