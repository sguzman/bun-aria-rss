  "description": "For our next season of [Un]Common Law, we’re wading into the thorny debate over Big Tech and social media. Companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter are much bigger than they were 20 years ago, but is this a problem?\nIs Big Tech impinging on your right to free speech? That depends on who you ask. And what about the increased influence of hate-speech, conspiracy theories and disinformation that spread like wildfire online.\nDespite bipartisan consensus that something needs to be done, what that something actually might look like differs wildly. So, we’re asking experts, and trying to connect the dots to find out what new internet regulation might look like. \nWe’re calling this series, UnChecked, and it will be reported out over a series of episodes starting June 14th. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
