On paper, Deepcut seemed to be a successful military installation -- yet it had a dark side. Young trainees were routinely bullied and abused, with little high-level oversight. A series of controversial trainee deaths between 1995 and 2002 were all ruled suicides, and, despite complaints and calls for investigation from grieving family members, forensic experts and more, this remains the official conclusion of the UK government today. Almost a decade since the last documented death, questions remain. Does the British Army have something to hide?
