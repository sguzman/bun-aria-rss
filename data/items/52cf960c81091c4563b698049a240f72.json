  "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is once again making headlines, polling his Twitter followers about whether to sell billions’ worth of Tesla stock. Daniel and I discuss the drama around the famously polarizing CEO... and whether investors should pay attention to his latest tweet storm. [1:00] Keeping with the theme of electric vehicles (EVs), electric pickup maker Rivian begins trading today… and the numbers are absolutely crazy. I explain what this says about current market conditions… and why Ford made a huge mistake investing in this rival. [8:05] Crypto exchange Coinbase reported weak earnings this week. While I have some concerns around this company… Daniel makes a case for why investors should buy the stock at current levels. [17:30] Musk wasn’t the only one causing a stir on social media this week… Daniel and I wade into Pfizer’s Twitter meme drama… and the uproar over Aaron Rodgers’ vaccination status. [27:00] In , I just updated Amazon from a hold to a buy. The move might have surprised members, given Amazon is already boasting over 200% gains for the portfolio… But this is a critical lesson on generating wealth over the long term. [31:35] Finally, I’m incredibly excited to share some details about our latest product, Big Money Trader—launching next week. [37:35] Enjoyed this episode?
