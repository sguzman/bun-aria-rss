  "description": "<p>SUFFERING COMES FROM SELF-OBSESSIVE THINKING. I used to be terrified to speak in public. I’d get nervous before getting in front of any kind of group. But then I trained in meditation and learned to switch my mindset. Instead of being so focused on me, I focused on being of service. Now, I love getting in front of a crowd. Once you connect to a purpose that is bigger than yourself, you can overcome the obstacles holding you back. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the value of coming from a place of faith and service with a Democratic presidential hopeful: Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi Gabbard is the first female combat veteran to ever run for president and the first female combat veteran ever elected to Congress, along with Tammy Duckworth. She has served for seven years on the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Homeland Security Committees, where she's been intimately involved with sensitive, national security issues. Tulsi is an introvert who had to push herself to be the type of person who felt comfortable knocking on doors to share her message. Now she communicates her plan for the future on one of the biggest platforms in the world.
