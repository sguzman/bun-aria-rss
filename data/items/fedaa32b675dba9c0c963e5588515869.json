  "description": "<p>In this 63rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we begin by discussing impeachment, pardons, and the Federalist papers, taking lessons from America’s history. Then we discuss a new research paper that finds that asymptomatic COVID cases account for half of all infections—is the research well-done, the model founded, the conclusions warranted? We discuss the fact that Oceania (New Zealand and Australia) have implemented such successful COVID containment measures that they are delaying vaccinations for a bit. And we end with a tale of two bald eagles and their nest, speaking also to other birds and their nests—swallows, Steller’s jays, robins. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
