  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human trafficking is the worst part of humanity, and it’s hiding in plain sight. It’s hard not to ignore it, because it’s so unbearable to think about. When you hear about it on the news, or see it in a movie, most people turn it off, because it’s simply too hard to imagine a child of your own, a sibling, a niece or nephew, godchild, in such a situation. It’s difficult, and it’s dark – and most people don’t want to face the darkness. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one organization, Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.), is looking darkness directly in the eye. In the past six years of their existence, they have rescued 3,500 victims and assisted in the arrests of more than 1,500 traffickers around the world through coordinated rescue operations and recovery programs. Their work, and mission, is one that Tony and Sage Robbins are deeply passionate about. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, you'll hear an interview with O.U.R. founder, Tim Ballard, on how they’re working to eradicate human trafficking – and incredible stories of survival and healing.</span></p>",
