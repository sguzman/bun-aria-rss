  "description": "<p>This week it’s Pine Barrens with guest Steve Buscemi…need I say more? This episode of the Sopranos is one of the greatest hours in the history of television. Now Michael and Steve are going to break it down scene by scene. We kick things off with an interview with Steve Buscemi who directed the episode and was nominated for an Emmy for his work. Steve talks about how the idea for the story came from a dream by Tim Van Patten, and how the episode randomly dropped to him to direct. He shares stories about how Jersey wouldn’t approve the show's permits so the outdoor scenes had to be shot in Harriman State Park, NY rather than NJ. How the snow was a complete accident and what it took to get Tony Sirico to mess up those wings. </p><p>Then before Michael and Steve break down the episode we better check the Wing-o-Meter. In this episode Tony goes from level one to level four and all the way to total bozo! </p><p>After that Michael and Steve talk about how several of the scenes were shot, locations where they were shot, and what it was like spending four days in the freezing cold. Steve has a hilarious story about what it took to make Jim laugh when he saw Bobby in the ridiculous hunting outfit. Then things start to get a bit strange.  Michael talks about squid from outer space and whether Steve is smarter than a dolphin. But that’s just the beginning because after all we are in the Pine Barrens….and the Jersey devil is about to stir things up. A horse head, kangaroo body, bat wings and a forked tail…..really? Steve is going to go off! This is a great one. Pine Barrens…Talking Sopranos Episode #37.
