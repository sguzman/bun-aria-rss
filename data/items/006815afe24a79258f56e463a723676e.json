  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about new stories popping up on this Super Bowl Tuesday and make way for four great guests. First, 16 year NFL Quarterback, starter for 8 teams, one of the toughest SOB's on the planet, Ryan \"Fitzmagic\" Fitzpatrick joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his career, this last year in Miami, where he's looking to go next, falling in love with football again, and what he's doing Super Bowl Sunday (26:40-46:40). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, Super Bowl Champion, 9 year NFL veteran on the offensive line and friend of the program TJ Lang joins the show to clear up some headlines that have been making the rounds after comments he made on a Detroit radio show about his old teammate Aaron Rodgers being \"hell-bent on revenge against the front office\" (1:01:23-1:12:30). Next, 10 year NFL veteran at WR, co-host of GMFB on NFL Network, Nate Burleson joins the show to chat about the 2020 NFL season, calling the Nickelodeon game, and what he ultimately thinks the Super Bowl is going to come down to (1:12:32-1:29:41). Later, Hall of Famer, 2x Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and friend of the show, Terrell Davis joins the program to chat about the Super Bowl week, his new Defy water, what his Super Bowl experiences were like, if he thought he'd win more, and much more (1:31:52-1:49:58).
