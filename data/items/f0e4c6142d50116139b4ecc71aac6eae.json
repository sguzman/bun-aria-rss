    "media:description": "The full extended edition of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy clocks in at just about 11 hours and 20 minutes. With so much dense character and world building it can be hard to catch just how connected the world of Middle Earth really is. Like the incestious family history of Galadriel. Or how Sauron made sure that nobody ever could destroy the Ring. In this video we’ll bring to you just 20 of the near endless things you could miss in the Lord of the Rings. And while it is not needed, watching the extended edition of these movies is highly recommended.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro \n0:22 - A Hobbit’s Real Name\n1:34 - Gandalf and Tolkien\n2:26 - Bodily Harm\n3:15 - Portraits\n4:15 - Cameos\n5:18 - Mr. Underhill\n6:06 - Dwarves\n6:55 - Aragorn’s Age\n7:55 - Back and Front\n8:35 - Light of Erendil\n8:57 - Everyone is Related\n10:10 - Figwit\n11:06 - Balrogs\n11:52 - Saruman’s Death\n12:53 - Christopher Lee\n13:27 - The Ring’s Power\n\nCheck out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant \n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant  \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/ \n\nOur Website:\nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nWritten by: Iyan Socolove\nNarrated by: Chris Goodmakers\nEdited by: Chris Goodmakers\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",
