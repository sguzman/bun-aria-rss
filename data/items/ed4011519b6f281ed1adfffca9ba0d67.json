  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. It's too little too late for FISA Judge Rosemary Collyer who chose not to act in 2017 when Landmark Legal Foundation filed a 'friend of the court brief' citing the abuse of the FISA Court. Collyer denied Landmark’s request and now, two and a half years later, rebukes the FBI for their \"irregularities.\" Her actions are disappointing and she should be held to account and publicly share the facts behind her new decision to look into these matters. Then, President Trump submitted his statement on impeachment for the record today citing the lack of an impeachable offense, the erosion of our Constitution, and the ill-spirited will of Democrats in the legislature to attack him over political differences.  Later, the enemy of the Constitution, is the Speaker of the House. In true fascist fashion Pelosi is obstructing the Senate because they cannot control the trial there. So, at the direction of Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe, Pelosi has decided to put the brakes on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate and snapped at reporters who asked if she was playing politics with the impeachment in order to gain leverage over the Senate process. The Senate has the sole power under the Constitution to adjudicate an impeachment. Therefore, Pelosi is attempting to obstruct the Senate’s power to act on its constitutional authority. Mitch McConnell should immediately put an end to this and declare the impeachment null and void as the speaker has failed to complete the impeachment process by timely sending it to the Senate for adjudication. McConnell has no less authority to unilaterally make such a decision than Pelosi does to withhold the administrative notification of the articles of impeachment to the Senate either indefinitely or with conditions. Her effort to cripple the presidency and blackmail the Senate must be defeated. We hope you have a very happy new year!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
