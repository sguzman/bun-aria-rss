  "description": "<p>2-20- Today we opened up the phone lines after Angela reported a story in Front Page about a man waking up to a man having sex with his wife and stabbed him, but was he in the wrong? So we asked our listeners what they thought about it. Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a man that is definitely not apart of the \"Faithful Man Community\" and that is Tristan Thompson because he allegedly cheated on Khloe again, but this time with Kylie's bestfriend. Also, Angela helped some listeners out during \"Ask Yee\". </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
