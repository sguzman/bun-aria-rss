In the news today are wars, natural disasters, food and energy crises, and a global recession. Amidst the backdrop of a post-lockdown world, where many nations are still trying to recover economically, a more sinister threat stands off to the side, biding its time.

Of that amount, its multitenant data centre demand will account for 1,429 MW.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This massive demand is primarily driven by cloud service providers (CSPs) who supply cloud tech to power increasingly digitalised businesses and services. These CSPs include tech titans such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Alibaba, as well as smaller players. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, most of ASEAN’s energy needs, including Indonesia’s, </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/southeast-asia-energy-outlook-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are met with fossil fuels.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In 2021, the share of fossil fuels in ASEAN was 81.2 per cent, with renewables comprising 18.2 per cent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly, during the pandemic, the share of renewables in the region remained resilient, jumping from 17.4 per cent in 2019 to 18.2 per cent in 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ASEAN Centre for Energy </span><a rel=\"follow\" rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://aseanenergy.sharepoint.com/PublicationLibrary/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2FPublicationLibrary%2F2022%2FPublication%202022%2FASEAN%20Energy%20in%202022%20Outlook%20Report%2Epdf&parent=%2FPublicationLibrary%2F2022%2FPublication%202022&p=true&ga=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the renewables sector to continue growing and become the main driver in various government stimulus packages across the region.</span></p>\n<h2>With great power demand comes great opportunity</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continued reliance on fossil fuels for energy will soon make it untenable to live in this world.

In fact, the nation </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www5.bkpm.go.id/en/publication/detail/news/harnessing-renewable-energy-investment-sector-in-indonesia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">commands 40 per cent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the world’s geothermal reserves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the utilisation of NRE resources stands at only </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://en.antaranews.com/news/248989/only-03-of-indonesias-new-renewable-energy-potential-utilized\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.3 per cent of its 3,638 GigaWatt potential (11.5GW)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signalling a huge market opportunity for anyone who can harness the sector.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truly, the potential for disruption and growth in Indonesia’s energy sector is nothing short of gargantuan, given its NRE promise and </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.oecd.org/environment/cc/cefim/indonesia/RUPTL-2021-30-PLN-steps-up-ambitions-to-accelerate-clean-energy-investments-in-Indonesia.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support by the government</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to grow the renewables sector.</span></p>\n<h2>Indonesia’s single biggest investment opportunity</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These statistics should make tech stakeholders sit up and pay attention. As Indonesia continues on its rapid path to modernisation, demand for the internet will steadily increase, and so too will its energy needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time is now for tech entrepreneurs in Indonesia to gain a foothold in this relatively untapped sector and figure out how to reduce, or at least equalise, the cost of renewables with coal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that anyone who can achieve this, with a roadmap to scale, of course, will have the next decacorn on their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that our local cohort of tech investors tends to focus on B2C and pure internet plays, and anything involving hardware, climate tech, or data centres has never been sexy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But local venture capitalists need to wake up and smell the energy demand on the horizon. They must start looking for real deals in the renewables space today because tomorrow is too late. </span></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: <b >e27</b> aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.
