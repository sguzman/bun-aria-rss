    "media:description": "#Chinainsights#20congresss\nThe reshuffle of the Chinese leadership has spooked foreign investors. The next day, on Oct. 24th, Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in Hong Kong since the global financial crisis in 2008, as foreign investors rushed to sell Chinese stocks. Nearly all the stocks in the Hang Sheng index were lower, with Chinese internet and technology stocks being hit particularly hard. \nAnalysts generally expect China's economy to slow in Xi's third term, not primarily because of the labor force demographics, productivity, real estate, etc. that drive growth, but because of the CCP's regressive economic policies. \n\nHave questions?
