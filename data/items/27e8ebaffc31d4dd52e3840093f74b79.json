I'm Matthew Hornbach, Global Head of Macro Strategy for Morgan Stanley. Along with my colleagues bringing you a variety of perspectives, I'll be talking about global macro trends and how investors can interpret these trends for rates and currency markets. It's Thursday, March 24th at noon in New York.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For most investors, most of the time, the general level of U.S. Treasury yields is more important than the differences between yields on shorter maturity bonds and those on longer maturity bonds. The most widely quoted Treasury yield is usually the one investors earn by lending their money to the government for 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But there are times when the difference between yields on, say, treasuries that mature in 2 years and those that mature in 10 years make the news. And this is one of those times. These yields are tracked over time on a visual representation we call the yield curve. And at some point soon, we expect the yields on 2 year treasuries to be higher than those on 10 year treasuries. This is what we call a 2s10s yield curve inversion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why yield curve inversion makes the news is because, in the past, yield curve inversion has preceded recessions in the U.S. economy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Still, there are two points to make about the relationship between the yield curve and recessions, both of which should put investors' minds at ease. First, using history as a guide, inverted 2s10s yield curves preceded recessions by almost two years on average. While time flies, two years is plenty of time for people to prepare for harder times ahead.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Second, despite popular belief, yield curve inversions don't necessarily cause recessions, and neither does significantly tighter fed monetary policy - which also can cause yield curves to invert. In his recent speech, Fed Chair Powell highlighted 1965, 1984, and 1994 as times when the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly without causing a recession.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Another important point is that the yield curve can flatten for reasons unrelated to tighter Fed policy. For example, between 2004 and 2006, the yield curve flattened by much more than Fed policy alone would have suggested. The curve flattening during this period baffled the Fed and investors alike. Former Fed Chair Greenspan labeled the episode \"a conundrum\" at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So what caused the yield curve to flatten so much during that period? Former Fed Chair Bernanke suggested it was a global savings glut. Overseas investors purchased an increasingly larger share of the Treasury market than they had ever bought before.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Fast forward to today and the demand from overseas investors has been replaced by demand from the Fed. In fact, the Fed owns almost 30% of outstanding Treasury notes and bonds, which goes some way to explaining how flat the yield curve is today. And, to be clear, fed ownership of those bonds also isn't a reason to think recession is right around the corner.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Another common concern about a flat yield curve is that it will cause banks to stop lending. And without banks lending into the real economy, recession might loom large. But our U.S. Bank Equity Research Team is less concerned.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Their work shows that bank loans grew during the prior 11 periods of yield curve inversion since 1969. While they found some moderation in loan growth, it was modest. And this year, despite our forecast for an inverted yield curve. The project loans to grow 7% over the year, after loans shrank last year, when the yield curve was actually much steeper.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So in the end, while we think the yield curve will invert this year, we don't think investors should worry too much about a looming recession - even if the news does.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for listening.
