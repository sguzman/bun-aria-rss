  "description": "So many food labels proclaim their eco-virtues these days — organic. Pasture-raised. Cage-free. Non-GMO. What do they actually mean? Here are six ways to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>- \"Natural\" or \"sustainable\" labels have no legal standard.<br/>- \"Organic\" means it's better for the planet, but may not be better for you.<br/>- Non-GMO is not organic. The food was still grown with pesticides.<br/>- Labels like \"Animal Welfare Approved\" mean the animals got to live outdoors.<br/>- \"Fair Trade\" products deliver a little extra money to small farmers in cooperatives.<br/>- Don't let labels stress you out. When it comes to solving the world's problems, your shopping decisions aren't nearly as important as your political decisions. ",
