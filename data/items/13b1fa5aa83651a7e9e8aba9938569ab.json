Or the one that brings the tears as soon as you hear the beat drop? There is no denying the power that music and dance has on our mood. Well did you know it can be useful in therapy too? In honor of Black Music Month, this week we're chatting all about how music and dance impact our mental health. For this conversation I was joined by Jennifer Sterling, a registered Dance & Movement psychotherapist and holistic nutritionist. Jennifer and I chatted about how she uses dance and movement in her work as a therapist, the concerns it can be useful for, and why dance and music are powerful in helping us heal. </p><p>I’m also super excited to share a conversation I had with one of my favorite musical artists, Carmen Rodgers, about her experience as an artist and her thoughts on why investing in your mental health is important as an artist.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our Amazon Store for all the books mentioned on the podcast. <a href=\"https://therapyforblackgirls.com/amazon\">therapyforblackgirls.com/amazon</a></p><p>American Dance Therapy Association <a href=\"https://www.adta.org/\">https://www.adta.org/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Jennifer</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://jennifersterling.com/\">https://jennifersterling.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Carmen</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.iamcarmenrodgers.com/\">https://www.iamcarmenrodgers.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
