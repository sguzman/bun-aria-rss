  "title": "Howard Burton, \"Pandemic Perspectives: A Filmmaker's Journey in 10 Essays\" (Open Agenda, 2022)",
  "description": "Howard Burton has been talking to very wise people for decades--scientists, historians, political thinkers, philosophers, etc. When Covid \"hit\" he was, like many of us, puzzled. Where did it come from? How should we respond to it? What does it say about us? So he did what he does: Had conversations with 32 very wise people about Covid. He filmed the discussions, and you can watch them here. Some of them will be released as podcasts on the Ideas Roadshow Podcast, which you can find here. He also wrote a book about his conversations: Pandemic Perspectives: A Filmmaker's Journey in 10 Essays (Open Agenda, 2022)﻿. You can buy it here. \nToday I talked to Howard about the book, and what he learned in his discussions with these people. Enjoy. \nMarshall Poe is the founder and editor of the New Books Network.
