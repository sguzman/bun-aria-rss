  "description": "<p>Jeremy Hunt is an optimist and his positive attitude towards life shines out throughout this entertaining and revealing interview. He shares great stories and insights from his time as Foreign Secretary, Health Secretary and Culture Secretary - including his candid take on the Murdoch bid to takeover BSkyB. It's his time at Health that is most fascinating and he is open and philosophical about his successes and failures in the job. He's philosophical in general and has a great approach to politics which is inspirational. The contrast with the current incumbent of Number 10, who Jeremy stood against in the 2019 Leadership Election, is irresistible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Jeremy on Twitter: @Jeremy_Hunt</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEW GUESTS ANNOUNCED FOR THE POLITICAL PARTY LIVE:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>20 Dec: Christmas Special with Jacob Rees-Mogg, Rosena Allin-Khan and MP4</p><p>10 Jan: Neil Kinnock</p><p>24 Jan: Angela Rayner</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buy tickets to The Political Party, live at The Duchess Theatre including the next show with&nbsp;<strong>JACOB REES-MOGG, ROSENA ALLIN-KHAN and MP$ </strong>here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nimaxtheatres.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-political-party-with-matt-forde%2F&data=04%7C01%7C%7C6a3902b741d14504929208d9ba74dcaf%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637745833339143126%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=sRKj1kugW8wFPNc3I4xU5WL%2BwFsmXxKYRqvNpcZJ6tU%3D&reserved=0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
