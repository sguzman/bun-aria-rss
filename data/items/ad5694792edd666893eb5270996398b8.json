  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Dr. Paul Zeitz, author of Waging Optimism, about how to identify our complacency and make a move toward impacting the world around us. Together, the pair discusses how optimism leads to courage, and how courage leads to action. Oftentimes, making change requires experimentation; Plan A doesn’t always work out, so it’s good to have more than one Plan B in place. While it can be easy to feel discouraged that our actions don’t lead to revolutionary change, we can bolster our optimism by remembering that every action ripples outward and carries an impact. Two foundational ways to be a catalyst for change? Always be ready to act and continue to learn new things about how the system works so you can generate ideas on how to improve it.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
