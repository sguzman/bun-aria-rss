  "description": "This is raw and in real time. We sit and have a conversation about the insurrection at the Nation's capital yesterday, January 6th, 2021. We, like all of you, watched in horror and anger, trying to process what we were seeing and how we as followers of Jesus are supposed to navigate the wreckage. All of it is emotional and wandering, but it is real.\n\nYesterday was the Day of Epiphany, the closing of the Christmas season and a reminder of Herod the narcissist and his kingdom being threatened by the hope of the coming Christ. We lament with the Nation and the Church as both have become fractured. How do we best love the Lord and our neighbor in this coming season? As always, we appreciate walking this road with all of you.\n",
