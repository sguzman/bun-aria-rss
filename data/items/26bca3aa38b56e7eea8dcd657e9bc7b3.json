Another really cool side of phytonutrients is the impact they have on making animals healthier, too. In fact, animals who graze on a diverse variety of pasture, with lots of different kinds of wild plants, get an incredible array of phytonutrients. They will even intuitively mix and match their nutritional needs to what plants are available, making sure they get the right balance of vitamins and minerals. Animals who’ve been able to graze like this provide much healthier meat that passes more nutritional benefits along to us. Plus they get to live happier, more natural lives! Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I talk to Fred Provenza about the amazing world of phytochemicals and what they can do for animals and our own bodies.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Fred grew up in Salida, Colorado, working on a ranch and attending school in Wildlife</p><p>Biology at Colorado State University. He is professor emeritus of Behavioral Ecology in the</p><p>Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University where he worked for 35 years,</p><p>directing an award-winning research group that pioneered an understanding of how learning</p><p>influences foraging behavior and how behavior links soil, plants, herbivores, and humans.</p><p>He is the author of three books, including <em>Nourishment: What Animals Can Teach Us About</em></p><p><em>Rediscovering Our Nutritional Wisdom</em>; <em>Foraging Behavior: Managing to Survive in a World of</em></p><p><em>Change</em>; and T<em>he Art & Science of Shepherding: Tapping the Wisdom of French Herders</em> (co-authored with Michel Meuret). He has also published over 300 research papers in a wide variety of scientific journals.</p><br><p>This episode was sponsored by Thrive Market, Joovv, and chili.</p><br><p>Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule. Not only does Thrive offer 25 to 50% off all of my favorite brands, but they also give back. For every membership purchased, they give a membership to a family in need. Get up to $20 in shopping credit when you sign up and any time you spend more than $49 you’ll get free carbon-neutral shipping. All you have to do is head over to <a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/Hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thrivemarket.com/Hyman</a>.</p><br><p>I recently discovered Joovv, a red light therapy device. Red light therapy is a super gentle non-invasive treatment where a device with medical-grade LEDs delivers concentrated light to your skin. It actually helps your cells produce collagen so it improves skin tone and complexion, diminishes signs of aging like wrinkles, and speeds the healing of wounds and scars. Check out the Joovv products at <a href=\"https://joovv.com/farmacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joovv.com/farmacy</a> and use the code FARMACY at checkout.</p><br><p>One of the easiest and most effective ways to get better sleep every single night is through temperature regulation, which is why I was so relieved to discover the transformative products from Chili. The chiliPAD and OOLER system are two really cool gadgets that fit over the top of your mattress and use water to control the temperature of your bed—which helps lower your internal temperature and trigger deep relaxing sleep. Right now chili is offering my audience a really great deal.
