  "description": "Learn about the natural neurobiology of co-regulation and it’s capacity to engage safety and heal trauma. In addition, this episode addresses the myth of self-regulation and how to re-engage interpersonal relationships if they’ve been neglected.\n\nTherapist Uncensored co-host Sue Marriott LCSW CGP chats with author and therapist Bonnie Badenoch about the concept of using safety to reshape your neural landscape through authentic relationships. Badenoch guides us through her progression of building a bridge between science and practice to cultivate the best therapeutic mind.\n\nYou’ll learn how exercising “happy humility” and compassion can allow for an ideal presence in our day-to-day life using our autonomic nervous system. Also, special hats off to Steve Porges and polyvagal theory.\n\n0:00-30:00\n\nWhat creates safety? How do our internal systems want us to be received?\n\nSympathetic activation happens when there’s a need to control something in light of an obstacle.\n\nInternal systems challenge to remain in an open and receptive state. Polyvagal theory and Steve Porges.\n\nHow can we explore the relationship between safety and curiosity and best use the language of “safety,” versus “comfort” and “discomfort”, especially towards the beginning of therapy and in new relationships?\n\nBadenoch contends that there’s no such thing as a maladaptive experience; that humans are always adaptive and require co-regulation.\n\nWhat’s the difference between co-regulation and auto-regulation?
