  "description": "The history of psychoanalysis is full of twists, turns and also glaring omissions. In their new two-volume set, editors Irwin Hirsch and Donnell Stern attempt to set the record straight in regard to the overlooked contributions of interpersonal writers and thinkers. In this interview, they speak at length about the history of the interpersonal tradition, why it was initially ignored by more traditional approaches, and how it became the one of the foundations of what is known as the relation school today.\n\nThe Interpersonal Perspective and Psychoanalysis, 1960s-1990s (Routledge, 2017) and Further Developments in Interpersonal Psychoanalysis 1980s-2010s (Routledge, 2018) are valuable additions to the psychoanalytic canon and essential texts for anyone interested in the development of relational and all contemporary psychoanalytic thinking.\n\n\n\nOn Twitter @cebandini\nLearn more about your ad choices.
