  "description": "This week, the gals hold court on some tainted trials. Topics include a Canadian attorney with a bad strategy, a premonition at the Four Seasons, and a pill-popping judge with a major conflict of interest. Pop open a fresh bottle of Domaine Bleu Le Mistral Red Blend, sequester yourself, and tune in for Mistrials.Â ",
