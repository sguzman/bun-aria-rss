  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the media decided decades ago that they were going to report the news and interpret it for you from a liberal perspective and that’s what we are seeing today. Now the media is claiming we lost the suburbs in the election because of President Trump but that's wrong, its immigration that cost us the suburbs and consequentially some House seats in the election. When Ronald Reagan and the Bush's won, Florida, Texas, and Colorado, they were solid red states. Back then the media wondered how the Democrats would ever win the presidency without physically changing the electorate. Well they're doing it! As assimilation has become extinct, we continue to lose because the population is changing. Mark reiterated his thoughts from his book Liberty and Tyranny in 2008 outline that birthright citizenship is not guaranteed by the 14th Amendment and it is immigration, both legal and illegal, which is fueling our problem with assimilation. Then, we look at new pseudo-events in the media, through the lens of Daniel Boorstin's book \"A Guide to Pseudo Events in the Media\". Boorstin describes pseudo-events as events that are not spontaneous, not train wrecks, but are planned and planted and exist solely to be reproduced by the media. Ambiguity is also a telltale sign of a pseudo-event. What Jim Acosta did last week at the Presidential press conference is exactly what a pseudo-event is. Later, California is on fire and the media blames Trump for his comments on forest management. Yet, Governor Jerry Brown makes comments blaming climate change deniers and does not get criticized by the media.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
