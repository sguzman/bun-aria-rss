(copy the link to share with your friends and family via text)\n\n\n\nNo other legend invoked as much fear, panic, and dread as the Wendigo. For hundreds of years people in Canada and the United States have told stories of a giant cannibalistic monster that could devour an entire community- or worse yet, possess you and turn you into a Wendigo. Almost everything that has previously been written about the Wendigo comes from an anthropological or sociological perspective, often failing to even address the supernatural component of the lore. Not this book! The result is one of the most comprehensive explorations of the Wendigo legend ever written. While not for the faint of heart, Wendigo Lore is a treasure trove of information for those seeking to learn more about this unique legend of the Northwoods.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
