  "description": "As former U.S. Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel says during this special podcast, when he interviewed Putin several years ago, the Russian president cited the collapse of the USSR as the greatest tragedy of the past century. And, as Richard notes, Putin has been on the attack against what he perceives as those that brought Russia down ever since. This led to his support for Donald Trump in 2016 and once again, it leads him to support Trump again in 2020. And Trump is returning the favor, making it harder for Congress and the American people to know what Russia is up to, harder to defend against them and even spreading disinformation to minimize the Russian threat. We discuss the latest developments in this, one of the great stories of our time, with Stengel, a former managing editor of Time Magazine, Natasha Bertrand of Politico and Graham Brookie, Director and Managing Editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Join co-hosts Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School and David Rothkopf of the DSR Network, for this important, insight-rich episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
