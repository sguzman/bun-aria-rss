  "description": "Isaac Lidsky has been a child actor, Supreme Court litigator, entrepreneur, best-selling author, and just happens to be blind. After losing his sight to a rare degenerative disease in his early years he learned the power of not just simply seeing the world for what it is, but mentally manifesting what you want it to be and executing. Isaac shares what lessons can be found in the unknown on this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.   SHOW NOTES: Isaac discusses how losing his sight helped him see the world in a new way. [3:38] Isaac talks about dealing with your inner critic. [16:08] Isaac explores his decision-making process during difficult moments. [23:15] Isaac details how he built his own reality despite obstacles and noise. [28:35] Isaac reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [43:25]   QUOTES:   \"The value in this Eyes Wide Open vision that I speak of is, it's not about science, it's not about blindness, it's about the lessons we can take in really taking control over the reality we want for ourselves. Literally choosing who you want to be and how you want to live your life in any moment.\" [10:50]   \"You can live a life of happenstance, of reaction, or you can take some time to figure out how you want to spend your time, who you want to be, who you want to be as a parent, who you want to be as a spouse, and on and on and on. You can try to be that person and you can try to live that life.\" [21:55]   \"Every moment of your life is a choice. How do you want to spend that moment? Who do you want to be? It is not the circumstances we confront that dictate the lives we experience.\" [25:55]   FOLLOW ISAAC LIDSKY: TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2q2K4jN\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2q2K4jN</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2H2XPXy\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2H2XPXy</a> YOUTUBE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2pWQSza\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2pWQSza</a> WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Io123h\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2Io123h</a>   MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE   BOOKS: Eyes Wide Open - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2uGuXlt\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2uGuXlt</a> [2:45]   SPEECHES: Isaac Lidsky Ted Talk - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2cYHPFx\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2cYHPFx</a> [2:50]   COMPANIES: ODC Construction - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Edw7V4\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2Edw7V4</a> [2:08]",
