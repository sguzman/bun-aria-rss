  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about Turla's return, this time in an espionage campaign against Switzerland's RUAG. The Panama Papers and other hacks prompt reiteration of lots of good, if familiar advice, some of it directed at the US Congress and other small businesses. The TeslaCrypt proprietors seem less remorseful than resourceful, as they shift to CryptXXX. SWIFT plans to announce a security upgrade today. US Cyber Command announces the winners of its $460 million IDIQ. Guccifer prepares to cop a plea, and the Scunthorpe Problem surfaces in Oxfordshire. We also hear about cloud storage security from Quintessence Labs, and Protemus talks to us about medical records' privacy.",
