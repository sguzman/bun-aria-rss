  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by former Tennessee Titan safety, Rhodes Scholar, and current neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Myron Rolle. Pat and Dr. Rolle chat about what things are currently like with the coronavirus and if we are in a better position now then we were when Pat and Dr. Rolle first spoke to one another a couple of months ago. Dr. Rolle also gives his take on what needs to be done to keep us moving in the right direction, if the coronavirus is something we're always going to need to be worried about like the flu, and some of the conflicting information that is out there currently about Covid19 (:49-15:19). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat has some big breaking NFL news for AJ, they chat about what it's like getting ready to play in the Hall of Fame game, they cover the start of the AFL season in Australia, chat about the PGA Tour's Charles Schwab Challenge, AJ's excellent gift giving abilities, and everything else going on in the sports world (17:45-1:37:19). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 7x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the 2000's All-Decade Team, member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and Pat's former teammate, Dwight Freeney joins the program. Pat and Dwight discuss his relationship with Michael Jordan and the Jordan brand, what he thought of The Last Dance, his relationship with Michael and how they golf 3-4 times a week together, his thoughts on the Jadeveon Clowney situation and why he thinks going to Cleveland would be a dream given Dwight's success alongside Robert Mathis in Indy, and his thoughts on the Jordan brand donating $100 million over the next 10 years for racial equality, social justice, and access to education (1:40:09-1:55:41). To close out the show, ESPN Baseball Insider and friend of the program, Jeff Passan joins Pat and the boys to give an update on what is going on with the MLB. Pat and Jeff discuss the likelihood that a season gets played, what's holding everything up, why the players couldn't strike even if they wanted to, where he thinks this thing might end up, what ramifications it could have for the future of baseball, and tells a few stories about being a massive WWF fan when he was growing up (1:55:43-2:17:09). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Have an incredible weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
