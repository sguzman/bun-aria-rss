  "description": "Chelsea tells Ben that when she heard what Vince said she wanted to crawl into a hole.  But she can’t hide for the rest of her life; they both need to get on with things.  When Ben says he doesn’t know how to, Chelsea says he could start by going back to uni.\nDavid worries to Leonard about who now knows about Ben and Chelsea.  He doesn’t know what makes him angrier – Vince threatening Ben or that he’s made a very private matter, public knowledge.  Leonard and David agree that Jill should know before she hears it from someone else, to Ben’s chagrin.  Later Leonard says Jill took the news surprisingly well, although she was horrified by Vince’s outburst.  \nElizabeth’s furious when Chelsea reveals that Vince told the whole village that she’s had an abortion.  Elizabeth offers Chelsea some behind the scenes work, rather than having to face customers in the Orangery.  Later Vince tries to apologise to Elizabeth, but she tells him it’s Chelsea who needs the apology. Vince tells Chelsea he was angry with Ben, not her, and he hopes his actions haven’t caused her extra heartache.  Chelsea says they have.  Vince says he’s truly sorry and asks if there’s anything he can do to make it up to her, but Chelsea leaves before he can say anything more.  Elizabeth tells him he also needs to resolve things with David and Ruth. But Vince sees red at Brookfield later when David comments on the way Vince behaved. Vince withdraws his investment in the solar panels.",
