  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving! On today’s show, Pat and the boys sit around and discuss the NFL slate on Thanksgiving as well as who they are thinking about betting on. They discuss whether or not people in Detroit hate Thanksgiving because it usually comes during a time of the year where Lions fans have nothing to be positive about, if the Bills have enough to beat the Cowboys in Jerry World or if the Cowboys will respond after Jerry Jones had a couple of choice comments for the Good Morning Football crew after being asked about Dak’s contract and the Jason Garrett situation. Pat also announces the Thanksgiving Giveaway Extravaganza Stupendous as each of the guys picks an ungoogleable question and a hashtag that you can try to answer to win anything from gift cards to the store, a free pair of shoes, a VISA gift card, or special items from the store. The guys also cover the “Thanksgiving Thank You” sale that started last night at midnight and will run through the end of the weekend. EVERYTHING in the store at store.patmcafeeshow.com is 20% off. Ugly sweaters, For The Brand gear, sweatpants, jackets, you name it. Supplies are limited so make sure you beat the rush. We thank you all so much for riding with us and being apart of the team. Come laugh with us, and hopefully this is the best Thanksgiving of your lives. Cheers.\n",
