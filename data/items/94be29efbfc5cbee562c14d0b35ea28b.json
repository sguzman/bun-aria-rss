  "description": "<p>Pull those jeans high and tight because it's time for spooky scary episode 666 with Tom Segura and Christina P. Christina gets back in the goth spirit and we posthumously celebrate another FedSmoker clip we've never seen before! In the spirit of the beast, we catch up with one of our favorite conspiracy dads, and we go deep into Lucifer's Lair and ask for forgiveness from Robert Paul Champagne himself! We then get into some fun brown talk, and follow up on the eye exorcist on his views on oral for this spooky episode! We then review some cool clips from someone who identifies as a tooth emoji, the halo voice over announcer, and talk about hot celebrities like Alec Baldwin, Henry Cavill, Chris Hemsworth and Margot Robbie. We then get into a very cool curation of Christina's latest TikToks.</p><p> </p><p>https://tomsegura.com/tour</p><p>https://christinaponline.com/tour-dates</p><p>https://store.ymhstudios.com/</p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/yourmomshousepodcast</p>\n",
