  "description": "Our beloved friend and colleague Petra Mayer died suddenly a few weeks ago. This episode is for her. First, a conversation with NPR's Scott Simon and Sir Andrew Motion on <em>The Folio Book of War Poetry</em>, edited by Motion. Among her many nerdy interests, Petra was a self avowed \"WWI poetry dork.\" The poetry is dark and moving, conveying universal feelings around loss. Then, a few quintessentially \"Petra\" pieces that capture her work and who she was. A conversation with romance author Beverly Jenkins and Petra talking about one of her favorite comfort reads, <em>The Goblin Emperor</em> by Katherine Addison.",
