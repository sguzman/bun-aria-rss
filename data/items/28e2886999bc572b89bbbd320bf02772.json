  "itunes:summary": "Without a doubt the biggest political issue in the world right now is the US Presidential election, and the many controversies surrounding it. From issues with ballots and access to the very laws surrounding the election itself, the events of this week have done much to illuminate the problems plaguing the institutions of representative governance in America today.\n\n\nAmidst the noise and confusion surrounding the final tally however existed some causes for celebration, namely in the form of several historic victories by candidates representing a diverse array of traditionally marginalized communities.  From Richie Torres and Mondaire Jones becoming the first openly gay black men in Congress to Sarah McBride becoming the first transgender state senator, these victories were undeniably historic, not only because of their occurrence in the wake of one of the most controversial elections in recent history, but because of the way in which they breached the walls of the traditionally exclusionary American political system. \n\n\nFrom classism in campaign finance, to the patriarchal structures of candidate selection to the overarching racialized nature of party politics, the representative institutions of the American republic have long-since been marred by a structural exclusion of minority groups. Which make the advances of minority candidates this week a huge victory indeed.\n\n\nThis isnâ€™t an indictment solely targeted at the United States as structures of intersectional exclusion are part and parcel of democracy in the western world. But the American example this week shows that maybe a fast track to institutional change is possible.\n\n\nThis week on the Carleton Political Science Podcast we discuss structures of minority exclusion in the representative institutions of the United States, Canada, England and more with Professor Melissa Haussman. Professor Haussman is a specialist in American government with the Department of Political Science, and has written extensively on comparative North American politics and the politics of gender throughout a myriad of institutional contexts. Just a side note: while weâ€™re releasing this episode on the heels of Election Night 2020, this podcast was recorded in the final days of the campaign. Regardless though, Professor Haussman offers a fascinating look at the intersectional politics at play during the American election and beyond.\n\n\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\n\n\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
