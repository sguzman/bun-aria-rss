  "description": "<p>With the Great Lockdown continuing to take its toll on the economy, mortgage rates are at near all-time lows so now is a great time to consider refinancing. Pouncing on these lower rates can lower our monthly mortgage payment, allowing us to free up some money that was being funneled towards housing. But what else should we consider? Are you a good candidate for a refinance? And then on top of that there are also costs involved in refinancing that can make it prohibitive. In this episode we discuss what you need to consider, some great reasons to refi, and how to make sure you are refinancing effectively.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Old Tuffy by New Belgium- a big thanks to Maggy for donating this beer to the show this week!
