  "description": "<p>Cairanne is an 877 ha/2,167 acre appellation in the southern Rhône Valley that has been farmed since the time of the Greeks. It is not just a regular appellation, it is a cru of elevated status in the Côtes du Rhône. It doesn’t get the credit it deserves! After tasting much of it at a wine fair in the southern Rhône, I found it unbelievably delicious. A cru with acidity and a lighter profile but still so much character? YES.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/france-southern-rhone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"292\" /></p> <p>And after speaking to a few of the other producers in the appellation, I found <a href= \"https://www.domaine-alary.com/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Jean-Etienne Alary and his father, Denis</a>.

Jean-Etienne gives us a full education on Cairanne. We cover:</p> <ul> <li>Cairanne’s location and its proximity to places like Gigondas, Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and Rasteau, as well as the Rhône River</li> <li>The main grapes that are grown, typical blends of Cairanne, and how a small percentage of Cinsault, Counoise or Carignan can go a long way. We discuss the whites, which are a small but very important part of the wines of Cairanne <ul> <li>The three main types of terroir and what grows best on each</li> <li>The climate and the strong Mistral effect, which helps keep disease off the grapes. We hit on climate change and drought, and what it means for certain grapes in the appellation</li> <li>The elegance that defines Cairanne versus all other Cru of the south</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>2. Then we discuss the 11 generations of the Alary family, their history in Cairanne and their essential role in Cairanne</p> <ul> <li>The <a href=\"https://www.domaine-alary.com/en/home/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alarys</a> have been involved in wine in Cairanne since 1692 and have farmed exclusively in this area since, surviving wars, phylloxera, mildews, to be what it is today</li> <li>We discuss Denis Alary, Jean-Etienne’s father and how he started to make significant changes when he graduated from oenology school in the 80s. We talk about the age of the big wine critic and how the Rhône bent to the will of certain critics but has come back to its roots. discuss how Denis and the close-knit wine community of Cairanne fought to get the appellation to cru status for decades, finally achieving the goal in 2016. Finally, we cover how Denis moved Alary to a certified organic property in 2009, years before it became trendy!</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>3.
