  "description": "<p>Knowing <em>when</em> to lead is just as important as knowing <em>what</em> to do and <em>where</em> to go. That’s why we’re beginning a new series on the Tests of Timing. John Maxwell explains that, when it comes to making good timing decisions, environment is everything. So, throughout this two-part series, he walks us through a step-by-step guide complete with key questions at every step to help you test whether the environment is right for the decision you need to make.  </p> <p>During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks discuss how they’ve implemented these tests in the John Maxwell Enterprise and how the courage to make big decisions comes from giving yourself permission to fail.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Tests of Timing Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Timing and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-21-Irrefutable-Laws-of-Leadership-10th-Anniversary-Edition-Hardcover_p_2780.html\"> <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John C.
