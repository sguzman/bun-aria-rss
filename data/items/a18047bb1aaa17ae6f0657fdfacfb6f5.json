  "description": "Last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced a Green New Deal resolution, outlining a bold effort to decarbonize the US economy and forestall the worst effects of climate change. Ever since, it has been the talk of the town in Washington, drawing praise and criticism from all quarters.\nBut most critics completely misunderstood the resolution. It is not a policy document. It is a set of goals and principles meant to guide the development of policy.\nThe work of fleshing out the policy details is largely in the hands of Rhiana Gunn-Wright, working out of a think tank called New Consensus. Gunn-Wright is busy consulting a broad slate of experts, with the goal of assembling a policy framework that will be ready to go when/if Democrats take power in 2021.\nVox staff writer David Roberts sat down with Gunn-Wright to chat about how she’s approaching this monumental task, why the Green New Deal includes social and economic goals (like full employment) alongside environmental goals, and what she makes of the criticism that the plan is “unrealistic.”\nBook recommendations:\nThe Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths by Mariana Mazzucato\nFear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time by Ira Katznelson\nWe are conducting an audience survey to better serve you.
