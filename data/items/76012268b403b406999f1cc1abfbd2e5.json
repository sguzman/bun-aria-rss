  "description": "<p>The word \"plantation\" pops up a lot in the food world – Plantation Mint Tea, Plantation Chicken, Plantation Rum. But it's not a culinary term. It doesn't indicate certain spices or cooking methods. So what are white people in food who use this word trying to evoke? Inspired by a piece by food writer Osayi Endolyn, we go on a mission to find out. In the process, we try to learn something about whiteness in America. </p>\n<p>Transcript available at <a href=\"http://www.sporkful.com/\">www.sporkful.com</a>.</p>\n<p>This episode is from The Sporkful's archives.
