  "description": "<p>I spoke to the witness today and it is probably one of the most fascinating conversation I have ever had. I think this witness is dealing with a lot of paranormal activity on his property and is seeing a lot of strange creatures including Sasquatch. I know this show might be beyond strange for most of my listeners but I have asked the witness to tell us everything that happen. A listener writes “Dear wes, I been listening to your show for a few weeks now, there seems to b a correlation between paranormal events and the appearance of bigfoot or dogman. I have never seen dog man but as for the rest of it I have seen plenty. Bigfoot is alive and well on my property and I hunt for it everyday trying to kill it, I have come very close to getting a shot at it but haven’t been able to pull it off, yet. Before bigfoot showed up I had an episode of demons on my property and was actually able to kill one, I know you hear this kind of stuff regularly so I decided to contact you and fill you in if your interested. I live in Texas and I know how the government tries to cover up such things and how they are always on the lookout for any new developments concerning bigfoot that’s why I have been silent about my experiences.”</p>",
