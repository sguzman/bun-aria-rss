  "description": "Greetings, HBs, from the 4 walls of our homes to the 4 walls of yours! In this episode, we cover chapters 11-27 of A Court of Wings and Ruin by Sarah J. Maas! Feyre and Lucien go on a freezing danger roadtrip, Feyre gets a taste for Eris's ropes of fire, Lucien gets super abandoned in Velaris so Feyre can do some reunited boning with her one true love, Nesta is (shockingly) an even bigger bitch, Amren is still a sexy monster (but now with books!), we still can't decipher what, exactly, Rhysand's role is, and the gang is trying to save that wall! The fate of Perineum depends on it! \n Bonus Content: Erin needs to apologize to you (she doesn't), it's #QuarantineTimes and HB is reflecting that, we go to the Autumn Court and it's #allbasicallthetime, Erin is a super hot task master and Melody doesn't care, Erin's got PIPING HOT TAKES, and #justiceforeris and his flaming ball gag? Plus, so much more! We really want to do the brilliance of SJM and our love for the books justice, while still remaining our goofy selves, so we're not sure how many parts this will be. Strap in and strap on, everyone! \n Lady Loves: \n Melody: Dye your eyebrows if you face needs more definition without effort every day! \n Erin: Get into the trashiest reality TV you can find, like the dirty raccoon you are!\n Episode Sponsor: \n  THE SINNER by JR Ward!
