  "description": "<p>The study of the polarization direction is crucial in the issue of restoring\nthe spatial structure of the magnetic field in the active galaxy parsec-scale\njets. But, due to relativistic effects, the magnetic field projected onto the\ncelestial sphere in the source reference frame cannot be assumed to be\northogonal to the observed direction of the electric vector in the wave.\nMoreover, the local axis of the jet component may not coincide with its motion\ndirection, which affects the observed polarization direction. In this article,\nwe analyze the transverse to jet distributions of the electric vector in the\nwave, obtained as a result of modeling with different jet kinematic and\ngeometrical parameters for a helical magnetic field with a different twist\nangle and for a toroidal magnetic field in the center, surrounded by a varying\nthickness sheath, penetrated by a poloidal field. We obtained: 1) the shape of\nthe electric vector transverse distribution depends in a complex way on the\nangles of the jet axis and the velocity vector with the line of sight; 2)\nambiguity in determining the twist direction of the helical magnetic field\nunder using only the distributions of the electric vector in the wave; 3) both\nconsidered magnetic field topologies can reproduce both the ``spine-sheath''\npolarization structure and individual bright details with the longitudinal to\nthe jet axis polarization direction.\n</p>",
