  "title": "Booking your first zero-emissions flight",
  "description": "In aviation, there’s a crowd of low-carbon technologies vying for a slice of the market. On one hand, the long-haul portion of the market will likely rely on sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) which still emit greenhouse gasses but could be offset to net-zero. On the other hand, there’s a big share of air traffic that could go completely zero-emissions with the help of batteries and hydrogen. \nSo how soon could you book a ticket on a zero-emissions flight? And what routes are possible?\nIn this episode, Shayle talks with Jayant Mukhopadhaya, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). Jayant recently authored two reports on electric aircraft and hydrogen aircraft. Shayle and Jayant dig in on some tough questions: \n\nCan electric aircraft take incremental steps into the market given the limitations of current battery energy densities? Or do they need a technology breakthrough?\n\nHow do hydrogen fuel cell, compressed hydrogen combustion, and liquid hydrogen combustion compare?\n\nHow do airports need to prepare for hydrogen fueling? Hint: Terminal-sized upgrades.\n\n\nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nResources:\n\n\nCanary Media: Can battery-powered airplanes decarbonize air travel? \n\n\nCanary Media: How do we clean up air travel? Fuel from fast-food grease is just the start\n\n\nBloomberg (video): Hydrogen May Be the Jet Fuel of the Future\n\n\nCatalyst: A bumpy ride toward decarbonizing aviation\n\n\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
