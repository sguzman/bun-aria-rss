  "description": "<p>In this work, a doubly resonant photonic crystal (PhC) cavity using the\nmerged bound states in the continuum (BICs) is proposed to obtain a higher\nsecond harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Firstly by scanning geometry\nparameters the accidental BICs and a band-edge mode outside the light cone can\nbe obtained. Then as the lattice constant or the thickness of the slab is\nadjusted the accidental BICs will merge. A supercell with large and small holes\nis constructed and the band-edge mode outside the light cone can be\nmode-matched with the merged BICs mode. Finally the heterostructure PhC cavity\nis designed. The merged BICs show a high quality factor for the photonic\ncrystal with finite size. Consequently, the SHG efficiency of the lattice\nconstant near merged BICs of ~6000% W-1 is higher than the one of the isolated\nBIC.\n</p>",
