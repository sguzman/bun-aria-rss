  "title": "132 - Order of the Solar Temple Doomsday Cult",
  "description": "<p>On October 4th, 1994 the dead bodies of two Solar Temple cult members and their baby are found in Morin Heights, Quebec. All three have been stabbed to death. The baby has had a wooden dagger run through its heart in an obvious ritual killing. Forty-eight other cult members would take their lives that evening. And then another sixteen in 1995. And then five more in 1997. Why? Why did so many cult members take their own lives? What did these people believe in? Madness. They believed in so much madness. And I'll break that madness down and tell the story of the formation and destruction of this strange cult today on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Upcoming<strong> Happy Murder Tour</strong> <strong>Standup</strong> dates:</p>\n<p><strong>March 28 Naples, Florida</strong> - Off the Hook Comedy Club <a href=\"https://offthehookcomedy.com/event/dan-cummins-the-happy-murder-tour-in-naples-fl/\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>March 30 Miami, Florida</strong> - The Improv <a href=\"https://www.miamiimprov.com/events/26908\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 4-6 Cleveland, Ohio</strong> - Hilarities <a href=\"https://tickets.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=0d900e79fdce414dc9d593385aeb96b6&vqitq=f511a5ab-c8b6-469b-8a92-176dde5401a5&vqitp=b2d9b5f9-979a-485c-a96c-b694549930bc&vqitts=1551139090&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=4d7353d62bef05fcf52557335620424d\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 11th Des Moines, Iowa</strong> - The Funny Bone <a href=\"http://desmoines.funnybone.com/ShowDetails/3016a329-7cb5-42f5-b12f-8ae6a4bc7d4e/1a2b0b25-ed7e-4180-abd5-8d8f6545ba17/Dan_Cummins__The_Happy_Murder_Tour/Des_Moines\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 12-13 Kansas City, Missouri </strong>- The Improv <a href=\"http://www.improvkc.com/Comedian/eb54eeee-6f82-46fa-81f1-66a6f3b315ba/_Dan_Cummins__The_Happy_Murder_Tour_\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>** LIVE ANT HILL KIDS CULT TIMESUCK April 6 Cleveland</strong> - Hilarities <a href=\"https://tickets.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&e=b752397fcdf4438b4be9b9f43477c982&vqitq=c1f457fb-d404-47c2-a6f7-3bdb0c1699ce&vqitp=f5a9a2a9-9797-4f81-b910-bf945590a467&vqitts=1551139151&vqitc=vendini&vqite=itl&vqitrt=Safetynet&vqith=1603170ee6242c97e7728a9843f259e5\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p>** <strong>LIVE ANT HILL KIDS CULT TIMESUCK April 14 Nashville - </strong>Zanies <a href=\"http://zaniesnashvilletickets.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=524467\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix! </p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the best of my standup on Spotify!</strong> (for free!) <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d\"><strong>https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the following <strong>sponsors</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>The Thrilling Adventure Hour Podcast! </strong>Listen wherever you listen to podcasts!</p>\n<p><strong>Quip! </strong> Go to <a href=\"http://GETQUIP.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>GETQUIP.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a> to get your first refill pack for FREE with a Quip electric toothbrush</p>\n<p><strong>Indochino</strong>!
