  "description": "On this very personal episode of Heath Theory, Tom Bilyeu interviews the co-founder of Impact Theory (and his wife), Lisa Bilyeu. For years Lisa has suffered from catastrophic dysbiosis, and her battle with illness is actually the inspiration for Health Theory. Now that her health is manageable, she is sharing the most important lessons she has learned. In this episode, she explains why she needed to take total ownership of her health, how she dealt with shame and fear, why she has learned to use controlled experiments, and why it is so important to challenge accepted beliefs on health.  This episode is brought to you by Impact Theory University: Visit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2MMGGX5\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly/2MMGGX5</a> today!
