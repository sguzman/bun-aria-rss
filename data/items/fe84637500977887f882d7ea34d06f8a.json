  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden acts as if Americans never had health insurance before Obamacare. Obamacare is not the gold standard of health coverage. Sadly, Obamacare has priced many people out of the market because the ACA law replaced existing plans with new plans with crushingly high premiums. Then, this is the most important election since the election following the civil war. Despite the failures of the Obama-Biden Administration, Biden still claims he has a plan to handle coronavirus. Later, Sen Kamala Harris is radical and has called for a national standard on the use of force with police. Harris never supported this as Attorney General but now she wants to take control away from the people in individual states and hand it over to the federal government. Afterward, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in with an update on House races and the 2020 presidential election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
