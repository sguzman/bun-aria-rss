  "description": "Penn State knocked off #2 Ohio State with a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown, so naturally we take 10 minutes to get to that game and talk about LSU-Ole Miss first because we're terrible at identifying meaningfulness. Other points of digression include:\n- Whether Todd Graham has what it takes to use \"chickenshit\" in conversation\n- How to defeat Jim Harbaugh by preying on his crippling addiction to competition\n- Bill Snyder is not a nice person, don't fall for his kind grandpa thing\n- Kirk Ferentz does the job you paid him to do\n- Our government mandated statement of fealty to Alabama\n- A very rude trip through the Arkansas-LSU box score\nLearn more about your ad choices.
