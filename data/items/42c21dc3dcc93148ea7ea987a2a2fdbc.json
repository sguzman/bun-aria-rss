  "description": "Xu Xian is dead. He discovered the truth about his wife and he died. I mean, yeah, he's dead...but he's also unwittingly married to a 1700 year old magical demon snake on a redemption arc, so...you know...something might happen. Seriously, though, this is a packed episode. There are magical (if not wholly unexpected) resurrections, crustacean armies, Doctor Strange ripoffs, and that's just in the first half. The creature this time is the suppon no yūrei, and probably a good idea to give up eating turtle altogether. -- Sponsors: Check out the Supernatural Skeptics Guide to New Orleans wherever you get your podcasts or at http://www.hvrwalkingdead.com Go to https://madison-reed.com and use the code LEGENDS to get 10% off plus free shipping.
