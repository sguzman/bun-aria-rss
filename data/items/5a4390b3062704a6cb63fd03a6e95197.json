  "description": "<p>We consider three equilibrium concepts proposed in the literature for\ntime-inconsistent stopping problems, including mild equilibria, weak equilibria\nand strong equilibria. The discount function is assumed to be log sub-additive\nand the underlying process is one-dimensional diffusion. We first provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the characterization of weak\nequilibria. The smooth-fit condition is obtained as a by-product. Next, based\non the characterization of weak equilibria, we show that an optimal mild\nequilibrium is also weak. Then we provide conditions under which a weak\nequilibrium is strong. We further show that an optimal mild equilibrium is also\nstrong under a certain condition. Finally, we provide several examples\nincluding one shows a weak equilibrium may not be strong, and another one shows\na strong equilibrium may not be optimal mild.\n</p>",
