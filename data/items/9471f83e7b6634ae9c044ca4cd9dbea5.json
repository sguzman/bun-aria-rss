  "description": "<p>I often talk about the importance of high-quality restful sleep and getting the right amount when it comes to creating great health. But what about the role of dreaming? You might be surprised to learn that the way we dream can have a multitude of benefits on our waking life—specifically through lucid dreaming, or the act of knowing we are dreaming while we are, in fact, completely asleep. To dig into this intriguing topic further, I sat down with expert lucid-dreamer Charlie Morley on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Charlie is a bestselling author and teacher of lucid dreaming and shadow integration. He was authorized to teach within the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism by Lama Yeshe Rinpoche in 2008 and has since developed a holistic approach to dreamwork called Mindfulness of Dream & Sleep, and has written three books which have been translated into 13 languages. In 2018 he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship grant to research mindfulness-based PTSD treatment and continues to teach on retreats for armed forces veterans. In this lively conversation, Charlie and I get into why lucid dreaming is such a powerful technique.&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
