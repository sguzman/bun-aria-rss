Then the crew discusses a follow up question to the podcast with Rob Vischer – do we live in a country with freedom from religion rather than freedom of religion? This leads into a conversation about the often antagonistic relationships between atheists and Christians, and why Christians often don’t show grace to those who do not share their beliefs. Phil asks Skye about Heaven and whether or not we will “go to Heaven” or if Heaven will come to Earth.</span></p>",
