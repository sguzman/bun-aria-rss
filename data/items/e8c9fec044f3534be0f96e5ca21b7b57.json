The stockings are hung, Melody is wrapped in her Reindeer Onesie, knowing the Reindeer Mafia will protect every HB, and we've got basically unlimited access to ALL THE CHRISTMAS LOVE MOVIES. This episode we recap Christmas Wedding Planner. There's, you guessed it, a plucky wedding planner, a PI who's not afraid to ruin everything, and a mystery surrounding the groom-to-be.

Also, Deathly Hallows concerts, fried chicken scones, mean mugging, set design excellence, a Melody reaction involving a mahogany desk that Erin wasn't expecting, JOEY FATONE, Melody's excellent impressions, and so much cackling we may have hit our limit. \n Patreon Shout Out: \n Ushma P., you are a descendent and acolyte of Euphrosyne, one of the three Greek Charities, or Graces. They were responsible for spreading joy and cheer throughout the world, and Euphrosyne in particular was the embodiment of beauty and grace. Ushma, you bring the same enthusiasm and mirth to any task you take on. Like the Graces, you know that a smile and positive attitude can make any situation, no matter how serious, more palatable, and your outlook is a ray of sunshine to anyone you meet. Do you govern your entire life with frivolity? Absolutely not. Instead, you know that the best launching pad for any interaction is kindness and you will offer others the benefit of the doubt as much as humanly possible. However, you’re also not one to let opportunities pass you by in favor of passing fancies, nor will you be anyone’s doormat. Instead, you see every occasion as an opportunity for betterment, whether it’s for yourself or the world at large. Your big heart and sunny disposition give you great power for good.\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
