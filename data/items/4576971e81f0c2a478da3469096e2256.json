How bad did it get? [07:27]</p><p>Why did Rich decide to pursue a career in law? [16:09]</p><p>What was the last straw that made Rich decide to seek help for his addiction to alcohol? How old was he, what was going on in his life at the time, and what form did this help take? [18:26]</p><p>What does Rich notice people commonly missing when he retells his story of addiction recovery and lifestyle changes that led him to become the person he is today? [27:45]</p><p>As Dr. Gabor Maté says: “Don’t ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.” What tools have most helped Rich understand and manage his own addiction? [33:51]</p><p>Was the decentralized nature of Bill Wilson’s Alcoholics Anonymous basically blockchain before blockchain was cool? [40:45]</p><p>Rich says that addiction is “a spectrum so broad that almost anybody can find themselves somewhere along the line.” Even if you might not consider yourself an addict, the tools of addiction recovery can often be used to help you break bad patterns you find yourself repeating. [43:45]</p><p>Having trouble cultivating good habits (like regular exercise)? Remember: “Mood follows action.” [48:36]</p><p>Why (and how) did Rich turn his physical health around at age 40? [50:52]</p><p>Rich’s most worthwhile investment of time, money, or energy. [57:59]</p><p>Rich’s advice for anyone trying to make positive changes in their own life — whether it’s building a small, beneficial habit, picking up a new set of skills, or overhauling their physical regimen for maximum results. [1:03:55]</p><p>Zone 2 training thoughts, experiences, and recommendations. [1:14:59]</p><p>How — and why — did Rich get in the habit of regularly sleeping in a tent on his roof? How does he maximize benefits and alleviate potential dangers of this unorthodox practice? [1:24:34]</p><p>By not scheduling commitments before noon, what does Rich’s daily architecture look like? How often does he succeed in fending off disruptions to this schedule? [1:32:00]</p><p>How Rich got to the point where he commits to living a month off the grid every year, what he does to ensure that it happens, and how he benefits from this practice. [1:38:37]</p><p>An aside: Rich asks me to share what I experienced off the grid recently in Antarctica. [1:42:41]</p><p>What would Rich’s billboard say?
