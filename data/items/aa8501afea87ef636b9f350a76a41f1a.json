  "description": "Risk in Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing (Routledge, 2018), edited by Vicki Bier, is a series of multidisciplinary approaches to analysis of rare, severe risks. The essays demonstrate a wide variety of methods, from quantitative analysis to qualitative evaluation of organizations and case studies. Additionally, Risk in Extreme Environments tackles several hot-topics in risk management: managing black swans, balancing investments in preparedness versus response, and institutionalizing resilience. Bier and the other contributors do not stop at risk analysis, but also look at how to communicate risk analysis and translate analysis into good decision-making.\n\n\n\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.
