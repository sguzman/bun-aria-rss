  "description": "<p>Wouldn't things be simpler if kids were fictional, and you could \"write\" their success over each challenge? In today's SASF, the guys discuss how a mom can help her children with their own \"character\" weaknesses. You get to hear another Nate airplane-story-turned-car story; Brian explains why camping is fun even though it sounds like it isn't; this episode also features two deer, a marten, and Yellowstone. But the real takeaways from this episode is 1) where to get the best breakfast burritos in the the Pacific Northwest; 2) stop trying to make life easy for your kids; and 3) be a killer side character in your kids' stories instead.</p>\n<p>#SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #BrianKohl #parenting #storytelling #character #Yellowstone</p>",
