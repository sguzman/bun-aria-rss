  "title": "Ep. 533 - Lock Down The Border",
  "description": "For over a month the Left has insisted we lock down our country. Towns, cities, even whole states have ordered citizens to stay locked in their homes. But now that President Trump is applying that logic to the national level by locking down our borders, the Left is up in arms. Foreign nationals can hop our fences and enter the country by the millions, but you can’t take a simple walk around the neighborhood. Doesn’t seem very fair. Then, CNN’s Chris Cuomo stages some Broadway caliber fake news before getting caught in the obvious lie, New York’s Mayor de Blasio calls for a ticker tape pandemic parade, and an Earth Day co-founder murders his girlfriend.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
