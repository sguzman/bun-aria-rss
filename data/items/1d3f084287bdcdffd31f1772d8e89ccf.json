  "description": "<p>In today's Books with Hooks, <b>Carly </b>and <b>CeCe</b> kick it back old-school to review the same three query letters. During the segment, they discuss avoiding flowery language, especially in a query; avoiding \"reviewing\" your own work and letting the pages show what kind of work it is; pitching your story rather than your writing; making sure you have the right category/genre, so that the right people read it and judge it accordingly; and getting creative with your POV when you need to write a character that isn't a main character.<br/><br/>After which, Bookstagrammer <b>Femi Omotade</b> joins us again to interview #1 NYT Bestselling <b>Brit Bennett</b>, author of <em>The Vanishing Half</em>. They discuss the writer’s responsibility to their reader; not giving yourself the burden of having to educate the reader; writing with an intelligent reader in mind; imagining that the reader is smarter than you; not trying to be universally appealing; writing as specifically as possible; how reviews are for readers, not writers; finding ways to protect your boundaries; how the book (rather than the author) is the product; and aiming for tonal fluctuations in a book. </p><p> Find us on our socials: <br/>Twitter: @TSNOTYAW @BiancaM_author @carlywatters @ceciliaclyra <br/>Instagram: @biancamarais_author @carlywatters @cece_lyra_agent @ the_shit_about_writing<br/>Facebook: @tsnotyaw<br/>Website: www.biancamarais.com<br/>Brit Bennett can be found at www.britbennett.com and on Instagram and Twitter at @britrbennett<br/>Femi Omotade can be found on Instagram at @thebookalert</p>",
