  "description": "<p>LIFE IS NOT A DRESS REHEARSAL. All of us are trying to do too many things at once. We’re on the phone while doing something else. We’re on a date but we’re distracted. We’re responding to text messages at red lights. When we live like this, we never fully experience anything. We’re half-living. It’s hard to build relationships, be joyful, and be open to opportunities when you’re not present. You may even be putting your life in danger.<br />\nOn today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the power of presence with a coach and mentor who has grounded me throughout my adult life: Chris Lee. Chris Lee has spent the last 27 years leading powerful Leadership Seminars around the world. A pioneer in emotional intelligence, Chris Lee has trained and developed people at the top of their game such as Olympic athletes, Fortune 500 Business leaders, celebrities and individuals with a desire to elevate themselves. Chris Lee also serves as a collaborator on TV and radio shows for Univision and The Fox Network. Chris says that we need to realize that life has an ending. What you’re experiencing now will soon be over- this is your one shot! By taking ownership of your life and your environment, you can stop your resentments of the past and anxiety about the future.<br />\nSo get ready to learn the Seven Keys to Being Present on Episode 818.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do we be more present? (7:00)<br />\nHow do we lead a more joyful life? (13:00)<br />\nWhat’s the difference between appreciating where you’re out and realizing you want something better? (14:50)<br />\nWhat is a lesson you’ve learned in the last six months? (36:00)<br />\nWhat’s a lesson you still need to learn? (38:00)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nSeven keys to be more present (9:00)<br />\nWhy we stay stuck in situations we don’t want to be in (16:00)<br />\nWhy you need to hold other people accountable for being present (18:00)<br />\nThe importance of setting intentions (24:00)</p>\n",
