  "description": "Extreme weather, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates all directly affect\nU.S. agriculture, which may in turn affect banks that make agricultural loans. Demand for loans from ag\nbanks could rise following events that reduce net farm income or increase banksâ€™ ability to reprice loans,\nsuch as supply chain disruptions or higher interest rates. But competition with other banks and nonbank\nfinancial institutions may offset some of these benefits.",
