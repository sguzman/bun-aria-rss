  "description": "In this episode we talk about the design rules we break and the rules that aren't really rules at all. We went to school to learn all the rules, so we can know when and why to break them.  We talk about upper cabinet doors vs open shelving and the rules we follow around fireplace hearths.  We talk about putting area rugs on carpet.  When to do it and why. We discuss other space planning rules including what to do when you have a shorter ceiling in terms for good balance and scale.  We feel strongly that rules were meant to be broken, just do it right.  <br /><br />Join our mailing list to see space plans and get exclusive offers:  <br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW</a><br /><br />Are upper cabinet doors making a comeback? 1:13<br />Rugs on carpet 7:44<br />Fireplace hearth 10:24<br />Space planning rule that breaks people’s brains 20:39 <br />Short ceilings 23:03<br /><br />“Any designer on the AD100, and you look at their spaces, they are putting things at all different angles, using things for different intentions than what they were originally built for and that’s why they’re so magnificent.
