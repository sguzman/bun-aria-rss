  "description": "<p>This episode I discuss the phenomena of over-parenting, narrating every aspect of your child's experience and other people's shitty kids. Also, what is so bad about \"starting over\"? A friend is on the verge of a major life change but is reluctant because he'd be \"starting over\". What does that mean and why are we so hell bent on staying the same? Our sense of identity is important, but it can also be holding us back. A woman emails about her annoyance with writer Elizabeth Gilbert's recent news of becoming a lesbian. Why would someone suddenly turn gay at 40? Also what wisdom can be gleaned from the film \"Mona Lisa Smile\". You're about to find out and get your life. </p>\n",
