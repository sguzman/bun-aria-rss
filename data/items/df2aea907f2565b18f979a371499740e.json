  "description": "It’s been 18 years since September 11, 2001, but has America ever recovered? As the next generation comes of age, we must remember living through the fear and confusion of that day and the unity of the day after. Retired New York fireman Bob Beckwith recalls how he became the national hero who stood arm in arm with President Bush at Ground Zero. Best-selling author Brad Meltzer joins to discuss his personal story of 9/11 and his new children’s book, “I Am Walt Disney.” Garrett M. Graff, author of “The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11,” discusses his research for the book, which is composed entirely of quotes from the people who were there, from survivors to the president’s staff and everyone in between. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
