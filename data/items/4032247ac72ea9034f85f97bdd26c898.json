    "media:description": "Topos Institute Colloquium, 22nd of September 2022.\n———\nAn interesting side-effect of formalizing mathematics in a theorem prover is that such efforts frequently leads to learning new details (*) about a known topic. I'll discuss these \"little gems\" that become much more apparent via formalization. While the focus will be mostly on items learned through formalizing Category Theory, a few nuggets from other domains (Universal Algebra, and the theory of programming languages) will also be thrown in.\n\n(*) These details are frequently known to select experts, but rarely ever recorded in print.",
