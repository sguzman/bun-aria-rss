Vievee Francis moves past these words and all their suggestions by telling us that her favorite word is the name of her husband — the poet Matthew Olzmann — and how she loves it when he says her name. Love, like this poem, can rejoice in many things, and take its own time to unfold its own delight.</p><p><strong>Vievee Francis</strong> is the author of<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10066/9780814333235\"> <i>Blue-Tail Fly</i></a>,<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10066/9780810128408\"> <i>Horse in the Dark</i></a>, and<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10066/9780810132436\"> <i>Forest Primeval</i></a>, winner of the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Poetry.
