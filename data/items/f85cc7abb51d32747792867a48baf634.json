  "description": "In this episode, Stephen A., Michael Irvin, and Dan Orlovsky debate whether or not Tom Brady is capable of winning another Super Bowl in Tampa and if off-the-field issues are factors in his performance. Aaron Rodgers previously called out his young wide receivers but failed to take a single preseason snap with them. The crew argues if that's a red flag in Green Bay. We react to the news of the Bills releasing punter Matt Araiza amid a sexual assault lawsuit. Patrick McEnroe joins the show to preview the first round of the US Open tonight in what could possibly be Serena Williams' final outing.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
