  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the President sees that we are in a second cold war with China, who have gone unmolested in their economic terrorism and theft. They have been aggressive in taking over as many global ports as they can to control the flow of commerce. China has long been a threat over the past two decades and more recently China went on unchecked during the previous Administration. Trump is now using a tactic that President Reagan used with the Soviet Union, to soften china with diplomacy and pressure them to change their ways and potentially their leadership. Then, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates once during the entire Obama Administration, yet they have raised interest rates under Trump's presidency nearly half-a-dozen times! Later, Bernie Sanders has come out of his communist closet and admitted he wants to end American energy independence by nationalizing our oil companies. For the first time in U.S history America has become energy independent without a need to rely on foreign fossil fuels. However, the leftists use an off-shoot of Marxism called climate-change to manipulate the issues. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
