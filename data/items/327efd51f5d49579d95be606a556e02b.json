  "description": "<p>My guest for tonight is from Washington State who has been having a lot of strange things going on around his property. He never once thought Sasquatch until he stumbled across it by accident. He was within several feet of the creature and he describes it as a gray color and very large. The face has been imprinted in his brain. He talks about the strange things going on around his property and a discussion he had with one of his neighbors. It is interesting to note that the previous renter like to shoot at anything that moved in the woods. The landlord and the neighbor said that the previous renter like to take pop shots into the woods from his back deck until one day he just left in a panic. The landlord had to fix up the property because there was damage inside and out of the home. Inside of the home looked like someone very tall smashed his fist into the ceiling.</p>",
