  "description": "<p>We have another great guest to bring you on <em>Off The Podium </em>today as we speak to Australian swimming legend Giaan Rooney about her amazing career and Olympic experiences! We find out from Giaan just how she was able to crack the Australian Swim team after only a few years of committing to the sport, and just how that then turned into winning a Commonwealth Games Gold Medal at the age of 15. We also find out just what it was like to debut at an Olympic Games in front of her home crowd, and why she always relished performing under high pressure. Added to this we learn just what moment of her career made her dad more proud than winning an Olympic Gold Medal and finding out just why her ice skating career didn’t quite take off after her retirement. It’s an amazing chat that no Olympic fan can miss!</p>",
