  "description": "April Smith sounds like an artist out of time: Her massive voice seems particularly well suited to the pop sounds of the '30s and '40s, when brassy belters reigned. Funded through $13,000 in donations from fans, Smith's recent album with her band The Great Picture Show, 'Songs for a Sinking Ship,' is a buoyant collection of quirky, charming songs. Here, Smith and her band perform live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
