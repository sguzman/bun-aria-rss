  "description": "How do the media make race? This question is at the heart of Race and the Cultural Industries (Polity, 2018), the new book by Anamik Saha, Lecturer in Media, Communications and Promotion at Goldsmiths, University of London. The book sits between critical race theory and the political economy of culture, proving to be an astute and valuable contribution to a field that, as yet, has yet to find a definitive take on the question of race and the cultural industries. The book is filled with examples from media, including news rooms, publishing, music, theatre and film, as well as rich and detailed theoretical engagements with scholarship accounting for the often hidden structures that give us a culture dominated by the norms of whiteness. It is not only essential reading for media studies scholars, but also is important for anyone interested in contemporary culture.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
