  "title": "71 - Stalin: Russia's Ruthless Man of Steel",
  "description": "<p>Joseph Stalin. Icon of the 20th century. Personification of Soviet might. Catalyst of the Cold War. Hero to some, monster to many. The Man of Steel who brought the Soviet Union to the world stage and helped end WWII while simultaneously terrorizing his own people (including Chikatilo!) and bringing his fellow communists to their knees. What was previously viewed as a backwards country, quickly rose to a world superpower under his determined, sociopathic drive. The numbers vary wildly, mostly due to propaganda and secrecy, but estimates range from a conservative 3 million deaths to a terrifying 60 million murders under his long, horrific reign. And today, we dig into his life, beliefs, accomplishments, crimes and more, on a cold-blooded, communistic edition of Timesuck.</p>\n<p>You can now <strong>signup to become a Space Lizard!!!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast\">https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast</a> .
