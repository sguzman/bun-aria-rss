  "description": "Hello and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today I'm joined by longtime friend - Marin Katusa, CEO & founder of Katusa Research. For any new listeners out there, I often bring Marin on the show as he is, hands-down, the most connected person in the mining industry. To start off the interview, Marin discusses the current states of gold, uranium and other resource sectors. As every investor should know, the dollar almost always moves inversely with the price of gold. For this reason, gold investments are used as a \"safe haven\" for investors around the globe. When markets become volatile and fears arise, gold is usually your best hedge. In the event of market downturns, gold prices surge... limiting your losses. Again... the dollar/gold inverse relationship has been the common rule of thumb for as long as I can remember... Marin claims, however, that 2017 will be a break for this historical pattern.  And gives us a closer look as to why... Switching gears, we then talk about the geopolitical environment of one of the biggest trends today - Uranium. Through this analysis, Marin explains a huge angle of the Russia/ Trump story that nobody else is talking about... As a result, he shares with us one of the biggest secrets behind investing in Uranium this year. And tells listeners exactly where to avoid all Uranium investments. Then, the big announcement... Marin introduces listeners to another private placement opportunity. Listen up as this is your chance to invest with some of the greatest investors in the world. Marin will break down all the details. And give listeners everything they need to know about his next long-term commitment.",
