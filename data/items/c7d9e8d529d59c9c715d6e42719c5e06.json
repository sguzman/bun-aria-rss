  "description": "<p>Wynn who is Native American and lives in western Montana describes many encounters they had with what they call the \"Hairy Man\" on the reservation including a savage attack on a tribal member. Wynn writes \"I live on a reservation and the population of Native American to White/other is about 50/50. My father is a tribal member and my mother is not. I am therefore a white descendant and have grown up experiencing both sides of the 'culture' so to speak. I have spent time in the rough neighborhoods and at white owned ranches and farms. Both whites and indians have stories that they rarely tell..\" We will also have a few other guests to share their own Sasquatch encounters.</p>",
