  "description": "<p>Taylor's theorem (and its variants) is widely used in several areas of\nmathematical analysis, including numerical analysis, functional analysis, and\npartial differential equations. This article explains how Taylor's theorem in\nits most general form can be proved simply as an immediate consequence of the\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTOC). The proof shows the deep connection\nbetween the Taylor expansion and fixed-point iteration, which is a foundational\nconcept in numerical and functional analysis. One elegant variant of the proof\nalso demonstrates the use of combinatorics and symmetry in proofs in\nmathematical analysis. Since the proof emphasizes concepts and techniques that\nare widely used in current science and industry, it can be a valuable addition\nto the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.\n</p>",
