  "description": "In today's podcast we hear that more nation-states have acquired and are using cyber capabilities. North Korea's SiliVaccine anti-virus product appears to have pirated an old version of Trend Micro's scan engine. Despite warnings of credential stuffing, people still reuse passwords. GravityRAT now takes its victims' temperature. Many firms remain unprepared for GDPR. Questions arise about possible overpreparation by two of the biggest companies out there. And some dimwit has hacked a highway sign in Arizona. (Congratulations, knucklehead.) Justin Harvey from Accenture on the uptick in credential harvesting they’re seeing. Guest is Piero DePaoli from Service Now with results from their recently published security report.",
