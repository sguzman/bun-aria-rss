  "title": "502 - Alex from Caoba Farms (Sustainable Farmer/Restaurant Owner)",
  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex owns and runs <a href=\"https://www.caobafarms.com/\">Caoba Farms</a>, just outside of Antigua, Guatemala. It's a Farm-to-Table restaurant where the tables are literally ON the farm. Best food I had in my two months in Guatemala, hands down. We talked about how he got started (growing weed in CA, then selling lettuce to restaurants back in Guatemala), why Alex loves to experiment and learn about nurturing plants and animals, and why this knowledge is so important to share. I really enjoyed hanging with this guy.</span></p> <p>Here's the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/03/paging-dr-orwell-american-medical-association-takes-politics-language/\"> article</a> I discussed in the intro.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/caobafarms/\">Caoba Farms</a> on Insta.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range;</a> \"Mistica,\" by Orishas; \"Smoke Alarm,\" by <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>. </span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
