  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the country is now experiencing massive propaganda from the White House to sway public opinion on what President Biden is doing in Afghanistan - the greatest surrender in American History. Biden decided how he'd withdraw from Afghanistan against the advice of the generals. It is Biden that capitulated to the Taliban on the August 31st deadline. It was Biden that decided to end air support and human intelligence support for the Afghan soldiers on the ground. Yet, Washington Democrats all voted for a radical $3.5 trillion \"reconciliation\" bill that makes it easier for illegal aliens to apply for chain migration, while thousands of Americans are stuck in Afghanistan behind Taliban lines. Once the final American troops leave Afghanistan, Americans will likely see a slaughter like it hasn't been seen since Cambodia. Biden's withdrawal is indefensible and weakens America. What they are describing as the biggest airlift in history will always be remembered as the greatest surrender in American history. Then, Rep. Michael Waltz, a retired Army Ranger Green Beret, calls in and points out that enemies will not be nice in the face of weakness, he reflected on his experiences across the table from the Taliban and how they'd only respond to strength and resolve. Waltz criticized Democrats for pushing their social infrastructure bill to take over the government and education system with indoctrinated students.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
