Argentina has plantings of the grape, California now barely any, so Chile is the epicenter of the grape, where it is thought of as the locals’ grape – something low quality and common that has been around forever but has never made more than cheap, bulk wine or wine for local consumption.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/50356109033_e683e03025_w.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"255\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">País (a.k.a., Criolla Chica or Mission), \"<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/55246793@N04/50356109033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mission Grapes</a>\" by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/55246793@N04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hey Fritters</a> is licensed under <a href= \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=openverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>But in 2007, the 200+ year old vines caught the attention of Europeans who were making wine in Chile and they began experimenting.
