  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Sen. Kamala Harris is the first woman of color ever nominated to run for Vice President, however, it's her own party, the Democrat Party that rejected her before they even cast their very first vote in the primary. Congressman James Clyburn and the Democrat Party chose Joe Biden over Harris and will now enlist her to be the Democrats' very own Spiro Agnew. Then, the press is no longer free and undermines the republic. Reporters that prefer to be analysts are exactly the problem America faces; they give you their opinions disguised as facts. Later, civil society has collapsed in many American big cities. Now it's the law of the streets that reigns. The looting in Chicago has reached new heights with the Mayor, Jesse Jackson, and fathers condemning the criminality of it. Yet, one Black Lives Matter (BLM) protester said looting was okay because it was a form of reparations. Afterward, the Associated Press is reporting that the death toll resulting from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's executive order forcing nursing homes to accept patients that tested positive for China's COVID-19 virus is \"cloaked in secrecy.\" The reporting reveals that the death toll only includes patients that died in the nursing home, not those that were infected in nursing homes and transferred to hospital ICUs. Oddly, New York is reporting that only 20% of its death were nursing home related while neighboring states are reporting that north of 44% of their states' deaths came from nursing homes.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
