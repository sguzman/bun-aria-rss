  "description": "<p>We’re back with another episode in our Anatomy of a Pandemic series on COVID-19. This time, our subject matter is the one everyone has been waiting for: vaccines. In this episode, with the help of two amazing guests, we attempt to answer all of your burning questions about the new vaccines for the virus that causes COVID-19. We walk you through the ins and outs of the technology behind these vaccines, the safety and regulation steps required for their approval, and some of the logistical challenges involved in their distribution. For this info-packed episode, we were so fortunate to be joined by Dr. Maria Sundaram (interview recorded Dec 14, 2020), postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases and fellow at ICES and Dr. Orin Levine (interview recorded Nov 24, 2020), Director of Vaccine Delivery at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As always, we wrap up the episode by discussing the top five things we learned from our experts. If at the end of this interview, your curiosity about vaccines is not quite satisfied, check out the <a href=\"https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker</a> website, which is an incredible resource for pretty much anything you could ever want to know about these vaccines.</p><p>To help you get a better idea of the topics covered in this episode, we’ve listed the questions below:</p><ol><li>Can you break down what the three potentially successful COVID-19 vaccines are and how each of them work?</li><li>What are in these vaccines? What are the ingredients and what do they do?</li><li>There has been some misunderstanding that these vaccines have the potential to give you COVID-19. Can you explain why that isn’t possible?</li><li>Why are people being advised to wear a mask even after getting vaccinated?</li><li>What does the timeline look like for these vaccines until we can go to the doctor or pharmacy and get one?</li><li>Is it a valid concern that this vaccine was developed so rapidly?
