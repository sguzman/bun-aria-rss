  "description": "When it comes to mental toughness, discipline, and being hardcore like no other, very few people can stand with absolute confidence. By now, you’ve realized how hard life is. Maybe your future didn’t work out the way you and your family expected. Maybe you’re convinced the world you grew up in is hostile, dark and heartless towards someone like you. <br /><br />Living with a victim mindset isn’t going to change your situation. Learning how to meet yourself where you are and stare at your inadequacies with total and radical honesty may be the most difficult thing you ever do, but perhaps it’s the only way out of the messed up life you’re living now.<br /><br />David Goggins, former Navy Seal, ultra marathon runner, athlete and total badass knows what it takes to build a level of mental toughness very few people truly know about. His radical approach to building himself from an overweight “nobody” to one of the toughest people alive makes many people uncomfortable, but inspires the heck out of many more.
