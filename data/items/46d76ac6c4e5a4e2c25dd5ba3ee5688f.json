  "description": "<p>Charlamagne Tha God (<i>The Breakfast Club</i> radio show, Comedy Central’s <i>Hell of a Week</i>, bestselling author, philanthropist) discusses his journey to discovering his true self apart from his famous radio persona, how CBT therapy taught him to unlearn, and his positive and frightening encounters with the spirit realm. He opens up about his history with panic attacks, the vigilance he developed while selling drugs, and how anxiety can sometimes be his superpower. Charlamagne details growing up Jehovah’s Witness, why he believes God is a woman, and the origins of his dark sense of humor. He explains why he uses his authentic, unapologetic voice to touch on touchy subjects especially around mental health gaps in the Black community, including the intergenerational trauma and institutional racism that can prevent minorities from seeking support. Mayim and Charlamagne consider anxiety around returning to our hometowns and bond over their love for Marvel comics and Judy Blume books.</p><p>Mental Wealth Alliance: <a href=\"https://www.mentalwealthalliance.com/\">https://www.mentalwealthalliance.com/</a></p><p>Charlamagne Tha God's Books: <a href=\"https://www.cthagodworld.com/books\">https://www.cthagodworld.com/books</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
