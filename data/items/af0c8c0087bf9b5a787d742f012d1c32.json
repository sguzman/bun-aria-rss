  "description": "<div>When the Glasgow climate jamboree ended after two weeks, COP26 President Alok Sharma broke down in tears and seemed to apologise for his failure to get countries like China and India on side. But now that the dust has settled from Glasgow's COP26 summit, but how will this one be remembered? There were protestors, no shows from state leaders and new commitments were made whilst backroom wrangling had mixed results.<br>\n<br>\nWhat are the key factors that make these summits a success? Given the mammoth task ahead of the countries that have committed to tacking climate change, is it realistic to expect real change?<br>\n<br>\nIn this podcast, Cindy Yu is joined by seasoned professionals in climate change and sustainability. Harriet Lamb, CBE and CEO of Ashden which is an organisation that supports and promotes sustainable energy enterprises. Emily Thornberry MP who is shadow attorney general but was Labour's shadow international trade secretary at the time of recording this podcast. Finally, Simone Rossi, who is the CEO of EDF Energy.<br>\n<br>\nThis podcast is kindly sponsored by EDF Energy.</div>\n",
