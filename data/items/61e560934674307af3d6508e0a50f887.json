[That interview is now live on the Patreon feed.](https://www.patreon.com/posts/21993766)We chatted about how he made the film, how he tracked down the victims and won their trust, how he learned about the tower shooting as kid and why is stuck with him for decades before he finally made the film, and how it was to tell the story of the shooting--the first-ever mass school shooting--as the story had been something of a state secret for nearly 50 years. We play a 3-minute clip of the interview at the end of the episode. \n\nWe wanted to rebroadcast this episode today so you could listen before listening to the interview with Keith! [So jump on over to the patreon feed and check it out!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/21993766)\n\nYou guys, THIS EPISODE IS ALSO WHERE THE HERO BELL MAKES IT'S BEAUTIFUL DEBUT!\n\nHere's the original description of the episode:  \nOn August 1, 1966, a sniper rode the elevator to the top floor of the iconic University of Texas Tower and opened fire, holding the campus hostage for 96 minutes in what was a previously unimaginable event. Based entirely on first person testimonies from witnesses, heroes, and survivors, TOWER combines archival footage with rotoscopic animation to tell the story of that day. The film highlights the fear, confusion, and visceral realities that changed the lives of those present, and the rest of us, forever - a day when the worst in one man brought out the best in so many others.",
