  "description": "<p>“I decided to give myself the license to fail, and to write across gender, to write in the voice of a midwife's daughter. And if the book isn't working, fine, we'll write it from the perspective of the midwife's husband, from some other male character. But I loved it. It was so emancipating to not be me, to not be (at the time) this 30-something dude. And I loved it. And I think, my best books, my best characters, whether it's first person or third person, are women.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Bestselling author and all-around charmer Chris Bohjalian has written 23 books, including our May 2021 B&N Book Club pick <em>Hour of the Witch</em>, <em>The Flight Attendant</em>—now a hit HBO series—and his latest, <em>The Lioness</em>. Chris joins us on the show to talk about his love of bookstores, not writing the same story twice, researching and asking questions and learning stories, letting his characters guide the plot and going back to the first sentence, geography as a character, and so much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer. And we end this episode with a TBR Topoff with Marc and Becky riffing on their favorite Bohjalian novels.</p> <p> </p> <p>Featured Books:</p> <p><em>Water Witches</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>Midwives</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Red Lotus</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Sandcastle Girls</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>Hour of the Witch</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Lioness</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Flight Attendant</em> by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Night Strangers </em>by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Double Bind </em>by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>The Light in the Ruins </em>by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>Skeletons at the Feast </em>by Chris Bohjalian</p> <p><em>Our Country Friends</em> by Gary Shteyngart</p> <p><em>Wish You Were Here</em> by Jodi Picoult</p> <p> </p> <p>Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang.
