  "description": "The quarterback carousel continues in the NFL. A day after Andy Dalton landed with the Bears, the QB he's replacing, Mitchell Trubisky, is headed to the Bills. And you know what, Mitch is probably a pretty elite backup. On this episode, Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech break down the notable news of the day, pick some destinations for the top unsigned players and finish with their winners and losers. The Lions and Rams finally announced the Matthew Stafford for Jared Goff trade after a mysterious delay and the Raiders continued to make puzzling decisions. Elsewhere, Will Fuller is now a Dolphin, Curtis Samuel is a WFT and Patrick Peterson is a Viking. However, Kenny Golladay and JuJu Smith-Schuster remained unsigned and our guys pick which teams would fit them best. Getting away from free agency for a moment, Breech breaks down the NFL's new TV deal that was announced Thursday afternoon. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
