  "description": "While Congress holds hearings questioning the Secretary of State about the conduct of America's exit from Afghanistan, it probably should also turn its attention to drawing the lessons of the 20 years of warfare, sacrifice and frustration that proceeded that exit. What might those lessons be? And what might come next for the Biden foreign policy team? We discuss with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University School of Law and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Join us (if only to hear Kori declare what Kori would do if she had a nuclear weapon). \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
