  "description": "The reason we wanted to do this episode is because celebrity spaces give us this great courage to go bold. In the early days when we were doing presentations, we just were trying to get people to do a colored kitchen because everyone wanted a white kitchen, and many still do, so we would always go to this classic, Cameron Diaz. She had the green kitchen that was always easy to reference back and suggest to people what they should do. We gather a lot of inspiration from various celebrities’ homes and talk about many of those today. <br /><br />The Cameron Diaz kitchen 4:15<br />Windsor Smith, big kitchen 7:28<br />Gwyneth Paltrow’s new home 10:37<br />Nancy Meyer film sets 15:06<br />Dianne Keaton 17:20<br />Lenny Kravitz 19:14<br />Seeing white everywhere, Kim Kardashian 23:00<br /><br />“People are always asking “How do I get photography in my home?” and I’ve never seen it done better than in [Lenny Kravitz’] home because he’s taking you through, and he’s super relaxed. He has slung furniture, it’s leather worn like his cool boots and his vests and everything, but you see these crisp, graphic images all over the walls, and they’re massive, and they’re black and white, up close, and he talks about how they’re of his mother and his aunt, they just look so editorial, but they’re so personal and I’m like ‘What a beautiful statement to have your family just surrounding you, but in such an artistic way.’” 19:54 <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
