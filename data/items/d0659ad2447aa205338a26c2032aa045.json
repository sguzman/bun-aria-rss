  "description": "A follow up to Weir’s bestseller The Martian, Artemis follows the journey of the main character Jazz as she tries to find her place in the first city on the moon. Growing up in Artemis she found herself getting into trouble from an early age, smuggling and dealing with crooks. The opportunity to make more presented itself to Jazz as she couldn't resist. The author does an impressive job in detailing the specifics of the city engaging the reader throughout the story. Jazz's internal conflict with her past plays itself out during the story, but new characters emerge making this impossible for her. The story is engaging and the imagery descriptive, however, I felt that the ending left little to the imagination as it felt too predictable. For anyone who likes Sci-Fi I advise that they read this, but for casual readers, I suggest passing on it. \n\nOMBRFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/oneminuteboo...\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/oneminutebo...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aun_abdi\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/oneminutebookr...\nYouTube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lp...\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/2713...\nSnapchat:https://www.snapchat.com/add/aunabdi\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/o...\nWebsite: https://www.oneminutebooks.org\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
