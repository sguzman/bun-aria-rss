  "title": "Willie Thought Korie Was Growing an Adam's Apple!",
  "description": "Korie Robertson says Willie was once absolutely sure she was growing an Adam's apple — and didn't tell her! She also divulges Willie's critical fishing mistakes and reveals how long John-David actually wet the bed. What do you like eating now that you didn't when you were younger? Martin talks about changing taste buds and they all agree on one thing: blue cheese is terrible. Si is still bitter at the squirrels who ate all his treasured strawberries one summer, plus that time his weenie dog, Merlin, beat him to his garden tomato. Martin doesn't miss the smell of wilted salad and hot vinegar dressing in his grandma's house. And Si describes his adventure in a mustard field in Germany that he — surprisingly — remembers quite well. \n\nhttps://american-giant.com — Get 20% off with code DUCK at checkout!\n\nhttps://www.stamps.com — Get a 4-week free trial + free postage + a digital scale with promo code DUCK\n\nhttps://OmegaXL.com/DUCK — Buy one bottle and get the second bottle FREE!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
