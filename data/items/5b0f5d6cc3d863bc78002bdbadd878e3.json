  "description": "Bid on our Draft-A-Thon items right now to benefit St. Jude! http://cbssports.com/ebay\nFollow the latest ADP: https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/draft/averages/\nFirst you'll hear the story of Jamey's harrowing encounter with a spider! Then we'll give you your news and notes and the big upside plays in each round beginning with Round 3 (10:30). Does J.K. Dobbins have that league-winning upside? Does Allen Robinson? What is David Montgomery's potential (14:25) and should he be drafted in Round 2? In Round 4 (19:40) we've got CeeDee Lamb and a couple of other potential stud WRs, but do we see any of the RBs as league winners? ... Round 5 (24:45) is another strong WR round and Tyler Lockett could win you your league. But so could Kyle Pitts and Mark Andrews! Then we get to Round 6 (33:00) which is perhaps the most interesting round of the draft. It's loaded with talent but maybe short on opportunity, which reminds us that league winners don't necessarily have to be great in Week 1. We talk Steelers and Bengals WRs among others ... On to Round 7 (42:00) which is where you may draft Michael Thomas or Jerry Jeudy, Round 8 (46:40) with Jalen Hurts and his immense upside and then the rest of the league winners you need to know in the later rounds (51:00) ...
