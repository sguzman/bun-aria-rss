  "description": "<p class=\"\">We’re back to a more recent book that taught Sarah about contemporary romance, Victoria Dahl’s Taking the Heat. Use headphones for this one, because we’re talking about the best BJs in romance, the power of a great sex scene, and how we want you all to be in a sex pantheon. We’re also talking about flawed characters, true cinnamon rolls, and why Victoria Dahl is a fricken great author.</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast, please!</p><p class=\"\">In two weeks, we’re reading <a href=\"https://sandrabrown.net/booklist/classic-romance/\">Sandra Brown</a>! Jen and Sarah will be reading <em>Texas! Chase</em>, but it’s dealers’ choice! Pick your favorite old Sandra Brown or ask us for a rec on Twitter or Instagram! Maybe you want <em>That Rana Look</em>? Or <em>Slow Heat in Heaven</em>? Or <em>French Silk</em>? You can find them wherever books are sold (but the Texas! series isn’t in ebook format yet, sadly) — and don’t forget your favorite indie!</p><p class=\"\">Also, if you love the music in this or any of our episodes, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6QWZy7vo4Dw9eS733PJj1U?si=W1voWFsHS5uPHHkw0WCHMw\">check out our Spotify playlist</a>, which includes it all!</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">Sure, Sarah's new computer makes her feel like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gj4hpKGPHA0\">Lightning McQueen</a>, but it's her new version of <a href=\"https://thewritelife.com/scrivener-review/\">Scrivener</a> that is the most exciting thing.</p><p class=\"\">Jen isn't the only one who likes <a href=\"https://www.thetalko.com/starburst-jelly-bean-flavors-ranked/\">Starburst jelly beans</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Sarah has planner envy. We both love <a href=\"https://blackwing602.com/\">Blackwing pencils.</a> If you also love Blackwing pencils, we highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spMaP-_Cq_8\">this video</a> by comedian David Rees on Artisinal Pencil Sharpening. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3a3fco8\">There's also a book</a>! We don't quite understand <a href=\"https://www.coupons.com/thegoodstuff/what-is-washi-tape/\">washi tape</a>, but we're happy for those who love it. If you want to talk planners, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nishawrites\">Nisha Sharma</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kateclayborn\">Kate Clayborn</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tlivesay\">Tracey Livesay</a> are your people.</p><p class=\"\">RIP <a href=\"https://www.bookexpoamerica.com/home/\">BEA</a> 2020, we look forward to 2021.</p><p class=\"\">Jen is addicted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/coronavirus-jigsaw-puzzles.html\">jigsaw puzzles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/03/24/americans-are-stocking-up-dry-goods-toilet-paper-puzzles/\">just like</a> <a href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/04/08/puzzle-warehouse-reports-sales-are-up-2000-from-this-time-last-year/\">everyone else</a> in the world.</p><p class=\"\">The city junk problem is actually <a href=\"https://cheapist.blog/Free-stuff-curb\">pretty great</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Victoria Dahl also writes as <a href=\"https://victoriahelenstone.com/about/\">Victoria Helen Stone</a>. Jen rediscovered contemporary romance with the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VsWrVZ\">Tumble Creek series</a>, and also the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xjtxQ5\">Fast Track series</a> by Erin McCarthy.</p><p class=\"\">Gabe's job was to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/03/ebooks.technology\">eBooks</a> to the library. <a href=\"https://digitalpublishing101.com/digital-publishing-101/digital-publishing-basics/a-very-short-history/\">We've come a long way, baby</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.jacksonwy.gov/\">Jackson, Wyoming</a> is the setting of this book, and apparently there's a lot to do there -- like <a href=\"https://www.jacksonhole.com/\">skiing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jacksonholewy.com/blog/climbing-in-jackson-hole/\">rock climbing</a>. It's all outdoorsy, so we can't really speak to it.</p><p class=\"\">The <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/small-town-romance\">big city to small town trope</a> is a cornerstone of romance.

In case you're into that sort of thing.</p><p class=\"\">Watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zuqUB_-RuZ0\">Ending of Crocodile Dundee</a> if you've never had the pleasure.</p><p class=\"\">If you are looking to try a new podcast app, we both love <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>.

And everyone's is <a href=\"http://lovessweetarrow.com/index.html\">Love's Sweet Arrow</a> or <a href=\"https://www.therippedbodicela.com/\">The Ripped Bodice</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Next time, it's choose your own <a href=\"https://sandrabrown.net/\">Sandra Brown</a> adventure. We'll both read Texas! Chase, which believe it or not isn't on Kindle, but <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RDIVOe\">it is on audio</a>! We'll also post a thread of some other Sandra Brown favorites. And if straight thriller is your thing, try <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VpIFTU\">OutFox</a>, which is the one Sarah's mom enjoyed.</p>",
