  "description": "In this episode we adopt a view on human spiritual formation and transport it over to spiritual maturity in the Christian Faith.  This observation became a critical tool that has helped me when speaking to audiences publicly and among groups.  Most importantly, wherever you find yourself on this spectrum, the goal for us is to hold grace across all types.  We'd really love you're thoughts on this episode, where you think you might be in these phases, and if this tool was helpful. Comment below (On Soundcloud) or on our Facebook page!\n\nRef. M.
