  "description": "<p>Mark Twain authored some of the most beloved stories in American literature. Everyone knows the story of Tom Sawyer, his buddy Huck Finn and about whitewashing wood fences. Not many people know the details of the life of Mark Twain though. Twain's life was one of literary genius, but it was also one of financial ruin and immense pain when it came to his family life. The Twain's owned a home in Hartford, Connecticut and Twain claimed that the years that he and his family lived in the Hartford home were the happiest years of their life. They would eventually move from the home, but did their spirits actually leave the home? Twain was a lifelong skeptic, but is he now a true believer as his spirit continues to roam on this side of the veil? Moment in Oddity features the Spider-tailed Horned Viper and This Day in History features the eruption of the Huaynaputina Volcano.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-29-life-and-afterlife-of.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-29-life-and-afterlife-of.html</a></p>",
