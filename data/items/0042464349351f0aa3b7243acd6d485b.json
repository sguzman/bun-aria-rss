  "description": "This fall, a number of auteurs are directing major blockbusters: Cary Joji Fukunaga took on the James Bond movie <em>No Time To Die; </em>Chloe Zhao joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe with <em>Eternals; </em>and Denis Villeneuve hopes to launch a film franchise with <em>Dune</em>.
