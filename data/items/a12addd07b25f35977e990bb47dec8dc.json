  "description": "Today, two books from indigenous authors who make a similar, wry argument: it's a miracle there are any Indigenous people in the Americas alive at all. First, Stephen Graham Jones talks about his horror novel <em>The Only Good Indians</em>, a reworking of an old, hostile phrase attributed to Theodore Roosevelt; plus the literary reasons why he chose to make it a horror story. Then, author Lisa Bird-Wilson talks about how her personal experience influenced her new book, <em>Probably Ruby</em>, a novel that follows the legacy of forced Indigenous adoption and residential schools in Canada.
