  "description": "<div>True Crime Tuesday presents The Best New True Crime Stories: Unsolved Crimes & Mysteries w/ Mitzi Szereto!<br>\n<br>\nCrimes are meant to be solved. But what happens when they’re not? For the individuals involved—from the victims and their families to police investigators—this is the most frustrating part of all. For them there’s no resolution, no justice, no tidy boxes in which to pack away all the bits and pieces of a puzzle that finally links together. Instead, they are only left with questions that may never get answered.<strong><br>\n</strong><br>\nIn The Best New True Crime Stories: Unsolved Crimes & Mysteries, the sixth volume in her true crime franchise, Mitzi Szereto brings together all-new and original accounts of unsolved crimes and mysterious stories from around the world penned by writers from across the literary spectrum, from true crime and crime fiction to journalism. Readers will uncover a fascinating collection of crimes that are dark, scary, mysterious, and still waiting to be solved. Mitzi joins the show today to talk about some of these stories and their deeper meanings... <br>\n<br>\nCheck out Mitzi's website here... <a href=\"https://mitziszereto.com/\">https://mitziszereto.com/</a><br>\n<br>\nGet \"The Best New True Crime Stories: Unsolved Crimes & Mysteries\" here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NrJPZB\">https://amzn.to/3NrJPZB</a><br>\n<br>\nPLUS DUMB CRIMES AND STUPID CRIMINALS!!<br>\n<br>\nFind all of the archives of True Crime Tuesday from the Patreon days of 2017-2021, go to our new website, <a href=\"https://www.officialtruecrimetuesday.com/\">https://www.officialtruecrimetuesday.com/</a>  and check out what you have missed! <em><br>\n</em><br>\n#crime #truecrime #truecrimepodcasts #truecrimetuesday #thebestnewtruecrimestories #unsolvedcrimesandmysteries #mitziszereto #appalachiantrail  #SaintCloudMinnesota  #murderontheappalachiantrail  #jeanspangler #BlackDahlia  #valleyofhell #olivebranson #richardbranson #LesBaux #francoispinet #montrealexpo #montrealmuseumoffinearts #artheist #kidnapping #Italy #Vatican #popejohnpaulII #EmmanuelaOrlandi #dumbcrimesstupidcriminals #TimDennis #BeerCityBruiser #ROH #RingofHonorWrestling </div>\n",
