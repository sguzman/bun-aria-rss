  "title": "Ep. 251: How to Hire an Interior Designer with Emily Wyatt",
  "description": "We are delighted to welcome Atlanta-based interior designer Emily Wyatt, of Wyatt Designs, to the show. Emily’s designs are fresh yet classic, and her signature strength is her ability to achieve these results while working within her clients’ budgets. We get candid with Emily about all the ins and outs of hiring an interior designer in order to demystify the process. We talk about everything from costs, to timelines, to how to get started, and much more. If you’re feeling intimidated about hiring an interior designer or just want to learn more, you’ll want to tune in to our conversation with Emily.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nWhat is the first step when thinking of hiring an interior designer?\n\nWhich credentials, if any, should someone look for in an interior designer?\n\nWhich red flags to look out for.\n\nWhy individual chemistry is so important when matching with a designer.\n\nWhy there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to hiring a designer.\n\nWhy it’s crucial to define your own needs before you begin the process of working with a designer.\n\nCommunication is a two-way street between designer and client, and it’s so important!\n\nWhat are some general timelines after meeting with a designer?\n\nDoes a client need to have their style defined before getting started?\n\nSo…how much does it cost?!\n\nWhat is a realistic budget for furnishings?\n\nAre there different payment options or levels of service?\n\nWhat to consider during the installation process.\n\nWhat happens when clients are unhappy with their choices?\n\nWhat was Emily’s favorite install thus far?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nHi Heather,\nThanks for writing again! I think for the side of the room that shares a wall with the bathroom, clothing storage is going to be your best bet. I would definitely not block the window if I were you because natural light is so important, so maybe set your sights on just a taller dresser. If it’s in the budget, I would highly recommend installing built-ins in place of where the armoire is. There’s a way to do it where it doesn’t have to be too expensive but can still look great. Also, you can customize it to meet your exact needs. In terms of nightstands, a lot will depend on user preference but if you need storage look for ones with drawers. I wouldn’t go any bigger than what you have and I’m a big fan of white nightstands. To choose the right finish I don’t think there is a wrong answer. I like to think of the finishes as a contrast to the piece. I also think you can definitely mix and match wood, but I would limit the amount that you use and think of how they play into the overall texture of the room. I love an heirloom, so the horse lamp can definitely stay along with the rug and the bench. They all really compliment each other. I am generally a fan of making the bed the focal point of the bedroom and then building out layers from there (think 3 supporting layers/pieces). You can keep your next layers on the lighter side then accent them with things like patterned drapes, bedding, chair upholstery, etc.\nWe are excited to see how the WHOLE renovation works out. Please keep us updated and send photos!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nWyatt Designs\nWyatt Designs on Instagram",
