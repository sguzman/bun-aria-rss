  "description": "Not much is known about why people experience tastes differently and why some people can detect certain tastes and not others. There also might be other tastes out there to add to the list beyond the five known ones now. In this finale to <em>Short Wave</em>'s Taste Buddies series, we're tackling the science of the five tastes, and in this episode, we look at why there is so much more research to be done. <br/><br/>Host Aaron Scott talks to <a href=\"https://monell.org/danielle-reed/\">Danielle Reed</a> from the Monell Chemical Senses Center about the controversy in taste science and about what other tastes might exist beyond sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. <br/><br/>To listen to more episodes about how we taste, check out our Taste Buddies series: <a href=\"https://n.pr/3sSOgDB\">n.pr/3sSOgDB</a><br/><br/>Email the show at <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>. <br/>",
