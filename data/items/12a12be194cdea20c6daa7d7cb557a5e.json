And he got him indeed! Glenn is one of those special people who can just make you smile and laugh whilst drinking at a bar, and make you smile bigger and laugh even harder whilst onstage. He’s performed on every continent except Antarctica. Numerous times! He’s the Beethoven of road dogs. Here are five words to describe this episode: be careful <em>when </em>you applaud.</p>",
