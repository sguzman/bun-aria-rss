  "description": "Daniel Jeremiah, Bucky Brooks and Rhett Lewis are back with a new episode. To start off, the guys react to Cam Newton's release from the Panthers and predict potential landing spots (2:06). Next, the trio discuss how general managers want to potentially move the draft back and the impact of everything going on in the world has on scouting departments (17:41). Then, the trio answer if they would be comfortable taking Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa in the top 5 of the draft, as it's tough to get a medical evaluation on him (25:38). After that, the guys look at the Panthers trading QB Kyle Allen to the Redskins and what it means for each team, while also analyzing how Panthers head coach Matt Rhule is building the team (29:54). To wrap up the show, the crew discuss if the Bucs are more or less likely to take a QB in the first round after signing Tom Brady and look at a few different draft scenarios, which involve Utah State QB Jordan Love (40:43).<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
