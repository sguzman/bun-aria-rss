  "description": "<p>We present the GPry algorithm for fast Bayesian inference of general\n(non-Gaussian) posteriors with a moderate number of parameters. GPry does not\nneed any pre-training, special hardware such as GPUs, and is intended as a\ndrop-in replacement for traditional Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inference.\nOur algorithm is based on generating a Gaussian Process surrogate model of the\nlog-posterior, aided by a Support Vector Machine classifier that excludes\nextreme or non-finite values. An active learning scheme allows us to reduce the\nnumber of required posterior evaluations by two orders of magnitude compared to\ntraditional Monte Carlo inference. Our algorithm allows for parallel\nevaluations of the posterior at optimal locations, further reducing wall-clock\ntimes. We significantly improve performance using properties of the posterior\nin our active learning scheme and for the definition of the GP prior. In\nparticular we account for the expected dynamical range of the posterior in\ndifferent dimensionalities. We test our model against a number of synthetic and\ncosmological examples. GPry outperforms traditional Monte Carlo methods when\nthe evaluation time of the likelihood (or the calculation of theoretical\nobservables) is of the order of seconds; for evaluation times of over a minute\nit can perform inference in days that would take months using traditional\nmethods. GPry is distributed as an open source Python package (pip install\ngpry) and can also be found at https://github.com/jonaselgammal/GPry.\n</p>",
