  "description": "<p>We got Christina P and Tom Segura's fill-in host Ryan Sickler again for the first part of this show this week. We start with a Tik Tok who's asking for everyone to STOP calling her Jeffrey Dahmer. Only thing is she looks A LOT like him. We get an interesting development from Tom Segura about Josh Potter in Europe. They're in Amstrerdam, so you can figure out what kind of update this was. Then we go into one of our classic lanes: Browning in public.</p> <p>Then we have Yakov Smirnoff joining Tom and Christina for the guest segment of the show. Yakov is a comedy legend who has seen every boom and bust the industry has offered. He talks about starting comedy under Soviet rule in The Ukraine and the parameters that he had to work within due to Communism. Tom and Christina also get to the bottom of Yakov's arrival in America and how he started doing comedy in the U.S. There are lots of old Comedy Store stories, plus we find out if Yakov thinks certain videos are Horrible or Hilarious!</p>\n",
