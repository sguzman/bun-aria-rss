  "description": "<p>There's almost no one who personifies glamour more than this week's guest, Alex \"Pardashian\" Pardoe, but this hairstylist works just as hard as he plays! Alex is one of the most down-to-earth persons you will ever meet but who describes himself as \"Boujee by birth, ratchet by choice\" and is definitely one of our top 5 interviews! This pre-covid jetsetter pulls back the curtain to tell us how he works (20 clients in 1 day?!?), his secret bread and butter clients, and how everything you see on the 'Gram isn't the whole story. Tune into today's episode to learn what Kim K thinks about his tattoo of her crying face emoji, his tips for running a salon and building a business, and the only service that takes you from a Toyota Corolla to a Rolls Royce in 1 salon visit!</p>",
