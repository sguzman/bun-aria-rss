It can have long-term adverse effects for both the mother and the child. Not only does it put the baby at risk for above-average birth weight, but gestational diabetes in the mother can also lead to increased risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and weight gain for the child in adulthood. It can also lead to higher rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy for the mother.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to preventing and treating gestational diabetes. They discuss the common drivers of gestational diabetes, why pre-diabetes in the mother is also a concern, and much more.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.
