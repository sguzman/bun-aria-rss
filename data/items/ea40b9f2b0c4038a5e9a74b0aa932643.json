But, most people don’t realize what kind of impact their favorite foods are having on their blood sugar, and subsequently their entire body. Feeling hungry even when you just ate, craving sweets, and dealing with acne, hormonal imbalances, and signs of aging like wrinkles are just a few of the many symptoms of blood sugar swings. When these continue to go unchecked more severe dysfunctions can occur.&nbsp;On today’s episode, I talk to Jessie Inchauspé, also known as the “Glucose Goddess,” all about her tried-and-true hacks for balancing blood sugar and increasing insulin sensitivity. </p><br><p>Jessie holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from King's College London and a master’s degree in biochemistry from Georgetown University. Her work at a genetic analysis start-up in Silicon Valley made her realize that, as the key to good health, food habits beat genetics.
