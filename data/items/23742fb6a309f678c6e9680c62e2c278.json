  "title": "60 - Man of War: Chesty Puller",
  "description": "<p>The most highly decorated Marine in the history of the Corps, Lewis \"Chesty\" Puller won five Navy Crosses, a Purple Heart, a Silver Star, the Army Distinguished Service Cross, five Presidential Unit Citations, and more. He fought for the Marines in Haiti. He fought again in Nicaragua. And then again in WWII. And once more in Korea. And then, at nearly 70 years old, he tried to fight in Vietnam! He was a fearless soldier, a courageous and talented leader, a loving father, a devoted husband, and just one Hell of an American.
