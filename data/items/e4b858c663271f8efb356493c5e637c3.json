  "description": "<p>Ben is a war reporter and has worked in some of the most dangerous places in the world. He has balls of steel and talks about what it takes to do that kind of work with Rogan extensively. Their conversation definitely made me appreciate the fact that even though sometimes I donâ€™t love my job at least no one is ever shooting at me.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p><a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</a></p>\n",
