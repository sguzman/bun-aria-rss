  "description": "<p>This is one of those feel-good episodes that will expand your heart. In it I sit with prolific writer Mark Nepo (author of the Book of Awakening) to discuss how we can lead with our intuition, rather than our fear. He shares his wisdom for those seeking to live their purpose and incredible stories to drive home spiritual stories. Mark’s writing was extremely helpful for me when I was 23-year-old living in Bali and I was so excited to pull out my 7-year-old journal to ask him about some of the quotes I wrote of his years ago.
