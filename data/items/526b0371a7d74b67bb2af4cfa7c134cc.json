  "description": "<p>This week we welcome Richard Waitas of <a href=\"http://www.magnaflow.com/\">Magnaflow</a> exhaust. Richard has an extensive background in engineering and worked his way up through the Magnaflow organization. With a lot of fabrication, development, testing and design time under his belt Richard debunked a lot of the myths behind exhaust designs. In addition we cover some concepts in tuning air fuel mixes, usage of nitrous oxide and Richard's mobile workshop. Meanwhile Matt gives us an update on his Mustang, we talk a little about the new Focus RS, my Fiesta ST and a multitude of other topics.</p>\n",
