  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP works at a bike shop that is heavily staffed by women. An incredibly sexist man comes in to buy a bicycle, and he snubs OP because he wants a male employee. OP happily gets him a different employee -- another woman. This upsets the customer even more, so he asks to speak to the manager. Would you like to guess the gender of the manager? Yep -- a woman! The sexist customer was completely embarrassed in front of the whole store.</p>\n",
