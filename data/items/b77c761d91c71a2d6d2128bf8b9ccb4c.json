  "description": "<p>r/Pettyrevenge In today's episode, OP encounters an incredibly entitled Karen who thinks that the entire universe revolves around her, so she's disrespectful of service workers and doesn't care about other shoppers' time. OP gets an opportunity to flip the tables on Karen, so she embraces her inner entitlement and forces the Karen to wait and wait and wait in line behind her. Revenge is petty, but sweet!
