  "title": "Ep. 920 - Biden Says You Can Now Identify As Gender 'X' On Your Passport",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in honor of “trans day of visibility,” the Biden Administration has made a number of policy changes, including allowing you to list yourself as the gender of “x” on your passport. How exactly is that going to work? Also, backlash grows against Disney’s self-professed gay agenda, as we at the Daily Wire announce our response to leftism in children’s entertainment. And a lesbian couple sues a fertility clinic for giving them a boy instead of a girl. The experience of giving birth to a boy was, they say, like “rape.” In our Daily Cancellation, people with PhDs complain about being marginalized when people fail to address them as doctors. You know they have to get canceled for that. \n\nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author. Reserve your copy of my new book here: https://utm.io/ud1Cb \n\nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
