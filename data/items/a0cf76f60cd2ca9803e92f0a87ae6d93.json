  "description": "<p>Episode 200 is finally here!! Can you even imagine a world in which Christine doesn't know Em is a clown?! Or that Em would be surprised that a member of Christine's family set a bear loose in town? </p><p>We're taking quite a few walks down memory lane today and we've got some fun, throwback announcements to go with it! We just released a kick ass, limited edition ATWWD comic book that brings our very first episode to life! We also released vintage merch that's lived with us in all our recording studios (and Em screen printed with their very own hands). Em also made us all a digital escape room so we can celebrate together from afar. And we've got some surprise guest appearances from Lemon (who is safe and sound and quarantining with Em) and the story of a newly blossoming, real life friendship with Farmer Bob. </p><p>For our stories today we decided to keep with the throwback theme and revisit the topics from our first episode: The Winchester Mystery House and Jonestown! We had a blast giving these OG topics a fresh coat of paint with our current research methods. We even discovered some new details we missed the first time around, like the Winchester Mystery House is even more of a fire hazard than we previously thought and Jim Jones just might have been the only straight person in the entire world. </p><p>Most importantly, thank you to everyone who has stuck with us on this wild ride. We can't thank you enough for helping us spiral this small idea of ours into the chaotic fever dream it's become. We couldn't do it without you! But perhaps most importantly, even after 200 episodes, you can still call us daddy and we'll sell you a monkey... and that's why we drink!</p><p>Get your copy of our brand new, kick ass comic book and vintage merch here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://atwwdmerch.com&source=gmail-imap&ust=1607803495000000&usg=AOvVaw3qcXtyFuuSdF2oikZiBCeW\" target=\"_blank\">atwwdmerch.com</a></p><p>Check out Em's digital escape room here!
