At the same time I have my gardens at the farm, the farmhouse to maintain in a okay state and a toddler to keep up with. Overwhelmed is not an exaggeration! But when you talked about making the home HQ everything fell in place.<br/>Yes we have our farm and all that, but where we are now, where we eat almost all our meals (if not at the farm with a packed lunch), where we sleep, has to be our base our HQ.
