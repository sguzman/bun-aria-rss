  "description": "<p>Kurt Metzger caught the cold. He was the latest comic to get the e-rage. It happened while I was in Scotland and he wanted to talk about it on my podcast, so as soon as I got home, we made it happen. He was called a \"rape apologist.\" They threatened to rape his girlfriend. He was misquoted and sold out as much as possible to prove a point they didn't know how to make. So he came to my apartment and we talked about it for a while. I interrupted way to much, but I just could not keep up with him. We're also joined by his still unraped girlfriend who tells me how frustrating it was to sit on the jury of an actual botched rape case. It's a weird episode. The left will probably learn nothing from it. But at least Kurt can tell his side of the story to an audience who actually listens. </p>",
