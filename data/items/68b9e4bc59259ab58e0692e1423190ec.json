I share a dark dream I had about my greatest fear, I talk about the scariest moment of my life, and the one question I wish I got asked more. We had a lot of fun- I hope you enjoy it! So get ready to know 73 new things about me on Episode 833.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nMy greatest fear (16:00)<br />\nMy secret talent (23:02)<br />\nMy most-used emoji (29:30)<br />\nWhat I would do if I weren’t doing what I do now (33:50)<br />\nMy career high point (24:00)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/833 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
