  "description": "<p>On average, the word ‘church’ appears in English bibles 115 times. However, <em>kuriakon</em>, the word from which ‘church’ derives, only appears in the original Greek text twice, and its usage has nothing to do with a place of worship. The word ‘church’ is a translation of <em>ekklesia</em>, a different Greek word meaning ‘assembly.’ In this episode, we examine the long and complex history of how the translation of how <em>ekklesia</em> was codified as ‘church’ and how this translation probably isn't correct.</p>",
