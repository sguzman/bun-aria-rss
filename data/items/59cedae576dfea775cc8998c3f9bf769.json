  "title": "368 - Philip van Wyck (Missionary/Sea Gypsies)",
  "description": "<p>Philip is a South African Christian missionary working with the Moken people (aka Sea Gypsies) on the island of Ko Phayam, in Thailand. When the tsunami in 2004 destroyed their boats, they were forced to live on land. Philip is trying to help them make the transition to a new way of life. He sees his role as striving to be the embodiment of God's love, not as trying to convince anyone to adopt his particular beliefs. </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is sponsored by</span> <a href=\"https://www.mudwtr.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mud/Wtr</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by</span> <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Basin and Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; “Life Upside Down,” by <a href=\"https://brettnewski.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brett Newski</a>; “Smoke Alarm,” by</span> <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carsie Blanton</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
