  "title": "147 - Revolutionary War",
  "description": "<p>Less than a week after the 4th of July, we Suck into the birth of the United States of America. We glance at some of the war's important battles and important figures, but, more importantly, we dig deep into the events leading up to the Revolutionary War. What went down between King George and the Founding Fathers that left colonists feeling like going to war with arguably the most powerful empire in the world was a good idea? How important was George Washington to America's eventual victory? If not for the French and Indian War two decades prior to the Revolutionary War, would the United States be part of the British Commonwealth today? We take a break from true crime and dig deep into US history, today, on Timesuck!</p>\n<p><strong>Feel the Heat preorder Link</strong>: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2WVJuax\"><strong>https://bit.ly/2WVJuax</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Donating $2600 this month: </strong>100+ Abandoned Dogs of Everglades Florida Rescue<a href=\"http://100plusabandoneddogsofevergladesflorida.org/\"><strong>http://100plusabandoneddogsofevergladesflorida.org/</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Come to my standup special taping at Crofoot in Detroit on Friday, October 18th</strong>.
