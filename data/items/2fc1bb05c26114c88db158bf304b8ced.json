A new challenge.\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nFree $15 with Code DREAMYT: http://cash.app/13+\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nMr Beast: @MrBeast \nBadBoyHalo: @BadBoyHalo \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nThis video is a different rendition of my normal challenge videos, where there are THREE hunters trying to stop me from beating Minecraft.\n\nWe're so close to 30 million subscribers! Make sure to subscribe :) also congrats to Mr Beast on 100 million!!!\n\nIn this challenge, the pot starts at 1 million dollars and it goes down $69 every 1 second. When I beat the game, the money that's left is given away to a RANDOM SUBSCRIBER! So make sure to subscribe! There's a catch though. If I don't beat the game quick enough, the money goes into the negatives, and that's how much I have to pay my 3 friends that are hunting me down!\n\nIt's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes, I might try and convince someone else to do it! \n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MrBeastHunt",
