We are rewarding those that aren't abiding by what they promised to do - and pay back their loans. What about those that have loans in other areas - will they be able to just not pay them as well? The division within the country continues as Biden does more Executive Orders that are unconstitutional as well as he doesn't even have the power to do! Also, Iran is pursuing uranium as China continues to take control over valuable minerals throughout the eastern hemisphere. Benjamin Netanyahu is warning that the new Biden Iran Nuclear deal is even worse than the first one, and is allowing Iran to get closer to a nuclear weapon. We have an incompetent, dangerous man in the Oval Office.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
