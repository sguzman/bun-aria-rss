  "description": "Almost a year ago, I left my last full-time job and decided to set on an independent path that includes data science consulting and work on my own projects. The ultimate goal is not to have to sell my time for money by generating enough passive income to live comfortably. My five main areas of focus are – in no particular order – personal branding &amp; networking, data science contracting, Bandcamp Recommender, Price Dingo, and marine conservation."
