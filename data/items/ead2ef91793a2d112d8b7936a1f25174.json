  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the reactions of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday around sports media, chat about the breaking news that Tua Tagovailoa actually does have broken weeks and will be out on a week to week basis despite initial reports that he his injury wasn't serious, if this means the rumors around the Dolphins going after Deshaun Watson will heat up again, and discuss reports that Carson Wentz is going to try to give it a go on Sunday with two sprained ankles, and how he is an absolute maniac on the football field. Joining the program for the first time, fresh off a huge bag this offseason, is Pro Bowl TE for the Baltimore Ravens, Mark Andrews. Pat and Mark discuss this weekend's Oklahoma/West Virginia game, what he loves about playing in Baltimore, what it's like playing with a guy as special as Lamar Jackson, if Jimmy's Seafood is still trying to take the team down, how big of a win it was against the Chiefs on Sunday Night Football, how he manages his diabetes and a day-to-day basis, and much more (12:41-25:51). Next, football coach for 37 years, former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano joins the program for Coach Us Up Chuck. Pat and Chuck chat about this weekend's games, decision making on third and fourth down in the redzone, how important assistant coaches are on gameday, why Bill Belichick's defense is so difficult for rookie QB's, how to make the perfect gravy for a Sunday dinner, and much more (42:54-1:11:22). Later, President of the UFC and friend of the show, Dana White joins the program to chat about UFC 266 this weekend, his new TV show on the Food Network, which matchups excite him the most this weekend and a few he's potentially looking ahead at, if the energy is different in Vegas with the Raiders now and if there are any plans to have an event in Allegiant Stadium, and why the fight business is just a mean game (1:15:08-1:33:51).
