  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Putin wing of the Republican Party, the Putin wing of the media, and those pretending to be America First cannot deny the genocide that Putin, a cold-blooded mass murderer, is waging on Ukraine - this is real Naziism. President Biden must stop being afraid of Putin's nuclear weapons and remember that we have nuclear bombs too. Russia has had nuclear weapons for 50 years and they haven't used them once, not even when they were getting beaten in Afghanistan as Reagan applied pressure to stop the Soviets. Then, how is it even conceivable that the media can claim they missed the Hunter Biden story? There was more evidence to corroborate this story than there was for any of the accusations against Trump. While AG Merrick Garland brags about his work prosecuting people for parading or trespassing near the Capitol on January 6th, he's said nothing about the Hunter Biden laptop investigation which is ongoing. Republicans must call for recusal of Garland and demand a special counsel immediately. Later, why isn't George Soros the most wanted man in the world for helping elect pro-crime progressive prosecutors? The bad guys are his constituency and that becomes a problem for the rest of us law-abiding citizens. Now, Biden wants Trump, Fox News, and dissenting citizens silenced and treated like criminals. Meanwhile, the gender obsesses Democrats that won't even define a woman are about to put a Judge that is sympathetic to the absolute worst criminals ever - child rapists. A child rapist was free to assault again because of Judge Ketanji Brown-Jackson's weak sentencing. Afterward, Rep. Madison Cawthorn made a statement that he's since had to walk back, yet his Republican colleagues are destroying him for it instead of getting him a clearer direction.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
