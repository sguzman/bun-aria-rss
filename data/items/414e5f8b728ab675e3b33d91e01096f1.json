Teigen has since apologized, but this news highlighted the disgusting ways people used to talk about young girls on the internet, and how Teigen’s online presence has never been as kind and lovable as she’d want you to believe.\nPodcast production by Daniel Schroeder and Derek John.\n﻿Support ICYMI and listen to the show with zero ads. Sign up to become a Slate Plus member for just $1 for your first month.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
