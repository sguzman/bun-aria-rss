  "description": "Bernie went from virtual unknown in the 2016 election to front-runner with the highest campaign contributions in the first quarter of the 2020 race.

Or will Bernie’s resistance to getting personal hurt him this time around? \nGuest: Slate politics writer, Jim Newell\nPodcast production by Mary Wilson, Jayson De Leon, and Anna Martin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
