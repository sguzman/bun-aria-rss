  "description": "Aleister Crowley, also known as the Great Beast, has been the subject of several biographies, some painting him as a misunderstood genius, others as a manipulative charlatan. None of them have looked seriously at his career as an agent of British Intelligence.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nUsing documents gleaned from British, American, French, and Italian archives, Secret Agent 666 sensationally reveals that Crowley played a major role in the sinking of the Lusitania, a plot to overthrow the government of Spain, the thwarting of Irish and Indian nationalist conspiracies, and the 1941 flight of Rudolf Hess.<br>\n<br>\nThe verification of the Great Beasts participation in the twentieth centurys most astounding government plots will likely blow the minds of history buff s and occult aficionados alike.<br>\n<br>\nRichard B.
