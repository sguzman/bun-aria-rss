Conventional medicine typically treats the symptoms of osteoarthritis but does not necessarily do anything to reverse it. Functional Medicine approaches these issues differently, treating and reversing chronic inflammation through lifestyle, diet, botanicals, targeted supplements, and more—including more “out of the box” therapies like ozone and prolozone.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with his colleague, Dr. George Papanicolaou, to discuss their experiences treating chronic joint pain in patients with nutritional and prolozone therapy.</p><br><p>George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. He is also an Institute for Functional Medicine Practitioner. Upon graduation from his residency he joined the Indian Health Service. He worked on the Navajo reservation for 4 years at the Chinle Comprehensive Medical Facility where he served as the Outpatient Department Coordinator. In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He practiced with a philosophy centered on personal relationships and treating the whole person, not just not the disease. He called that philosophy “Whole Life Wellness”. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive this kind of personal care Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health – a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine.
