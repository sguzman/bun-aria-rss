  "title": "Can China tame Hong Kong?",
  "description": "This week China marks the 70th anniversary of its founding. The great fanfare playing out across the country could be overshadowed by events in the southern territory of Hong Kong, which is part of China but maintains separate judicial and economic freedoms. For months, people there have been taking to the streets every weekend to rally against a controversial extradition bill. These protests have turned into a movement calling for full democracy, and an investigation into allegations of police brutality during the protests. The embattled government of Hong Kong initially shelved and later withdrew the bill. This has not quelled the unrest. The Chinese government has reacted angrily, but it has stepped back from deploying troops. So where do the two sides stand and how will the scenarios play out? Is the standoff just about democracy or a broader series of issues - from wealth inequality to identity? Can Beijing calm the situation without the use of force? And could these protests inspire movements in other parts of China? Celia Hatton and an expert panel of guests discuss the protests and what they say about the rapidly evolving relationship between Hong Kong and China.",
