It can seem even more daunting when present moment conditions are different than you’d expected them to be. And often, we can feel that we don’t have the time or space to focus on our own dreams.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Earlier this year, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Hyman spoke with Gabrielle Bernstein about the importance of taking spiritually aligned action toward the life you desire. Last year, he also explored how to create a vision for every area of your life with Jon and Missy Butcher.</p><br><p>Gabrielle Bernstein is the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Universe Has Your Back</em> and has written six additional bestsellers, including <em>Super Attractor</em> which launched in September 2019. She was featured on <em>Oprah’s Super Soul Sunday</em> as a “next-generation thought leader” and The Oprah Winfrey Network chose Gabrielle to be part of the “Super Soul 100,” a dynamic group of 100 trailblazers whose vision and life’s work are bringing a higher level of consciousness to the world.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Jon and Missy Butcher are artist-entrepreneurs whose life together revolves around their amazing relationship, family, and work. Together, they have founded over a dozen companies, all organized around causes that matter. Their purpose and mission is to create the highest possible quality of life they can for themselves and the people they love while helping others around the world to do the same. Their program, Lifebook, is a complete life-development system for creating your very best life.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Four Sigmatic.
