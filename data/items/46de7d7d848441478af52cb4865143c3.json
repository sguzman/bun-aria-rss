  "description": "<div>He’s the host of the “Infinite Fringe” on Truth Frequency Radio and “America Unplugged” on Ickonic. Billy Ray Valentine reports from the front line of the Coronavirus pandemic.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Or is it a “plandemic”? Could there be something more sinister at play with the push to close down New York City and other cities around the world? Billy Ray talks about what he is seeing in the Bronx, just outside of Manhattan, as the virus mutates from being only a scientific problem to now becoming a political one as well.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Will the unprecedented “shelter in place” orders stop the spread of the virus, or is it just a power grab by those feeling that their control over the people has loosened in the past couple of years? Only time will tell, but nobody knows how the reality shapers think better than Billy Ray Valentine.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong><br>\nScribd: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/37XqNUF\">https://bit.ly/37XqNUF</a>\n</div>\n<div>Curiosity Stream: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3a3DyhI\">https://bit.ly/3a3DyhI</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
