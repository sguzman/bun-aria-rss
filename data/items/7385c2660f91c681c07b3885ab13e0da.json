  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about DarkOverlord and the data he's selling online. Guccifer 2.0 returns to blogging, and says he's not working for the Russians, but CrowdStrike, ThreatConnect, and SecureWorks present evidence to suggest otherwise. Thompson-Reuters says it's contained the World-Check database leak. Oculus' Twitter account is briefly hijacked (now restored to company control). Point-of-sale breach disclosures are confirmed. Why hackers hack when they do. Some governments' efforts to control information online seem to be having greater than expected success. Level 3's Dale Drew explains the season nature of cyber attacks, and Cytegic's Dan Pastor offers his view on the recent SWIFT banking attacks.",
