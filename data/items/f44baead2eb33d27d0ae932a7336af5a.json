  "description": "<p>Today, more than ever, we are mistaking being busy for being effective. Great work is more valuable than ever today. Whether it’s work related to health and fitness, real estate, tech, art, or any other field, the quantity today is massive. But quality is what we truly desire.</p> <p>For those willing to engage in deep work (the topic of which we’ll be dissecting today), the potential upside is limitless. Through deep work, you’ll be able to experience better financial health, relationship health, physical health, and more. But, be aware, there are treacherous obstacles looming. You’ll have to make some mental shifts in order to avoid the booby traps of distraction that have a chokehold on most of the folks in our society. The tips and insights you’ll learn from today’s guest, Cal Newport, will be absolutely life-changing.
