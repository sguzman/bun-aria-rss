After the Civil War, rebuilding the country was a messy task, but Black Americans knew that creating educational opportunities for their children was highly important. What started in rural Virginia as the success of one teacher–Virginia Randolph–who put love, care, and oftentimes her own salary into her one-room school, grew into an unstoppable educational evolution for Black students. Learn about Randolph’s philosophies, the creation of the Jeanes Foundation, and the teachers who continuously pushed themselves to do the next needed thing for their students and their communities. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
