  "title": "#76: Too Dumb For Fiction (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p> In this 76th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss Portland going off the rails again. More riots and vandalism happened downtown, and we went to document some of it: the Apple store, the dumpster fires, the volunteers picking up trash, the companies proclaiming that we are “united by love” while (only) the white women in their displays are crossed out by activists. Meanwhile, the public schools debate changing names and mascots, and we are told that we need to register our cats. Then: a discussion of four numbers in the news this week. Three: shots now needed for the Pfizer vaccine. Ninety: the percentage of false positives from Covid tests in England. Thirteen: the proposed new number of Supreme Court Justices. 2.5 billion: the number of T. rexes who once roamed the Earth. Penultimately, we discuss lizards that aren’t lizards (but are in fact salamanders). And finally: footage from a coyote den that we (or rather, our dog) found near us, which had in it a mother and two kits. <br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
