  "description": "<p>I was lucky enough to learn at a young age that we can write our own stories. We can become the authors of our own lives instead of the victims—living authentically is a cornerstone of that process. Throughout life we’re posed with obstacles, successes, and everything in between. My guest on today’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, the one and only Matthew McConaughey, shares how challenging events (redlights) can provide us with the opportunity for growth and success (greenlights), which is the focus of his new book <em>Greenlights</em>.</p><br><p>Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey is a husband, father of three children, and a loyal son and brother. He considers himself a storyteller by occupation, believes it’s okay to have a beer on the way to the temple, feels better with a day’s sweat on him, and is an aspiring orchestral conductor. In 2009, Matthew and his wife, Camila, founded the just keep livin Foundation, which helps at-risk high school students make healthier mind, body, and spirit choices. In 2019, McConaughey became a professor of practice at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as Minister of Culture/M.O.C. for the University of Texas and the City of Austin. McConaughey is also brand ambassador for Lincoln Motor Company, an owner of the Major League Soccer Club Austin FC, and co-creator of his favorite bourbon on the planet, Wild Turkey Longbranch.</p><br><p>Here are more of the details from our interview:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ul><li>What Matthew found when he looked back on the journals he kept over 30 years (4:49)&nbsp;</li><li>The science of satisfaction (8:01)&nbsp;</li><li>Being an author vs. victim of your life (10:55)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Reframing selfishness (13:05)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Matthew’s recurring dream and what he did to follow it (17:39)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The transformative wrestling match that Matthew inadvertently found himself participating in (23:55)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritizing what matters most to you (36:30)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>How relinquishing need can bring in more (42:32)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The power of journaling and writing down your thoughts (43:28)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Get a copy of Matthew’s book, <em>Green Lights </em>at<em> </em><a href=\"https://greenlights.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://greenlights.com/</a>.</p><br><p>Follow Matthew on Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MatthewMcConaughey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@MatthewMcConaughey</a>, on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/officiallymcconaughey/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@officiallymcconaughey</a>, and on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McConaughey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@McConaughey</a>.</p><br><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
