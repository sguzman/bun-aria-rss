  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats called the invasion at the border a manufactured crisis now they're calling it concentration camps. They've accused President Trump of using children as pawns, yet they support infanticide. What have they done to help the country? The inaction of the Democrats has caused this crisis to exacerbate. Also, Carl Cameron, an ex-correspondent from the Fox News Channel, was once a Conservative now he's released a video trashing Fox News and Trump. It’s another example of the media taking on the role of a social activist. Later 'middle class' Joe Biden has earned millions since leaving the Vice Presidency and is now living in a huge Georgian-styled home worth $4.2 million and a $2.7 million vacation home. He comes into Congress with nothing and leaves with millions. Finally, Iran is in full propaganda mode; trashing National Security Advisor John Bolton and personally trashing Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
