  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the reports that Russell Wilson is back on the trade market, and what teams potentially have enough capital to get the deal done. Joining the program is 4x Pro Bowler, a man who just signed a new contract with the Indianapolis Colts, friend of the show, TY Hilton, to chat about his decision to stay with the Colts, what other team offered him, his relationship with Andrew Luck, how he came to his decision, and why he's excited to play with Carson Wentz (25:20-49:02). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, and new New York Giants TE, Kyle Rudolph joins the show to chat about his decision to go to the Giants, how the foot is doing, if he's had a chance to meet or talk to any of his new teammates yet, what he thinks of Joe Judge, and much more (49:11-1:14:25). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk shoot the breeze about the Russell Wilson seemingly not being resolved in Seattle, and everything else going on in free agency across the NFL (1:16:37-1:41:21).
