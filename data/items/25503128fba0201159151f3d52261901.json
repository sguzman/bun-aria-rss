  "description": "<p>Chiral magnets can host topological particles known as skyrmions which carry\nan exactly quantised topological charge $Q=-1$. In the presence of an\noscillating magnetic field ${\\bf B}_1(t)$, a single skyrmion embedded in a\nferromagnetic background will start to move with constant velocity ${\\bf\nv}_{\\text{trans}}$. The mechanism behind this motion is similar to the one used\nby a jellyfish when it swims through water. We show that the skyrmion's motion\nis a universal phenomenon, arising in any magnetic system with translational\nmodes. By projecting the equation of motion onto the skyrmion's translational\nmodes and going to quadratic order in ${\\bf B}_1(t)$ we obtain an analytical\nexpression for ${\\bf v}_{\\text{trans}}$ as a function of the system's linear\nresponse. The linear response and consequently ${\\bf v}_{\\text{trans}}$ are\ninfluenced by the skyrmion's internal modes and scattering states, as well as\nby the ferromagnetic background's Kittel mode. The direction and speed of ${\\bf\nv}_{\\text{trans}}$ can be controlled by changing the polarisation, frequency\nand phase of the driving field ${\\bf B}_1(t)$. For systems with small Gilbert\ndamping parameter $\\alpha$, we identify two distinct physical mechanisms used\nby the skyrmion to move. At low driving frequencies, the skyrmion's motion is\ndriven by friction, and $v_{\\text{trans}}\\sim\\alpha$, whereas at higher\nfrequencies above the ferromagnetic gap the skyrmion moves by magnon emission\nand $v_{\\text{trans}}$ becomes independent of $\\alpha$.\n</p>",
