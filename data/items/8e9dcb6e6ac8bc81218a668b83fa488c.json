  "title": "Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin",
  "description": "This book explains how to take extreme ownership to become a better leader. The stories in the book detail how both authors experienced high-pressure situations during the war in Iraq, but only by taking ownership of everything around them could they lead with conviction to ultimately win. Leadership is usually synonymous with many adjectives, but I do not recall a book that emphasises ownership as much as this one. The concept that connected with me was the 'dichotomies of leadership'. The authors explain that to be a great leader, you must find the balance between two extremes. I enjoyed listening to this book. The audiobook was well structured, and I felt the emotion of the message coming across from the authors. If like me you appreciate leadership books, I encourage you to pick up this book because it gives a much different angle than most. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
