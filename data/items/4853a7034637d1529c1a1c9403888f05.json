  "description": "We all know John Delorean stood out in the automotive industry, in part because of his flamboyant lifestyle (but mostly because of his sizable chin). So maybe it wasn’t a good idea for Delorean to get into the Cocaine Trafficking Business. Delorean was nabbed carrying a briefcase worth over 6.5 million dollars worth of cocaine, but did the FBI set him up? Or would the British backed DMC finally find success in Ireland. Join Nolan, Joe, and James as we find out in John Delorean: Part II- “This Stuff’s Better than Gold”.\nFollow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey \nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes \nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
