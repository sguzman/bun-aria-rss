  "description": "<p><strong>You basically grew up in a cult, and following your own path as an adult was seen as an act of \"rebellion\" in the eyes of your dad, from whom you've been estranged ever since.</strong> He's even forbidden you from setting foot on his property until you \"repent, return, and remain.\" Now, years have passed and it doesn't sit well with you that your relationship is so strained. Should you try to reconnect with your cult father, or is it even worth the bother?
