  "description": "On today's show, Pat breaks down his trip to Bristol and the ESPN campus and his gig on Get Up, and what he thought of the whole process, and discusses some of the different locations he checked out while in New York. The guys also chat about Logan Paul potentially fighting in the UFC, Whitey Bulger being killed in prison, all the political ads that have been running the last few months, and take a hard look at what board game Pat could potentially be playing tomorrow for his mybookie challenge. Also included is a conversation about Reese's setting up a trade-in machine for bad candy, and the guys do a deep dive into everything that happened up through the NFL trade deadline and what the impact has on all the teams involved. It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
