  "description": "Country music star Clay Walker kicks back in his wine cellar and pours himself Michter's 10 Year, 291 Colorado Rye Whiskey and Seelbach's Bourbon. Fred and Clay talk about the impact of music on Fred's life, including a Clay Walker show he saw in his teenage years. They talked about the FFA, Rodeos, fallen friends, multiple sclerosis (Clay was diagnosed at 26) and upcoming shows, including a CMT appearance.\n\nClay Walker by the Numbers \n- 11 No. 1 singles\n- 39 songs on the Billboard charts\n- four RIAA PLATINUM albums\n- two Certified GOLD albums\n\n*’Texas To Tennessee’ album out now (7.30) via Show Dog Nashville: https://orcd.co/texastotennessee\n\n*”Behind The Album” video series launched in August, here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNSbbtd8Cx5-OXkWWzmQ2IQ\n\n*Clay will perform as part of CMT's \"A Tennessee Kind of Christmas” airing Wednesday, Dec 8 at 9/8c on CMT\n\n*New single “Catching Up with An Ol’ Memory” to be released early 2022\n\n\n\nClay Walker Bio\nDiscovered in a Beaumont area bar by noted producer and head of Giant Records James Stroud (Toby Keith, Tracy Lawrence, Tim McGraw, Kenny Rogers), Clay Walker was in his early twenties when he started rattling off a string of smash hits: “Live Until I Die,” \"Dreaming With My Eyes Open,\" “This Woman And This Man,” \"Hypnotize The Moon,\" \"Rumor Has It,\" “Then What,” \"I Can't Sleep\" and \"She Won't Be Lonely Long.\" \n\nFour platinum albums, more than 30 charted singles and 11 No. 1’s later, Texas-native Clay Walker has built a storied career blending country’s timeless themes with music-of-the-moment timeliness. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Walker’s debut Show Dog Nashville album ‘Texas To Tennessee’ (7.30). Certainly, the realities of place are as central as this comeback album's name implies: Nashville - busily working toward the next fresh hit; Texas - moving at its inimitable and familiar pace.  \n\nEmbracing the role of social media in today’s music industry, Walker has built a following of more than 1 million fans on TikTok.\n\nProduced by Michael Knox (Jason Aldean) and chart-topping songwriter Jaron Boyer, ‘Texas To Tennessee' delivers smooth bore country that would feel right at home on any of Walker's four platinum CDs. It’s a modern album that nods at an earlier era in its time economy.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Fred Minnick's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg?view_as=subscriber\n\nMerch, including official The Fred Minnick Show Glencairn: https://shop.podcastone.com/collections/the-fred-minnick-show\n\nBecome a YouTube Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg/join\n\nSome products tasted on this show may have been provided to Fred Minnick at no cost to him.
