  "description": "<p>Self-organization through adaptive rewiring of random neural networks\ngenerates brain-like topologies comprising modular small-world structures with\nrich club effects, merely as the product of optimizing the network topology. In\nthe nervous system, spatial organization is optimized no less by rewiring,\nthrough minimizing wiring distance and maximizing spatially aligned wiring\nlayouts. We show that such spatial organization principles interact\nconstructively with adaptive rewiring, contributing to establish the networks'\nconnectedness and modular structures. We use an evolving neural network model\nwith weighted and directed connections, in which neural traffic flow is based\non consensus and advection dynamics, to show that wiring cost minimization\nsupports adaptive rewiring in creating convergent-divergent unit structures.\nConvergent-divergent units consist of a convergent input-hub, connected to a\ndivergent output-hub via subnetworks of intermediate nodes, which may function\nas the computational core of the unit. The prominence of minimizing wiring\ndistance in the dynamic evolution of the network determines the extent to which\nthe core is encapsulated from the rest of the network, i.e., the\ncontext-sensitivity of its computations. This corresponds to the central role\nconvergent-divergent units play in establishing context-sensitivity in neuronal\ninformation processing.\n</p>",
