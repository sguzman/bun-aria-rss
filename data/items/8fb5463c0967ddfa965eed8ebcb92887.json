    "media:description": "It’s time to get into the spirit of Halloween and Monster Madness or “Munster” Madness today. Every October, I like to do something a little different. This time I’ll be checking out some NEW horror and monster movies. And by NEW I mean, they just came out! This is exciting for me, because it gives me an excuse to watch brand new stuff, instead of always just going into my familiar rolodex, digging into classic horror and things from the past. Which I enjoy and will continue to do, but today’s pick is equally nostalgic as its a reboot of the classic 60s show by Rob Zombie, The Munsters!\n\nFollow James:\nhttps://twitter.com/cinemassacre\n\nFor everything else Cinemassacre:\nhttps://cinemassacre.com/\n\n#TheMunsters #RobZombie #JamesRolfe #MonsterMadness",
