  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the crew chat about a few things that are happening around the NFL as we get into week 2. They cover the skunk smell coming from the Raiders locker room, and Pat remembers playing in Oakland with a haze floating over the stadium. Pat also dives into Chuck Pagano's travel dress rules and how got around them. Also included are three great interviews. First, the GOAT of punting, Shane Lechler, joins the show to talk about his split with the Texans, what he's been doing with his time off now, and what he thinks of the state of the game (36:08-50:43). Next, cohost of Good Morning Football, Kyle Brandt, joins the show to talk about his new show The Kyle Brandt Football Experience, how weird his resume is, and how his career has gotten to this point (56:26-1:14:24). After the show, The World's Strongest Man, Mark Henry, joins the show. They chat about his WWE career, getting arrested in Ireland, and some of his wildest experiences, (1:20:00-1:43:01). Cheers.\n",
