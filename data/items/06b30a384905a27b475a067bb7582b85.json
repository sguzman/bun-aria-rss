  "description": "Why I’m still long on General Electric (despite its recent slump)… Bruno Mars is NOT Michael Jackson… Eagles to the SuperBowl? On today’s episode of Frankly Speaking, I mostly cover General Electric (GE). I’ve received tons of questions and emails after shares reached a new 52-week low last week. So I wanted to give my followers an update. A massive restructuring is currently underway and rumors are spurting in every direction. In addition, JPMorgan is now saying a dividend cut is “likely”… which could push prices even lower. This is a name I’ve been wrong on for the past six months… But, with my ego put aside, I still think GE is an incredible buy at these levels. Here’s my take. As always, thanks to everyone who participated!",
