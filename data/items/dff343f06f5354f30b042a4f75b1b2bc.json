  "description": "On August 5, 2022, a 16-year-old girl went to a campground party near her home and never returned. When records showed her phone last pinged at the campground before turning off minutes after she supposedly left, her family feared for the worst. Both she and her car are both still missing, with few clues as to what could have happened to her.
