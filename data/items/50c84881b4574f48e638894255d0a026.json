A South Carolina judge set bond at $7 million with the proviso that Murdaugh must pay his bond in full. Previously, State Grand Jury Chief Creighton Waters ordered Murdaugh to remain jailed without bond as he was a flight risk. During his virtual hearing, Murdaugh apologized to the family of his former housekeeper. Gloria Satterfield suffered a fatal fall at the Murdaugh home in 2018. Murdaugh was arrested on October 14 at a rehabilitation center in Florida for obtaining property by false pretenses for allegedly stealing $4.3 million from her estate.

Murdaugh is also accused of stealing $6.2 million from clients and associates between October 2015 through 2020.
