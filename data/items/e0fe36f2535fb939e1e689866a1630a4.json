  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we have a lawless, un-American Democrat Party and in an act of legislative tyranny, several high profile Democrats have threatened to restructure the US Supreme Court if they don't curb their rulings on gun control. Historically, criticism of judges has been met with disdain by the media. But now, Democrats are pushing to criminalize court-packing (only if it's stacked with Conservatives). They are trying to change the make-up of the Court just like they've tried to change the outcome of the election by relentlessly going after President Trump, his finances, and his family. Over the decades, Democrats have been the party of segregation, Jim Crow laws, and opposing the Civil Rights Act. The Democrat Party is the Party of tyranny.  Then, the left is in hate America mode, so we must be in defend liberty mode because reparations and systemic racism in this day and age are not accurate — its a political ploy to regain the loss of African American voters leaving the Democrat Party. Later, CNN Host Chris Cuomo makes expletive-laced threats during a temper tantrum over being called \"Fredo\" from the movie the Godfather; a name he called himself in an interview with WABC radio host Curtis Sliwa years earlier. After, citizens in Hong Kong — one of the greatest places in the world — are protesting China's extradition laws with massive sit-ins shutting down their airport. President Xi is a brutal killer that has rounded up Muslims and Christians as he fancies himself a modern-day Mao Zedong.  Now the communist Chinese government has issued an ultimatum to the Hong Kong police to resolve the uprising before they send in the Chinese military to quash the pro-liberty protesters. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
