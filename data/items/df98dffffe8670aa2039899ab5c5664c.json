  "description": "<p>Spooky stuff may make you cover your eyes in fright, but many of us find ourselves peeking through our fingers to get another glimpse. Why are we drawn to things that make us jump? In this episode, we'll find out how fear can actually be fun. We visit a scientist who helps design haunted houses for ultimate scares, chat with an author who writes ghost stories about how he crafts the creepy crawlies, and play a rousing game of Name That Phobia! Plus we help Gungador get rid of his hiccups and answer the Moment of Um question: \"Why do raspberries have little hairs?\"</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hmho9087yE\" class=\"default\">To learn more about the mystery sound, click here.</a></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner (bona.com/brainson), Pillsbury Crescent Rolls, and MEL Science (text BRAINS to 64-000). </p>\n",
