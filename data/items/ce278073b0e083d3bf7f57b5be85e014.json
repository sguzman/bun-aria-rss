Then we take a look at the hype and hysteria that surrounds Blanton's. We dive into the recent news of Blanton's Gold making its way to the US and if we think $120 SRP is a deal you should jump on.

He wasn’t able to stay on due to some technical difficulties, but we hope to have him on again soon.\nShow Notes:\n\nBarrel Shortage:  https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-there-a-bourbon-barrel-shortage-on-the-horizon\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about taxes.\n\nWhat are distilleries doing for coronavirus?\n\nHistory of Blanton's.\n\nHow did Blanton's become so popular?\n\nWill limiting the purchases of allocated items work?\n\nWhy don't distilleries use technology to manage this problem?\n\nBlanton's Gold coming to the US.
