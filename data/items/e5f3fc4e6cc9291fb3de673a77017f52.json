Instead of our usual show, we’re sharing an episode of PushBlack’s newest podcast, Building Black Dollars!\nIt’s no secret that the economic system is rigged against us as Black people. Barriers such as the racial wealth gap and banking discrimination continue to plague our communities. Still, economic freedom is within our reach. And it begins with you.\nBuilding Black Dollars empowers our people to take charge of personal finances and improve financial literacy. We address the daily issues Black folks face financially and offer practical actions to take right now to solve these everyday problems, and ultimately build Black economic liberation.\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/building-black-dollars/id1603304217\nSubscribe on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/77WHAlLe9yvVIYsoyk3PBz\nSubscribe on Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vYnVpbGRpbmctYmxhY2stZG9sbGFycw\nListen to the first episode here: There's a very clear power division in America: The Entrepreneur vs. The Employee. In a white supremacist nation, where capitalism reigns supreme, most Black people become the employees. And it's time we understand why. On this episode, we give you practical advice to become an entrepreneur, survive being an employee, and explore what these positions mean for Black America's economic future.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
