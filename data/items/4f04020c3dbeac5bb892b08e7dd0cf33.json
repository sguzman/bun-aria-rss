    "media:description": "Analysing the campaign of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (2022's Modern Warfare 2, that is) - a game as nonsensical as it is hypocritical (this is just my opinion and if you liked the game that's fine!).\n\nSupport the show on Patreon - http://patreon.com/writingongames\n\nPodcast - http://anchor.fm/writingongamescast\n\nSecond Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1xxfS_HILi09yaELQdmV1A\n\n---\n\nCall of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is back, baby, and I'm here to talk about it. Despite a couple of missions that serve as series highlights thanks to their emphasis on flexible gameplay over its trite narrative, Modern Warfare 2's otherwise lacklustre campaign fails to sell a narrative that's as nonsensical as it is downright hypocritical. In this analysis/review of the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (2022) campaign I discuss how, in the game's skewed view of what it means to be \"critical of war,\" as with 2019's predecessor, the ends always (apparently) justify the means.\n\n0:00 - Intro plug\n0:11 - \"De-escalation\"\n2:33 - Don't worry, you're still the Good Guys\n3:53 - MW2 takes itself too seriously\n5:14 - Most missions are dull too\n6:44 - Breaking down the best mission in the game (Recon By Fire)\n9:19 - Actual, subtle storytelling\n11:21 - The other good mission in the game (Alone)\n12:50 - The worst mission in MW2\n14:23 - MW2 is less gritty conflict, more Crash Bandicoot\n15:26 - Outro\n\n---\n\nIntro text animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames",
