We spend a bit of time talking F1 stuff mostly Prost vs. Senna and of course the new Räikkönen + Ferrari alliance.  We touch upon the mertis of Australia's V8 Super Car series vs NASCAR, the reckles aussie abandon that is Bathhurst, and of course Australia's most famous vehicles the utes.  Beyond all of that and our usual brand of bullshit, Rich is simply floored by our outlook on electric vehicles and hybrids; the Volt and Tesla Model S specifically.  </p>\n",
