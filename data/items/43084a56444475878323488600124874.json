As well as attracting and inspiring others in her salon, she wrote novels, plays. literary criticism, political essays, and poems and developed the ideas behind Romanticism. She achieved this while regularly exiled from the Paris in which she was born, having fallen out with Napoleon who she opposed, becoming a towering figure in the history of European ideas.\n\nWith \n\nCatriona Seth, Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford\n\nAlison Finch, Professor Emerita of French Literature at the University of Cambridge\n\nand \n\nKatherine Astbury, Associate Professor and Reader in French Studies at the University of Warwick.\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
