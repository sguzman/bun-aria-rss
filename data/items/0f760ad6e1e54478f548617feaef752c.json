  "description": "<p>In this episode, Alberto Tasca d'Almerita, part of the 8th generation of the Tasca d’Almerita family, the CEO of <a href= \"https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Tasca d’Almerita</a> winery, and one of the directors of the <a href=\"http://www.winesofsicily.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sicilia DOC</a> joins the show.</p> <p>This is an excellent complement to the <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6JLoDXIj6Y\">Wines of Sicily class (part 1 now on the YouTube Channel!</a>).</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Low_Alberto_Tasca_PH_Matteo_Carassale_3-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"255\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><a href=\"https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Photo: Courtesy of Tasca d'Almerita</a></span></em></p> <p>The Tasca d’Almerita family got into wine in the 1830s with the purchase of <a href=\"https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tenuta Regaleali</a> in the center of Sicily, with a range of altitudes that rise up to nearly 3000 ft/900 m, a variety of exposures, mixed soils, and elevations. The varied terrior and strong diurnals means that so many grapes grow well here – the winery grows 25 red and white varietals and the wines are fresh, fruity and honor the Sicilian tradition.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the early 2000s, Alberto took over the business side of <a href=\"https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Tasca d’Almerita</a>. He shook things up and modernized the winery, improving the wines but staying true to tradition. Alberto grew the winery to four other Sicilian winegrowing regions: Tenuta Capofaro on the Aeolian island of Salina; Tenuta Tascante on Mt. Etna; Tenuta Whitaker on the Phoenician island of Mozia; and Tenuta Sallier de La Tour in the DOC Monreale. To say that Alberto understands the ins and outs of Sicily and what it has to give is an understatement.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/sicilyia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"363\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"http://www.winesofsicily.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Courtesy of Sicilia DOC</span></em></a></p> <p>I found that one of the most altruistic and interesting things about <a href=\"https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alberto Tasca d’Almerita,</a> is that he doesn’t only focus on his own business.
