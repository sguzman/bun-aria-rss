  "description": "<p>It's the 100th anniversary of WW1! The Great War. The War of Nations. The War to End All Wars. If only that were true. What a war it was! It was a war unlike any other fought in the long history of Europe. New technology - tanks, flamethrowers, fighter jets, poison gas, and more. And it was unprecedented in scope - over 65 million troops would be mobilized over the course of the four years. Over 65 million men sent to fight. Think about that number. We'll talk about a lot of numbers today as we break down what led to WW1, what happened during WW1, how and when it ended and its aftermath, today, on a thank you to the troops edition, happy Veteran's Day edition, of Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by <strong>Away Travel!</strong> For $20 off a suitcase, visit <a href=\"http://awaytravel.com/timesuck\"><strong>awaytravel.com/timesuck</strong></a> and use promo code TIMESUCK during checkout! </p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>Hims!</strong> Get a trial month of hims for just $5 today when you go to <a href=\"http://ForHims.com/Timesuck\"><strong>ForHims.com/Timesuck</strong></a></p>\n<p>We're donating $1,000 this month to the <strong>Green Beret Association.</strong>Hail Nimrod! <a href=\"https://www.greenberetassociation.org/\"><strong>Click HERE</strong></a><strong> </strong>to learn more or donate.
