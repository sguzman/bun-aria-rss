  "description": "In today's podcast we continue to follow the Shadow Brokers, and we take a quick look into the shadowy world of hybrid warfare. No fresh leaks in this incident, but someone seems to be using seized Silk Road Bitcoin wallets to bid on leaked files. Election hacking worries persist, and concerns about secret ballots appear. Some users want a general strike against Tor. Point-of-sale malware and what to do about it. Industry notes. A new Wassenaar round will revisit cyber arms control next month. John Leiseboer from QuintessenseLabs addresses data redundancy and replication, and Michael Marriott from Digital Shadows tells us about the shady deer.io online market.",
