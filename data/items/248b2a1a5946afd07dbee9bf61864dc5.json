  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP helps out the old lady next door by clearing snow off her driveway, mowing her lawn, etc. He doesn't even ask the old lady for compensation -- he just does it because it's the neighborly thing to do. Well, when the mean old lady complains about OP driving over her property, OP happily stops doing free yard work for her. If you don't want OP on your property, then OP will stop going on your property! Be careful what you wish for!</p>\n",
