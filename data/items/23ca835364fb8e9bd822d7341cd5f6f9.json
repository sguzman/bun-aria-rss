  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts wrap up their series on <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cI6L92\">Hard Times</a></em> by Charles Dickens. Angelina opens the conversation about the book by highlighting Dickens’ masterful ability to tie up all the loose ends in his stories. They cover not only the major plot points here at the end of the book, but talk about the craft of Dickens and continue to teach us how to read this type of story. We see each character’s full arc and the positive changes that come when people choose repentance versus the fate of those who remain stubbornly on the road to destruction.</p> <p>Join us next time for a special conversation with Jason Baxter, author of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CKyqQY\">The Medieval Mind of C. S. Lewis</a></em>.</p> <p>After that, we will be digging into Bram Stoker’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3RJeVMN\">Dracula</a></em> together and learning more about this late Victorian Gothic novel.
