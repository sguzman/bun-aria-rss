  "description": "<p>When we truly love someone, we want to see them thrive. We want the best for them, and we want to see them happy.</p>\n<p>In our world today, too many people are struggling day-to-day with their health. They are barely surviving, let alone thriving. And often times they have no idea things can change, or no motivation to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>It can be one of the hardest things in life to see someone you love struggling with their health… especially when you know just how good it can actually be.</p>\n<p>Today you're going to find out some powerful ways to help motivate your friends and family to take better care of themselves. Sometimes it's not the message itself, but how it's delivered that can make all the difference in the world. That's why today you're also going to learn what NOT to do when communicating with the people you care about if you really want to effect change in their life.
