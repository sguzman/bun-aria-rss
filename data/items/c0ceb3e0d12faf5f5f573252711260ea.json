  "title": "Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ by Daniel Goleman",
  "description": "This book is an exploration into why EQ or emotional intelligence can be a greater indicator of intelligence than IQ. I have read many articles around this topic from top CEO’s and Entrepreneurs who believe this to be true and recommended this book as an introduction into the topic. What struck me most about this book is how detailed Goleman explains how our experiences, especially in infancy, creates our tendencies and habits as we get older. The book explains details of our emotions, how they are created and are managed on a day-to-day basis. What I took away from the book is that everyone strives to become more intelligent, therefore they read and learn, but by self-analysing how you form relationships and interact with people you gain a competitive advantage in any field. This is a great introductory read and I rate it four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
