  "description": "When we hear about a “self-made man,” it usually refers to someone who had very little and became wealthy and influential all on his own. Abraham, the father of our faith, also became wealthy, influential, and left an amazing legacy for the whole world, but his label reads a “God-made man.” Abraham wears the label “God-made man” because he willingly trusted God to take him to a land unknown to him, and he trusted God to make him fully into the person He created him to become. Abraham was not called by God because his faith was perfect. He was called by God because he was willing to follow and believe God, and along his journey he “was strengthened in faith” through God’s promise (Romans 4:20 NKJV).
