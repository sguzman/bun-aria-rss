  "description": "<p>Michael Sweetney, (former NBA player & current Yeshiva Assistant Coach) details his journey through professional basketball, from the pressure he felt as a star player and student athlete at Georgetown to his experience with depression after the sudden, tragic loss of his father. He opens up about why he hated playing basketball at first, the grueling mind-body experience of being drafted, and the criticism he faced for removing himself from the NBA. Michael explains his backfired attempt to use basketball as an outlet following his father’s death, which resulted in a suicide attempt and how his family structure and faith motivated him to seek help. Mayim breaks down reasons the rate of depression is so much higher in professional athletes and the causes and dangers of professional masking. She and Michael discuss trying to balance work and grieving and ways the conversation about mental health around athletes has evolved over time. Mayim suggests ways to broach mental health topics with your family in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything. </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
