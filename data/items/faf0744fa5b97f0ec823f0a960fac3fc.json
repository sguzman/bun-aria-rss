  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden isn't doing anything to stop the dictatorial nature of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau announced that truckers who donated to the Freedom Convoy should lose their trucking licenses. Then, Senator Mike Lee calls in to discuss how the US Senate tried to advance a bill ending vaccine mandates, but Democrats blocked it and it failed. Even deep blue states are rescinding their COVID mandates, but the Senate is not. Simply put, this is about power. Although the virus is waning, the Democrats want to maintain their control via mandates. Later, American's are hard-pressed to defend Biden or the Democrats. While Democrats purport to stand for civil liberties their words run contrary to it. The Washington Post has made racist comments about the US Supreme Court's only African American Justice. Afterward, Dr. Oz, a candidate for US Senate from Pennsylvania, joins the show. Oz says that COVID inspired him to run for office. Oz also mentioned that there are still shortages on treatments today and this must stop. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
