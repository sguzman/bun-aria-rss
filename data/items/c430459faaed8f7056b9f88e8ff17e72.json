  "title": "ðŸ“¬ Mailbag: The Great Kirk Cousins debate, Ranking Oklahoma QB products, Panthers' future Hall of Famers (Football 5/31)",
  "description": "Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech answer YOUR mailbag questions which were left attached to 5-star reviews on Apple Podcasts. First, the guys predict who Pete Prisco will notably leave off his Top 100 list this year (set to be released Tuesday on CBSSports.com) (3:15). Then, the show turns into a comprehensive Kirk Cousins breakdown and comparison series vs. other QBs around the league (15:00). Would you rather have Kirk Cousins or Derek Carr? How about Kirk Cousins or Jameis Winston? Plenty of hypotheticals are covered during this segment. The Panthers were established in 1995 so they currently have minimal Hall of Fame representation, but that should soon change. But how many of their guys will get into Canton (36:00)? Julius Peppers appears to be a lock, but Steve Smith and Luke Kuechly might present a bit more of a debate. Oklahoma has become a QB factory recently with Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray and Jalen Hurts set to be starters next year and current Sooners QB Spencer Rattler on his way to the league. How would the Superfriends rank those four in five years (48:00)? Lastly, some talk about more international prospects getting a chance in the NFL (55:45).\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts.Â \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
