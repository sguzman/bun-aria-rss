  "description": "When we make mistakes, God doesn’t abandon us. Psalm 37:23-24 tells us, “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord… Though he falls, he will not be destroyed; for the Lord will be there to pick him up.” No mistake you make can ever be too great to cancel out God’s plan for your life. Let Joel show you that it’s time to believe again in this redeeming message. No matter what you’ve done, if you will shake off guilt and move forward in your thinking and expectations, God will get you to where you’re supposed to be. Not somewhere secondary, but the best plan for your life.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
