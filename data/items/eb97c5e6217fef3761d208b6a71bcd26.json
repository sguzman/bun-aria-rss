  "description": "<p>The legendary singer/songwriter Yusuf / Cat Stevens released his first album in 1967. He’s a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and his albums have sold millions. In 2020, he released <em>Tea for the</em> Tillerman², a re-imagining of his hit 1970 album <em>Tea for the Tillerman</em>. In the song “Father & Son,” he sings a duet between the two title characters, doing both voices. But in the 2020 version, he approached this song in a kind of astonishing way—he recorded the part of the father, but for the part of the son, he used a live recording of himself from 1970, taken from a show he played at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. So the two parts are still both sung in his voice, but 50 years apart. In this episode, the 200th episode of Song Exploder, Yusuf / Cat Stevens tells the story of how he created, and then re-created “Father & Son.”</p>\n\n<p>For more, visit <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/yusuf-cat-stevens\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/yusuf-cat-stevens</a>.</p>",
