  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ian Fidance and I took a drive down to New Jersey and talked and laughed about his weird level of sexuality. He’s got some unique views on sex and love and whether or not he’s gay. I assumed he was at least bi but he doesn’t agree. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a fun driving episode that I’m gonna do more of. I think the last one I did like this was with Duncan Trussell talking about Buddhism.
