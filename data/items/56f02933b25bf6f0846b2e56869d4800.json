  "description": "So... last week when Draymond Green visited the show, there were an awful lot of superlatives being thrown around. And why not? It was an incredible interview that was certainly deserving of high praise. Well, if this week proves anything, it’s that you can never have enough superlatives when it comes to the OM3, because joining the show this week is yet another surefire first ballot Hall of Famer, Chris Paul. And even though CP3 and JJ are the closest of friends and have gone through just about everything together on the court and off, this discussion has Chris breaking new ground on several topics. To say this conversation was spectacular on every level is an understatement. Once again, it’s a can’t miss interview on the OM3, so sit back and enjoy the ride.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
