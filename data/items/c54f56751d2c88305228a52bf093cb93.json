  "description": "We’ve had a lot of listeners write in and they have a lot of questions about creating the ideal nursery. The nursery space is such a precious area and we’ve done a lot of them, so we’re excited to share what we know with you. We recommend white draperies if you’re planning on having more kids, as choosing a specific color, like pink for example, can give it more of a girl’s room feel. Having a diffuser for the nursery and having a night lamp can give the nursery a nice atmosphere to make that experience of getting up in the night to tend to your baby a bit more bearable. Try putting a sheep skin at the foot of the crib so you have something nice for your bare feet to stand on. <br /><br />How to design a nursery that looks designed, but has a child/baby element 2:08<br />Draperies and how to decide what to spend/save on 4:27<br />Creating a nursery in a small space, but still loving it 9:46<br />Make a nursery feel special for working mom and stay-at-home mom 13:31<br />Nursery must-haves - “Seating for mom, obviously, a little lamp.
