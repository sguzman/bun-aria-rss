  "description": "<p>On this episode Clay hosts a group of longtime friends from his hometown - Andy and Scott Brown, Steve Phillips, Randy Stepp, Cauy House and Gary \"Believer\" Newcomb.  This is a humdinger of a conversation about wild hogs, deer hunting, three-wheeler wrecks, wrestling deer and an eclectic assortment of wild stories - one involving Andy losing a finger.  Scott tells about the time they killed two giant hogs and big buck on the same hunt. Clay tells about stalking a group of wild hogs on his hands and knees, Andy tells about a wild three-wheeler wreck and about losing his finger in a treestand accident related to his ring. Gary tells about hitting a deer on his fourwheeler and barely escaping death. Finally, Scott tells a story about Clay chasing a perfectly healthy deer down a snow covered mountain. If you're looking for a good time - this is your podcast. </p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
