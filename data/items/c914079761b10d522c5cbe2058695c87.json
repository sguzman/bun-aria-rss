  "description": "<p>Jane Doe January. A woman is raped in her own apartment by an unknown man who had made his way into her building. Despite supportive family and law enforcement, it would be two decades before the identity of the rapist would be discovered. Bringing the man to justice would become her mission and she set about researching him and doing what she had to do to have charges brought against him. Along the way she would have to deal with challenges as well as an important question as she approached a trial date: Will her progress over all of these years diminish what he did to her? Emily Winslow speaks candidly about what happened to her and what she learned about the system, and herself, in her quest for justice. Today's sponsor is Audible.com.
