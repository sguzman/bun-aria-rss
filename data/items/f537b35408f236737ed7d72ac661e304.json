  "description": "<p>We continue to analyze the HBO docuseries “Phoenix Rising” about Evan Rachel Wood. At the age of 18, Wood was pursued by a then 37-year-old rock icon. Their relationship spanned over four years, beginning with intensive flattery, then escalating to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Looking back, she recognized a pattern of grooming and control tactics similar to those experienced by other survivors, who told their stories of harrowing experiences at the hands of this same offender. What is special about this film is its intimate, personal portrayal of not only Evan’s life –– a chronicle of how she fell down the rabbit hole and ultimately climbed her way back out –– but also of the importance of community and solidarity to overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>#phoenixrising</p><p>#hbomax</p><p>#hbo</p><p>@HBO, @HBODocs, @HBOMax&nbsp;</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><p>PROSE HAIRCARE - makes custom haircare that’s <u>effective</u> because it’s <u>personal</u>.
