  "description": "While the shooting seems to enhance Wanger’s reputation in Hollywood’s eyes, the media frenzy that follows enacts a sharp price on the lives of Joan Bennett (Zooey Deschanel) and her children. Joan is forced to make a living largely through grueling touring theater. By the mid-1950s, Joan is essentially blacklisted from Hollywood movies, but her acting career gets a final boost, when Joan is cast in the legendary daytime supernatural soap, Dark Shadows, and acquires a whole new generation of fans. \nListen and subscribe at http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\n\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
