  "description": "On today's show, Pat recaps the events that happened last night on WWE NXT on how he was bamboozled into eating a boot from Adam Cole, his entrance into War Games, and everything else about the trip. First, 9 year NFL vet at Defensive Back, friend of the program, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod and Everything DB, Darius Butler, joins the show to chat about his locks for tonight's Cardinals vs. Seahawks game, what he likes for over/unders, QB passing yards, and who he thinks is going to win the game (21:30-40:03). Next, current WR for the New York Football Giants, Darius Slayton joins the program to chat about the fight that heard round the country between a couple of coaches, if he thought he was going to be drafted higher after playing at Auburn, his relationship with Danny Dimes, and who he looks up to (43:35-56:22). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, 2013 AFC Defensive Player of the Year, Colts Ring of Honor member, future Hall of Famer, Robert Mathis joins the show. Pat and Robert chat about why he and Dwight Freeney don't get as much love for being arguably the best DE duo ever, his thoughts on this Colts team, why playing defensive end is like a game of chess, and how you deal with a QB like Aaron Rodgers (59:53-1:14:54). Lastly, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ chat about last night's events, and preview tonight's Thursday Night Football game and give their picks.
