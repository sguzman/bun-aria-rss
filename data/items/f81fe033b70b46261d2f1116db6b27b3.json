  "title": "285: What’s the Point of Joy Right Now? | James Baraz",
  "description": "In my opinion, purveyors of joy can come off as oily and unctuous, even in the best of times. Like walking impersonations of Rainbow Brite. But in hard times, arguing for joy can seem pollyanna-ish or downright clueless. Our guest today reframes joy as supremely relevant and eminently doable. His name is James Baraz. He is the co-founder of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in California, and author of the book Awakening Joy. We talk about: why joy gets a bad rap; why it’s not a feel-good project, but instead a “feel-everything” project; and the role of meditation in taking on pressing issues such as climate and race. Also, stay tuned for a cameo from our producer, Marissa, who weighs in with a personal question.\nWhere to find James Baraz online:\nWebsite: https://www.awakeningjoy.info/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/baraz415\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/awakeningjoy10/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcjQ-YTKDv18nT6t3Abq1g\nBooks:\nAwakening Joy: 10 Steps to Happiness by James Baraz and Shoshana Alexander: https://bookshop.org/books/awakening-joy-10-steps-to-happiness/9781937006228\nAwakening Joy for Kids by James Baraz and Michele Lilyanna: https://bookshop.org/books/awakening-joy-for-kids-a-hands-on-guide-for-grown-ups-to-nourish-themselves-and-raise-mindful-happy-children-9781941529287/9781941529287\nJames Baraz leads the Awakening Joy course each year which people take from all over the world.
