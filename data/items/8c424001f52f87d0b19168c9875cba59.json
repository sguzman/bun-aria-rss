  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life, our hosts Angelina, Thomas and Cindy have a special guest on the podcast. Gina Dalfonzo is an author whose work has been featured in First Things, The Atlantic, Christianity Today, The Weekly Standard, National Review, The Gospel Coalition, and more! Gina has written a new book called <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/34vrsyI\">Dorothy and Jack: The Transforming Friendship of Dorothy L. Sayers and C. S. Lewis</a></em> which is the topic of discussion on today’s episode. Angelina opens the conversation asking Gina to share how she came to write this book exploring the relationship between Lewis and Sayers. <em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</span></em></p> <p>Other topics explored in this episode are the following: the influence of Oxford in Dorothy Sayers’ life and work, how Dorothy and Jack finally met one another, Lewis’ personal distaste for detective novels, and his praise for Sayers’ other work. They also talk at length about how Sayers and Lewis support each other in pushing the boundaries of their literary careers.</p> <h3>Find Gina Dalfonzo:</h3> <p>Facebook: <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/ginadalfonzo.author\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/ginadalfonzo.author</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginadalfonzo\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://twitter.com/ginadalfonzo</a><br /> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gina.dalfonzo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/gina.dalfonzo/</a> Dickensblog: <a href=\"https://dickensblog.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">https://dickensblog.typepad.com/</a></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>For life in general, there is but one decree: youth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a <em>regret</em>.</p> <cite>Benjamin Disraeli</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>There’s always surrender to humiliation and crucifixion, an emptying, before the glory.
