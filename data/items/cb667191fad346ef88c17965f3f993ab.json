  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by recently retired 13 year NFL veteran, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and friend of the show, Lorenzo Alexander. Pat and Lorenzo chat about the rumors floating around that the Bills are interested in bringing in Cam Newton, and whether or not he finds any truth in that, Pat chats with Lorenzo about his lifting weights now that he's retired, what he thinks the NFLPA will do if the league's salary cap goes down between $30-$80 million like some are predicting, and why Michael Jordan's gambling habits don't surprise him at all and wouldn't be out of place in an NFL locker room at all (1:59-21:52). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ dive into everything happening in the NFL and around the sports world. They discuss the upcoming UFC card this weekend and why AJ thinks that it will be an explosive thing everyone is going to want to watch, they discuss what they think of the upcoming NFL schedule release, and chat about a couple different landing spots for some of the big free agent names still available (21:54-1:40:55). Lastly, Louisville Head Football Coach, Scott Satterfield joins Pat and the boys. They chat about why he thinks the name and likeness rule could potentially harm college football and what some of his concerns are, how he thinks the NCAA could police it, what the major differences are when coming from a school like Appalachian St. to Louisville, and what he and his coaches have been doing to combat the quarantine thus far into their offseason program (1:40:57-1:55:21).
