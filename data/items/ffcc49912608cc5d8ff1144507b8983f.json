  "description": "<p>Mediocrity is on sale in our world today. It's cheap, easy to get, and there are even 2-for-1 discounts if you want to bring someone along with you. </p> <p>Why do we set the bar so low? And why do so many of us settle for a life of quiet desperation when we can live the life of our dreams? My friend Bo Eason has a problem with mediocrity, and he’s on fire to help people wake up to their true potential which (he will explain exactly why) is literally your birthright.</p> <p>Bo’s story is absolutely incredible. Going from elite NFL player, to critically acclaimed playwright and stage performer, he knows a thing or 10,000 about what it takes to become great at something. He also knows (and will share with you today) how to pivot and carve out a new path for yourself, why it takes just one person to change your entire life, and how to truly step into your power.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>What Bo did at the age of 9 that laid the foundation for his future.</li> <li>Why the plan for your life usually doesn’t look like it’s going to work out.</li> <li>Why Bo didn’t think his skills in football would transfer over into the real world.</li> <li>What life-changing advice Bo received from Al Pacino.</li> <li>Why most people fail miserably when they have the opportunity to learn from someone great (this will shock you!).</li> <li>How we are veritably hardwired to be winners.</li> <li>Why it’s so valuable to learn from the very best person in their respective field.</li> <li>Why practice needs to be the center of your universe.</li> <li>How rituals and practice give you more freedom in life.</li> <li>What some of Bo's most important daily rituals are.</li> <li>Why most people are late when opportunity presents itself.</li> <li>What Bo does to accelerate recovery and improve performance.</li> <li>What the #1 enemy in our lives is (this is important!).</li> <li>Why it's critical for us to expand what we are aiming for in life.</li> <li>What’s the #1 character trait we must have in order to be the best in the world.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/Model</a> <== Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organifi.com/model</a> ⇐ Use the coupon code modelhealth for 20% off & a free book</li> <li><a href= \"http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Sleep-Smarter-Audiobook/B01J4BK4MY/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1472608886&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sleep Smarter Audiobook</a> ⇐ Get the new audiobook here now!!!</li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/jay-papasan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The One Thing With Jay Papasan - The Model Health Show</a></li> <li>Connect with Bo Eason <a href=\"http://boeason.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Website</a> | <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/boeason21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoF4YFrPwjXg6Pq64cfvgrg\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a></li> </ul> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
