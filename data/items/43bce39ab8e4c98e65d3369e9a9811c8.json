For several years running, unbeknownst to us, Jen and Sarah would tweet each other about Lisa Kleypas’s empirically greatest hero—Derek Craven (We will not be taking questions at this time) — on February 4th. We took this as an important cosmic sign that that date would forever be immortalized as Derek Craven Day, and then Google confirmed it. Seriously, Google “Derek Craven Day.” We’ll wait.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, in advance of Derek Craven Day, we are rereleasing our deep dive episode on <em>Dreaming of You</em>, which was our first readalong episode of Season 2, in which we featured the Books that Blooded Us, or made us the romance readers we are today.
