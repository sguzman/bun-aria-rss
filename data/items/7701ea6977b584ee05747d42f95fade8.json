Probably the most famous cat mayor was Stubbs, who served as the honorary mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska.\n\nBut did you know a cat also recently served as the mayor of Hell? Yeah, and the cat didn’t even live there.\n\nJinx, a cat from California who became a viral internet sensation due to her big eyes and funny mannerisms, became the mayor of Hell, Michigan earlier this year for three years. You can go to Hell if you want, by the way. It has a population of 72 souls and is located about 20 miles northwest of Ann Arbor. And yes, being in Michigan, it regularly freezes over.\n\nNow, to be fair, ANYONE can become the mayor of Hell by filling out a form and paying a small fee. Becoming mayor for one hour is just $25.",
