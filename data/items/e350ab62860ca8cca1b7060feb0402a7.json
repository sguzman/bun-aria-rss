  "description": "<p>Why would anyone stop eating for 7-days?</p><p>That's what I first thought when I started hearing accounts of longer-term fasting. Insane. Nuts. Dangerous. Then, I started exploring the research. There is a growing interest in, and body of science around, longer-term fasting that is revealing some incredible benefits. Everything ranging from anti-inflammation and pain reduction to weight loss, disease risk reduction, positive epigenetic signaling, immune boosting, mental acuity and more. I got curious, so I decided to run my own experiment.</p><p>Last week, I fasted for 7-days. I was surprised by what happened on many levels. I detail what I did, why I did it, and the sometimes dramatic ways it affected me in today's podcast. Of course, all the usual precautions apply. It's absolutely not for everyone, it should be done (if at all) in conjunction with a qualified healthcare professional.
