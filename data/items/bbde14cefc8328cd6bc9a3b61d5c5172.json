  "description": "Two stories from the bawdy, funny, and oftentimes deeply unsettling 17th century fairytale author Giambattista Basile, both of which have to do with pets. The first pet is a rooster, whose owner just can't bring himself to kill it. No judgement there. The second pet is a flea...the size of a lamb.
