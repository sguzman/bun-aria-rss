Ross, a UW colleague whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, penned a particularly strong-worded critique: <a href=\"http://madhadron.com/posts/2014-08-30-frequentist_and_bayesian_statistics.html\">Bayesian vs frequentist: squabbling among the ignorant</a>. Here I want to briefly explore and respond to the points he makes in the post.",
