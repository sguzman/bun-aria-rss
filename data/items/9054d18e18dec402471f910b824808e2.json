They then get into all of the new music that was released over the weekend, including Cordae, Ant Clemons & J.I.D.,  and of course give their opinions. They also speak on re releasing mixtapes on DSP's.</p><p>Mal thinks the NY boys being allowed to play Fan Duel will lead to more poverty and robberies, and gives a warning to not gamble away money you can’t afford to lose. The guys discuss the rumored announcement of the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight (which has since been debunked by Tyson), and imagine what a fight and contract between them would look like, + more!</p>\n",
