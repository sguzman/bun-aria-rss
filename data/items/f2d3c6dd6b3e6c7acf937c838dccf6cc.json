  "description": "<p>Today we take a huge deviation for the type of topic we typically cover here on Timesuck. The Space Lizards on Patreon vote on two topics a month through the app, and for today, they voted in my grandfather who passed away back on December 23rd. Probably the most influential person in my life. Today, I cover how the Hall family ended up in Idaho which leads to a history of Idaho settlement. My great-great-grandfather was one of the area's first homesteaders. I also share a lot of stories from my childhood, about central Idaho, and of course Papa Ward. I take you on a timeline of this man's wonderful, inspiring life. He meant a Hell of a lot to me and always will, and I think you'll like the tale of his impressive life. Hail Papa Ward :) <br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions give $12,500 this month to the <strong>USC Shoah Foundation.</strong>  <strong></strong>Click the link to learn more: <a href=\"https://sfi.usc.edu/\"><strong>https://sfi.usc.edu/</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ns3yVzMB7Cc\">https://youtu.be/ns3yVzMB7Cc</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
