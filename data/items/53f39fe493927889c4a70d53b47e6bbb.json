Durant, a former league MVP who had missed time with a calf problem, sustained an Achilles injury during the game. It has prompted billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to call for the league and players union to invest in research into diagnostic tools that would allow for proactive analysis of tendons and ligaments. Cuban said it's worth the investment, even if the payoff is more than a decade away. Also discussed are the U.S. Women's Soccer team's 13-0 win over Thailand, and Forbes's list of highest paid athletes, which is topped by a trio of soccer players: Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
