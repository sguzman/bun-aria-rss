  "description": "<p>Joél Leon is a storyteller, performer, poet, musician, and author. Born and raised in the Bronx, from the earliest age, art, performing and music became both a refuge and a source of creative expression. He’d eventually land a spot at the famed New York High School for Performing Arts, where Joél continued to hone his theatrical chops. But driving it was always a fierce devotion to language and writing that led him to deepen into the craft and become a powerful voice and public storyteller exploring everything from parenting, joy, mental health, creativity, and performance to race, activism, and justice. Leon's work and devotion to revelation, truthtelling, and elevation have led to appearances at the legendary Apollo Theater, TED, TODAY Show, Joe's Pub, Rockwood Music Hall, Columbia University, NYU, Webster Hall, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Joél Leon at:</p><p>Website : http://mydaughtermayhave.com/</p><p>Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/joelakamag/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
