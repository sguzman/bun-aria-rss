  "description": "<p>Why Health Coaches Are Behavior Change Ninjas | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://swannies.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Swanwick</a></p><br><p>Most health plans, whether they’re about losing weight, exercising more, or quitting bad habits, aren’t designed to last. This is because they’re based on an incorrect assumption that all you need is willpower and motivation. In truth, we all need a support system to help guide us toward sustainable behavior and lifestyle change. And the reality is that the majority of healthcare actually happens outside of the doctor’s office.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee and Chris Kresser about why behavior change recommendations from healthcare providers are largely ineffective, and why having the support of a health coach can make all the difference in achieving your health goals.</p><br><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential medical doctors in the UK and hosts the most listened to health podcast in the UK and Europe, ‘Feel Better, Live More’. His first three books have all been #1 Sunday Times Bestsellers and his latest, Feel Better in 5, shows people how to transform their health in just 5 minutes. It has been a smash hit in the UK, selling almost 100,000 copies in just 7 months, and has just been published in the United States. Professor BJ Fogg, the world’s leading expert in human behavior, calls this book, \"one of the best habit change programs he has seen—deceptively simple but remarkably effective.” Dr. Chatterjee regularly appears on BBC News and Television and has been featured in numerous international publications including The New York Times, Forbes, The Guardian and Vogue, and his TED talk, How To Make Disease Disappear, has been viewed almost 3 million times.</p><br><p>Chris Kresser M.S., L.Ac is the co-director of the California Center for Functional Medicine, founder of Kresser Institute, and the New York Times bestselling author of The Paleo Cure and Unconventional Medicine. He is one of the most respected clinicians and educators in the fields of Functional Medicine and ancestral health and has trained over 1,500 clinicians and health coaches in his unique approach. His health coaching program, called ADAPT, is the one I recommend for my staff at Cleveland Clinic and he’s the guy I trust with my own health.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Swanwick.
