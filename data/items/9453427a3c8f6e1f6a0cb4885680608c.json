How do you get back on the path and into that pocket of flow, where you’re center?\n\nI am a big believer that the creative journey often goes hand and hand with the journey of personal discovery, liberation and breakthrough.\n\nThis conversation with Jamie Drake is such a beautiful testament to this idea.\n\nIn 2019, Jamie released her debut album “Everything’s Fine”. This record captures the creative journey so fully, that I was desperate to get her on the show to dive deep into the process of arriving at this gorgeous creative statement.\n\nHUGE thanks to Jamie for being so gracious with her time and her story. This conversation is deeply personal and is such a gift to our community!
