  "description": "Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist at the Oxford Club and editor of the Oxford Income Letter, shares a simple formula investors can use to determine if a dividend is safe.  This is important since many companies - notably in the energy sector - are suspending their dividends.  He also recommends two of his favorite dividend paying stocks to buy right now.  \nMarc then explains why speculative stocks are suitable for almost any portfolio.  He shows investors - by using a four-rule system - how to find these potential 5-baggers without taking huge risks.  \n \nFinally, Marc breaks down the biotech industry.  This is a sector of the market he's been covering for almost a decade.  Marc suggests investors should be buying biotech stocks on the recent pullback. However, he explains why one particular area within the sector should be avoided at all costs. ",
