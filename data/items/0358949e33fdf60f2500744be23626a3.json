  "title": "1989: sex, lies and videotape: Rob Lowe and James Spader (Erotic 80s Part 12)",
  "description": "American independent film is launched into the mainstream by Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies and videotape, starring James Spader as an impotent man who gets off on filming women talking about sex. Videotape also plays a role in a Spader film released almost simultaneously, Bad Influence, in which he plays a meek yuppie at the mercy of alpha male Rob Lowe – who was trying to rehabilitate his career after a tape leaked shot by the actor and documenting his real-life threesomes — one with a 16 year-old girl. We close the first half of this season talking about Lowe, Spader and how camcorder mediation of sex changed pop culture forever.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
