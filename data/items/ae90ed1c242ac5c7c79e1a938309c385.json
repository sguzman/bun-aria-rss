  "description": "<p>Have you ever fantasized about having your own farm? On today's show, five fierce female farmers dish the dirt on their profession as part of the \"So You Want to be a Farmer?\" panel from this year's Cherry Bombe Jubilee conference. From a fashion editor/orchard owner to a leader in the food justice movement, our panelists are as inspiring as they are hard working. Moderator Erin Fairbanks, Heritage Radio Network executive director and host of The Farm Report podcast, talks with Katie Baldwin and Amanda Merrow of Amber Waves Farm; Leah Penniman of Soul Fire Farm; Molly Culver of The Youth Farm; and Laura Ferrara of Westwind Orchard. This panel was part of our third annual Jubilee conference, which was held earlier this year at the High Line Hotel in New York and featured interviews and talks with some of the most interesting women in the world of food. More than 300 guests attend the sold-­out conference each year to network, hear the speakers, and enjoy food from the city’s hottest female­-run businesses.</p>\n",
