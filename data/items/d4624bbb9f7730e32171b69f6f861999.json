  "description": "<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of people have been feeling out of sorts: angry, sad, frustrated, and just plain bummed out. Part of the reason for these feelings is obvious, and part has been hard to articulate and understand.<br /><br />That's probably why <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief\">a recent interview the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> did with <a href=\"grief.com\">David Kessler</a> went viral when it named the issue point blank. Kessler said what we're all experiencing is grief. He's an expert on the subject who worked with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, creator of the famous five stages of grief, and also added his own sixth stage to the roadmap to loss.<br />That interview resonated so much with me and others, that I thought it would be useful to bring Kessler on the show to talk through his perspective in a short, special episode of the AoM podcast. Kessler walks us through how the five stages of grief explain how we're often feeling these days during the pandemic, and how we can also work through the sixth stage of grief, in order to find meaning in a dark time.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/grief\">aom.is/grief</a>.</p>\n",
