  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Our friend, Brandon O’Brien, is back on the show to discuss his new book “Not From Around Here.” Drawing from his upbringing in rural Arkansas and his new life in Manhattan, O’Brien examines the divide between urban and rural Americans, and how the divisions are hurting both the country and the church. He also explores the best way to heal the divisions and move forward. His wisdom is exactly what we need heading into an election year. Also this week: Francis Chan announces he’s moving to Asia to be a missionary and offers a few parting shots at the American church. Plus, why we might need fewer teachers and preachers if we really want to advance the mission of Christ. And, Soviet nuclear cannibal ants are on the march.</p>",
