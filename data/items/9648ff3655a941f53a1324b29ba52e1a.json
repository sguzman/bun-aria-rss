OP finished up first, so he started the call while his girlfriend finished up next to him. Unfortunately, OP forgot to mute his microphone! So when his girlfriend crosses the finish line, his mic picks up the sound and his window lights up to let everybody in the class know where the noise came from.</p>\n",
