  "description": "<p><b>It’s our second week in 1 Thessalonians! Raechel and Amanda read the rest of the apostle Paul’s letter with Jonathan Pitts, a pastor, author, and father of four. Having walked through his own season of grief recently, Jonathan speaks to the believer’s hope that death is not final and every loss will find its resurrection in Jesus. From Paul’s instructions (or “four-word sermons”) on practical holiness, to his beautiful benediction, the three friends discuss how we are called to live lives of daily faithfulness that ring out for Christ until the day we are united with Him. They also celebrate the reality that He who calls us is faithful—He will do what He has promised!</b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 2 of the She Reads Truth 1 & 2 Thessalonians reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the 1 & 2 Thessalonians collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='http://shereadstruth.com/podcast/1-2-thessalonians-week-2-with-jonathan-pitts'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/1-2-thessalonians-week-2-with-jonathan-pitts</b></a></p>",
