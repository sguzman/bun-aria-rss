    "media:description": "Happy Friday! On today’s IGN The Fix: Games, \n\nAside from Fortnite and a couple of low-profile free-to-play efforts, there aren’t many games running on Unreal Engine 5 that have actually been released at this point. There have been impressive, official demos like The Matrix Awakens. Unofficial fan projects that imagine what games might look like in cutting-edge tech. The YouTube channel TeaserPlay is one such group of creators.\n\nAs revealed on the PlayStation Blog, Sony has announced the PlayStation Plus games for November 2022 are Nioh 2, LEGO Harry Potter Collection, and Heavenly Bodies. All three games will be made available at no extra cost to all PlayStation Plus subscribers on November 1. Nioh 2 is the Soulslike sequel released in 2020 that thrusts the player into the supernatural world of Japanese legend, fighting as a samurai imbued with the supernatural Yokai.\n\nElevator Action Returns S-Tribute is a port of the Sega Saturn version of the cult classic. It’s out on December 1st.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
