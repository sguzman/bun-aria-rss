Don’t even get us started on his sons, Lachlan and James, who are so pissed at each other they’re about ready to rip off their shirts and fight it out. Something’s gotta give or else Rupert’s empire, the one he spent his whole life building, might just crumble.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Be sure to check out “Planet Fox,” the incredible three-part story about the Murdochs that ran in the New York Times Magazine: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
