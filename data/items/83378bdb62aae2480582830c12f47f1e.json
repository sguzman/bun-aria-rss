  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, what happened in Buffalo, NY was horrible and this 18-year-old killer should face the death penalty but he can’t because it’s NY. As the nation becomes more diverse because of immigration and other reasons it's even more of a need to keep the nation together. The racist shooter chose that supermarket because it had a high number of African Americans and knew they'd be defenseless because it was New York State, and they have stringent gun laws. He admits to studying communism and rejects the left and the right. Then, replacement theory as it's been referred to by the media is the notion that non-whites are replacing whites is also a Lat-crit policy promoted by the left. Yet they blame Donald Trump for promoting racism and hate. If you believe in a color-blind society, they say something is wrong with you. That goes directly against our national motto 'E Pluribus Unum' (out of many, one). Later, the FDA created this baby formula shortage with their extensive regulations. Its consumers who decide which products are bought and sold, not the government. Also, it's important to send someone to the US Senate that can win and Kathy Barnette's derogatory comments about gays and Muslims put her at a disadvantage to win in the general election. Afterward, Sen. Ted Cruz joins the show to reiterate that Putin must be defeated, and Russia must lose. Cruz discussed his vote to assist Ukraine and blamed President Biden's weakness warning that China is taking note of it. Cruz agrees with Reagan's mantra of 'peace through strength.' Finally, Rep. Ted Budd calls in for an update on his campaign for the US Senate in North Carolina. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
