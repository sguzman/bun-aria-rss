  "description": "Super Mind: How to Boost Performance and Live a Richer and Happier Life Through Transcendental Meditation. Rosenthal explains how we can improve our state of mind by practising TM placing us into a super-mind state of consciousness. This book confused me. I was expecting a 'how to' into how I can perform TM and implement it into my life. Rosenthal during the book explains all the life-changing aspects that TM has but without actually revealing how the reader can achieve it. The author recommends to sign-up for a TM practitioner, however many of us want an introduction before committing long-term. There is little space dedicated to how we can approach learning TM individually, which surprises me. The way it was written left little to the imagination as well as it contained, name-dropping mostly and examples of how TM is life-changing. I don't doubt this, but I was expecting a lot more from this book. I rate it two stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
