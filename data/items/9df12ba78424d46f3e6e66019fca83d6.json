  "description": "Here are the slides from a talk I gave the Sydney machine learning meetup on Siegelmann and Sontag&#8217;s paper from 1995 “On the Computational Power of Neural Nets”, showing that recurrent neural networks are Turing complete. It is a fantastic paper, though it is a lot to present in a single talk.
