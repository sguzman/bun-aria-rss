  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat is Live from 4 World Trade Center in New York City with new friend of the show and hilarious comedian, Paul Virzi. They discuss the current climate of comedy and how things have changed since he started, and how it has gotten more difficult keeping audiences happy with the current outrage culture, how Bill Burr initially discovered him and what their relationship with each other is like, his love for the New York Giants and what he thinks of the whole Daniel Jones situation and whether or not he was excited when the Giants first drafted him. Pat and Paul also chat about how sad the whole Antonio Brown saga is, what the final straw was for Giants fans with Odell Beckham, and other things going on in the NFL on an overreaction Monday. You can check out Paul’s special “I’ll Say This,” streaming now on Comedy Central, his album “Night At The Stand,” on iTunes, and The Virzi Effect Podcast wherever podcasts are found. Today’s show is an absolute blast. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
