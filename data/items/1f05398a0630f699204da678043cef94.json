  "description": "<p>It's day two of a Minifan onslaught directed toward the phone lines of WEEI. Kirk's prediction of an Andy Gresh breakdown by midday Wednesday didn't pan out... It turned out to be Noon on Monday (00:07:01). Justin continues to put on an impressive display on the Kirk Minihane Network rallying the Minifans. Day two has proved to be even more effective as WEEI appears to have shut down the phone lines. Minifans from all over are reporting that they can't get through using a hidden number. Kirk announced that four individuals who call the most will have the opportunity to sit in on an episode of the show and that the top two would have lunch with Kirk and crew. Old audio of Gresh complaining about Kirk making fun of him on air is discussed (00:26:04).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
