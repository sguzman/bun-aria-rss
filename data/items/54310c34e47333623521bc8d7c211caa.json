Tune in to this week’s episode of <em>Eat Your Words</em> as guest host Talia Ralph chats with Sarah Huck and Brian Nicholson, the duo behind<br />\n<em>Fruitful: Four Seasons of Fresh Fruit Recipes</em> . <em>Fruitful</em> is a trip to the local orchard, overflowing with ripe, seasonal produceâ€”and it’s not just desserts! From sweet to savory, including fresh juices, every chapter is devoted to the produce of the moment: rhubarb, strawberries, apples, plums, apricots, peaches, quinces, pears, and more. This delectable cookbook showcases the bounty from New York’s favorite orchard, Red Jacket Orchards, illustrated with gorgeous full-color photography throughoutâ€”but all of the fruit can be found wherever you live.
