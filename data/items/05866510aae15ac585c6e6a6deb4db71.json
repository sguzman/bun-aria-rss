  "title": "ðŸš¨ Anthony Lynn fired by the Chargers after 4 seasons - Emergency Podcast (Football 1/4)",
  "description": "In a mildly surprising move, the Chargers have parted ways with head coach Anthony Lynn. The team surged late in the season, so we weren't sure if this emergency podcast was coming, but ultimately in-game mistakes cost Lynn his job. Will Brinson breaks down the decision and what plagued Lynn's LA tenure and speaks to the desirability of this new opening. With Justin Herbert as the franchise QB, the Chargers gig has to be one of the most attractive on the market. But who will fulfill that role?
