  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, what is the purpose of immigration? ICE and the border patrol have been effectively defunded. The ruling class is completely disconnected from the American people and they're trying to change the country for various reasons. They reject the idea that open borders are to change the make-up of the country to further their control, but this is precisely what happens when you have open borders. Interestingly the Administration and the media will not cover the atrocities occurring at the border whether it's crimes against women and children, fentanyl trafficking, or the rampant number of migrants just simply crossing right into the U.S under the phony guise of asylum. Then, the government redistributes the wealth you create. The tax dollars of hard-working Americans are paying to forcefully undo this country racially, economically, and educationally. Later, FDR used the institutions of the modern left, the FBI and the media, against political opponents and used the New York Times to tamp down coverage of the Holocaust. Yet some leftists will project that anyone who is against illegal immigration is a fascist Nazi. Afterward, Sen. Mike Lee joins the show to discuss his re-election campaign in Utah. Lee highlighted the need to prevent Schumer and the Democrats from having an additional vote to add more spending to inflation on the American people. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
