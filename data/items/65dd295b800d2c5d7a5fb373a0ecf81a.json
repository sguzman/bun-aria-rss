  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP has a nutty neighbor who believes that OP should just give her a huge piece of his property so that she can build a swimming pool. She demands OP to come to her house and sign over his driveway to her. When OP refuses, she says that she will take it from him with or without his help, so he may as well make it easy on everyone. And the best part: we have a voicemail! Yep, this video has a voicemail from a crazy, ranting Karen about how she deserves someone else's property.</p>\n",
