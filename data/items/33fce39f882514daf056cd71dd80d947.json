  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our Trailblazer episodes continue this week with Jayne Ann Krentz, who has done it all: writing for Vivian Stephens, writing historicals, writing contemporaries, writing space-set, fantasy, and paranormal romance, writing nonfiction about romance. In addition to managing life as JAK, Amanda Quick, Stephanie James and more, she’s also a legend of the genre because of her vocal resistance to the way society, literature and academia talks about romance novels. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In this episode, we talk about her journey and the way she continually reinvented herself to keep writing, about the importance of writers’ core stories, about genre and myth making, and about the role of romance in the world. We could not be more grateful to Jayne Ann Krentz for making time for Fated Mates. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, our first read-along of the year will be Lisa Valdez’s <em>Passion</em>, an erotic historical published in 2005 that is W-I-L-D.

Now she publishes under 3 names: Jayne Ann Krenz (contemporary), Jayne Castle (speculative fiction romance), and Amanda Quick (historical). She has said, “I am often asked why I use a variety of pen names. The answer is that this way readers always know which of my three worlds they will be entering when they pick up one of my books.”</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/10/3/s0404-ravished-by-amanda-quick\">We read Ravished for the podcast</a>&nbsp;in 2021, or three decades ago.
