  "description": "Amir Adnani, Founder and Chairman of Brazil Resources, talks about the recent 300% surge in his stock.  He breaks down what's next for the company and how he plans to more than double the company's gold deposits - which now stand at over 11 million ounces.    Amir also discusses Brazil Resources' huge uranium asset.  This asset - which surrounds Areva's super high-grade Maybelle River deposit - could be valued at more than $50 million, or 40% of the market-cap of the company.  Yet, the \"Street\" is assigning no value to this large high-grade deposit.  Finally, Amir talks about the state of the gold markets.  He sees prices going higher over the mid to longer term.  If he's right, this should be great news for Brazil Resources which has become one of the premier standouts in the huge junior resource sector.",
