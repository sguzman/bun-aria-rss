  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, does anyone understand the Biden Administration's position on mask-wearing and vaccines? The CDC refuses to release any data on how they get to their guidance. If vaccinated people have to wear a mask just like those that aren't, they have lost that as an incentive. This will only discourage people from getting vaccinated. Biden's $100 bribe to get vaccinated might appeal to some, but it doesn't change the open border allowing people into the country with limited or non-existent testing and vaccinations. These arguments aren't based on data or logic and the American public expects and deserves better. Then, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 17 other Republicans sold out on \"infrastructure.\" Biden claims that this bill will tackle climate change and racism through increased spending. Later, social movement theory is widely taught in colleges and universities as is oppositional protesting. It is critical that Americans understand what the challenge is, how it is shrouded and how to defeat it. Finally, China is meeting with the Taliban while Biden’s proposed defense budget calls for a increase in the Department of Defense’s civilian workforce while reducing the number of active-duty troops. The damage Biden is doing to America, foreign and domestic, is unimaginable.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
