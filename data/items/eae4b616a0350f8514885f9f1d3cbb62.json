  "description": "<p>This is an episode with some great recordings of both audible and EVP sounds! Paranormal investigator and listener Josh Kitchen joins us to share his experiences and evidence from Moundsville State Penitentiary! The West Virginia Penitentiary is located in Moundsville, so most people know it as Moundsville State Penitentiary. In its day, it was one of the most violent prisons in the United States. The Gothic architecture of the building resembles a castle with turrets and battlements. This place truly was a fortress, not as protection from outside forces, but to keep the bad inside. It would seem that some of the inmates of the prison still remain in the afterlife. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Moundsville State Penitentiary! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features Bella in the Wych Elm and This Day in History is by Krisitn Swintek and features the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures are here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-116-moundsville-state-prison.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/04/hgb-ep-116-moundsville-state-prison.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com.historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com.historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Join us at the forum: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.freeforums.net/\">http://historygoesbump.freeforums.net/</a></p> <p> </p>",
