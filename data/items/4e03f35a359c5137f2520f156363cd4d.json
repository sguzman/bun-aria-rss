  "description": "<p>Bran Castle is more famously known as Dracula Castle. Originally, the Teutonic Knights claimed this spot and had a wooden fortress on the site in the 1200s, but eventually a new castle would be built and it possibly might have been a place where Vlad the Impaler passed through. Queen Maria would take possession in the 1920s and turn the fortress into a fairytale castle. Bram Stoker chose this location as the setting for part of his novel \"Dracula.\" Stoker never visited the castle and thus his description does not match reality. Count Dracula never lived here either being that he is fictious. But the history connected to the castle gives it an ominous mystique, one that would lead many to believe the castle is haunted. But is it? And what of the lore about vampires? Are they real? Join us as we examine the history and hauntings of Bran Castle. The Moment in Oddity features the Vetala and This Day in History features the Women's March on Versailles.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-73-bran-castle.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-73-bran-castle.html</a></p> <p><em>Music featuring This is Halloween by Kayzo & LooKas can be found here:   <a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/kayzo-music/this-is-halloween-kayzo-x-lookas\"> https://soundcloud.com/kayzo-music/this-is-halloween-kayzo-x-lookas</a></em></p> <p>Help the show grow!
