  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane sets out to explore new feuds in the Minifan World and ends up discovering his love of poetry. The guy from Saved by The Bell is apologizing for expressing his opinion on a hot button issue. Blind Mike is ratcheting up his efforts to get paid, but Minihane's not ready to fork over his own credit card. The worst morning radio show in history sinks further with the worst interview of the most boring person in Boston. Maybe someone could chronicle the fall of WEEI in some form of literature?Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
