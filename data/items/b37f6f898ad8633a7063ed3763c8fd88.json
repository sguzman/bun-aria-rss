It's full of elves, giants, trolls, gods, deadly mistletoe and eight-legged horse babies. Anything goes in a world created from the decapitated body of a giant where a squirrel runs communications! But what was the ultimate purpose of these stories? Who wrote them? And what do they teach us about Viking culture?\n\nProduced by Cornelius Mendez\nScript by Greg Jenner and Emma Nagouse\nResearch by Charlotte Potter & Hannah Mackenzie\n\nA production by The Athletic for BBC Radio 4.",
