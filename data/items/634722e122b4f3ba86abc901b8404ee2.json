  "description": "<p>Maitland Gaol is considered Australia's hardest jail. For nearly twenty years the gaol has stood empty, but for 150 years this jail housed some of Australia's worst criminals. Behind the sandstone and razor-wire of this modern day tourist attraction, some of the worst brutality occurred from murders to rape and of course, suicides. Inmates claim that the cells were concrete coffins. This kind of energy and emotion usually feeds unexplained activity. Rumors of hauntings permeate the stories about the gaol. Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Maitland Gaol! Moment in History features the Fertility Chair and This Day in History features Francis Scott Key being inspired to write the Star Spangled Banner.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Check out the show notes:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-68-maitland-gaol.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-68-maitland-gaol.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer of the show:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
