  "description": "On the last episode of Working at MoMA we are, quite appropriately, exiting through the gift shop. Though, in MoMA’s case the term gift shop might be a little misleading. \nJordan talks to Maggie Berry, the associate director of retail marketing for the MoMA Design Store. As you’ll hear, the Design Store goes beyond your typical mugs and T shirt souvenir shopping. The store is dedicated to beautifully and cleverly designed items that range from a remarkably quiet shower cap to a brilliantly company piano. Each item has been carefully selected or created by the museum itself in collaboration with some of your favorite artists.  \nYou can email us at working@slate.com.\nPodcast production by Jessamine Molli.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
