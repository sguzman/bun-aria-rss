  "description": "<div> <p>We stayed up impossibly late one night because we just had to know how Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s <em>The Gods of Jade and Shadow</em> ends. (Sleep is overrated when you need to know if a young woman can help the Mayan God of Death reclaim his throne in Jazz-era Mexico). We did it again with the creepy, unsettling <em>Mexican Gothic</em>, one of our favorite books last year, and again with <em>The Beautiful Ones</em>, our May 2021 Speculative Fiction Monthly Pick. Silvia joins us on the show to talk about her new noir, Velvet Was the Night, breaking convention and writing across genres for each of her books, the importance of storytelling, and more. Featured titles: Velvet was the Night and Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia and Bath Haus by P.J. Vernon. Hosted/Produced by Kat Sarfas and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p> </p> <p>Poured Over is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Stitcher. New episodes land Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p> <p> </p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p> </div>",
