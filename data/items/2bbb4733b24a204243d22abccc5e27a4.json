She and Anna delve into gender politics issues in journalism and Hollywood, and discuss Katie's work on a thought-provoking new documentary about gender identity. The conversation gets even more personal when Anna, Katie, and Sim discuss their experiences with internet trolls and cyberbullying. And you might be surprised about what Katie thinks are dating dealbreakers! The gang also plays a game called \"Rapper or Politician?\" and Katie teaches Anna a \"valley girl\" cheer (as well as correct Hebrew pronunciation).
