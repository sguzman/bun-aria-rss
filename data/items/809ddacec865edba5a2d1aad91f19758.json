  "description": "<p>Why do so many people have strongly negative feelings about the field of psychology?  I think there are a handful of reasons and in this episode I talk about two of them: the so-called \"self-esteem movement\" and the \"positive thinking\" movement.  Are psychologists responsible for why \"kids today\" appear to be so self-centered? Do psychologists think that changing yourself is as simple as just changing the way you think?  Hear one psychologists opinion on this and my explanation on two reasons why I think maybe you hate psychology.  Just hear me out.</p>",
