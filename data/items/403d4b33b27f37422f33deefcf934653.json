  "description": "<p>Excited to bring you another epic interview today as we chat with two-time Aussie Olympic snowboarder Adam Lambert about his incredible career and even more incredible Olympic experiences! We find out from Adam just how being strapped to a snowboard at 18 months old helped him on his journey towards the Olympics and how his supportive parents fueled that passion even more. We also find out which other sport he could've potentially gone to the Olympics in and when the Olympic bug finally bit him with snowboarding. Added to that we learn about how the influence of the late great Chumpy Pullin still is felt on the Australian team, just how the disappointment of Beijing is spurring him on towards the next Olympics and how sharing the name with a famous singer impacts his life. It's another entertaining and insightful chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
