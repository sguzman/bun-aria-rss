The nation has an incredibly strong social security system, with universal healthcare, robust retirement pensions, as well as allowances for maternity leave.</p>\n<p>And These kinds of policies are mirrored in other areas as well, the nation is home to relatively high tax rates, and the protections for employees are very strong almost to the point that people joke it is impossible to be fired in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So this kind of looks like a liberal paradise right? Well, it would if it were not hiding a dirty little secret.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This postcard-perfect little nation is according to the world bank the most unequal place on earth, and the extent of the inequality is simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have explored south Africa on the channel before, which normally gets this less than desirable title.
