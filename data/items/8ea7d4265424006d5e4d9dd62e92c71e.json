    "media:description": "After the manganese heptoxide video on NileRed, I had a lot of manganese and acid waste that I had to deal with.\n\nI initially planned to be done after isolating the waste, but as the last minute, I decided to try melting it. I don't consider that to be part of the waste processing though, and it's more of an experiment on its own.\n\nIn general, I don't recommend heating waste because it can sometimes be dangerous and it can also generate toxic fumes. \n\nCheck These Out:\n• NileRed: https://www.youtube.com/c/nilered\n• Link to the manganese heptoxide video on NileRed: https://youtu.be/2BZGjycR7YM\n• Nile talks about lab safety (Chemistry is Dangerous):  https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZA\n• NileBlue Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nileblue2\n\nMerch Store: https://nilered.tv/store\n\n-------------------------------------------",
