  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, we’ll be exploring the ancient migration of mallard ducks and why the place they choose as a primary wintering ground -- Arkansas -- is called the “Duck Hunting Capital of the World.” We're exploring why this reputation has lasted the test of time. We’ll talk with the lead waterfowl biologist of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Luke Naylor, and the new director of the agency, Austin Booth. We'll get a good lesson in waterfowl biology and the Mississippi flyway. We’ll go into the flooded timber and hunt with a world-champion duck caller, Jimbo Ronquest, and lastly, we’ll talk with ornithologist and author, Scott Wiednesal about the mystery of migration. We’ll even hear from Sean Weaver of MeatEater. The lineup is stacked, the knowledge drop will be thick, and we’ll be getting an introduction to how the Green Tree Reservoirs -- the flood prone hardwood bottoms of Arkansas are in jeopardy, and what the plan is to save them. It would not be possible for you to intentionally want to miss this one. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
