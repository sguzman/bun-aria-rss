  "description": "<p>Ever notice how a growth mindset leads to opportunity and success and how a poverty mindset leaves you with nothing but want, and often spirals downwards into an ongoing funk? We have to use our physical state to change our mental state, and vice versa. There’s a feedback loop between our bodies and brains, which is why mindset and behavior are so powerful for creating the reality we desire.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This week on The Doctor’s Farmacy I dig into how to do that, and so much more, with Tom Bilyeu. Tom a filmmaker and serial entrepreneur who chased money hard for nearly a decade and came up emotionally bankrupt. To that end, he and his partners sold their technology company and founded Quest Nutrition—a company predicated not on money, but rather on creating value for people with the mission to end metabolic disease, something impacting Tom’s own family. After exiting Quest and generating extraordinary personal wealth, Bilyeu turned his attention to the other pandemic facing society, the poverty of poor mindset. To solve the mindset problem at scale and help hundreds of millions of people adopt an empowering mindset he has co-founded the media studio, Impact Theory with his business partner and wife, Lisa Bilyeu. Their aim is to influence the cultural subconscious by creating content that empowers people.</p><br><p>This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by ButcherBox.
