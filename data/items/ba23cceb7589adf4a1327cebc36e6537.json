  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Media Matters has libeled this program by maliciously taking fragments of statements made and twisting them to intentionally change the clear meaning that Democrats within the media label everyone that they disagree with as \"racists.\" Then, the ongoing investigation into the January 6th riot is the biggest investigation in U.S history, according to the Attorney General. The Democrats and never-Trump Republicans on the Congressional select-committee have now issued new subpoenas into Trump's senior team. This is nothing more than another political hit job by the Democrats with the patina of a fair oversight investigation. Later, Lt. Governor-elect, Winsome Sears, a Jamaican immigrant is attacked By Michael Eric Dyson as being a Black mouth with a White supremacist tongue. The analysts on MSNBC are all towing the same racist line too. This has nothing to do with race and everything to do with dehumanizing society and promoting their hateful American Marxist agenda in classrooms and elsewhere. Afterward, Former White House Trade Advisor, Peter Navarro, calls in to discuss his new book \"In Trump Time: My Journal of America’s Plague Year.\" Navarro shared personal anecdotes of his years in the Trump Administration and how he witnessed the media lie by omission on various occasions including regarding the coronavirus.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
