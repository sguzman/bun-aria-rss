  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WPHT Radio host Rich Zeoli, fills in for Mark.The Democrats want to expand government and create a new social contract. Moreover, there is no pandemic exemption in the Bill of Rights. What is the difference between putting on a mask and going to a big box home improvement store and putting on a mask to go to one's house of worship? None. Americans are smart enough to adapt, whether its installing plexi-glass barriers, doing curb-side pick-ups, or wearing masks, individuals don't need the government's guidance to live their lives. Governors cannot prevent Americans from worshiping their God or earning a living. Then, former VP Joe Biden tells black Americans, you \"ain't black\" if you vote for President Trump. What's more, Biden still has a hurdle to overcome stemming from his 1990's support for the Clinton Crime Bill, which incarcerated a record number of African Americans. Later, Democrats would love to swap out Biden for someone more popular like Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo who's now infamous for ordering COVID-19 patients into nursing homes. Cuomo subsequently presided over the deaths of senior citizens in those homes ultimately accounting for 33% of all coronavirus deaths in America.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
