  "description": "SOFIA FRANKLYN IS GETTING A BBL!\nKim and Kylie are QUAKING. No seriously, that is our fearless leaders spontaneous decision of the week. We’ll see where we’re at 7 days from now. WELCOME BACK TO SOFIA WITH AN F! This week Sofia is, of course, back on her bullshit. Aside from her impending body reconstruction surgery, we get into some fun stuff today. Are you SICK of seeing your boyfriend (who’s not really your boyfriend) scroll through his Instagram feed and watching him quickly scroll past Sommer Ray girate her oiled up ass? You and everyone else…well, except your boyfriend. Luckily for you, Sofia is breaking down the laws of social media with your significant other. Professor Sloot then takes us on a VERY important lesson on how to identify and rid yourself of the narcissists in your life. They’re around you…and they WILL try to ruin you with no remorse - because they simply don’t feel anything! Finally, Sofia spits some HARD HITTING facts that may have you looking at your wrists and feet just a tad differently…it’s all out of love though. Only the best for the Sloots, and that’s what the fuck you’re getting.
