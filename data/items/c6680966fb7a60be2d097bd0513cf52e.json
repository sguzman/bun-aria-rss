  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump drew out lie after lie from former VP Joe Biden at last night's debate. Trump brilliantly called Biden to the carpet for not implementing any of his grandiose plans when he had the opportunity to implement them during his 47 years in public office. Then, the most glaring fact-check was when Biden claimed that he's never called to end fracking and challenged Trump to put the video of him saying it on his website. Trump tweeted it. Biden's 110-page manifesto known as the unity task force document on his campaign website was taken to task. The radical energy plan, co-authored by Rep. AOC, will cripple our economy and dramatically raise costs. It will also destroy our energy-production capacity. Later, former President Barack Obama lied more than 36 times saying that people who had health insurance would be able to keep it. This was false. Yet, Joe Biden told that same lie at the final presidential debate and it went unchecked by the moderator. Plus, one question that was obviously missing from the debate was the one regarding any formal denial of the Hunter Biden laptop. Biden won't say that it's not Hunter's laptop, and even Hunter has come forward to deny that it's his. This is the most corrupt media in American history. Afterward, Senator Lindsey Graham joins the show to discuss the 100 million-dollar attack on his campaign. Graham has fought hard to support Trump and now the DNC is after him. Finally, Senate candidate Daniel Gade calls in with an update on his campaign against Mark Warner, his military service, and how he's being outspent by the Democrats.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
