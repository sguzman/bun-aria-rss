  "title": "191 - Serial Killers Leonard Lake and Charles Ng",
  "description": "<p>Haven't heard of these two? By the end of today's tale, you'll be shocked that they're not much more infamous. Lake and Ng most likely killed over 25 people in central and northern California in the early 80s. Lake was a former Marine obsessed with preparing for a nuclear apocalypse, taking nude photos of as many women as possible, having sex with as many of those women as possible, and pursuing what he called, “Operation Miranda” - a sick plan based on the novel The Collector, that involved kidnapping young women to imprison and train to be sex slaves. And his murder-buddy, Charles Ng, was arguably scarier than he was. And now one of these men is dead and the other is in prison for life. Find out who lived and who died and how much terror these two inflicted on those around them in a fascinating true crime edition of Timesuck! <strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>New standup special and album,</strong> <strong>Get Outta Here; Devil! out on Amazon, AppleTV, cable-on-demand, Spotify, iTunes, Pandora, and more. </strong></p>\n<p>We've <strong>donated $5,400</strong> this month to <strong>Penfed</strong>!
