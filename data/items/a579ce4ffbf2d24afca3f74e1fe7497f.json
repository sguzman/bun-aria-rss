  "description": "What factors compel Central American residents to flee their home countries and head to the United States? What do national elections in Latin America mean, and why should the U.S. be concerned? Which Latin American nations are emerging international powers? These are some of the questions Dr. Gregory Weeks prepares students to answer with his book, Understanding Latin American Politics (Pearson, 2014). Dr. Weeks balances regional theories on political participation and economic development with unique circumstances within each Latin American state. Analyzing events on the local, national, and international levels, this synthesis demonstrates how actions at the local level impact the global community.\n\nIn this interview we discuss Dr. Weeks’s book and gain insight into contemporary Latin American affairs, providing listeners with a theoretical and practical background to analyze future events in the Western Hemisphere.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
