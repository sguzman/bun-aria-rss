  "description": "Contributor(s): Joel Suss, Professor John Hills | In this episode of the LSE's British Politicast we talk to Professor John Hills about his new book, Good Times, Bad Times: The Welfare Myth of Them and Us. With two-thirds of all UK public spending going towards welfare, how the money is spent is an important political debate. The myth that dominates this debate, and to some extent drives policy, divides the British public into two opposing camps – those that pay into it versus those who benefit, ‘strivers’ versus ‘skivers’. Professor Hills explains to us how the picture is far more complicated. Credits: Presented by Joel Suss. Produced by Cheryl Brumley. Other contributors: John Hills. Music and sound came courtesy of the following user at the Free Music Archive: DJ Harrison (City Swagger).",
