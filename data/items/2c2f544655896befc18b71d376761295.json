  "description": "<p>If you’ve been listening for a while, you know that I’m passionate about the power of a good night’s sleep. Quality sleep can help reduce your risk of chronic illnesses, improve the function of your immune system, protect your brain health, and so much more. And while getting consistent, quality sleep often comes down to habits, nutrition is also a powerful (and often overlooked) tool you can use to regulate your sleep.</p> <p>On this episode of The Model Health Show, you’re going to learn about the connection between sleep and your metabolism, and the top nutrients you need to include in your diet to improve your sleep quality. You’ll also hear about the role that your microbiome plays in regulating your sleep, and what you can do to make sure your gut is ready to support high quality rest. <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>As always, I’m bringing you all of the science and studies you need, plus attainable, actionable practices you can implement in order to make a positive shift toward becoming better rested.
