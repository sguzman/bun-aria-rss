  "description": "<p>On average, we lose 3 hours of productivity every single day due to distractions! There are countless ways that we’re distracted in our lives today, and these distractions are keeping us from doing the things we truly need to do. MAYBE YOU’RE CURRENTLY DISTRACTED RIGHT NOW. It is very easy to allow ourselves to be constantly barraged by notifications, social media, or by email and these distractions are keeping us from being good friends and family members at home, and they’re keeping us from being productive and engaged at work. This is why we’re stoked to be talking with distraction expert Curt Steinhorst today. Curt wrote the book <em>Can I Have Your Attention? Inspiring Better Work Habits, Focusing Your Team, and Getting Stuff Done in the Constantly Connected Workplace</em>. We often talk about ways to <em>save</em> money but today’s conversation will focus on how we can do a better job <em>earning</em> money by focusing our attention on what matters most.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Quatrefoil by Jackie O's Brewery- a big thanks to Art, Mackenzie, and all of our friends there at the brewery!
