  "description": "What do you know about the Enneagram?  Where did it start?  What does it mean?  How can we use it?  Does it have any place in our spiritual lives or is it all just a fad?  \n\nAnnie Diamond is an Enneagram Coach who teaches from the Narrative Method and in this episodes she explains the ins and outs of the Enneagram including it’s very early origins from the “9 Deadly Sins”.  Annie discusses how every number has a “sin” or a “fixation” which can pull them away from God or others around them, and how noticing these fixations can help recenter and realign our thoughts, emotions and actions.  In addition to these fixations, each number also has a door to the “higher self”, the part of the self that allows us to fully step into who God created us to be.  Annie leads us through a thoughtful discussion about each these crucial aspects of the Enneagram and how it can make a big impact in our lives.  \n\nIf you’d like to know more about Annie, you can visit her website at: https://www.enneagramforwholeness.com or on instagram at @enneagramforwholeness\n\nThe book she recommends to get started on the topic is called “The Complete Enneagram: 27 Paths to Greater Self-Knowledge” by Beatrice Chestnut\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
