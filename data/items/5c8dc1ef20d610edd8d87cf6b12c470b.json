  "description": "<p>“That was really what I wanted to get at. The relationships that you have with the people who you love <em>so</em> much, and who you're <em>so</em> close with that you don't have to talk to them all the time.” All of Emma Straub’s novels have big beating hearts, no matter who or what or where or when she’s writing about. <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/this-time-tomorrow-emma-straub/1140201490?ean=9780525539001\"><em>This Time Tomorrow</em></a> is her “autobiographical time travel novel” and it’s an absolute delight.
