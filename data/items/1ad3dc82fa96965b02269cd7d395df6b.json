  "description": "Joe Biden is the type of guy who can tell which way the political winds are blowing — and right now, that means taking a big, bold swing at boosting the economy. Democrats are pushing a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package through Congress, arguing that the real risk is doing too little, not too much, to help steer the country through the Covid-19 crisis. It’s quite a shift from deficit concerns of the past. Vox’s Ella Nilsen discusses the Democratic Party’s more progressive turn on the economy and whether it will last. \n\nReferences: \n\nEmily and Ella wrote about Biden’s big economic plans\n\nAnd Emily also wrote about what’s in the stimulus plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
