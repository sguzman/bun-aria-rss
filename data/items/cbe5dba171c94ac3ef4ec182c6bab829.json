  "description": "Born in ice and fire, Norse mythology starts violently...and strangely. There's a blood ocean, a giant primeval cow, and some light grandpa murder. Thor and Loki take two kids on a field trip to Jotunheim, where, like any family vacation, Thor gets in a drinking contest and wrestles an old lady. Then, Odin travels to the far reaches of the void for wisdom and learns that he must pay a terrible price only to learn that the end, when the universe will once again be bathed in ice and fire, is coming. The creature of the week is the sandman and you shouldn't let your kids listen to it, especially if it's right before bedtime. Basically, growing up in the middle ages was terrible and I don't know how anyone made it out without some severe psychological trauma. Sponsors: Loot Crate!
