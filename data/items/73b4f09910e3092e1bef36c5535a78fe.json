  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is Kristen Strout a beautiful woman who has won bikini and modeling contests, but this smokeshow is a tomboy at heart who can work on your car, flip your house, and then fix your toilet leak. She joins Bunnie to talk about settling into Nashville, weird stalkers, and the real price of dating a model. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen grew up in Florida and is a tomboy at heart. She ran outside barefoot, played in the dirt, and is just like one of the guys minus the drop-dead gorgeous looks and killer body. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen always had an infatuation with Nashville, and even though she is a self described introvert, she’s settling in quite nicely. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Kristen won her first bikini contest, she realized there was money to be made from contests and promo modeling. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen is a biker chick at heart, and now is the proud owner of a custom detailed C7 Corvette. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen has a huge passion for flipping houses and doing huge makeovers on properties. The last one, she and her fiance demoed themselves with a bunch of skill and a ton of elbow grease. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guys, take it from Bunnie and Kristen: trying to find someone’s location using instagram stories or screenshots is not attractive — it’s creepy. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Expect a bunch of new beautiful work from Kristen including her very own calendar. She also has a passion for music and singing, so maybe we will get lucky and have some new tunes from her as well. </span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes: </strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone wants to date a model, til they date a model.”</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I could show my labia lips and you don’t care, but if I’m cooking vegan food you all want to know the recipe.” - B</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would rather put my heart on a platter for people to stomp on than my butthole.” - B</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned: </strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/r1_vette_babe23/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">|</span> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/R1.Vette.Babe23/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook </span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://kristenstrout.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen Strout </span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://kristenstrout.com/bwg_gallery/gallery/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Gallery </span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://tropicbeauty.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Tropic Beauty</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check out Bunnie: </strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@xomgitsbunnie</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/bunniexo\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">BunnieXo </span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/officialdumbblonde/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@officialdumbblonde</span></a></p>",
