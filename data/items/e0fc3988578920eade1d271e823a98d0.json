  "description": "Metropolitan Community College in Omaha, Nebraska has a campus filled with historic buildings because this was once Fort Omaha. This fort's main purpose was to serve troops logistically during the Indian War era and is connected to the landmark Standing Bear v. Crook Case in 1879 in which Native Americans were legally determined as persons under the law. This location also was a place that conducted experiments with dirigibles at the Balloon School. There are multiple ghost stories from Fort Omaha as well. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Fort Omaha. The Moment in Oddity features a skeleton walled up at Fort Independence and This Month in History features five letters between John and Abigail Adams.
