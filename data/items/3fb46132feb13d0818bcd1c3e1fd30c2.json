We discuss the entraining of humans via mask mandates, and through prescriptions on how and where to walk. We talk about the policies that have been put in place “to protect people from Covid,” and how ineffective, or anti-effective, many of them have been. We discuss the value of meandering, of serendipity, of not knowing what the path will be. We discuss the value of work, and of spending time generating solutions. We discuss whether, as some have claimed, the mRNA vaccines are “gene therapy,” and what would that mean, according to the FDA’s definitions of same. We share an excerpt from Orwell’s 1937 The Road to Wigan Pier, which bears striking similarities to today’s economy. We discuss the price of lumber.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
