  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are joined by Super Bowl Champion, 10 year NFL veteran, former Linebacker for the Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Bengals, and good friend of the show, AJ Hawk. They discuss what he has been up too as of late, as he and Pat explain the difficulties with calling college football games and how their short term memory works. AJ also chats about his method for avoiding concussions his entire playing career from high school to college to the NFL, how impressed he has been with defenses so far this NFL season, who he thinks the best teams in the NFC are, and if the Colts are good enough to knock the Patriots off in the AFC. AJ and Pat also catch up and tell a few stories in an absolutely hilarious interview (2:33-54:35). Also included are some phone calls that didn't make it to live air from the radio show with topics including the issues with the NFL refs and how implementing a review system similar to tennis might be a viable option, whether or not the 49ers are the best team in the NFC, and what the chances of survival are for the XFL, and other leagues similar to it. It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
