  "description": "<p>The castle-like Delta Bessborough Hotel is a four star, ten-story hotel located in downtown Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Today it is owned by Marriott, but this historic hotel dates back to 1928 when it was built by the Canadian National Railway. Railway hotels were built all across Canada with many of them sharing the same architecture. Many locals refer to the Bessborough as \"The Bess\" and many of them have tales of hauntings that take place in the hotel. There seems to be several spirits hanging around The Bess in the afterlife. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Delta Bessborough Hotel. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Lisa Lauren Schmidt and features Jean Hilliard frozen alive and lives and This Month in History features the outlaw Belle Starr killed in Oklahoma. Also, we have the 12th installment in the third series of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition. Our location was suggested by listener Corianne Wilson.</p> <p>Checkout the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/02/hgb-ep-184-delta-bessborough-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/02/hgb-ep-184-delta-bessborough-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
