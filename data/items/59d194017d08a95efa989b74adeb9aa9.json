  "description": "<p>There will be declines in the stock market, and you’ll likely see the amount of money you have invested begin to drop. This is normal during a bear market- stay calm! It’s also OK to feel a little nervous. We are emotional creatures after all, and while it’s fine to feel a little anxious if you’re hemorrhaging money in your investments, it is NOT fine to react to these declines by selling and getting out of the market. It doesn’t help that the 24-hour news cycle and media outlets are fueling any uncertainty you might have by proclaiming doom and gloom. So in this episode we’re going to discuss what actions we should take, before and during a market crash, and how to harden ourselves to weather the financial storms that accompany a major market decline.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bretta Weisse by Firestone Walker - a big thanks to our friend Josh for donating this beer to the show!
