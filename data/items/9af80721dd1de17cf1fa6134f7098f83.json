  "description": "The work from home revolution has arrived...but is that a good or bad thing for the business world? Let’s walk through the pros and cons.\n\n\nPros: The ability to work from wherever means more opportunity in previously underserved and non-coastal cities. Less commuting means less pollution. Three words—work from bed.\n\n\nCons: A fully distributed workforce can be tough to scale. It’s harder to build both company culture and innovation remotely. No office snacks.\n\nToday on Business Casual, we’re putting all of that in context with Matt Mullenweg. Matt is the founder and CEO of Automattic, which is the parent company of WordPress.com. He built Automattic to have a completely distributed workforce—1,200+ employees working from 77 countries and no HQ.\nAs Matt sees it, “the sun never sets on Automattic.” He’s adamant that the environment, the economy, and distribution of opportunity could all meaningfully change for the better in a widespread remote workforce world.\nSo it works for Matt and his team, but can it work for everyone? We’re about to find out. Matt thinks the companies like Google and Facebook that have announced WFH through the rest of the year will find it hard to go back to in-office work. \nSo is this the new normal? And can it change corporate America for the better? Listen to find out.",
