  "description": "<p>When the curator of the longest-running study on human flourishing, the Grant Study, was asked if there was any one factor that most contributed to a life well-lived, his answer was clear - love, full stop. In no small way, love makes a life. And, we’re not just talking romantic love. So, today, we’re bringing you a very special episode drawing upon the deep wisdom of five past guests, each experts in the space of love, relationships, and self-discovery, to share provocative, unique, and valuable insights about how to love and be loved, how to hold relationships with curiosity and allow room for growth, how to create a society-wide container of compassion, then invite everyone in, even those you struggle to like, or be in the same room with, let alone love.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You’ll hear from Julie and John Gottman, who’ve been married and also researching love and relationships, both clinically and in the lab for over 4 decades together, and writing mega-bestselling books on the topic. You’ll hear from Diego Perez, who most know from his online moniker Young Pueblo, on creating the space for growth. Rev. angel Kyodo williams will share an expansive lens on love and its connection to compassion, holding the space for difference, and liberation. And, our friend, spoken-world artist, IN-Q, shared a beautiful spoken-word piece, framed by his own experience of falling in love, wrapping with an invitation for us all to find moments to create magic.</p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You can find Julie & John Gottman at: <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/gottman-love-lab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Conversation</a> | <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gottmaninstitute/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>You can find Digeo Perez (Yung Pueblo) at: <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/diego-perez-yung-pueblo-clarity-connection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Conversation</a> | <a href=\"https://yungpueblo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yung_pueblo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>You can find Rev. angel Kyodo williams at: <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/95c9e44b9f290e78289c13b107722ed8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Conversation</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zenchangeangel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://angelkyodowilliams.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></p><p>You can find IN-Q at: <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/in-q/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Conversation</a> | <a href=\"https://in-q.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inqlife/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br><p><strong>My new book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Outschool: </strong>Explore over 100,000 topics and learn in small groups via Zoom.
