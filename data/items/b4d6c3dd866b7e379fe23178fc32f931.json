This was incredible.\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://dream.shop\n\nBadBoyHalo:  @BadBoyHalo \nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Hitmen. This video there are THREE hunters/hitmen instead of just one.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive for 100 minutes, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo tries to prevent me from surviving. Every 10 minutes there is a 10 minute period of invincibility. They can see me through walls, and the world is small. It's a chase, a race, and it's super intense. A lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,500,000 likes we'll do it again!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed runner / survivalist in Minecraft against a killer / assassin / hitmen\n\n#MinecraftHitmen",
