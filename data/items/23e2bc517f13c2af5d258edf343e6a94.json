  "description": "<p>WorkLife will be back on March 29 with new episodes including an incredible conversation with Dolly Parton, and an episode on the (not so) Great Resignation. For now, here's an episode of another show that Adam frequently appears on. It's called The Next Big Idea, presented by LinkedIn. In this episode, Annie Murphy Paul, author of “The Extended Mind” sits down with Adam for a spirited conversation in which she defends the fine art of fidgeting, suggests ways to improve group brainstorms, and gives him advice on how to talk to his childhood sensei. For more episodes, you can find and follow the Next Big Idea wherever you're listening to this.</p>",
