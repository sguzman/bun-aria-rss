  "description": "<p>There’s a big difference between knowing that you could be involved in a car accident, and then actually getting 5 car pile up. Of course you know it’s a possibility, you have the head knowledge that you should be careful and alert, but it’s another thing completely to have experienced it firsthand. The same thing can be true when it comes to investing in the stock market- we <em>know</em> that occasionally there are going to be corrections, but until we actually <em>experience</em> those downturns ourselves, we’re not totally sure how we’re going to react. Our fear and emotions might cause us to do something we’d later regret. And lucky for us we recently had a downturn in the market so now is a great time to talk about what we can learn from the past, what is currently going on with the stock market, and what we can do to prepare for future volatility.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed A Force for Good 2021 by Creature Comforts- a big thanks to Nathan for donating this delicious beer to the show!
