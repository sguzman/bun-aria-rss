  "description": "The Biden administration constant pushing of wokeness is weakening U.S. national security. England's women's soccer team is successful, but not \"diverse\" enough. The goal of every sports team isn’t to be \"diverse,\" it’s to put the best team on the field regardless of race. Veterans call in on the weakening of the military because of political correctness. Riley Gaines, University of Kentucky swimmer that tied with transgender Lia Thomas in the 200-yard freestyle NCAA swimming championships, discusses with Clay and Buck the transgender issue in women's sports. The woke virus destroys everything it touches.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
