A networked sterilizer is, well, digitally unhygienic. Docs dot com search functionality temporarily disabled. Remember, if you want to reach the G-men, it's FBI dot GOV, not dot com. The UMD Center for Health and Homeland Security's Ben Yelin examines a case where a defendant's expertise is being held against him. Brian Brunetti from Route1 warns about VPN insecurity. Scareware hits iOS users. And a Brooklyn prosecutor gets bad advice from the old heart.",
