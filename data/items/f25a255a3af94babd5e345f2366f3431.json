  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, following the resignation of Justice Stephen Breyer, President Biden has said that he will nominate the first Black woman to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The practice of hiring someone based on race or sex has been found to be unlawful for schools, businesses, and others but when Biden does it it’s no longer a problem. The perverse ideology of American Marxism has crept into every facet of our government including the judiciary. The race is on between the U.S and the Chinese to retrieve America's most advanced stealth fighter jet which has reportedly slid off the deck of a U.S Navy aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. U.S officials are concerned about China salvaging the aircraft before they do, to have a sample of the Navy's most elite warplane. Then, many are concerned with why America should do anything with Ukraine. If the U.S ignores its responsibility to defend Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances of 1994 it would be violating its part of the treaty. The founders warned against an activist court. Where is judicial review in the Constitution? It's not. This power exercised by the Supreme Court known as judicial review started in Marbury versus Madison. Jefferson noted that declaring what the law is, has more influence than every other branch of government. This practice contravenes the Constitution and is an authority given to the Court by itself, not by the framers or We The People. The constitutional case for the 2020 election in Pennsylvania that was brought by Greg Teufel and Julie Levin scored a victory today in the state's Commonwealth Court. The court ruled that the practice of no-excuse mail-in ballots, put in place by Democrats right before the 2020 election was unconstitutional. This case was initially dismissed outright by the U.S Supreme Court despite being meritorious.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
