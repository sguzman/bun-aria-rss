  "description": "<p>My #HoneyDew this week is the one and only Joey Diaz! Joey has lived a life that very few, if any, have lived. I love talking with Joey because he's an open channel. His memory is incredible and his stories are so vivid. You can't sit down in one episode and get Joey's life story. This episode covers birth to age 9. I'll have him back again and we'll pick up right where we left off but when I tell you that the things Joey lived through and the things he did by age 9 are more than most adults have ever done in a lifetime, I'm not kidding. This episode is what the HoneyDew is all about. It's a must-listen and an instant classic! Subscribe, download & review!</p> <p>Sponsors:<br /> Go to <a href=\"http://expressvpn.com/HONEYDEW\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://expressvpn.com/HONEYDEW</a> and find out how you can get 3 months free with a 1 year package.</p>",
