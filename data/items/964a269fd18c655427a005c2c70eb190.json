  "description": "What if the history books record that Donald Trump was third American president to be impeached, but the first of those to be re-elected? It's not far-fetched. In fact, many folks think it's likely. And it's what happens after that that has them scared. We discuss in a great roundtable with the Washington Post's Greg Sargent, Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and NYU Law School's Ryan Goodman. You won't want to miss it.\nMOVA Globes turn all on their own, with or without a base, in any setting with ambient lighting. No batteries are needed and no sloppy cords to detract from your enjoyment. Each globe has a transparent outer shell made from carefully selected, high-quality acrylic.
