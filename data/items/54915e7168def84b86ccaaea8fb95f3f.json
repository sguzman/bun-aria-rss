  "title": "161 - The Source Family Cult",
  "description": "<p>In the late 1960s, James Baker transitioned from the spiritually-minded owner of a vegetarian restaurant on Los Angele's Sunset Strip to Father Yod - the leader of a cult based on the belief that he was, pretty much, god-in-the-flesh. The cult was also based in a lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock n'roll. And also vegetarianism. Bust mostly sex and rock n'roll. Roughly 150 counter-culture flower children lived together, first in LA, and then in Hawaii, giving themself super cult-y, crystally names like Moonbeam the Aquarian. And then Father Yod lost his faith and the whole cult went down in a tragic hang-gliding accident. It's a strange story and I enjoyed telling it today, on Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!</p>\n<p><strong>Donating $3200 </strong>this month to the nonprofit - Holding Out Help. <a href=\"https://holdingouthelp.org/\"><strong>https://holdingouthelp.org/</strong></a><strong> </strong>Holding Out HELP provides those who come from a polygamous culture the resources needed to transition from isolation to independence!
