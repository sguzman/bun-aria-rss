  "description": "Today’s guest is long-time friend and resource expert, Marin Katusa. He's the founder and CEO of Katusa Research. And co-producer of the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference. This event is just around the corner… and it's where I find the BEST investment ideas in the sector year after year. In this episode, Marin maps out this year's event… and explains what it’s like to be in the same room as industry legends like Rick Rule, Frank Holmes, and Ross Beaty. Marin also updates us on the gold and junior mining markets… While some analysts tout Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as substitutes for gold, Marin reminds listeners why precious metals remain relevant.",
