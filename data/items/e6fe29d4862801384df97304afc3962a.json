  "description": "I thought it would be super fun to share how things roll in the land of quilting! I am inspired every day by quilters and their creativity. A few months back I noticed that pineapples were showing up all over the place and low and behold there was also a pineapple quilt that was too cute for words! I of course, want to make it. Because I love to make cute things. BUT I also wanted to chat with the quilter behind ‘that pineapple quilt’ and learn a bit about Jackie Padesky of Pineapple fame!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jackiepadeskyquilts/\n----------------\nDonna Desoto is back and I’m so excited! She loves to organize large quilt challenge, and she is very good at it! The first was the tribute to the Beatles and now the 2nd quilt challenge to honor the 100th anniversary of the National Parks is out on exhibit and there is a beautiful book to go along with it. Donna’s challenges are clever and well thought out. I will reveal what the 3rd is and IF I’m participating this time.. on today’s show!\nwww.npscentennialquilts.com\nhttp://www.fiberbeatles.com/\nhttp://dmdesoto-iep.blogspot.com/\nwww.donnadesoto.com\n------------------\nI caught up with my awesome Australian friend Helen Stubbings at the trade show then organized to record  her when she got home.
