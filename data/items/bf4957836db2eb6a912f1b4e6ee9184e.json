  "description": "Today on the Bestselling Children’s Author Show, Chicago public schools are excited to announce that every bathroom in the district, in every school, will now be gender neutral. How could they instate a policy like this right on the heels of the Loudoun County scandal where a girl was raped in a bathroom by a boy in a dress? We’ll talk about that today. Also the White House unveils its new “five point plan” for defeating COVID. Will this work better than the plan before this, or the one before that? And Whoopi Goldberg engages in shocking transphobia while attacking pro-lifers. The New York Times argues that abortion is good because adoption is bad. And Trevor Noah takes the vaccine red pill. An unexpected turn of events. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
