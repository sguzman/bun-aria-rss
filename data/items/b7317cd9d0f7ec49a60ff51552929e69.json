  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss what is often called one of the most significant battles in history. In 480BC in the Saronic Gulf near Athens, between the mainland and the island of Salamis, a fleet of Greek allies decisively defeated a larger Persian-led fleet. This halted the further Persian conquest of Greece and, at Plataea and Mycale the next year, further Greek victories brought Persian withdrawal and the immediate threat of conquest to an end. To the Greeks, this enabled a flourishing of a culture that went on to influence the development of civilisation in Rome and, later, Europe and beyond. To the Persians, it was a reverse at the fringes of their vast empire but not a threat to their existence, as it was for the Greek states, and attention turned to quelling unrest elsewhere.\n\nWith \n\nLloyd Llewellyn-Jones\nProfessor in Ancient History at Cardiff University\n\nLindsay Allen\nLecturer in Greek and Near Eastern History, King's College London\n\nand\n\nPaul Cartledge\nEmeritus Professor of Greek Culture and AG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
