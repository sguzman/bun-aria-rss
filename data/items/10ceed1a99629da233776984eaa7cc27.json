  "description": "<p>In the show, I welcome Victor Urrutia, the CEO of the <a href= \"https://www.cvne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compañia Vinícola del Norte de España (CVNE)</a> one of the most famed bodegas in Rioja, which has been around since 1879. Victor is part of the 5th generation of a family that has run <a href= \"https://www.cvne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVNE</a> (said coo-NAY) for 141 years. We discuss the storied history of this classic, traditional, high quality bodega, and probe into a dozen other Rioja-related topics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cvne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/logo-300x56.png\" alt= \"\" width=\"223\" height=\"46\" /></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cvne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/VictorCVNE.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"264\" height=\"165\" /></a></p> <p>Victor and I cover many subjects, and I was thrilled to have him - it’s been really hard for me to find Spanish producers to come on the show and he comes from one of the most historic, classic, and outstanding bodegas in Rioja (I drink A LOT of <a href= \"https://www.cvne.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVNE</a>!). Here’s a high level of what you’ll find in the show: </p> <p> </p> <ol> <li>Victor tells us the story of his family in Rioja and in wine, and his circuitous route to becoming a leader that combines a progressive attitude with a strong respect for tradition.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li>We dork out on the Rioja region.

Grapes come from both Rioja Alta and Rioja Alavesa, and from warmer and cooler climates to make highly drinkable, tasty wine. CVNE is made every year, and is made in a traditional style.

These wines are structured, excellent for aging, and only made in the best years from estate grown fruit in Rioja Alta.
