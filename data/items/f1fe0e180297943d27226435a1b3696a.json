  "title": "The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch",
  "description": "The 80/20 principle centres on Alfredo Pareto's theory that 80% of wealth is in the hands of 20% of people. Koch explains that this percentage applies to multiple industries, markets and interests. The book gives detailed advice about the ways we can implement the 80/20 principle to achieve more by doing less. For instance, when analyzing individual happiness, it is common to find that 80% of happiness derives from only 20% of one's activities. Koch encourages readers to see that 20% across all areas of their life and implement them. I found this book incredibly informative and practical. It breaks down why you should be living the 80/20 principle day by day and the benefits to individual happiness of doing so. This book is a must-read in today's hectic environment when finding what is important personally and professionally can be hard. However, by adopting the 80/20 mentality, it can make it easier. There is no doubt this book is five stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
