    "media:description": "The beginning of the Masaman 2021 ethno-racial map of the world is here.\n\nWell, it took almost 2 years, but my final map of humanity is almost at an end. It's been a wild ride and this journey has taught me more than I ever thought possible about fascinating ethnic, racial and religious groups across the world from far and wide. In today's video we'll be doing a brief overview of some of my work so far, particularly on the continent of Africa, which was probably the most difficult and time-consuming out of any region, but one of the most fun as well.\n\nI'll be releasing the full map and all iterations of it in the upcoming weeks, and will include all of the sources I used as well. Thank you for your patience and thank you all so much for watching!",
