  "description": "Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham famously held no press briefings during her time in the White House — but now, she's ready to talk. Her memoir, <em>I'll Take Your Questions Now,</em> is the latest tell-all from a former Trump staffer — and Tamara Keith, from NPR's Politics Podcast, hit her with some tough questions about whether the book is simply an image rehab project. \"Too many books have been out there to help one person's reputation so they can be rehabilitated ... or to try to rewrite history,\" Grisham says. \"I just want to tell my story and have people take what they want from it.\" ",
