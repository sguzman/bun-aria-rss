  "title": "Ep 141:  Getting Free From Societal Boxes & Taking up Space",
  "description": "<p>A sweet millennial writes in asking how someone gets out the boxes society puts you in. This episode is all about that. Why do we sometimes live small and how do we get into taking up some goddamn space? How do we recognize society's rules then get ourselves out of the Matrix? A woman who wants to pursue her Master's degree in Social Works wonders if her school choice is a reflection of her wanting to please others or herself? We get into external validation. A young woman has a 22-year old friend who has been hitting the booze hard lately. Should she say something? It's all here, bros. Let's get deep and GET YOUR LIFE!</p>\n",
