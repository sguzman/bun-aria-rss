  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast I'm joined by the <em>New York Times</em>'s Andrea Elliott, who won the Pulitzer Prize for her book <em>Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in New York City. </em>She tells me how she came to spend seven years reporting on a single, homeless family in Brooklyn, how she negotiated her duty to observe rather than participate â€“ and what their <em>telenovela-</em>like experiences tell us about American history.</div>\n",
