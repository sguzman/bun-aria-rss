  "description": "<p>Whidbey Island sits along Puget Sound and has a long history dating back to the 1800s. The island is the largest of all the islands making up Island County in Washington. It is a picturesque location that stretches for 55 miles making it the fourth longest and largest island in the contiguous United States. It is home to the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. The island also is home to Fort Casey, Ebey's Landing, Admiralty Head Lighthouse and a few legends and stories of hauntings, that include The Lurker. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Whidbey Island. We also have the seventh installment in the third series of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Ronda Borgen and features killer clothing and This Day in History features the ratification of the Bill of Rights.
