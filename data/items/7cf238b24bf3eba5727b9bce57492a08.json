  "description": "<p>When it comes to stress, you've got three basic options today.</p> <p>One, you can crumble under the weight of the stress, succumbing to things like heart disease, obesity, and depression that are all linked to chronic stress.</p> <p>Two, you can run from the modern world and hideout in the mountains (grow a beard), in a monastery (shave your head and/or grow a beard), or even in a naturalist colony (renounce all of your clothing and/or grow a beard).</p> <p>Three you can step up and do something to ensure that you are breaking the cycle of stress by learning how to enjoy our modern advances without being overrun by them. That's what The Urban Monk is all about.</p> <p>Dr. Pedram Shojai is here to share some of the most powerful insights you'll ever hear for taking back control of your mind and overcoming stress in a hyper-stressful world.
