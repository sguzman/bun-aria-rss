  "description": "<p>My #HoneyDew this week is Adam Ray! Adam shares stories about his parent's divorce and the strain it put on his relationship with his father and his family. Adam talks about being a kid and seeing his mom go on dates, and some of the dudes that rolled through his life, like the guy who wanted to do \"basket shots\" with him. Adam talks about his dad's new family and what is was like the night he witnessed the first time his mom kiss another man! This episode is as open, honest and sweet as it is funny! I really enjoyed sitting with Adam and learning a lot about why he is the man he is today.
