For some, the removal of statues is a powerful symbol of the desire for social justice and for remembering the wrongs of the past. For others, the removal of monuments is an attempt to erase history. It is certainly a subject that evokes very strong feelings.</p><br><p>The historian Alex von Tunzelmann is today's guest on the podcast.
