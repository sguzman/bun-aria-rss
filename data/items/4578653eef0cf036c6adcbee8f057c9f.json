  "description": "<p>When you're in prison, you've got a lot of time on your hands, and a lot of inmates spend this time exercising. With little or no equipment and sometimes just the space available in their cells, prisoners are able to get incredibly big and strong. Learning how prisoners do these bodyweight workouts can be useful for those who aren't in jail, but want to get fit and don't have access to exercise equipment. </p>\n<p>My guest today got the lowdown on the methods prisoners use to get strong by interviewing bodybuilders who also spent time in the slammer. His name is <a href=\"https://joshstrength.com/\">Josh Bryant</a>, and he's a powerlifter and powerlifting coach and the co-author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJHWFHK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FJHWFHK&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Jailhouse Strong</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing the mindset with which Josh approaches fitness training, including what he means by being \"gas station ready.\" We then discuss why being big and strong is oftentimes a matter of survival for prisoners and some of the famously fit former inmates Josh highlights in his book. We then dig into the specific bodyweight movements prisoners typically use, how they can be incorporated in your own workout routine, and the various ways you can modify and make the exercises harder. We discuss programs prisoners often use and how Josh has enhanced them with his powerlifting background. Josh then lays out a beginner's three-day-a-week bodyweight program, explains the way prisoners incorporate \"deloading\" or taking a break from their workouts, and talks about his all-time favorite conditioning exercise.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/jailhousestrong\">aom.is/jailhousestrong</a>.</p>\n",
