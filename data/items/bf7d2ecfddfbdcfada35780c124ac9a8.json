  "description": "<p>Based on a quantum thermodynamic protocol for shortcut to isothermality that\nsmoothly modify the system-reservoir interaction can significantly speed up an\nisothermal process while keeping the overall dissipation constant [Phys. Rev.\nX. 10, 031015 (2020)], we extend the study of optimization performance of\nCarnot-like heat engines and refrigerators in a straightforward and unified\nway. We derive the universal optimization efficiency of heat engines and the\noptimization coefficient of performance of refrigerators under two unified\noptimization criterions, i.e., chi criterion and omega criterion. We also\nderived the universal lower and upper bounds for heat engines and\nrefrigerators, and found that these bounds can be reached under extremely\nasymmetric cases.\n</p>",
