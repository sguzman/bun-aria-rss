  "title": "Ep. 895 - We Must Defend The Biden Administration’s Perverted Values",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden Administration has said that American families will have to bear the cost of defending Ukraine against Russia. Why should we have to bear this cost? Because we have to defend our values overseas. But whose values? And what values? We’ll talk about that today. Also, the Supreme Court will decide whether a web designer has the right to refuse to make wedding announcements for a same sex wedding. And the sponsors of that so-called “don’t say gay” bill in Florida have started to buckle under left wing pressure. Plus another UFO sighting, proving once again definitively that aliens walk among us. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the unintentionally hilarious efforts of the Women’s March to turn student debt into a women’s rights issue. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
