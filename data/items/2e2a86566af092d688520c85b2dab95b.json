A brutal military power that used violence and war to bring \"Pax Romana\" or \"Roman Peace.\"   But Ancient Israel has a hope, long ago they were promised a Messiah.  Someone would come and lead them out of oppression into true freedom.<br />\nJesus of Nazareth shows up and begins performing miracles and speaking of a new kingdom, the Kingdom of God.   Many people think this is the man who will lead them in war against the Romans.
