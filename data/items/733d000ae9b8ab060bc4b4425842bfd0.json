That's the real problem. Are you having cake and booze when you want it or when you plan it?</p> <p>The best way I know how to teach you to lose weight is to do these THREE SIMPLE things:</p> <p>Know what you are eating and drinking.<br /> Before you give up food and alcohol get real about what you currently eat, how often, when, and why. When you have this information you are READY to move to the next step.</p> <p>Decide when you will have eat and drink things you know SLOW down weightloss. Decide, plan, commit, and no extras.<br /> That means if you plan three glasses of wine Friday and Saturday you don't get a fourth and you surely don't get it on Wednesday when the day was bad.</p> <p>Assess your week.<br /> We all want to lose weight and we all want to do it in a way we can keep eating and drinking the way we like.</p> <p>That's not ever going to work. Sorry.</p> <p>But, you don't have to \"give up\" everything you love. If you want to keep booze you can. You just have to plan it and when you weigh in each week you get to decide if the results are what you want. If not, you choose to plan less. If they are, you choose to keep on track.</p> <p>Nowhere in here you are deprived. It's just you planning, committing, assessing and choosing. That's it.</p> <p>I go deeper into how I've gone from drinking three nights a week to once a week (without tons of deprivation and crying)...and seen an extra 5lbs of booze bloat naturally go away the last couple of months.</p> <p>I, too, was in the trap of drinking when I wanted and wondering why I was up 8lbs! LOL. Yes. Me!</p> <p>The podcast is pretty honest about how even 13 years into maintenance I can get sloppy. But, I also teach you how I decided to get my act together in an honest way that taught me good habits. And when I teach me I teach YOU, too.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
