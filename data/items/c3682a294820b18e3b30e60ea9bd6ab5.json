  "description": "Last week Kwasi Kwarteng, the new UK Chancellor, announced a cut in taxes at the same time that the government was stepping in to subsidise rising energy costs for homes and businesses. The cost of all this dwarfs the money spent on the furlough scheme. That means there’s a heap of government money being pushed into the public sector.

Could it make inflation worse? And what about the repercussions on income disparity – from the budget and its unforeseen consequences. Hopefully someone in the Treasury is listening.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
