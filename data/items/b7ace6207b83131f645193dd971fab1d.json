  "description": "There’s some good news if you’re an equity partner at a large law firm. Based on the findings of a survey of firms released by Wells Fargo Private Bank’s Legal Specialty Group, equity partners should see “healthy levels of profit” this year, according to Joe Mendola, a senior director of sales with the group. However, Mendola also warned that this continues to be “a challenging time” for many firms in the second hundred of the Am Law 200, and we should expect consolidation to continue in the coming years.\n\nMendola visited the Big Law Business office on Wednesday to record an interview with Josh Block about the findings of his group’s Mid-Year Check-In, a survey of financial measures of approximately 135 law firms. About 60 Am Law 100 firms participated in the survey, including a “high percentage” of the Am Law 50.\n\nBig Law Business \nhttps://bol.bna.com/\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-law-business/id1074067483?mt=2\n\nWant to receive more stories like this in your inbox every morning?
