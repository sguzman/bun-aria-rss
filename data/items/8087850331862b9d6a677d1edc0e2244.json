And giving everyone verification is a clear platform benefit. So I&#8217;m for it.</p>\n\n<p><center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Apparently Twitter's new verification won't require any identity verification, just a monthly payment. If that's the case we're going to see an influx of criminals buying accounts with stolen credit cards to engage in spam and impersonation. <a href=\"https://t.co/NyMvswErni\">https://t.co/NyMvswErni</a></p>&mdash; Marcus Hutchins (@MalwareTechBlog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1588316968645316608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</center></p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<p class=\"note\">Keep in mind this reporting could be wrong and verification could still be part of the plan.</p>\n\n<p>Except, no, it doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re opening up verification. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1588304086792667136\">this analysis</a> above they&#8217;re:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Removing verification</li>\n<li>Removing the validation of being a public persona </li>\n<li><strong>Charging $8/month for it</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"note\">I guess you could argue that Twitter having money will meta-help Twitter in the future.</p>\n\n<p>So we haven&#8217;t gained anything for the community. In fact I&#8217;d argue we&#8217;ve lost a lot. One of the biggest features of the blue check&#8212;not just on Twitter but on any social media platform&#8212;is disambiguation from copycats. If the analysis above is true and correct, we lose that. Now it&#8217;s just blue checks everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Which would be fine if that was the case for validated non-public people&#8212;the more the better. But they&#8217;re not validated. In sum, this is <strong>less</strong> validation, and <strong>more</strong> blue checks. Seemingly all in the name of revenue.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n\n<p>If this is true, the effects will be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Malicious actors paying <em>negligible</em> costs to attain credibility with their victims</li>\n<li>Devaluation of the checkmark (it used to mean you were confirmed to be a real human, at least)</li>\n<li>Some more revenue for Twitter</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe #3 makes #1 or #2 worth it, and it looks like we&#8217;re about to find out.</p>\n</p>"
