  "description": "It's UNGA week, the big party for the world's leaders as they come to NYC for the opening of the UN General Assembly.  Of course, this year is marked by the fact that it's Donald Trump's first UNGA as president of the United States...and that could be the reason so many of the world's most important leaders are not attending.  But plenty of folks will be watching because Trump is, after all, Trump.  This week, David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and Kori Schake of Stanford University discuss what to expect from Trump and the UN meetings with regard to Iran, North Korea, and Nikki Haley's career prospects.
