  "description": "Broads, the proposals are wrapping up and the couples are meeting face to face and heading to Mexico. It’s about to get wild (*cough cough* Jessica potentially meeting Barnett IRL *cough cough*). But first, the Broads catch up on quarantine and some bachelor news. They then dive into this 3rd episode recap of LIB - Bekah doesn’t know how she feels about the show. Jess is stoked on it. But one thing is for sure, they laughed A LOT recapping this episode, threw around a lot of theories, and can’t wait for the next recap. <br>***Reminder: we are watching this show episode by episode as we recap - though the show has been out for a long time, we do not know how anything ends so please no *SPOILERS*.
