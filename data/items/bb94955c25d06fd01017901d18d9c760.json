  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is live from Orlando, FL as he prepares for this weekend's NXT WarGames. He and the boys recap the Monday Night Football game between the Seahawks and Eagles and wonder whether the Eagles are dead, if Russ is back, and the Steelers and Ravens playing at 3:40 PM tomorrow. Also joining Pat and AJ, coming off a 4 touchdown performance on Sunday Night against the Bears, is Packers QB and friend of the program, Aaron Rodgers. They cover the game, how he's feeling ahead of his 37th birthday, he gushes about a few teammates, and much much more (20:56-1:06:23). Next, NFL Insider and friend of the program, Tom Pelissero joins the program to chat about the evolving situation between the Steelers and Ravens, and how that situation is different that others, if the Eagles are dead, and everything else going on in the NFL (1:07:28-1:26:06). Later, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 9 year NFL vet at Running Back, and rushing touchdown leader in 2016, LeGarrette Blount joins the program to talk about his career, why he thinks he might not get the respect he deserves, his resemblance to Derrick Henry, and much more in a great conversation (1:28:18-1:52:29).
