  "description": "<p>A 51-year-old mom of two, stabbed nearly 60 times, found stuffed inside a duffel bag in her Forest Hills neighborhood. A half-mile long blood trail led police to the home Gaal shared with her husband and teen sons. The husband and older son were reportedly out of town on a college campus visit. Police say Orsolya Gaal spent her Friday afternoon with friends at a backyard party, before telling her teen son that she was meeting friends. Police say the woman is seen on surveillance video sitting in a Queens' bar, alone, for nearly an hour. Then at 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, a security video captured a man rolling the bloody duffel bag down Juno Street. A man walking his dogs found the body. Gaal’s husband says he received a text message threatening him and his children prior to the murder. Whoever sent the text claimed they had been jailed or imprisoned at some point in the past because of Gaal. The suspect allegedly threatened to kill the entire family if the police were contacted. No suspect names have been released and no arrests have been made in the case.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace today:</p><ul>\n<li>Matthew Mangino - Attorney, Former District Attorney (Lawrence County), Former Parole Board Member, Author: \"The Executioner's Toll: The Crimes, Arrests, Trials, Appeals, Last Meals, Final Words and Executions of 46 Persons in the United States\" </li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, (Atlanta GA) www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Mona Kay - Private Investigator, \"Mona K Investigations\" (Omaha, NE), Twitter: @monakay</li>\n<li>Dr. Michael Baden - Former Chief Medical Examiner of New York City and past Co-Director of the New York State Police Medico-Legal Investigations Unit</li>\n<li>Tina Moore - New York Post Police Bureau Chief, Twitter: @TinaMooreReport</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
