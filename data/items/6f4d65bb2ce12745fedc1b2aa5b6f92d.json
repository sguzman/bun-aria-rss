  "description": "Oh man. This is a weird one. Pete asks Sarah Silverman if she \"tells herself she's a good person\" and, I mean, that's in like the first minute. What more weirdness do you want?! How about Sarah talking about losing her virginity. I mean, this is all in under the four minute mark. Or new euphemisms for masturbation. Pete also overshares his virginity story and calls the Old Testament \"your half of the Bible.\" God, this is a weird one. This is also the first ep where Pete shares a track from the lost \"UCB Tapes,\" never-before-heard standup recordings from NYC.",
