  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down Prince Family Paper! When David Wallace asks Michael and Dwight to go undercover and scout out a family-owned paper business, Michael’s conscience gets to him. Meanwhile back in the office, everyone debates whether Hillary Swank is hot or not. (The ladies may get on a soapbox or two for this one.) Jenna does a deep dive on Hillary Swank, the ladies delve into all the creative production work that went behind building and shooting the Prince Family Paper company, and Angela shares a funny blooper where a cast member got bits of smoked almonds spit on them. So congratulate yourself for getting up and putting on clothes today, we think that’s hot and totally deserving of this fun episode.</p>\n",
