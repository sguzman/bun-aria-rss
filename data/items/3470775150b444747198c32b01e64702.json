  "description": "Wow. Sometimes there's not much more you can say than just... wow. On the court, Kendrick Perkins was a fierce competitor who backed down from no one. As a member of the media? Well, he's pretty much the same. There's really no subject that is off limits and there is virtually no team, player, or media member he won't take on. Which is a big reason why this interview is so damn good. Perk just tells it like it is, plain and simple. He speaks the truth as he sees it, and if it ruffles some feathers along the way, then so be it. It's part of the reason JJ and Tommy have been working long and hard to get him on the show, and now that he finally made it on, boy does he deliver.
