  "description": "Vladimir Putin’s propaganda machine is trying to turn the letter ‘Z’ into a symbol of domestic support for his war in Ukraine, but his government can’t hide the fact that the world’s economic war against Russia is succeeding, as evidenced by major brands like McDonalds and Coca-Cola pulling out of the country at lightning speed. President Obama’s ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, visits The Late Show to talk to Stephen about the latest developments in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and offers his analysis of what it would mean for NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. And Denée Benton was born to be on stage, but she spent much of her younger life working to overcome preconceived notions about what a Black girl can achieve in the performing arts. Catch Denée in her latest role, starring as Peggy Scott in, “The Gilded Age,” Mondays on HBO.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
