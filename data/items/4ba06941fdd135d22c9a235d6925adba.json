  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak with David who had a terrifying encounter with several Sasquatches. The men were in a remote location in Colorado and were out shooting targets when a very large ape-like creature stepped out of the bushes and was growling, screaming and showing its teeth. David describes what the creature looked like and describes the bushes around him exploding with other creatures screaming at them. David took up a defensive position and started firing while his cousin ran back to get the truck. You will not want to miss this one. </p>",
