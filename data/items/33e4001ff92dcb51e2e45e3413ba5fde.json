  "description": "<p>The best of The Colin Cowherd Podcast. Colin rants about how Ben Simmons needs to be repurposed (:55), Tom Brady's real genius (2:50), and how the Sixers meltdown could actually be a good thing for the organization (6:00). Marcus Thompson of The Athletic tells us why Ben Simmons to the Warriors makes a lot of sense (8:55), Nick Wright of FS1's First Things First explains why we could see Zion with the Knicks sooner rather than later (22:25), and Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated and Fox Sports on the \"sticky stuff\" controversy in baseball (28:45). Plus, with the big changes happening in Dallas, we flash back to Colin's interview with Mark Cuban when he talked about what he learned from Dirk, and the mistakes he won't make with Luka (36:39).
