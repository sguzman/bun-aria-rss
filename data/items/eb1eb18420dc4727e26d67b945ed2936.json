There's no demand for the book by Trump's disgruntled niece who alleges -- without evidence -- that his father abused him. Trump niece book will bomb, in part because people expect you to keep family problems in the family. Jason Whitlock is one of the few willing to call out Black Lives Matter as radicals, rips NFL for caving and insulting fan base. Twitter is not America.

Scott Jensen, Republican of Minnesota, dares expose the government for falsely claiming COVID-19 deaths. You dare not speak out against the regime. Not a single bit of optimism about COVID-19, just never-ending pessimism to make Trump look bad. Guess what? Now it's proven that these anti-American protests spread the virus, says the NY Times.
