  "description": "We're continuing our weeklong series of some of our favorite music interviews from our archive. We'll hear several interviews recorded with the late Charlie Haden, one of the greatest bass players in the history of jazz. Haden grew up singing in his family's country music radio shows but turned to the bass when polio damaged his vocal cords. He helped lead a musical revolution in the late 1950s and early '60s, performing in the Ornette Coleman Quartet. He formed his own jazz bands but also returned to traditional music when he recorded with his triplet daughters, wife and son.<br/><br/>Also, David Bianculli reviews HBO's <em>The Patient</em>, starring Steve Carell.",
