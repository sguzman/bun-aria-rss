  "description": "<p>The fact that money is so <em>measurable</em> is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because your budget, your salary, how much you have set aside in investment accounts- basically all dollar amounts in your life are very quantifiable. And because of that it’s not difficult to make some tweaks in order to see some movement with your net worth. Awesome! But at the same time it’s a curse- <em>because</em> these are measurements that are so readily available, we can often overly rely on these numbers to let us know how we’re doing in life. If you’re overly focused on the numbers and if your life satisfaction is purely determined by how much you’ve got in the bank, then we’d argue that you’re incorrectly using your wealth as the main measurement of life satisfaction. So hear us out: the argument we’re putting forth today is that maybe we should all consider dying destitute! We discuss some great reasons to consider spending all your money, how to spend your money in a way that brings you the most joy and happiness, whether you should give money away before or after you die, and some thoughts on leaving money to your kids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Want more How To Money in your life?
