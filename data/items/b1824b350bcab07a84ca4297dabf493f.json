  "title": "It Ain't a Thing (feat. Rahul Kohli)",
  "description": "We highlighted Rahul Kohli in our \"More, More, More\" episode, which went over so well, we decided to give you... well, more. So we got Rahul on FaceTime, before he'd even finished his morning coffee, to ask him why he's so dang hot. He explained his Big Geek Energy, his man-crushes, what it's like auditioning for roles in the UK vs the US, the significance of playing Ravi Chakrabarti on iZombie, and his efforts to get black women on the show. We don't have any video of our chat, but trust us: he wakes up flawless. Because this is a special episode, we did something a little different with drabbles this week. Get ready for Rahul's morning voice, Thirst Buckets. It's almost too much to handle.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line!
