  "description": "<p>On this week's Watch What Crappens, Matt Whitfield (Yahoo), Ben Mandelker, (bsideblog) and Ronnie Karam (TVgasm) are all about video! We did our first live video podcast on our Youtube page (http://www.youtube.com/thetvclique) and had a great time. We actually started with an entire hour of RHOC joint slamming with the gang over at YourRealityRecap, which you can find on episode #87. Then we came back to our own channel to talk more RHOC finale, the snoozefest that was RHONJ, and of course, the ending of the ridiculous(ly fun) Princesses. Just when you thought we couldn't talk any more, we got on a Food Network Star roll. This one is long, it's insane, and it was a total blast.</p>\n<p>Check out our Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens) for announcements on when our next live Crappens show will be, and join us at our TheTVClique: Big Brother live every Thursday night post eviction (10:30 Pacific Time) on our YouTube page!
