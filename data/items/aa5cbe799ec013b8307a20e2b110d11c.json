Molekule is a complete reinvention of the air purifier, not just an improvement on existing, outdated technology. It was developed by a scientist whose son suffered from asthma and who was frustrated by the fact HEPA air purifiers did not relieve his son’s symptoms. As a result, Dr.Yogi Goswami spent 20 years developing a completely new, totally effective way of removing indoor air pollutants. Unlike HEPA filters, Molekule destroys indoor air pollutants at a molecular level, completely removing them from the air you breathe.</p>\n\n<p>Red light for Night vision<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision</a><br>\n<br>\nGemini<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation</a><br>\n<br>\nSide by Side song<br>\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_by_Side_(1927_song%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_by_Side_(1927_song)%5C\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_by_Side_(1927_song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_by_Side_(1927_song)\\</a><br>\n<br>\nHow to shoot one actor as twins in same shot<br>\n<a href=\"http://cinefex.com/blog/twinning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://cinefex.com/blog/twinning/</a><br>\n<br>\nSmoke stacks<br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_chimneys\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<em>of</em>tallest_chimneys</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<em>of</em>tallest<em>buildings</em>and_structures</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-dead-dream-of-the-dirigible/256758/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-dead-dream-of-the-dirigible/256758/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/question238.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/question238.htm</a><br>\n<br>\nWhy called Led Zeppelin<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-10-wildest-led-zeppelin-legends-fact-checked-153103/keith-moon-of-the-who-gave-led-zeppelin-their-name-154053/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-10-wildest-led-zeppelin-legends-fact-checked-153103/keith-moon-of-the-who-gave-led-zeppelin-their-name-154053/</a><br>\n<br>\nOne little spark song<br>\n<a href=\"http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/One_Little_Spark\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/One<em>Little</em>Spark</a></p>",
