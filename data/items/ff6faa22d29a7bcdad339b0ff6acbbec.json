  "itunes:summary": "As part of the exhibition Site & Sound: Sonic art as ecological practice at McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery, Liquid Architecture was invited to stage a project critically responding to themes of sonic art, acoustic ecology, field recording, deep listening, and spatial sound, all understood in the context of profound environmental crisis and instability.\n\nA Hanley’s practice is interested in listening as an affective practice and the possibilities of sound as an expression of human and non-human exchange. This comes through in their piece SUNKLAND.XYZ, in which field recordings of the Carrum Carrum Swamp and surrounding areas of the McClelland site uncover the history of the movement of water. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/unheard-relations\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/a-hanley\n\nImage: A Hanley\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture",
