  "description": "<p>There are a number of confusing things in life- for some it’s deciphering the latest Christopher Nolan film, for others it might be the process of building whatever is in that flat pack box from Ikea. But what about taxes? They can also be a puzzling topic and we also tend to have some janky tax ideas in our brains. Unfortunately, those ideas are often what we base our decisions on if we don’t have a tax professional in our life. So our goal for this episode is to clear up some more common tax misconceptions out there and to make sure that we’re all making decisions based on what’s true instead of based on a video that someone made on TikTok, or what we heard a friend say.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Sponch-O Villa by J Wakefield!
