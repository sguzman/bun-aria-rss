  "description": "<p>The Parks department is back—and so is the Recollection team! Today Rob Lowe and Alan Yang talk about the season 2 Parks and Recreation premiere. In “Pawnee Zoo,” Leslie promotes a local zoo by marrying two penguins. When both birds end up being male, it causes a bit of a stir. Today we get a look at what it takes to rap poorly, Tom being besties with Joan Callamezzo, and the intense work that went into every character’s name on the show. It’s another great day in Pawnee!<br />Got a question for the Pawnee Town Hall?
