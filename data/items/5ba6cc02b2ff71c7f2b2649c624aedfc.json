  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Gregg Rosenthal are joined in studio by superstar NFL analyst Mina Kimes to bring you all the latest news from around the league. We start with new Broncos' owner mispronouncing Roger Goodell's name (5:42). Mekhi Becton is expected to miss all of the 2022 season with a fractured kneecap (8:20), Roquan Smith has requested a trade from the Bears (13:38), Shaquille Leonard may miss some of the regular season recovering from back surgery (16:44), and Aaron Rodgers spoke recently about his ayahuasca experience (21:11). The group quickly shares their thoughts on the Hard Knocks season premiere (24:20) before getting into the 2022 NFL Team Win Totals Over/Under draft (32:01). We go around a few times with each host picking over or under a team's win total based on how confident they are in their selection, and we will track the results throughout the season. Picks include the Bears, Saints, Texans, Patriots, Eagles, Lions, Commanders, Cowboys, Chiefs, Cardinals, Chargers, and Bills. We close with a rapid-fire final round hitting the 49ers, Colts, Raiders, Dolphins, and Titans.</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
