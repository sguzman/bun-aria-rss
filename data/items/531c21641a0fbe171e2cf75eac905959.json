The band is very much a \"undiscovered gem\" and frankly, they weren't that prolific or long lasting but always stuck in my head. Jeff played drums in the band and we get to nerd out about the band and their place within the metal core world and playing 17 minute sets. Enjoy and hopefully you will find one of your new favorite bands.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
