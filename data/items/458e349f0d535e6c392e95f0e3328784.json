  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, there is a huge breaking news story from the New York Post which is being censored by Twitter and Facebook. Newly discovered emails reveal that Hunter Biden introduced his father, the sitting Vice President at that time, to his colleagues at Burisma to leverage his influence to stop an investigation into the company. Soon after, VP Biden threatened to withhold a billion dollars in US loan guarantees unless the Ukrainians fired the special prosecutor that was investigating Burisma. The media will run with unvetted, unmanned sources, and books by authors that hate President Trump. The NY Post’s information has multiple named sources and actual emails to corroborate their report. VP Biden is on the record saying he's never had a single conversation regarding his son's business dealings. Then, author Peter Schweizer calls in to explain how Hunter Biden's claim to fame was access to the VP, his father. The media never stopped to censor or block false stories about Trump so that they can be fact-checked. Nor did the media ever block any stories containing feloniously leaked information as a source, but they are comfortable covering it up to protect the Biden campaign. Later, Dan Bongino joins the show to discuss his new book, Follow The Money: The Shocking Deep State Connections of the Anti Trump Cabal.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
