  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Diwali! And we couldn't even think about breaking down this episode without checking in with the amazing triple threat herself, Mindy Kaling! Mindy walks us through how she came to work on The Office, what it was like for her to be able to pitch and write Diwali, and explains why they cast her actual parents in this episode. Then Jenna and Angela dig into this episode even deeper covering Kevin's sweaty feet, and what went into filming and costuming the Diwali festivities. Finally, we connect with Jaysha Patel, who played one of Mindy's sisters and get her memories of filming this episode, why sushi and bottle service don't mix, and we end with a great BFF catch. </p>\n",
