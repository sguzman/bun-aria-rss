  "description": "<p>What is it about theaters that causes them to so often have tales of haunting experiences? Is it the emotions that are displayed on the stage and evoked in the audience? Are they just more prone to accidents and death? Landers Theater in Springfield, Missouri is one such theater. This theater has stood for decades and seen much history. Famous performers took to the stage, including Lillian Russell and Lon Chaney. When motion pictures became the thing, the theater adapted. But there is more than just a rich history to this place. Something else seems to have carried over through the decades. Spirit activity is reportedly high inside this elegant theater. Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Landers Theater. Moment in Oddity features the Skeleton Under the Tree and This Day in History features Harriet Tubman and her Flight to Freedom.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-69-landers-theater.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-69-landers-theater.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer of the show:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
