  "title": "26: Peace in Ghent, War in New Orleans",
  "description": "“I could have walked on the dead bodies of the British for one-quarter of a mile without stepping on the ground.”\nThis is the story of peace and war; of self-destruction and political birth. American and British negotiators are hashing out a peace treaty in Ghent, Belgium. The War of 1812 is over! But funny things can happen when word of the treaty’s signing hasn’t made it back to the US. Some out-of-power Federalists are going to make a few ill-timed demands in Washington, D.C., inadvertently killing their own party. Meanwhile, American and British troops are still fighting in New Orleans. \nThe Treaty of Ghent might exist now, but they don’t know about it, and it isn’t ratified, so the Battle of New Orleans rages. It’s violent. Bloody. Deadly. And unnecessary. But the British fight against a motley mix of Free Black, French-, Spanish-, and Anglo-Americans--as well as pirates!--a new and unlikely political star is born. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the future 7th President of the United States: General Andrew Jackson.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
