  "description": "Lindsay Mayka’s new book examines the idea and implementation of participatory institutions, asking the question about when they actually work, and when they do not work, and why this is the case, especially in Latin America. Building Participatory Institutions in Latin America: Reform Coalitions and Institutional Change (Cambridge University Press, 2019) explores, especially in the introductory and concluding chapters, the countries that make up Latin America, but the thrust of the book focuses specifically on Brazil and Colombia. The concept of participatory institutions is tied to considerations of building citizenship within democracies and especially within the institutions that form the governmental structures of a democracy. Mayka’s research looks at particular cases in both Brazil and in Colombia to understand the variables that contributed to success and to see what may have been missing in situations that proved less successful. This is a complex examination of the dynamics that thread through the creation of participatory institutions and how those ideas are then moved from paper to concrete, functioning institutions and processes. Building Participatory Institutions in Latin America examines different cases to assess the different dynamics and components at play in building these institutions, taking the reader through comparative and distinct policy arenas and exploring the differences in citizenship engagement between Brazil and Colombia in these issue areas.\nLilly J. Goren is professor of political science at Carroll University in Waukesha, WI. She is co-editor of the award winning book, Women and the White House: Gender, Popular Culture, and Presidential Politics (University Press of Kentucky, 2012).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
