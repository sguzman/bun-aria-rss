Together they think through ways to help kids develop awareness, perspective, and gratitude. They talk about the importance of teaching your child how to think, not what to think, and why asking questions that your child doesn’t have answers for is part of a strategy of cultivating thoughtfulness.\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
