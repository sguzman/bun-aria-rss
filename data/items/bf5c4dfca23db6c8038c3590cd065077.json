Later, the trio look at Ravens QB Lamar Jackson's big game in a win vs. the Browns (8:20).

Then, DJ and Bucky emphasize how their pinky promise is looking good after the Cardinals beat the 49ers (28:02). To wrap up the show, Rhett explains why the Falcons have too much talent to be trailing the whole game like they did vs. the Seahawks (33:06).
