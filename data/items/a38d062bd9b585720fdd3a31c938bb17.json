Here’s how to do it using <a title=\"RSiteCatalyst CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSiteCatalyst/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">RSiteCatalyst</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"generating-adobe-analytics-documentation-file\">Generating Adobe Analytics documentation file</h2>\n\n<p>The code below outlines the commands needed to generate an Excel file (<a title=\"Example Excel file Adobe Analytics Documentation\" href=\"http://randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/adobe_analytics_implementation_doc.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">see example</a>) with six tabs containing the basic structure of an Adobe Analytics. This report contains all of the report suites you have access to, the elements that reports can be broken down by, traffic variables (props), conversion variables (eVars) and segments available for reporting.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, within each tab metadata is provided that contains the various settings for variables, so you’ll be able to document the expiration settings for eVars, participation, list variables, segment types and so on. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><table class=\"rouge-table\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter gl\"><pre class=\"lineno\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"RSiteCatalyst\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"n\">library</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"WriteXLS\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n\n</span><span class=\"c1\">#Validate that underlying Perl modules for WriteXLS are installed correctly</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"c1\">#Will return \"Perl found.

The WriteXLS package uses Perl as the underlying code, so you’ll need to validate that the package is installed correctly, which is done using the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">testPerl()</code> function in the package.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"this-is-pretty-bare-bones-no\">This is pretty bare-bones, no?</h2>\n\n<p>After you run this code, you’ll have an Excel file that has all of the underlying characteristics of your Adobe Analytics implementation. It’s important to realize that this is only the <em>starting</em> point; a great set of documentation will contain other pieces of information such as where/when the value is set (on entry, every page, when certain events occur, etc.), a layman’s explanation about what the data element means and other <em>business information</em> so your stakeholders can be confident they are using the data correctly. Additionally, you might consider creating a single Excel file for every report suite in your implementation. It’s trivial to modify the code above to subset each data frame used above for a single value of rsid, then write to separate Excel files. Regardless of how your structure your documentation, DOCUMENT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION! The employees that come after you (and your future self!) will thank you.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT 2/4/2016: Thanks to reader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CSitty\" target=\"_blank\">@CSitty</a> for pointing out the R code became a little stale. The documentation generating code should now work again for RSiteCatalyst versions &gt;= 1.4 and WriteXLS &gt;= 4.0 (basically, any current version as of the time of this update).</em></p>"
