  "title": "Episode 149: The Tragic Murder of Matthew Shepard Part 1",
  "description": "If you grew up in the 90s, Matthew Shepard's face is something that has probably stayed with you since his murder on October 6, 1998.<br>\n<br>\nMatthew was lured from a bar in Laramie, Wyoming by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. Their intent was to pose as gay men and rob Matthew. What occurred was much more than robbery. They used a .357 magnum revolver to beat him to death, tying him to a buck fence and leaving him to die for 18 hours in the freezing Wyoming cold. His death was a scream for stronger legislation of hate crimes, particularly against the LGBTQ+ community. In Part 1, we discuss Matt's life, his murderer's lives and his brutal assault. <br>\n<br>\nCheck out these sources:<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Matt-Shepard-Friend-Michele-Josue/dp/B015XMK0T0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ESVY2YO36QUE&dchild=1&keywords=matt+shepard+is+a+friend+of+mine&qid=1592620962&sprefix=Matt+Shepard%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Shepard Is A Friend Of Mine</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Meaning-Matthew-Murder-Laramie-Transformed-ebook/dp/B002N83GU8/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Matthew+shepard&qid=1592620889&sr=8-2\" target=\"_blank\">The Meaning of Matthew by Judy Shepard</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Thanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\nSimpliSafe<br>\n</strong>Head to <a href=\"http://SimpliSafe.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">SimpliSafe.com/MORBID</a> and get FREE SHIPPING and A 60 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE and to make sure they know that our<br>\nshow sent you.<br>\n<strong><br>\nMolekule<br>\n</strong>For 10% off your first air purifier order, visit <a href=\"http://Molekule.com\" target=\"_blank\">Molekule.com</a> and at checkout enter Morbid.<strong><br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh</strong><br>\nGo to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid60\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid60</a> and use code morbid60 to get $60 off your first three weeks, including free shipping on your first box.
