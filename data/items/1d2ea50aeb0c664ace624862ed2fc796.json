  "description": "<p>Heard of this guy before? If you haven't, I'm with you. I hadn't either. And then once I got into this story, I wondered HOW had I never heard of him? This story is insane. Karl Denke killed, it seems, at least 30 people in Ziębice, Poland (formerly Münsterberg, Weimar Republic aka Germany). And he ate them. And he sold some of their meat to others. Probably many, MANY others. And he made suspenders out of their skin and shoelaces out of their hair and on and on and on. And he did that out of his apartment, surrounded by neighbors, for over two decades. How? Partially - due to hyperinflation. Yes, hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic led to so much economic chaos that people were a lot more worried about surviving than they were about what their neighbors were up to. And why haven't more of us heard about Karl? Because of another killer operating nearby at the same time who was even more disturbing - Fritz Haarmann. We'll go over some of his crimes as well. True crime, the economic chaos of German's Interwar Years and more on an outlandish edition of Timesuck. <br /><br /></p>\n<p>Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions donate $13,800 this month to <strong>The Ocular Melanoma Foundation</strong>, in honor of Timesucker Alex Roach.</p>\n<p>To find out more, go to <a href=\"http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/\"><strong>http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oIvZy2JwlHs\">https://youtu.be/oIvZy2JwlHs</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
