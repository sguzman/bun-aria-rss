  "description": "It sure did take Glen Hansard a while to capture the world's attention. Long a star in his native Ireland, thanks to a long string of albums with The Frames, Hansard couldn't catch a break in America, where he bounced from label to label without finding much success. But then Hansard and young Czech singer Marketa Irglova sang and starred together in a little 2007 indie movie called 'Once,' and everything changed: The two won an Oscar for \"Falling Slowly,\" the movie's soundtrack sold millions, and The Frames gave way to The Swell Season, in which Hansard and his old band perform with Irglova. The two singers' romantic relationship ended as they were recording 2009's 'Strict Joy,' but they continue to work and perform together. Here, The Swell Season performs live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
