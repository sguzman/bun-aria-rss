  "description": "<p>Entering a fresh, new year after the one we just finished has left us feeling isolated, restless and bored. We're carrying over routines and patterns we adjusted to in 2020 that we thought were only temporary. And in the midst of all that changed, we might've lost a bit of who we are. <br> <br> Friend, if this describes how you're feeling, you're not alone! Can we share something hopeful with you? God can restore and revive your heart, even when your circumstances don't change.<br> <br> In this practical and helpful episode, Rebekah Lyons walks us through four rhythms to renew our minds: rest, restore, connect and create. These rhythms are meant to help us sustain emotional, relational and spiritual health and live in the abundance of life God has for us.</p><p>Related Resources: - Connect with Rebekah at </p><p><a href=\"https://rebekahlyons.com\">https://rebekahlyons.com</a>.<br> - Make sure you grab a copy of Rebekah's book, <a href=\"https://www.christianbook.com/rhythms-renewal-trading-stress-anxiety-purpose/rebekah-lyons/9780310356141/pd/356141?product_redirect=1&search_term=rebekah%20lyons&Ntt=356141&item_code=&ps_exit=PRODUCT&Ntk=keywords&event=ESRCP\"><em>Rhythms of Renewal: Trading Stress and Anxiety for a Life of Peace and Purpose</em></a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.christianbook.com/rhythms-planner-journal-days-peace-purpose/rebekah-lyons/9780310361169/pd/361169?product_redirect=1&search_term=rebekah%20lyons&Ntt=361169&item_code=&ps_exit=PRODUCT&Ntk=keywords&event=ESRCP\"><em>Rhythms for Life Planner and Journal: 90 Days to Peace and Purpose.</em></a><br> - Are you looking for a new study at the start of the new year?
