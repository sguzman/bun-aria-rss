  "description": "<p>Get ready to learn the science behind the multiverse! That’s the idea that our universe isn’t the only universe out there. What if there were other, different universes existing alongside our own? Ones with different laws of physics, different planets and stars… or maybe even different versions of us! </p>\n<p>In this episode we explain a few different theories behind this popular idea. Plus, we’ll learn some quantum mechanics, hear about string theory and meet many different versions of Sanden. All that and a brand new Mystery Sound!<br><br>Today’s episode is sponsored by Truebill (truebill.com/brainson) and Shopify (shopify.com/brainson).
