  "description": "<p>Martha Stewart has dominated all things domestic for nearly 35 years. But what about the woman behind the empire? Last year, Katie and Brian talked with Martha over some apple-cranberry crisp, and in honor of Thanksgiving, we're revisiting that conversation. Martha recalls what it was like growing up in New Jersey as one of six kids, getting her first book deal, serving time in prison and what it was like to work on a TV show with Donald Trump. Plus, she discusses her slow-cooker cookbook and her collaboration with Snoop Dogg. Nothing is off-limits. It's a good thing.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
