  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">With the world being rocked by a pandemic and protests, many are seeing signs of the end times predicted by the Bible. Are they right? Some say they are misreading the signs. Others argue they’re misreading the Bible itself. Biblical scholar, Dr. Juan Hernandez, is back to discuss the right way—and the wrong way—to engage one of the most mysterious, and misread, book in the Bible. Also this week, what does “white privilege” actually mean and why do so many people react to the term? Evangelicals are upset about “cancel culture” but did they actually invent it? And learn how to avoid paying a farting fine in Austria. (Hint—it’s all about intestinal intent.)</p> <p class=\"p1\"> </p> <div>Evangelicals perfected cancel culture.
