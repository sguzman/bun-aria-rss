  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane answers the demands of the Minifans by adding another Saco show to his summer drive-in theater tour. Details at FireKmarko.com. Howard Stern said on The View that he's never used the n-word on the radio; we found dozens and dozens of examples of him using the n-word on radio (0:14:00). A pair of Barstool wannabes tried to make their big break into podcasting by analyzing the Minihane-Kmarko fight and somehow managed to get every single detail wrong (1:03:00). A former NESN sports broadcaster says she fled Boston because of the racism, but she used to say it was all part of her rise to ESPN (1:32:20).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
