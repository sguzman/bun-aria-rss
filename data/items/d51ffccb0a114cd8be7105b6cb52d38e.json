  "description": "<p>Hormoz Rashidi met me at the LA bungalow I was staying in while I was recording the next season of This Is Not Happening and he tried explaining to me all the histories of the middle east and our current involvement there. I don't know what Hormoz's background is, but he's real knowledgable about the whole region and this conversation really opened my eyes up to a way of thinking really plainly about the individuals involved in getting the US to go over there. It's the way I like thinking about almost every subject and I'm glad I finally got to do it about the middle east.</p>",
