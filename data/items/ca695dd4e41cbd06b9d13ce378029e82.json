  "description": "<p><p>On this week's episode, the guys are without Whitney, who is on Karlsson watch over in Europe. Meanwhile, the boys were joined by former NHL tendy Jason LaBarbera. The guys talked about some of the crazy rosters Jason has been apart of as well as some crazy stories from those teams. With it being the summer, the guys dropped the hockey talk for a little and were joined by Paul's friend “Arch Bishop” who gets paid by people with foot fetishes. Some crazy stories and we learn how people are actually making money off this.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
