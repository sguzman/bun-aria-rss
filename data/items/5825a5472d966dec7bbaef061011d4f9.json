    "media:description": "The mid-80s was make-or-break time for Kate Bush. Since her breakthrough in 1978, she’d been gradually alienating her fans with successive ambitious but non-commercial left turns. As such, her label EMI was seriously concerned for her future as a pop artist. \n\nHowever, that all changed in 1985. She returned after 18 months at her farmhouse recording studio with her weirdness intact and a song about Faustian-deals, body swapping and the power of love. And it saved her career. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God).”\n\n#KateBush #runningupthathill #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:02 The Dramatic Left Turn of The Dreaming\n10:03 Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\n17:53 Hounds of Love \"It's in the Trees, It's Coming\"\n21:45 The Ninth Wave \"Little Light Shining\"\n26:18 What Kate Bush Did Next\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
