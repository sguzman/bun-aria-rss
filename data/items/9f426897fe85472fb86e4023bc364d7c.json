  "description": "“Grant is my man and I am his the rest of the war.”\n\nThis is the story of hard fighting—on the battlefield and in the courts.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln is making the controversial decision to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. While the Constitution does permit this to be done “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion” that  threaten “the public Safety,” is the executive branch the one to do it? Is it prudent?\n\nMeanwhile, battles rage across the nation. Stone’s River claims a higher percentage of combatants than any other battle has or will. Ulysses S. Grant is laying siege to Vicksburg, which is the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. Can he do it, effectively cutting the CSA in two? Finally, friendly fire is laying low one of the Confederacy’s most talented generals at Chancellorsville. The war will never be the same.\n\n.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
