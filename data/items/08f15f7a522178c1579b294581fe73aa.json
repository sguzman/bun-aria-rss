  "description": "<p>7-month-old Christopher Abeyta disappeared from his crib on July 15, 1986. His family lived in a quiet neighborhood of Colorado Springs, Colorado and were in the habit of leaving their doors unlocked. No one heard anyone come in and take Christopher that night but by morning, he was gone. Panic immediately set in when no one could find the baby. They ran downstairs to find the front door left open. The investigation focused on the family for a long time but in recent years, a person of interest has been identified. Even though detectives focused so much on the family, that didn't stop the Abeyta's from searching on their own. One of Christopher's sisters, Denise, joined me for this episode.</p><p>In this first part of the story, we will go over the first 23 years of the search for Christopher. In Part 2, we will discuss the more recent developments.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Christopher Abeyta, please call 1-800-THE-LOST or Colorado Springs Police Department at 719-444-7000.</p><p>You can follow Christopher's case at <a href=\"http://findchristopher.com\" target=\"_blank\">findchristopher.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/findchristopher/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/findchristopher/</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://blueapron.com/vanished\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Apron</a>&nbsp;- Get $30 off your first order and with free shipping by visiting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blueapron.com/vanished\" target=\"_blank\">BlueApron.com/Vanished</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://adt.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\">ADT</a>- Get the ADT Security Starter kit including a security panel, keypad, motion sensor, two entry sensors, indoor camera and keyfod.
