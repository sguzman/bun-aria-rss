  "title": "Weekly Roundup: Thursday, February 8",
  "description": "Senate leaders reached a two-year, bipartisan budget deal, but with just hours left before government funding runs out again, it's still unclear if it will get the votes to pass. Because the deal does not address DACA, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took to the House floor on Wednesday for a record 8 hours in protest. And a top White House aide has resigned, after two of his ex-wives accused him of physical abuse, raising questions about what the administration knew and when. This episode, host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben and political editor Domenico Montanaro.
