  "description": "<p>If you’re a leader, you’re a creator! This week on The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast, John talks about the things leaders create in their organizations and in their people. They create confidence, ideas, strategy, and options.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole and Chris Goede will offer some ways you can apply John’s lesson to your own life and leadership. They discuss how many leaders are the most creative when they are working in their strength zone, and how leaders who don’t think of themselves as creative need to be reminded to get back <em>into</em> their strength zone.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “Leaders are Creators Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
