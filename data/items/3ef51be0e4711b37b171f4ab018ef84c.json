  "description": "<p><p>To start the show, Chaps officially serves Kate her Page 11. A Brigadier General got shot by the Taliban, so the show discusses how motivated his troops would be upon his return. Kate gets jazzed about new female Marine uniforms. A story came out about a bunch of soldiers who were catfished and blackmailed by prisoners, so we make fun of them! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
