  "title": "ZBT #198: ISIS Has Ran Out Of Suicide Bombers, So Now They Use Cows + Remembering 9/11 featuring Large",
  "description": "<p><p>ROUND 1: The news that the Taliban were going to meet with Trump at Camp David the day before 9/11 caused a firestorm, but now the talks have stalled & they're not meeting at all</p><p>ROUND 2: The Army has launched an inquiry into how a teen with autism and arm disorders was recruited</p><p>ROUND 3: General McCraven's Lessons In Leadership</p><p>ROUND 4: ISIS is using cows as suicide bombers but I hate that term because these beautiful beautiful cows dont have a choice in the matter. They are murder bombers.</p><p>ROUND 5: Does the term “If it ain't rainin', we ain't trainin'” make you roll your eyes a little? We get into a little PT talk with a poll from the ZBT twitterverse. </p><p>ROUND 6:  With the 18th anniversary of September 11th this week we'll be closing out the show by re-playing an interview we recorded last year with our co-worker Large. He lost his father-in-law in the attacks, and we're so grateful he shared his story with us! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
