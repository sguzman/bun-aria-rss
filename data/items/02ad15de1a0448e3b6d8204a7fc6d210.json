  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Evangelicals used to believe the way to transform America was through revivalism. Increasingly, they now believe it’s through revolution. Why are so many buying into Christian nationalism? What is it? And what can we do about those caught in this heretical gospel of political domination? Phil, Skye, and Christian discuss the issue. Also this week, Dr. Derwin Gray—former NFL player and lead pastor of a multiethnic church in North Carolina—joins Skye to talk about his new book on the Beatitudes, “The Good Life,” and why Jesus was the happiest person ever. Gray also unpacks why so many pastors are afraid to talk about race and politics. Plus—nano chameleons and scientists teach vegetables to send emails.</p> <p class=\"p3\"><a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/opinion/christian-nationalists-capitol-attack.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/opinion/christian-nationalists-capitol-attack.html</a></p> <p class=\"p3\"><a href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/discerning-the-difference-between\"> https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/discerning-the-difference-between</a></p>",
