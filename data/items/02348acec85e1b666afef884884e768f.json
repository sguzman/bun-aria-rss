  "description": "Frank Dobson, Jr.‘s Rendered Invisible: Stories of Blacks and Whites, Love and Death  (Plain View Press, 2010) is a single-authored collection of fiction. It includes the opening, gripping novella “Rendered Invisible,” which gives the book its title. That’s followed by five notable short stories: “Black Messiahs Die,” about a black college basketball player who is murdered by police officers; “Homeless M.F,” about a homeless, ex-convict who is picked up by a rich woman for sex; “Junior Ain’t,” which features a fatherless boy who is antagonized by his wealthier, two-parent cousins; “Another Continent,” a study of unrequited love between professors; and “It Falls between,” a meditation on white racial anxiety and its affect on a working class black man. The stories are nice complements to the opening “Rendered,” the fictionalized account of the factual serial killing of black men in 1980 in Buffalo, New York. Dobson discussed his book, black life, the role of literature in society, and why he loves his job as an educator and writer. Listen in. You’ll enjoy it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
