  "description": "<p>TST's own Thaddeus Brown has taken a vacation from his job filming in Dubai to return to the home base. After filming nearly half the content on /DRIVE and The Smoking Tire, he left to seek fame and sun burns. He's returned with tales of lawless driving, speed limits go ignored, the deletion of blinkers, turbo-charged off-roaders, and his 6-month stretch decidind what used car to buy. Should he buy a C63 AMG? Or a used Ford Raptor? What about a rally car? Maybe finance a McLaren (hint: no)? Or should he buy a BMW M3? The circle goes round and round. </p>\n",
