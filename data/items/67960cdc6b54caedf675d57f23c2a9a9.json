  "description": "Today’s podcast featuring the roundtable talks about the controversial relaunch of the OKI brand. We examine the potential motivating factors behind New Riff selling the label and if it’s a pure money grab by the new company that owns it. We then look at the current landscape of craft distillers and if they will survive the COVID-19 conditions as over 43% of all craft distillery workers have now been laid off or furloughed. Lastly, we see an age statement return to Knob Creek.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about buying whiskey for cheap during the pandemic.\n\nOKI is being relaunched with new ownership. Why would New Riff do this and is it a money grab?\n\n118 craft distillers surveyed recently, 42% said they do not believe they will able to stay in business for more than three months with COVID-19. Is the craft boom going to bust?\n\nThe return of 12 and 9 year Knob Creek. What does this mean for private barrel selections?\n\nThanks to Blake from bourbonr.com, Nick from BreakingBourbon.com, Brian from sippncorn.com, and Kerry from Subourbia for joining.\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
