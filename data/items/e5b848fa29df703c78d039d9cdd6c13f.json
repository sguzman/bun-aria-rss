  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's season premier of Hard Knocks with the Dallas Cowboys, and how it was nice to see a different side of Dak Prescott, Zeke Elliott, Mike McCarthy, Jerry Jones, and other members of the Cowboys, what the best moments were, what they're excited for in future episodes, and how this is once again another indication that the NFL season is right around the corner. Joining the program is the GM of the Buffalo Bills and friend of the show, Brandon Beane. Pat and Brandon chat about Josh Allen recently signing a new 6 year deal for $150 million guaranteed and how they got a good portion of it worked out on the golf course, why he's excited about what's happening in Buffalo, what he's looking at in preseason games as opposed to players and the average fan, how he's constructed this Bills roster and his philosophy on being a GM in the NFL (45:53-1:05:15). Next, the current WWE Universal Champion, The Head of the Table, The Tribal Chief, the biggest superstar in the WWE, Roman Reigns joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his upcoming title match at SummerSlam against John Cena, his football career at Georgia Tech and what it was like playing with Calvin Johnson, if he ever gets burnt out with all the travel and the weight of having the company on his shoulders, and much more (1:05:19-1:21:17). Later, coming off an Olympic Gold Medal in golf, the #4 ranked player in the world, Xander Schauffele joins Pat and AJ to chat about his Olympic experience, his mindset when first coming on the tour to now when he's an established force, if nerves were a factor at all in Tokyo, and much more (1:27:37-1:42:55).
