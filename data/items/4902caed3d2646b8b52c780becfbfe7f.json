  "description": "We get asked this question again and again across all our platforms, so today we decided to give the people what they want and talk about how we do gallery walls. It’s a visual game of Tetris and memory collecting, and we talk about where to do it because you don’t want a gallery wall in your entry. For gallery walls, you want to have somewhat of a theme where you don’t want to have a picture of George Washington, and then your family right next to it. You can put textiles on the walls, such as a nice scarf from your travels to give it texture, and then for music artists, putting vinyl records or instruments is great. <br /><br />Tried and true tips on hanging art on walls 1:48<br />Is there a rule for mixing and matching in a gallery wall? 7:17<br />How to put it together 16:17<br />Favorite gallery wall items 21:42<br />Common mistakes 28:14<br />Spacing and dimensions 32:36<br /><br />“Make sure you have a level, but then also look at when you’re hanging a piece of art because not always is your ceiling, or whatever comparable line you’re looking at your art next to, not always is that gonna be straight. Your eye is gonna be your biggest truth finder.” 3:37<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
