Along the way, this episode delves into what kinds of emotions one might feel at every stage in one’s career.

A job well done that isn’t noticed won’t advance your fortunes.\nLindsey Pollak is the New York Times bestselling author of three previous books and was named to the 2020 Thinkers50 Radar List of global management thinkers. Her consulting and keynote speaking clients have included over 250 various corporations, law firms, and universities.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of nine books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc.
