  "description": "<p>The St. Augustine Lighthouse is actually a Light Station, meaning that the lighthouse is accompanied by several outbuildings. This is one of the tallest and oldest lighthouses in America. We visited with several History Goes Bump listeners to experience the Dark of the Moon Ghost Tour. While many families lived here without incident, there were a couple that suffered tragedy. And it is through those tragedies that spiritual energy seems to have continued on, even after all these years. We had what seemed to be an experience of our own. Come with us as we share that and the history and hauntings of the St. Augustine Light Station. The Moment in Oddity features the Eillean Mor Lighthouse Mystery and This Day in History features the Battle of Neville's Cross.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and our personal photos, including of our group, can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-76-st-augustine-light.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/10/hgb-podcast-ep-76-st-augustine-light.html</a></p> <p>Love the show and want to help keep us on the air and bringing you more content?
