  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Utopianism attempts to shape and dominate the individual by doing two things at once: it strips the individual of his uniqueness, making him indistinguishable from the multitudes that form what is commonly referred to as 'the masses,' but it simultaneously assigns him to a group identity based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, income, etc., to highlight differences within the masses. Clearly, Utopianism is incompatible with Constitutionalism. Engels and Marx teach that society must be destroyed in order to remake it, violent groups like ANTIFA that insist on destroying civil society are radical Marxists at their core. Then, a group of former Generals continue attacking President Trump. Meanwhile, Trump has been one of the most restrained Commander's-in-Chief in history. The same way that university professors have challenged individualism, these former military officers follow the lead of the communist-sympathizing intelligentsia. Later, the media is unabashedly the communications conduit for the left's messaging. Civic or activist journalists are advocates nor objective reporters of fact. Social activism and public or civic journalists are the new progressive standard in America's newsrooms. Afterward, Sen. Martha McSally calls in to discuss her new book, Dare to Fly: Simple Lessons in Never Giving Up.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
