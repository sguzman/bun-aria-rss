  "title": "Can Micro-Dosing Psychedelics Help Improve Mental Health? How to Safely Micro-Dose + Common Psychedelic Myths Debunked (with Paul Austin, Founder of Thirdwave)",
  "description": "<p>In this podcast, I speak with Paul Austin from The ThirdWave (a company that focuses on providing resources for safe, structured, and responsible psychedelic use) about the relationship between psychedelics and mental health, the different types of psychedelics and what they can be used for, how psychedelics can help overcome trauma and addiction, and how the responsible use of psychedelics can help us become more integrated mentally and physically and connected to the world around us. We also discuss how psychedelics can help with neuroplasticity, impact epigenetics, and how to safely micro-dose.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>This information is intended for educational purposes only.

I do, however, believe that it is important to have this conversation, and think of ways we can help everyone improve their mental health and find satisfaction and purpose. This is why I strongly believe we need to reduce the stigma around talking about psychedelics and researching safe and responsible ways we can use them to help people manage their minds and live their best lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information on Paul and The Thirdwave (tons of helpful resources and articles!) visit: http://paulaustin.co and https://thethirdwave.co</p>\n<p>More helpful resources: https://maps.org</p>\n<p>***Special offer from this week's podcast sponsors*** &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Liquid I.V Electrolytes (my favorite electrolytes!): Get 25% off with code DRLEAF at checkout https://liquid-iv.com &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-ThirdLove Bras (the most comfortable bras!!): To get 15% off your ThirdLove Bra order see: https://thirdlove.com/drleaf&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Podcast Highlights&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1:57&nbsp;What is Third Wave?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8:49&nbsp;What are psychedelics?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>20:00&nbsp;Why what comes after the psychedelic experience is so important&nbsp;</p>\n<p>23:40&nbsp;How do psychedelics compare to other forms of therapy?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>28:46&nbsp;The 3 main elements of a healthy psychedelic experience&nbsp;</p>\n<p>34:18&nbsp;The power of microdosing&nbsp;</p>\n<p>38:50&nbsp;The different types of psychedelics and how they can help with mental health&nbsp;</p>\n<p>50:00&nbsp;Are psychedelics addictive?</p>\n<p>1:00:20&nbsp;Epigenetics and psychedelics</p>\n<p>1:09:38&nbsp;Is ketamine safe?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read the show blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-psychedelics-can-help-improve-mental-brain-and-physical-health-how-to-safely-micro-dose-common-psychedelic-myths-debunked-with-paul-austin-founder-of-thirdwave</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to join my free text program and receive mental health care tips and strategies, exclusive offers and more!
