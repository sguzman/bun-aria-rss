  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Jaguars v. Saints preseason game, how Jacksonville didn't look good at all, Trevor Lawrence being under duress all night long, if Jameis Winston is going to start for the Saints after his great performance last night, some of the other Quarterback battles that may be dictated by Head Coaches who call plays, and much more. Joining the show is former 7 year NFL veteran at RB and current President of the Washington Football Team, Jason Wright. Pat and Jason chat about when the new team name will be announced, the enormous amount of pressure he's facing in order to get the decision correct, the strides they've made as an organization since he took over, how hard it is to speak in front of an NFL locker room as an outsider, and much more (24:14-42:29). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is hip-hop legend, producer, actor, and founder of the Big 3, Ice Cube, to chat about the Big 3 championship coming up this weekend in the Bahamas, whether or not he's still a Raiders fan after they left for Vegas, what projects he's got coming up, his acting career, how therapeutic it was filming Straight Outta Compton, his thoughts on \"Anaconda,\" and much more (44:33-1:06:42). Later, Pat and AJ discuss whether or not Urban Meyer will own things if the Jaguars are terrible, how impressed they've been with Zach Wilson so far this preseason, why invented advanced analytics can be damaging to the perception of quarterbacks, and everything else going on around the NFL as we are 16 days away from the start of the NFL season (1:08:07-1:33:26).
