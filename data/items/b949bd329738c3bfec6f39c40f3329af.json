  "description": "In the past few weeks of the crucial case for free speech and press, Wikileaks-founder Julian Assange was granted a new appeal on his extradition trial and it came out that a key witness (who is a diagnosed sociopath) admitted to lying, a smear campaign distorted much of what we know, and psychological torture was reported in the prison where he’s being held.\nRemember all that? You don’t? Well, do you read the New York Times and Washington Post? You do? But do you watch CNN and MSNBC? You watch those too? And they didn’t mention it at all? Hmm.\nSo why does no one cover the story that creates a precedent of criminalizing journalism? Because there’s a narrative that Assange helped Trump. What Assange did do was release court-deemed-pertinent documents on Hillary Clinton before the election. What he did not do is meet with Paul Manafort to brainstorm how to help the Trump campaign. But that’s the evidence-free story they’re going with. So of course liberal media can’t defend a guy who helped Trump!\nBut most importantly, this shouldn’t matter even if he did have any connection to Trump. The charges don’t have anything to do with 2016. They’re about 2010 Chelsea Manning revelations and publications of Afghan and Iraq war logs as well as reports of torture in Guantanamo Bay. It’s a serious trial on first amendment rights. And could have even more serious consequences.\nJulian’s brother Gabriel Shipton and journalist Kevin Gosztola warn of a dark future: The New York Times may not care now, “but a President Mike Pompeo, who led the charge at the CIA against Wikileaks, if elected” could decide he doesn’t like the leaked material you published and bring the same case against you.\nAnd when they start throwing your colleagues in jail, don’t you want to be able to say you were against the Espionage Act back then?\nIt’s an important interview about a case that has worldwide consequences, while also about saving one man’s life.\nAlso in this episode of Useful Idiots:\n–Art critic Nina Felshin critiques Hunter Biden’s paintings\n–Greg Abbott’s plan to arrest all the democrats\n–Miami mayor calls for airstrikes on Cuba\n–Plus: Is it ethical to murder a drone?\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
