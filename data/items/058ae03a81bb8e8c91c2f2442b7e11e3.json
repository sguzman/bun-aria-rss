  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to two guests. Brent writes,<em>“Hey Wes! My name is brent and I live out in banks, Oregon. A friend and I had an experience a couple years ago up in Washington. Here is a copy of what I first wrote down while it was fresh. I have attached the recording and picture</em></p> <p><em>In the recording you will hear me trying to calm down my dog and get him to stay. Then I walk a short distance down the gravel road in the dark with no flashlight (crazy in retrospect) I stop and have my cell with the mic end pointed in the general direction of the initial screams. It’s a poor recording at best. But during most of it in the back ground you can hear the screams. In real life they started out as guttural grumpy ape sounds and then would escalate to high pitched screams and then back to guttural huffing and puffing from the “main one” . The responses were similar but seemed more like a “I’m in position chase them this way” from the others.</em></p> <p><em>Me and a friend recently went to forlorn lakes on 9/22 for a camping trip. We arrived at approximately 7pm.</em></p> <p><em>At approximately 1am we heard a very loud scream. There were 2 or 3 then another one answered back. It sounded like it was near the other side of the small lake we were camping at. Similar but slightly different tone. Then there were multiple answers back. I thought there were possibly 3 answers back to the first scream that was first and closest. My friend had better hearing and he thinks possibly 4. So that’s potentially 4 – 5 total. This went on for about 20 – 30 minutes. I have a German Shepard/wolf dog. He was whining, scared and trying to get as close to me as possible. When I put my hand on him his heart it was beating very rapidly. I have never seen him act like this before. And me and my friend were shaking uncontrollably. He asked if I could record it with my phone. After retrieving my phone from my van I turned on the voice recorder. And walked towards the first and closest screams. I got 2 minutes of recording, but as soon as I got down the road towards the main entrance it stopped. And the whole forest was completely quiet. We both slept in our vehicles that night.</em></p> <p><em>The next day I walked completely around the lake. I found a fresh set of elk tracks cutting across the edge of the lake where the screams were coming from. They were in a tight formation. almost single file. It read obvious that they were at a full run by the way that the softer mud was very churned up. And were not there for a drink. I triangulate the direction and went to the main road where I thought they were coming from. When I reached the swath of forest between the lake and road my dog went to a spot and started sniffing. When I checked it out there was a foot print that I would of never found if he hadn’t pointed it out. It was on the upside of the ditch headed in the same direction a the elk tracks. The dirt was already compacted, but I could clearly see a big toe print and heal. It was still early in the day and you could see the fresh moist dirt that was disturbed compared to the sun baked surround. I snapped a pic with my phone and ran back to camp. After that we decided to leave. I camp on average 30 days a year. And Indian heaven and forlorn lakes are one of my favorite spots. I have never heard anything like this before or been more scared in my life. I googled big foot /forlorn lakes when I got back and bfro report #26572 is very similar. same time of year/ conditions. The main difference is these screams were very close. I would guess about a block away. And the responses were about 2/3 blocks away. Also I feel like maybe they were hunting the elk. And that the loudest one was driving then towards the others and using the lake as a natural barrier to funnel them to the others waiting to ambush. Why would they make do much noise exposing their present and location? My only guess is to scare us away or hunting… Thanks</em></p> <p><em>Since I wrote this I have read many stories and listened to most of you pod cast. It was hard at first to listen to them, but but I feel as time goes on I have less ptsd about the situation. And I can really relate to you last couple episodes. Also now that I am more educated on the subject I realize there have probably been multiple times I have been in close proximity to them and being watched.</em></p> <p><em>Would love to grab a beer and talk about this in person some time</em></p> <p><em>I will be attending the conference in Kennewick and have tickets to Bobs dinner.
