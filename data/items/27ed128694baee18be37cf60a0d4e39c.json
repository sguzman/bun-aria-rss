At least the seeds that we use to grow food are alive. Seeds can die if they're not properly cared for, if they get too hot or cold or wet.  But under the right conditions, they're just dormant.</p>\n\n<p>\"It means they're sleeping basically,\" Dempewolf says.  \"Seeds are dormant and they need to be activated to grow. They need light to grow, along with humidity and warmth, that's the conditions that allow seeds to grow.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Different species of plants have very different kinds of seeds and different types of seeds also need very different conditions to grow. Some grow with very, very little humidity with very little wetness, and some need a lot. Some need to be submerged in you know under water for a while until they can grow. Some need to be frozen first before they can grow. Some seeds are made that they have to first be eaten by an animal and then pooped out again, so they can grow. Some grow with very, very little wetness, and some need to be submerged underwater for a while until they can grow. Some need to be frozen first before they can grow. Seeds are amazingly complex.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://butwhykids.org/donate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Support But Why</a> | <a href=\"http://vpr.us1.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=ab1a703905d19f426745609a0&id=3977beaf72\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Newsletter Sign-Up</a></strong></p>",
