Brandon questions the cast on what they think the owner of the jaguars should do with Urban. The cast all agree with Chantel when she shares that Urban must be fired. They all go on to individually explain why they believe it’s time for Jacksonville to cut the cord on Urban Myers.  \n\nThe cast jumps to the status of Ben “Big Ben” Roethlisberger and discuss if it’s time for Big Ben to hang up his cleats or not. Leger Douzable reminisces and shares personal stories about sacking Big Ben when he and Michael Vick played for the Jets.
