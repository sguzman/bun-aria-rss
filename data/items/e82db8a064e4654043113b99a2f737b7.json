  "title": "318 - Bloods and Crips - America's Deadliest Gang Rivalry",
  "description": "<p>Today we cover the formation of the infamous Bloods and Crips gang rivalry. How did it get started? Why did it begin in South Central Los Angeles in the late 1960s and early 1970s? The Crips were founded by two high schoolers named Raymond Washington and Stanley “Tookie” Williams, who formed an alliance to protect their neighborhoods from other young people who were harassing them. And then very quickly, gang violence escalated far beyond beating up other kids with your fists to  drive-by shootings, over 15,000 murders, and controlling much of the nation's drug trade. Hope you find all this info as interesting as I did. <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>: This month we donated $15,029 to Guide Dogs for the Blind, with an additional $1,669 added to our Scholarship Fund!
