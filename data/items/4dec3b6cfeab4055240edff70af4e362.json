  "description": "<p>Who was Eleanor Roosevelt? She was the niece of Theodore Roosevelt. The wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt. So much Roosevelt! She was also a bad MF'er. She revolutionized the role of First Lady in American Politics. She didn’t just plan parties for other women of privilege - she gave press conferences with the public and wrote an internationally distributed newspaper column. She served on the United Nations. She stood up for the oppressed in an age when most did not. She was a light in the darkness, a beacon in the storm, a cool glass of sanity and reason in a desert of ignorance and oppression. And today, she’s getting sucked!</p>\n<p>Trouble with the APP or new website? Email BitElixir!
