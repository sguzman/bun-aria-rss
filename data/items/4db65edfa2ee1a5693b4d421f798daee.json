They do. They're everywhere.</p><p>We just don't do a good enough job celebrating them.</p><p>So this week, I'm pleased to shine a bright spotlight on one of my favorite examples of female self-empowerment.</p><p>Meet Robin Arzón.</p><p>At the height of her corporate law career, Robin fearlessly left it all behind to embark on new adventures in the health and wellness space. She soon discovered her passion for coaching athletes, bridge running New York City, tackling ultra-marathons (she just completed her first 100-mile run and once ran five marathons in five days across Utah) and hosting wildly popular indoor cycling experiences that bear more resemblance to after-party raves than your typical spin class.</p><p>But it's not what she does that makes Robin special. It's who she is.</p><p>There was the time she was kidnapped and held at gunpoint. Then there's the recent Type 1 diabetes diagnosis that persistently threatens to sideline her active lifestyle. But Robin isn't interested in playing the victim. She's interested in telling a different story. A story writ large that involves constant reinvention and tenacious commitment to personal growth. A narrative that aims to redefine, reform, and rethink possibility through movement.</p><p>Human performance art in motion, Robin is a powerhouse of positive vibes. Confident, colorful and courageous with a no bullshit attitude and NYC street cred for days, she is inspiration personified. And she's got a message for you:</p><p>sweat transforms lives.</p><br><p>Now Robin can add author to her resume, because her incredible new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062445685/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0062445685&linkId=76668dfe7282a1a91a5098229d94f09d\" target=\"_blank\">Shut Up and Run: How to Get Up, Lace Up and Sweat with Swagger*</a> hits bookstores everywhere June 21.</p><p>Exploding with color, attitude and practical advice, Shut Up and Run is the ultimate embodiment of everything Robin. Equal parts fitness manual, self-help empowerment and coffee table photography book, it perfectly captures Robin's ethos and aesthetic. Overflowing with tips, tricks, and most notably her welcome inviting hand, Shut Up and Run&nbsp;is an utterly unique breath of fresh air in a world of drab running manuals. A book&nbsp;screaming with attitude that beckons you to join her.</p><p>I love Robin. She's just an awesome person. And I really love her new book. So I was delighted to sit down with her once again and delve deeper into her fascinating life.
