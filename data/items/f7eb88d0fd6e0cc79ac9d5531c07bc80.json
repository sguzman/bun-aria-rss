  "description": "<p>The Southern Charm reunion comes in hot, and we're here to recap it. First there are allegations of Madison sleeping with an ex-MLBer (internet rumors say it's A-Rod, but Ben is holding out for Darryl Strawberry). Then there's talk of Cameran, Shep's apology tour, and Craig's pillows. It all climaxes around with Kathryn bouncing in her chair like a rag doll. It's infuriating and hilarious - just what we expect from Bravo.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p>\n",
