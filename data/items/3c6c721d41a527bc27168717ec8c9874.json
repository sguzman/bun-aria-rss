  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin show, there was never an organized concentrated effort focused on the hate from Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Their history of antisemitic commentary precedes them and they've never been held to task by Pelosi or the media for it. Yet, Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene is threatened by all for pushing back when provoked. Also, new reports from CNN indicate that the medical examiner's office found that the reports that Officer Brian Sicknick was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher at the Capitol Building riot are unproven. Then, a far-left female-led domestic terrorism group bombed the US Capitol in 1983 and past presidents pardoned them. No one has ever discussed impeaching those presidents. Afterward, Anthony Fauci's doublespeak on the virus is catching up with him and his defense is incoherent. Later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joined the show to outline how Florida has taken a lead to hold Big Tech companies accountable when they violate the rights of Floridians by interfering in the state's electoral process via censorship and de-platforming due to political bias. DeSantis also highlighted his record of handling COVID-19 vaccinations debunking the misinformation shared by the White House Press Secretary. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
