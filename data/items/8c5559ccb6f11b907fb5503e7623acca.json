Are arguments about washing the dishes and cleaning the closet really about those issues, or is something deeper happening? On this episode of Women of Impact, Lisa and Tom Bilyeu talk about how to deal with differing values and opposing ideas. They discuss creating shared goals, how they build positive habits, and their methods of making sure that conversations stay open, respectful and honest. And then they give a wonderful example of good communication by examining a real life conflict they have had over making the bed...
