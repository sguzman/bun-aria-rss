[2:37] Alex on how external voices and rejection factored into his journey. [9:23] Alex tells the power and importance of friendship in his success. [17:54] Alex talks about fear within uncertainty and how to work with it instead of against it. [24:06] Alex shares Steven Spielberg’s incredible story of turning rejection into a new path.

[42:40] Alex reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [47:05]   QUOTES: “The difference between fearlessness and courage is that fearlessness is jumping off of the cliff without thinking. Courage is acknowledging your fear, analyzing the consequences, and deciding you still care so much about it, you're gonna take one step forward anyway.” [4:37]   “You will never win against the voices in your head if you try to argue with them. What I've learned is that if you, instead of focusing on the voices and the fears, you focus on the desires.” [12:04]   “And I think no matter what your dream is, if you're able to find a larger purpose, a larger impact that lives beyond you, all of a sudden all of your bullshit that's holding you down becomes a lot less relevant.” [12:17]   “I've learned that insecurities will never leave you, just like with fear. They're a natural part of the human condition. So your goal shouldn't be to rid yourself of insecurities. It should be to become so aware of them that they could be yammering away and you go, \"Oh, that's just the insecurity.” [44:25]  “The second you speak something out loud, it doesn't have power over you anymore.” [45:15]   “When you change what someone believes is possible, you change what becomes possible.” [49:24]   FOLLOW ALEX BANAYAN: TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2tf2FL1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2tf2FL1</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yubDKj\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2yubDKj</a> LINKEDIN - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ljSDo1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2ljSDo1</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2tnyxgD\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2tnyxgD</a>   PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Blake Mycoskie - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2lgrwKz\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2lgrwKz</a> [13:50] Qi Lu - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2M1Qyse\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2M1Qyse</a> [34:32]   COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Alsop Louie - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2tixBdj\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2tixBdj</a> [0:50]   BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: The Third Door - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MxoDSa\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2MxoDSa</a> [1:00] When Things Fall Apart - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JTcxkt\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2JTcxkt</a> [26:07]",
