  "description": "<p>On today's show, Tony almost gets caked, and the guys dive into what has brought about Big Motor's personality change after he attempted to body bag Foxy after the live show on Thursday. The guys also dive into a loaded Pod FOD including gas powered vehicles being a thing of the past in California as early as 2035 resulting in the guys making a desperate plea to save gas stations across the United States. They also cover how they're considering buying 15 million shares of AMC stock, Big Motor's high school football glory days, people reusing condoms in Vietnam, some tips for giving a best man speech, and much more, plus Nick selects a few more Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend.
