  "description": "<p>In this mini-review we discover a sub-region that used to be part of the larger Côtes-du-Rhône region: Rasteau. Our foray into this new appellation was nothing short of a rollicking success! 2010 Cave de Rasteau La Domeliere Price: $15 Grapes: 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Mourvedre Alcohol: 14.5% Color: A rich plum color with thick legs Smell: Shrubs and underbrush (garrigue, as we state), herbal, a horsetail (yeah, as in the animal), leather, with an undertone of cherry but fruit is definitely secondary. It was a bit of a cilia singer — a little hot from the alcohol Taste: Just like it smells — cherry, earth, medium tannin, nice round, full texture from the alcohol. Rich, full, earthy, and not too heavy. Drink or sink?: Drink! Great structure, great flavor, rich and drinks well above its price! Hope you enjoy the review!
