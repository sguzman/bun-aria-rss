  "description": "What if that had been Trent Shelton in that video, instead of George Floyd? George Floyd had family, just like you do. He had dreams and fears and favorite foods and fond memories, just like you do. If that question makes you uncomfortable, good - that's the idea. I recorded this episode with tears in my eyes because I felt I needed to share my thoughts about this situation, and now I want to issue a challenge to you. If you're listening to this episode, I want to challenge you to take a moment to talk to someone who walks a different path from you, and then ask yourself how you can show up better for that person in your life. It's time for us to wake up, stop being part of the problem, and start creating the solution by uniting against the evil we see in the world.\nNow, more than ever, it all starts with you.\nRest In Peace George Floyd.",
