  "description": "Suppose you work for a business that has paying customers. You want to know how much money your customers are likely to spend to inform decisions on customer acquisition and retention budgets. You&rsquo;ve done a bit of research, and discovered that the figure you want to calculate is commonly called the customer lifetime value.
