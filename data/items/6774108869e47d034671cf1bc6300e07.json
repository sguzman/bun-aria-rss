  "description": "<p>America and Europe face a major energy crisis. European reliance on Russian oil backfired when Russia invaded Ukraine back in February. European leaders were faced with the decision to either continue buying energy from Russia and essentially funding Putin's war effort or to refuse the Kremlin's energy and allow their respective countries to face a major energy crisis. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration's insistence on hampering American energy production has put the United States in no position to help the desperate nations of Europe. In fact, the U.S. faces serious questions about how we'll sustain our own energy needs. Jay, Jordan, and the <em>Sekulow</em> team discuss this and more today on <em>Sekulow</em>.</p>",
