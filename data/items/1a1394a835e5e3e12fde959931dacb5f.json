  "description": "In this installment of Best Of The Gist, we resurfaced a couple clips from our Tuesday interview with Douglas Farah (author of Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible), which we intentionally left on the cutting room floor but later decided they might be fun for listeners. Dust off your 90s NBA references!\nAnd then we listen back to Mike’s Thursday Spiel about Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s testimony to the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee this past week. Despite it being a rare example of Congress doing real work and a Biden Administration official giving solid answers, it got reduced to lowest common denominator. If you’re bored and want to see the federal government in action, here’s a link to the full hearing.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
