  "description": "Of course the big story of today is Fart Gate, which we will analyze in depth. But also, Chick-fil-A caved to the rage mob after seven years. We'll talk about why this move is not only shameful but completely counter productive. Surrendering to the mob never pays off. And an LGBT publication accuses me of \"transphobia\" and \"racism\" (again). But did they meet their burden of proof in validating that claim? We'll take a look. (The answer is no, not even close.)
