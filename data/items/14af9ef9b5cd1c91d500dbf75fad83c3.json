  "description": "<p>After a long hiatus, we're back to release this short, breadcrumb episode, number 89, with Dr. Jane Roland Martin on Education and Gender. Dr. Martin has been a prolific author on the philosophy of education, and in this short episode, explains some of her thinking about past figures in that area, who excluded some things that need to be taught to everyone, and considered their narrower visions the right approach to education for boys. Then, when education for girls caught on, they were thought to need the same education that boys received, excluding those things long considered feminine, which all people should learn. </p>",
