Whoever gives more or takes more has engaged in Riba.\" (Sunan an-Nasa'i 4569)</p> <p>“Do not sell gold for gold, except like for like, and don't increase something of it upon something;” (Sahih Muslim 1584a) </p> <p>\"The bartering of gold for gold is Riba (usury), except if it is from hand to hand and equal in amount, …” (Al-Bukhari 2134)</p> </div> <p><em>Podcast Hosted by Almir Colan.</em></p> <p><strong>Connect with us:</strong></p> <p>Be part of the conversation and keep in touch with us to find out about new episodes and other content.</p> <p>Web: <a href= \"https://www.islamicfinancepodcast.com/\">www.islamicfinancepodcast.com</a></p> <p><strong>Social media:</strong></p> <p><strong>- <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTL0dXwFBNyKBuM9mhMpIw\">YouTube</a></strong></p> <p><strong>- <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/IslamicFinancePodcast\">Facebook</a> (public page)</strong></p> <p><strong>- <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Islamicfinancepodcast\">Facebook</a> (group)</strong></p> <p><strong>- <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Islamic_FinPod\">Twitter</a></strong></p> <p><strong>- <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/islamic_finance_podcast/\">Instagram</a></strong></p> <p><em>----</em></p> <p><em>Read Disclaimer <a href= \"https://www.islamicfinancepodcast.com/pages/disclaimer\">here</a>.</em></p>",
