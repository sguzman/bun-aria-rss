Come check out Antinalysis, the new address risk analyzer,&#8221; read the service’s opening announcement. &#8220;This service is dedicated to individuals that have the need to possess complete privacy on the blockchain, offering a perspective from the opponent’s point of view in order for the user to comprehend the possibility of his/her funds getting flagged down under autocratic illegal charges.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Antinalysis allows free lookups, but anyone wishing to conduct bulk look-ups has to pay at least USD $3, with a minimum $30 purchase. Other plans go for as high as $6,000 for 5,000 requests. <strong>Nick Bax</strong>, a security researcher who specializes in tracing cryptocurrency transactions, told KrebsOnSecurity at the time that Antinalysis was likely a clone of AMLBot because the two services generated near-identical results.</p>\n<p>AMLBot shut down Antinalysis&#8217;s access just hours after last year&#8217;s story went live. However, Antinalysis[.]org remains online and accepting requests, as does the service&#8217;s Tor-based domain, and it is unclear how those services are sourcing their information.</p>\n<p>AMLBot spokesperson <strong>Polina Smoliar</strong> said the company undertook a thorough review after that discovery, and in the process found two other services similar to Antinalysis that were reselling their application programming interface (API) access to cybercrooks.</p>\n<p>Smoliar said that following the revelations about Antinalysis, AMLBot audited its entire client base, and implemented the ability to provide APIs only after a contract is signed and the client has been fully audited. AMLBot said it also instituted 24/7 monitoring of all client transactions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a result of these actions, two more services with the name AML (the same as AMLBot has) were found to be involved in fraudulent schemes,&#8221; Smoliar said. &#8220;Information about the fraudsters was also sent to key market participants, and their transaction data was added to the tracking database to better combat money laundering.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61612\" style=\"width: 764px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61612\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-61612\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"754\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e.png 1872w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e-768x337.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e-1536x674.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pharoah-e-782x343.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Experts say the founder of Antinalysis also runs a darknet market for narcotics.</p></div>\n<p>The Antinalysis homepage and chatter on the cybercrime forums indicates the service was created by a group of coders known as the <strong>Incognito Team</strong>. <strong>Tom Robinson</strong>, co-founder of the blockchain intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elliptic</a>, said the creator of Antinalysis is also one of the developers of Incognito Market, a darknet marketplace specializing in the sale of narcotics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Incognito was launched in late 2020, and accepts payments in both Bitcoin and Monero, a cryptoasset offering heightened anonymity,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;The launch of Antinalysis likely reflects the difficulties faced by the market and its vendors in cashing out their Bitcoin proceeds.&#8221;</p>\n",
