  "description": "<p>Now we know that baseball is America’s pastime, but is there any other sport that is more ingrained in our culture than football? And is there anything more wholesome than parents encouraging their kids to play football in order to learn teamwork, develop their athletic prowess, and develop friendships while having a great time? That may have been true 30 years ago, but the rise of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) has given parents pause as we’re now seeing something close to 35% fewer kids playing the sport now than played 10-15 years ago. The value proposition has changed as we’ve learned what the longer-term impacts of all of those hits to the head means for athletes. Well we believe the same thing is true when it comes to higher education. Due to the higher costs of college, the massive student loan burden, and other false assumptions about going to college, we want all high school grads to think long and hard about whether college is the right choice for them. Listen as we discuss the factors to consider to maximize your ROI of attending college, some great alternatives to going straight from senior year to a university, and then some questions to ask yourself to help you decide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Foeder Bier by Southern Brewing!
