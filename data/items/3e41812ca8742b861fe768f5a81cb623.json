They began with the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand\">Glif</a>, and when I talked to them last <a href=\"http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/6/5/dan-provost-tom-gerhardt-studio-neat-living-in-the-back-it-bracket\">over a year ago</a>, they had launched their second software product and were deep in planning on a new, more complicated item: the <a href=\"http://www.studioneat.com/products/neaticekit\">Neat Ice Kit</a>. They funded the kit on Kickstarter in September 2013, raising $156,000 against a $50,000 goal. We talk through the challenges of fulfilling that campaign, more lessons learned, and their recently launched follow-up, the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/simple-syrup-kit\">Simple Syrup Kit</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Sponsors and patrons</h2>\n\n<p>This podcast is made possible through the support of sponsors and patrons.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.99designs.com/disruptors\">99designs</a>: Have dozens of designers from the over 310,000 that are part of 99designs's network submit ideas for your logo, Web site, T-shirt, car wrap, or other design project, then pick the best and have a finished, professional result in a week or less for a flat price.
