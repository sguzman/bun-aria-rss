  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough to recap Saturday's AFC Wild Card action. Is the Patriots dynasty over (:15)? Who's more likely to leave; Tom Brady or Bill Belichick? The guys discuss the future in New England after the defending Super Bowl champs suffered a 20-13 loss to the Titans. They also dissect Tennessee's performance including an outstanding effort from Derrick Henry and below-average night for Ryan Tannehill, before analyzing their chances against the Ravens next week. Next, the Pick Six Superfriends react to a wild Wild Card early game as the Texans emerged past the Bills in overtime (44:30). We saw the full Josh Allen experience, a magical comeback led by Deshaun Watson, plenty of whacky moments and some questionable coaching decisions and Will, Ryan, John and Sean are here to break it all down. They also peek ahead at the Texans divisional round matchup vs. the Chiefs and pick an AFC East division favorite for 2020.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
