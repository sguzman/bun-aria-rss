  "description": "<p>This is a review of Joe Rogan’s first ever JRE podcast where he streamed live on Dec. 24th 2009. Joe and Brian take questions from Twitter and over 300 people join in on the experience. It’s really cool to listen back to the very first 1 and see how far the podcast has grown. Joe get’s in to everything from Marijuana, conspiracy theories and basically all the usual shit he talks about all the time. It was great. Check it out if you haven’t heard it for a while or ever!</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
