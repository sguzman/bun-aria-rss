  "description": "<div>Richard Cutshall spent his childhood in the quiet town of Parsons, Kansas, in a house that was rumored to be haunted. Growing up in this tiny town in the middle of the country was anything but a peaceful experience, despite the fact that it should have been. It was inevitable that he would spend his childhood surrounded by strange occurrences, such as seeing apparitions, hearing voices, encountering doppelgangers, and possibly even demonic beings that could only be described as horrifying. This would ignite a fascination with the supernatural that would last a lifetime.
