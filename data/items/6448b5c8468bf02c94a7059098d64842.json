  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, teachers' unions are the biggest scam going. Confiscatory taxes are taken through property tax so that teachers can be paid and now they don't want to show up to work and educate our children. Teachers' unions are insisting that teachers should stay home for fear of the coronavirus adding that both students and adults must be vaccinated before they return to work. Meanwhile, the facts and the science show that kids don't spread the virus as much as adults. In an attempt to bribe another constituent group, Sen. Chuck Schumer wants to forgive $50,000 in school debt to look out for the little guy, unless that little guy works for a pipeline. Elizabeth Warren and other leftists adore the idea of financially bolstering the propaganda mills that support and spread their ideology. Mitt Romney is proposing a new welfare program that pays people a national basic income and this includes children. Romney is the new George McGovern. \\Then, the New York Times continue their attempts to lump all conservatives into the 'conspiracy theorist' category, essentially alleging that all Republicans and Trump supporters are domestic extremists. Democrats and their shills in the media are experts in disinformation therefore they attack free speech when others disagree with them. Yet, it's the Marxists that attack the fabric of our nation. It's the leftists that attacked the White House and more than a dozen cities across America this past summer. Later, former Clinton lawyer Marc Elias is now claiming that voting machines in New York miscalculated votes for his client. Will the media say he is delusional, dishonest, or unhinged? Will the voting machine manufacturer threaten to sue Elias for his comments? Afterward, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been voted out of her committee assignment in Congress because of her previous statements on controversial issues, despite her election with 75% of the vote. There was no defense of her because she was a woman. There was no vote to remove Ilhan Omar from her committee assignments because of her past controversial comments while serving in Congress. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
