  "description": "<p>The Holy Spirit is a tough subject in Christianity.  It seems everyone has their own experiences of how the Spirit works. Or doesn’t.  Tim and Jon talk a little bit about their own Holy Spirit experiences growing up.  Jon grew up in a Baptist church where the Holy Spirit was largely theoretical.  Tim grew up with the opposite experiences in a community that got really dramatic about the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>The guys also talk about what the ancient Hebrews believed about the Holy Spirit and the differences between their ancient beliefs and the modern Western view.</p>\n<p>To the Hebrews, the Holy Spirit was the essential, mystical force of life.  An all encompassing energy that created the world and kept creating the world over and over, right before their eyes.    For Hebrews, creation and sustaining the creation were not two separate ideas.</p>\n<p>Tim and Jon reflect on what it might look like if we adopted a similar worldview the ancients had.  How it might invite us to become re-enchanted with creation.  That we would begin to see God’s personal presence animating and energizing all of the world.</p>\n<p>Music credits:<br />\nDefender (instrumental) by rosasharn.bandcamp.com<br />\nLook Back In by Moby.  album 18.<br />\nChord Sounds by Moby. album Every Day.</p>\n",
