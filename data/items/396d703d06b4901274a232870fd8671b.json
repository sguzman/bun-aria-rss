  "title": "Averting water wars as we decarbonize",
  "description": "Don’t miss our live episode of Climavores in New York City on October 20! Sign up here for a night of live audio and networking with top voices in climate journalism. \nWe designed our power plants, refineries, and other energy infrastructure to depend on water. But not just any kind of water—water that’s available at the right quantity, quality, place and time. When water falls outside of this Goldilocks zone, energy systems can unravel, sometimes in unexpected ways. Low water levels strain hydroelectric and thermal power production and restrict coal shipments by river. Extreme cold freezes water in natural gas infrastructure, causing blackouts. Examples abound.\nThe irony is that the energy system fuels climate change, which in turn fuels water problems for the energy system. \nSo how do we address these vulnerabilities as we decarbonize? And how can we build a resilient water-energy system in an increasingly chaotic climate?\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Dr. Michael Webber, author of Thirst for Power: Energy, Water and Human Survival. Michael is a professor of energy resources at the University of Texas-Austin and chief technology officer at Energy Impact Partners, where Shayle is a partner. \nThey cover topics like:\n\nThe surprising places we use water in energy, like extracting minerals and natural gas, growing crops for biofuels and sequestering carbon\n\nThe ways energy improves the quantity and quality of water, allowing us to move water longer distances, reach deeper wells and desalinate water\n\nHow to avoid exacerbating water problems as we decarbonize\n\nWhether cheap, abundant electricity from nuclear fusion will power wide-spread desalination\n\nWhy the data on water systems is so scarce compared to energy systems\n\nHow prescient the new Mad Max water-war movies are\n\nResources:\n\n\nYale University Press: Thirst for Power: Energy, Water and Human Survival\n\n\nThe New York Times: Europe’s Scorching Summer Puts Unexpected Strain on Energy Supply\n\n\nThe New York Times: China’s Record Drought Is Drying Rivers and Feeding Its Coal Habit\n\n \nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
