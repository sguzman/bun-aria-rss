  "description": "How should we understand the history of post-war Britain? In The Welfare State Generation Women, Agency and Class in Britain since 1945 (Bloomsbury, 2022), Eve Worth, a Research Fellow on the Changing Elites project in the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford, explores this question by foregrounding the lives of women who grew up, worked, and retired as the first ‘welfare state generation’. The book uses oral history methods to tease out the changing role and changing experiences of the welfare state, along with the role of women in working in and administering that welfare state. It thinks through the sense of autonomy and control, as well as changing perceptions of class identity and feminism, in the lives of women, and thus tells a new story of post-war British history. The book speaks to a huge range of academic audiences and is also essential reading for anyone interested in the history of Britain.\nDave O'Brien is Professor of Cultural and Creative Industries, at the University of Sheffield.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
