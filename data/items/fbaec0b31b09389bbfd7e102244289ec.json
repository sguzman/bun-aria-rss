  "description": "<p>Exploiting effective target modeling units is very important and has always\nbeen a concern in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this work,\nwe propose a phonetic-assisted multi-target units (PMU) modeling approach, to\nenhance the Conformer-Transducer ASR system in a progressive representation\nlearning manner. Specifically, PMU first uses the pronunciation-assisted\nsubword modeling (PASM) and byte pair encoding (BPE) to produce\nphonetic-induced and text-induced target units separately; Then, three new\nframeworks are investigated to enhance the acoustic encoder, including a basic\nPMU, a paraCTC and a pcaCTC, they integrate the PASM and BPE units at different\nlevels for CTC and transducer multi-task training. Experiments on both\nLibriSpeech and accented ASR tasks show that, the proposed PMU significantly\noutperforms the conventional BPE, it reduces the WER of LibriSpeech clean,\nother, and six accented ASR testsets by relative 12.7%, 6.0% and 7.7%,\nrespectively.\n</p>",
