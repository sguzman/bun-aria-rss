After retrieving the 13 month-old from his crib, he discovers the body of his wife in their living room. She had been handcuffed behind her back and killed with a knife or some other sharp instrument. It appears as though the attack began while she was sleeping. When investigators look into the murder they will end up with two very different suspects. Was this a crime of passion? Or a robbery gone wrong? Did her husband murder her to avoid a costly divorce? Or did a laborer with a history of violence and theft in that area commit the crime? </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
