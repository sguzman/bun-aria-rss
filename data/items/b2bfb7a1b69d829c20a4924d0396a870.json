  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin show, Liberty gives people the liberty to destroy liberty and equality is still equality even when you're living in hell. The Cuban citizens are protesting their government's destruction of civil society. After six decades of a communist dictatorship, food rationing, and now limited medicine, Cubans have taken to the streets with their shouts for liberty. The Cuban government has shut down the internet to prevent the people from speaking out. The Biden administration blames Cuba's fiscal mismanagement and the pandemic as the catalyst for this crisis instead of calling it the consequences of communism. Then, \"American Marxism\" is the most important book Mark's ever written. Sadly, Marxism has become one of the most accepted ideologies on college campuses because it splintered off into several other movements promoted in classrooms by the teachers' unions. Theories like collective identity, social movement, oppositional protest, and combat-ready protest are widely taught on college campuses to galvanize mobs of brain-washed anti-American, Marxist sympathizers. Groups like BLM can no longer argue for a color-blind society because of the Farakkhan-esque separatism and Marxist agenda that is being taught in the name of equity. Later, former President Trump's class-action lawsuit against the big tech companies is solid and well written. While these tech firms are private they act on behalf of the Democrat Party and effectively engage in campaigning. Censoring the oldest newspaper in America and treating a sitting President as if he didn't exist toward the end of his term was only the beginning. The Democrats will hold onto all of the section 230 protections to shield their corporatist donors in Silicon Valley.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
