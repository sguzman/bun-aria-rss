  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">On this week’s episode of Currently Reading, Kaytee and Meredith are discussing our top 10 books of the year that wouldn’t end. We don’t include our regular segments in these Best of Episodes in the interest of time. We hope that you love this list! It might help you identify if one of us is your book twin. Or if you want to add something to your 2021 TBR.

If you’d like to listen first and not spoil the surprise, don’t scroll down! </p> <p class=\"\">New: we are now including <a href= \"../../../s/S3E22-transcript.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">transcripts</a> of the episode. These are generated by AI, so they may not be perfectly accurate, but we want to increase accessibility for our fans!</p> <p class=\"\">*Please note that all book titles linked below are Amazon affiliate links.
