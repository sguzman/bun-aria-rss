  "description": "<p>Against doctor’s orders, Ron “Pigpen” McKernan hit the road one more time with the Grateful Dead. The band’s 1972 tour of Europe is legendary. But at the time, Pigpen was just trying to stay above ground. You could hear it in his voice when he took the mic onstage. Close your eyes and his voice was a window into the past. But listen closer, and you’d hear something else. Something you couldn’t quite put your finger on. A distance. Some pain. Truth was, Pigpen was on borrowed time.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Long-Strange-Trip-History-Grateful/dp/0767911865/\"><em>A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Dennis McNally</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Living-Dead-Twenty-Garcia-Grateful/dp/0815411634/\"><em>Living with The Dead: Twenty Years on the Bus with Garcia and the Grateful Dead</em>, by Rock Scully with David Dalton</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sound-Life-Grateful-Dead/dp/0316154490/\"><em>Searching for the Sound</em>, by Phil Lesh</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grateful-Dead-FAQ-Greatest-History/dp/1617130869/\"><em>The Grateful Dead FAQ: All That’s Left to Know About the Greatest Jam Band in History</em>, by Tony Sclafani</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/This-All-Dream-We-Dreamed/dp/1250058562/\"><em>This Is All a Dream We Dreamed: An Oral History of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Blair Jackson and David Gans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jck2Z0sfGr8&t=322s\">Grateful Dead live at Chateau D’Herouville, France, 6/6/1971</a> (YouTube)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reverb.com/news/le-chateau-dherouville-un-studio-mythique\">Château d'Hérouville: The Castle Studio Where Bowie, Elton, and Pink Floyd Recorded</a> (Reverb)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadsources.blogspot.com/2012/07/june-21-1971-herouville-france.html\">June 21, 1971: Herouville, France</a> (Dead Sources)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.holidayatthesea.com/music/grateful-dead-at-the-the-honky-chateau-06-21-71\">Grateful Dead at the The Honky Chateau (06-21-71)</a> (Holiday at the Sea)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gd71-04-28.sbd.murphy.2248.sbeok.shnf\">Grateful Dead live at the Fillmore East, 4/28/1971</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadsources.blogspot.com/2014/09/april-1972-weir-pigpen-interview.html\">April 1972: Weir & Pigpen Interview</a> (Dead Sources)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1RzbN-NBTo\">Donna Jean Godchaux interview</a> (YouTube)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/keith-godchaux-dies/\">The Lasting Impact, and Sudden Death, of the Grateful Dead's Keith Godchaux</a> (Ultimate Classic Rock)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dead.net/deadcast/enter-keith-godchaux\">Enter Keith Godchaux</a> (Dead.net)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.levity.com/gans/Donna.980328.html\">Donna Jean MacKay 3/28/98</a> (Levity)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61nYKFMd_X4\">Grateful Dead live at the Boston Music Hall, 12/2/1971</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadsources.blogspot.com/2014/09/april-1972-weir-pigpen-interview.html\">April 1972: Weir & Pigpen Interview</a> (Dead Sources)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gd72-06-17.aud.hanno.16470.sbeok.shnf\">Grateful Dead live at the Hollywood Bowl, 6/17/1972</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://savagesaints.blogspot.com/2014/02/mother-mccrees-uptown-jug-champions-top.html\">Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions - Top of the Tangent (1964)</a> (The Savage Saints)</p>\n<p>For behind the scenes info and news on this episode, follow:</p>\n<p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/doubleelvis\"> @DoubleElvis</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/disgracelandpod/\">@Disgracelandpod </a></p>\n<p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://wwww.twitter.com/doubleelvisfm\"> @DoubleElvisFm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disgracelandpod\">@Disgracelandpod</a></p>\n<p>Tik Tok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@disgracelandpod\">@Disgracelandpod</a></p>\n<p>Pinterest:<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/doubleelvisfm/\"> @doubleelvisfm </a></p>\n<p>Facebook:<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DoubleElvisProductions/\"> Double Elvis Productions</a></p>\n<p><em>Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse and many more musical icons all died at the age of 27.
