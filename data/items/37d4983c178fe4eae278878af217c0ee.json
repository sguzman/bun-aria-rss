Maybe you worry you’ll say the wrong thing or offend someone. But when you think about it, is there anything better or more beautiful than sharing Christ? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss some common pitfalls we experience in evangelism and the gospel hope that drives us to try again. From the people in our homes to those we see in our communities, we can share the greatest news of Christ’s resurrection by simply sharing what he did and how the gospel impacts our own lives!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re grateful to Crossway and the ESV Women’s Study Bible for making this week’s show possible.
