  "description": "In this episode we have with us design artist Aren Muse, who has his own team of stylists and a great amount of experience and knowledge in styling that he shares with us today. We start off talking about the finishing touches in a room and how to accessorize, mainly with a fireplace and tables. We discuss the different greenery we want, the types of books we should put out on the coffee table, and then the candles that will go well as an accessory for your coffee table or side tables. Try to keep things balanced because if you use too much of one texture, such as marble for example, it will no longer be special. Books typically have a less glossy, flashy look under their cover, so a way to improve the look of your books is to remove the jacket, giving them a more dark and handsome look.<br /><br />How to approach the finishing touches of the room like accessories 1:50<br />Coffee table books 10:44<br />Crystal on fireplaces 20:24<br />How to transform the look of your books 31:27<br />What has inspired/influenced Aren 41:23<br />Small or big? 46:06<br /><br />“Stuff that they wouldn’t normally make or couldn’t put on the rack, but it is absolutely editorial and extraordinary. And that is the work that we are trying to create is the more unexpected we can, but still believable, useful, and tell the story of the homeowner, but don’t do it in a way that everyone else is doing it.” 24:20<br /><br />@arenmuse<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
