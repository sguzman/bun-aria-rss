  "description": "<p>This week, Louise is joined by special guest Lewis Noble. Lewis is a UK-based contemporary landscape painter with a unique style and a well-established reputation. He exhibits widely and has been teaching workshops for over 15 years. &nbsp;In this episode, we discuss his approach to abstracting from reality, a unique process that involves a combination of plein air painting and studio work. Our wide-ranging discussion covers issues such as getting away from the horizon line, the role of collage, and how to know when a painting is done. Lewis also shares his experience of turning in-person teaching into an online learning experience and the discoveries he has made along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Lewis's website: <a href=\"//\">https://www.lewisnoble.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p>Lewis's online workshop: <a href=\"//\">https://www.lewisnoble.co.uk/online-workshops</a></p>\n<p>Lewis on Youtube: <a href=\"//\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ojuGFqdy4DO8Tf7tsVBfA</a></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/\"><u>www.alicesheridan.com</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
