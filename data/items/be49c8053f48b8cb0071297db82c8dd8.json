  "description": "If you have been watching TV — like, at all — since the 1990s, you've probably seen (and loved) Kellie Martin in something. After beginning her career as a child in the '80s, she landed the role of Becca on the critically acclaimed family drama Life Goes On, a role that would eventually earn her an Emmy nomination. But her career is far more than that one role. She was part of one of the most terrifying moments in ER history. She worked with Lucille Ball. She was a voice in The Goofy Movie, for goodness sakes. Even as she's moved into adult parts, she's continued to work frequently, in everything from Mad Men to Hallmark movies. And now, she's one part of TBS's new, very broad comedy, The Guest Book. But look, Todd just wanted to talk to Kellie because his 10-year-old, Life Goes On-loving self wouldn't forgive himself if he didn't. They discuss everything from how she managed to keep from falling into the pitfalls that consume so many child actors, to how she balances her work and her many other pursuits, to her long friendship with Life Goes On co-star Patti LuPone. Kellie's a great storyteller — and she has many great stories to tell.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
