  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Being a mom can feel isolating. Our children may be our constant companions, but we often long to interact with other adults, and social media can be a fun and easy way to connect. But with statistics showing that the average person spends 2.5 hours a day on social media, we’re wise to consider how it affects our ability to live out the calling of motherhood. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss how social media is designed to draw us in and how it might influence our hearts and actions more than we may realize. They offer practical boundaries for social media use and encourage us to consider whether that use of  time is beneficial to our growth in Christ. It’s important for Christians to be present on social media, but we don’t want our presence there to come at the cost of loving God and others.</span></p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re grateful to Christian Standard Bible, a Bible translation for everyone, for making this week’s show possible.
