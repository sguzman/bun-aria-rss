  "description": "The Ringer’s Robert Mays and Kevin Clark react to a wild Week 1 in the NFL, including how the Cowboys regained their NFC contender status Sunday night (03:30) and how the Seahawks may have lost theirs (08:00). Then, the guys discuss how the Raiders and Marshawn Lynch are the perfect mix of fun and force (10:00), why running backs won’t play a role in playoff races this season (20:00), and how some lesser-known Ravens exposed the bumbling Bengals (30:00). Then, Danny Kelly joins the show to explain why Le’Veon Bell struggled out of the gates against Cleveland (33:00) and Rodger Sherman helps the guys decide whether some Week 1 surprises were a fluke or not (42:30). Finally, Robert and Kevin point out some marquee matchups that we lost for this season this weekend (49:30), and how one glaring weakness could make for a long season leaguewide (51:00).\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
