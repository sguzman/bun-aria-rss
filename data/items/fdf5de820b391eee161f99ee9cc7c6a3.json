  "description": "<p>In our first reading today, Elijah is dejected and requests that the Lord take his life. But an angel touches him and orders him to get up and eat.

If we don't feed our souls, we will become spiritually lethargic and unhealthy. Where do we find that nourishment? The answer comes in John 6, our Gospel reading for today.</p>\n",
