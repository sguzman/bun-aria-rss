  "description": "The Nobel Prize-winning economist and author of a new book - \"Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy\" - believes both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are “right on” when it comes to the issue of income inequality. Democratic front-runner Clinton also gets kudos from Stiglitz for tackling short-term capitalism. Maybe no surprise there – the former White House economic advisor's new book is thought to be a blueprint for Clinton's economic plan. But with some prodding, Stiglitz acknowledges that sometimes Republicans are right on the income inequality front too.
