  "description": "<p>On this episode Clay is joined by Misty, Josh, Kobly Morehead and Arkansas Game and Fish wild turkey biologist, Jeremy Wood. The crew notes that Misty is the only person without a mustache so Josh brought her a stick-on-stache. Kolby Morehead talks about the Bear Hunting Magazine team in the campaign to raise money for a bear collaring study in Arkansas. Clay jumps on his soap box of picking up stone points on his own land, they discuss some new art he got of Warner Glenn, and a gift from Kolby. They all tell their&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;turkey story from the last Bear Grease Podcast. Then they jump into the issues surrounding wild turkeys in Arkansas with Jeremy. It's an action and information packed episode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connect with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
