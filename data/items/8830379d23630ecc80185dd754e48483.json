  "description": "<p>In this 121st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss the newly published Together trial on the efficacy of Ivermectin in treating Covid, and the media’s response to said publication. We discuss mass formation, as detailed in Mattias Desmet’s book, The Psychology of Totalitarianism (not “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” as Heather said during the podcast; that is the name of Hannah Arendt’s 1951 tome). We discuss the left’s eagerness to be on the side of science, when it suits them, and we mention Solzhenitsyn. And we discuss the need for evidence-based medicine.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Eight Sleep: Personalized thermoregulation while you sleep, and when you wake.
