Joining Pat and AJ, like he always does on Tuesday's, is the starting QB for the Green Bay Packers, fresh off his 400th TD to chat about the big win over the Eagles, how special of a moment it was, how the team genuinely likes each other, Aaron deciding to lay down some big blocks on Sunday, and much more (25:59-58:18). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, starting WR for the Minnesota Vikings, friend of the program, Adam Thielen joins the program, to chat about the Vikings season so far, them finding themselves in the playoff picture, how he's so good at football, whether or not he's ever demanded a trade to the Packers, his cleats from this past weekend and what he and his wife have been doing with their foundation (1:01:49-1:19:43). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, 14 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of The Man-To-Man Pod, Antoine Bethea joins the program to chat about his thoughts about the NFL season thus far, his recent workout with the Ravens, who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl, and much more (1:19:45-1:38:11).
