    "media:description": "In this video, I will guide you through how to talk about your daily routines while staying in the target language. You will also learn about what makes a verb reflexive, and examples of reflexive vs non-reflexive verbs.\n\nThroughout the video, you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and respond to questions in the target language about what you do to get ready in the morning and evening.\n\nSpanish CI (Comprehensible Input) is a teaching methodology of speaking only in the language that you are learning so that you get the necessary input and the exposure.
