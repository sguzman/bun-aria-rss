  "description": "Yuck doesn't worry much about first impressions: Short of calling a band \"We're Terrible,\" it's hard to imagine a name riper for dismissal. On stage, though, this is a remarkably assured young riser. Yuck captures the frayed noise and hooky, guitar-driven melodies of '90s rock, even though its members, at 20, are too young to have experienced it firsthand. Hear the band perform live at SXSW from Stubb's in Austin, Texas, on March 16, 2011.",
