  "description": "“Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!”\nThis is the story of the Civil War in late-1864. Battles of significance are happening all across the country, and many of them are quite odd or unique: Pennsylvania miners are secretly digging under Confederates to blow them up from below; Admiral David Farragut is fighting in the torpedo-filled waters of Alabama’s Gulf Coast; Bushwacker “Bloody Bill” Anderson is fighting the war as a brutal gun-slinger; and one-legged Confederate General John Bell Hood is making a Hail Mary play and taking Tennessee. It’s a quick paced tour around the country as we inch toward the final culmination of the Civil War.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
