  "description": "We go over what appears to be the worst possible timeline for the Sixers—backs against the wall in the present, uncertain of how to build their Frankenstein roster in the future (1:15). Then, we run down the larger takeaways from the other series: Boston’s been overwhelmed by Milwaukee, Paul Millsap has found his old form, and the Rockets’ swingmen have been critical (24:50). Finally, we finish with some draft talk about what lessons we can learn from these playoffs, including (for the hundredth time) that teams shouldn’t take inexperienced rim-running centers over skilled combo guards (44:10).\n\nHosts: Danny Chau and Jonathan Tjarks\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
