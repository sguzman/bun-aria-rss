  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Kevin who is originally from Ireland. He shares some Irish folklore, along with an encounter he had with a little green man. What we might first assume in a America to be a little man in a green suit or a leprechaun, Kevin explains that something is lost in translation because what he saw was what most would consider to be a 2-3 foot tall little grayish/green alien. Not only did he see it but his family saw it. Kevin said “In our culture we would leave it gifts to leave us alone. My aunt said it had the head of a porcelain doll because it was so smooth and the face did not move.”</p> <p>Kevin goes on to say, “I came to America and joined the Marines. I served this country but my strange experiences did not stop in Ireland I have also seen a Sasquatch.”</p>",
