However, keeping our internal “clock” in rhythm is a vital component of our health and well-being. If you’ve ever experienced jet lag or pulled an all-nighter, you know just how off you can feel. When your biological and circadian rhythms become unbalanced, so does your health, and you feel it.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Todd LePine about the importance of keeping our circadian rhythm in sync. They also discuss how they work with patients to restore the body’s natural rhythm.</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).
