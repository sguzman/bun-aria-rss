  "description": "While Frank is in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), I (Daniel Creech), will be your podcast host the next couple of days. I start with a quick recap of this year’s crazy holiday travel environment… and what I saw on my trip home to Ohio.  Turning to the markets, I break down the 2021 results and highlight some of the best-performing sectors. And I share my thoughts on which areas will lead the way as inflation continues this year.  Healthcare stocks did great in 2021. But the current legislation in D.C. could push a lot more money into the sector…  Next, I recap the Fed’s plan to raise interest rates in the coming months. I tell you how to prepare for a massive shift that’s about to happen… and a potential surge in volatility.  The coronavirus continues to make headlines, with the Omicron variant causing a spike in new cases. I break down the shifting media narrative around COVID over the past year… and the changes in quarantine policy from the CDC. It’s a frustrating situation for investors, but there are reasons for optimism.  Before forming an opinion about the coronavirus, I highlight two interviews you should listen to…  Finally, I share some updates from Frank’s first day at CES, including why he’s ticked off at some major companies… the one megatrend everyone is talking about… and one tech player that stole the show. ",
