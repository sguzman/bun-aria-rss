We discuss the size of pyramids, Sasheer meeting Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, the app Sasheer tells if she’s horny, pornhub - ever heard of it?, if Sasheer would travel 16 hours for a hot dog, and if Nicole got power hungry on the set of Nailed It. They take a quiz to find what bird they would be in another life, and learn if having a duck is feasible for Nicole. They answer listener questions about an office threesome, mushroom birthday presents, and lots of wonderful questions from our audience! </p><p> </p><p>Here is the quiz we took this week: <a href=\"https://www.quizyourfriends.com/what-bird-would-you-be-in-another-life/\">https://www.quizyourfriends.com/what-bird-would-you-be-in-another-life/</a></p><p> </p><p>Email or call Nicole & Sasheer with your friendship questions at:</p><p><a href=\"mailto:nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com\">nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com</a></p><p>424-645-7003</p>\n",
