  "description": "<p>Nikki and her boyfriend Chris have two different definitions of The Glaser Effect. Nikki will be hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday. Last time she hosted was early on in the pandemic when she and Chris were still friends not lovers. Andrew remembers the turning point of Chris and Nikki's friendship and it involved boobs. Chris may take the relationship to a new level now that Nikki has a picture of him on her lock screen. While in Boston, Nikki went all out and bought a ring to remind her of Poppy's sass. She is reading the book Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and is now a believer of manifestations. In the Final Thought they go through Nikki's Reddit Dump. </p>\n<p>------------------</p>\n<p>Watch this episode on our Youtube Channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv56vKUY_59gXVFe0bRL8og\">The Nikki Glaser Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow the pod on Instagram for bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaserpod/\">@NikkiGlaserPod</a></p>\n<p>Leave us your voicemail: <a href=\"https://www.speakpipe.com/thenikkiglaserpodcast\">Click Here To Record</a></p>\n<p>Get Pod Merch: <a href=\"https://podshop.nikkiglaser.com/\">Podshop.NikkiGlaser.com</a></p>\n<p>Nikki's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/tour\">www.nikkiglaser.com/tour</a></p>\n<p>Andrew's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.andrewcollincomedy.com/\">www.andrewcollincomedy.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More Nikki: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaser/\">IG</a></p>\n<p>More Andrew:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewtcollin/\"> IG </a></p>\n<p>More producer Noa: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noainjection\">IG</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
