  "description": "Perhaps its his fear of an impending Oprah candidacy but Donald Trump seems to be embracing her tactic of great generosity to her audience.  In his case, it is of course, the audience of one he covets most...the one in the Kremlin.  And so in this week's episode of Trump's reality television show he has decided--after attacking our neighbors to the South (Mexico), a big American company (Amazon), and the U.S. Department of Justice--to give a big reward to Putin by reportedly inviting him to a White House meeting.  This is the kind of reward presidents reserve only for special friends--and think of what Putin has done to deserve it.  Yes, Just think of it.  That's what our Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and special guest Kelly Magsamen from the Center for American Progress do on this episode of Deep State Radio.
