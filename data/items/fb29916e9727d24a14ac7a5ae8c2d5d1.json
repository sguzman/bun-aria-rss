  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Left wants to abolish ice, borders, and now, the American suburbs by ending single-family zoning and replacing it with mini downtown areas. Stanley Kurtz joins the program and explains that this would create opportunities for federal funding for these new cities and eliminate local control. This was first considered by the Obama Administration via Senator Cory Booker. This plan, now adopted by Joe Biden, would hold hostage any federal grants or HUD money to achieve its goal of ending single-family zoning and densifying suburban neighborhoods. Then, you the American Citizen, are the enemy of the Marxists. We The People get in the way of the left doing what they want. The Democrat Party embraces the German philosophers Hegel and Marx and play people using emotion, gender, race, and income. Using race or climate to cause strife and division is quintessential Marxism. Marxists don't create, they destroy. Later, being an activist, working on campaigns, handing out leaflets, and doing whatever each of us can, is critical to winning in November. Activism is not something that can be done by someone else, it must be done by oneself. Finally, Daniel Horowitz calls in to give evidence that most coronavirus cases are now weaker than the flu.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
