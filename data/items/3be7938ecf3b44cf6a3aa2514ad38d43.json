  "description": "This week's Shutdown Fullcast is not only late, it's recorded on the road with relatively poor audio quality! Obviously you should listen to every terrible second of it.\nTopics covered:\n1. Rivalries updated, i.e. can you make up a rivalry out of thin air? Should you even have rivals? Which rivalries actually matter, and which ones do people even really care about? Why are the most intense rivalries between the most similar types of people? Remember that time South Carolina and Clemson had a head-kicking brawl that cost South Carolina a bowl game? You should probably remember that more often than you do.\n2. Is Les Miles sort of doomed at LSU? Beyond the usual ambient level of doom one might associate with LSU?\n3. What teams are you really, really unwilling to admit you enjoy watching? And not \"oh, it's a guilty pleasure!\" level watching, but \"oh god please don't let even my wife know I enjoy watching them\" kind of shame or discomfort.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
