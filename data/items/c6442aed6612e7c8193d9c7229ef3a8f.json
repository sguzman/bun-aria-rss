  "description": "Brad, Chelsea and Mia are at a training session for new staff at Lower Loxley. Brad asks Mia to go easy with Chelsea; she’s having a bad time. Chelsea’s astonished when Mia is nice to her as they work together in the cloakroom. Mia admits she’s sometimes a cow, but she’s not going to put more pressure one someone who’s already feeling it. Banter ensues. Later the three of them find some gruesome pictures of the hunt, and Mia suddenly wonders if there’s something they could do to mess up the Ball. She’s sure they could do it without getting caught. \nRuth goes to the rewilding to discuss the Brookfield soil results. When Kirsty goes to walk Lilian round the Halloween Trail, Rex chats to Ruth. He asks if Ben’s okay. When Ruth wonders why, he tells her how distracted Ben was when they were fishing together. Ruth’s alarmed at what he says. She was planning on taking them a meal soon – she’ll do it tomorrow. \nMeanwhile Lilian’s having misgivings about being a witch in the cold, dark rain. Kate is anxious, and Lilian tells her she knows why. This is all about sucking up to Kirsty to get in her good books and get some work. Kate admits it. Lilian bites the bullet for her niece. On the walk-through of the trail, Kate tags along, but is studiously ignored when she tries to fish about the yoga sessions. Then Lilian trips over something – it’s an old bottle, with an intriguing message inside it.",
