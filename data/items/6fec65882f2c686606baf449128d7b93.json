It is small and grows a majority of red wine, mainly spätburgunder<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Baden</em></strong> is Germany’s southernmost region and accordingly it is the warmest, sunniest region. It is close to France, and grows a lot of Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, and Pinot Blanc as a result<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Franken</em></strong> is known for its flagon – a flat, round-shaped bottle called a bocksbeutel. The regions specializes in earthy, white Silvaner from the limestone shores of the Main River<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Hessische Bergstrasse</em></strong> is a teeny region with Riesling as the lead. You don’t see these wines outside of Germany<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Mittelrhein</em></strong> is in the middle of the Rhine (fitting name, huh!?). It is dominated by Riesling, which grows on steep slate slopes<br /> <br /></li> <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Mosel</em></strong> is the most famed region in Germany and makes what many consider to be the best Riesling in the world. The first winegrowing in Germany was in Mosel and it contains the steepest vineyard: at 65˚ grade, Bremmer Calmont has this distinction. Slate soils are dominant and the wines are known for low alcohol levels, high acidity, pure fruit and floral (jasmine, gardenia) notes, along with strong minerality. They are generally off-dry to sweet, to offset the very powerful acidity the terroir imparts to Riesling.<br /> <br /> <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/p_170_6_Mosel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" /><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo (C)Wine For Normal People<br /></span><br /></em></li> <li><strong><em>Nahe</em></strong> is located around the river Nahe, the volcanic soils create wines with fuller, richer textures than in other parts of Germany. It is a medium-sized area and not all vineyards or wineries are created equal – there are excellent producers and less good ones too!<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Pfalz</em></strong> is the second largest area after Rheinhessen. It is consumed heavily in the domestic market and can make rich, fuller stules of dry Riesling because the climate is slightly warmer. Red wines are growing here as well, given the warm conditions and the ability to fully ripen red grapes.<br /> <br /></li> <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>Rheingau</em></strong> is the home of Riesling, the creator of Spätlese and Auslese, and highest percentage of Riesling (nearly 80%) and the home of Geisenheim University, one of the best viticulture and oenology schools in the world. The wines range in sweetness and in stule but they are subtler than Mosel wines and tend to develop intricate flavors of petrol, flowers, chamomile tea, and herbs with a few years in the bottle.<br /> <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/p_171_6Rheingau.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo (C) Wine For Normal People</em></span><br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Rheinhessen</em></strong> is the largest production area in Germany. It has the dubious distinction of being nicknamed “Liebfraumilch land” from its mass production of the sweet plonk that kind of tanked Germany’s reputation. Rheinhessen has tried to shirk that image and focus on quality wine made from Riesling. The areas of Nackenheim, Nierstein, and Oppenheim can produce excellent quality wine.<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Wurttemberg</em></strong> specializes in red wines that aren’t grown in other parts of Germany – Trollinger, Lemberger (Blaufränkisch), and Schwarzriesling (Pinot Meunier) are all big here.<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong><em>Saale-Unstrut</em></strong> and <strong><em>Sachsen</em></strong> are in the former East Germnay. Both specialize in dry wine and are at 51˚N latitude. The wines are improving with the help of climate changes and better viticultural practices.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Finally we tackle the levels of German Classification:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Deutscher Tafelwein</strong>: German Table Wine, consumed domestically</li> <li><strong>Deutscher Landwein:</strong> German Country wine like Vins d’Pays in France or IGP in Italy, consumed domestically</li> <li><strong>QbA</strong> (actually stands for <strong>Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete</strong>): Wines from a defined region. It can be blended from a few regions but generally it’s from one of the Anbaugebiete, so you’ll see Mosel, Pfalz, Rheingau, etc on the bottle</li> <li><strong>Prädikatswein</strong> is made from grapes with higher ripeness levels. The levels are: <ul> <li><strong>Kabinett:</strong> Ripe grapes. Can be dry or sweet</li> <li><strong>Spätelese:</strong> Late Harvest wines. Can be dry or sweet</li> <li><strong>Auslese:</strong> Select Harvest wines. Can be dry or sweet, very flavorful wines</li> <li><strong>Beerenauslese:</strong> Berries of the Select Harvest. Always sweet, generally have experienced the effects of botrytis so the wines are honeyed, waxy, and apricot like. Berries are selected off the vines for the best of the bunch</li> <li><strong>Trockenbeerenauslese:</strong> Dried Berries of Select Harvest. Always sweet, very rare. Grapes are very ripe must have been affected by botrytis. The grapes are raisined with very high concentration of sugar. Very expensive and rare wines</li> <li><strong>Eiswein:</strong> Grapes are harvested after the first frost. The water in the grapes freezes, the winemakers squeeze out the frozen water and then press the sugar that remains. These wines should not be affected by botrytis</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>We wrap up with other terms that are good to know:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Trocken </strong>means the wine is dry</li> <li><strong>Halbtrocken </strong>wines are off-dry and can seem very sweet</li> <li><strong>Feinherb </strong>wines are sweeter or as sweet as halbtrocken wines</li> <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The VDP:</strong> A private marketing organization of about 200 producers around Germany, with its own standards of quality that it expects its members to live up to. Not all great producers are VDP members but it is a safe bet if you know nothing about the wine<br /> <br /> <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/vdp_1910.jpg\" alt= \"\" width=\"210\" height=\"158\" /><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>VDP Logo<br /> <br /></em></span></li> <li><strong>Weingut </strong>is a winegrowing and wine-producing estate</li> <li><strong>Gutsabfüllung </strong>refers to a grower/producer wine that is estate bottled</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><em>Much of the data for the podcast was sourced from the <a href= \"https://www.germanwineusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/German-Wine-Manual-2018GB-RZ_Web.pdf\"> Wines of Germany</a></em></p> <p>________________________________________</p> <p>Thanks for our sponsors this week:</p> <p><strong>Wine Access:</strong> Access to the best wines for the best prices!
