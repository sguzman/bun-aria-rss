  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Pew Research Center on Journalism and Media released a study today indicating that more than 6,000 Americans surveyed believe that \"made-up news\" is a problem that we need to fix.\" Respondents also noted that they expect this negative trend to get worse and see it as a problem that needs to be corrected by the media policing themselves. This is exactly what \"Unfreedom Of The Press\" is all about and that's why it's #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List for a second week in a row. The American people are smarter than the media thinks; they seek out the truth like a modern-day Thomas Paine pamphlet and why ratings on CNN and MSNBC continue to suffer. If the media doesn't get with the program, they will make themselves irrelevant because people will eventually bypass them for being propagandistic manufacturers of pseudo-events. Then, Steven Crowder calls in to discuss being demonetized by YouTube following criticism from Vox commentator Carlos Maza. Later, tomorrow we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the horrors of D-Day during World War II, recalling the atrocities of the Third Reich and how they were defeated. Finally, the free market gave us the industrial revolution and we can't abandon capitalism for the next fad. To be for the American worker is to be for the American economic system of capitalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
