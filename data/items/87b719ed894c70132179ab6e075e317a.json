  "description": "This weekend on BEST OF THE GIST, we unearthed a 2016 interview with Chuck Klosterman, the author of The Nineties and a dozen or so other books. In this archival gem, Mike and Chuck discuss what counts as a great American novel, and how we decide who’s smart. And we’re also listening back to the Tuesday spiel about how a Harvard sleep researcher changed Mike's position in the battle over Daylight Saving Time.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
