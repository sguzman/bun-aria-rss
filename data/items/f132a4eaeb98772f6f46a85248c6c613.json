Over fifteen months, they will work together in the Flatiron Building in downtown Atlanta, growing their businesses while they learn from one another and outside experts. “Isolation is the enemy of entrepreneurs,” notes Smith, who herself is a recent graduate of Leadership Atlanta, a nine-month executive-level training and development program. </p><p>In this episode of Access & Opportunity, Carla Harris talks with Smith about the model that the Atlanta Women’s Entrepreneurship Initiative has established for empowering women-owned businesses and how that model could be replicated in other cities. A key element of the Atlanta program is its diversity: the women in the incubator are as racially and socioeconomically diverse as the city where they live, and they range in age from their early 20s to late 50s. “We know the talent is equal,” says Smith. “It's the opportunities that are not.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
