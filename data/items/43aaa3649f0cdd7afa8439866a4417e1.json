  "description": "<p>Over the past few weeks we asked you our listeners and readers of <a href='http://thecigarauthority.com/'>TheCigarAuthority.com</a> to partake in a survey where we asked you 20 questions. Well, the results are in and we will share the results… How much do you smoke, how much do you spend, what are your favorite brands and so much more. Barry has compiled all the answers and we share them with you the participants with whom it would not have been possible.</p>\n<p>The big companies are out to hurt the little companies, but have those small companies turned the tide? It appears the big are getting smaller, but are the little companies getting bigger? Regardless, the cigar industry is changing and we will take a look at what’s going on as well as some major changes in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we will tackle the first 10 questions while smoking Intemperance by RoMaCraft Cigars, while in the second hour we fire up a Padron 2000 Maduro. Both cigars were named by us on our after-show where we shared with you cigars that are smoking really well right now.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
