  "description": "<div>HELLO True Crime & MakeUp Lovers  !<br>\n Hi friends , hope you had a wonderful weekend! I wanted to talk about this story, and boy, it's a doozy. Katherine Knight was insane, literally, insane, no other words to describe her. What are your thoughts? Doesn’t it sound like a movie ??? This is why I don’t leave my house, I know there are these people just roaming around out there !! Anyways, please be safe, don’t kill anyone or eat them, please and thank you. <br>\n Love and appreciate you all so much and I will be seeing you very soon <br>\nx o<br>\nBailey Sarian<br>\n<br>\nP.S. If you haven't already, check out my YouTube @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/baileysarian\">BaileySarian</a>\n</div>\n",
