  "description": "<p>Nikki is here solo, solo (shout out Frank Ocean), starting the pod number 6 in line for a Covid test at a local clinic. She will be traveling the next two days and didn't want to miss a chance to thank some Besties who cried at her show and one who parallel parked in Los Angeles to say hello. After her first dates back on the road Nikki explains why she has new walkout music and how her material is changing. She had a \"normal\" moment that she shared with her girlfriends. You Heard It Here First; Nikki is still afraid of \"crowd crushes\", who wouldn't want a civil rights icon involved in their birth, when a personality makes you ugly and a murder mystery that was finally solved is giving Nikki all the swells. In the Final Thought, Nikki affirms that you will never find her standing on a long line. </p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>Watch this episode on our Youtube Channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv56vKUY_59gXVFe0bRL8og\">The Nikki Glaser Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow the pod on Instagram for bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaserpod/\">@NikkiGlaserPod</a></p>\n<p>Leave us your voicemail: <a href=\"https://www.speakpipe.com/thenikkiglaserpodcast\">Click Here To Record</a></p>\n<p>Get Pod Merch: <a href=\"https://podshop.nikkiglaser.com/\">Podshop.NikkiGlaser.com</a></p>\n<p>Nikki's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/tour\">www.nikkiglaser.com/tour</a></p>\n<p>Andrew's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.andrewcollincomedy.com/\">www.andrewcollincomedy.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More Nikki: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaser/\">IG</a></p>\n<p>More Andrew:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewtcollin/\"> IG </a></p>\n<p>More producer Noa: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noainjection\">IG</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
