  "description": "<p>“I love bookstores, with all of my heart for everything that they've done for me and my stories, but it is the booksellers that are at the front putting these books into the hands of readers, so they do absolutely deserve a majority, if not all of the credit.”  Our booksellers will be the first to tell you that T.J. Klune writes charming, heartfelt must-reads—<em>The House on the Cerulean Sea</em> was one of our favorite Monthly Picks this year—and his newest book, <em>Under the Whispering Door</em> is our Speculative Fiction Book of the Year! T.J. joins us on the show to talk about his extraordinary world-building, being honest about grief, Buddy Holly, and more. Featured Books: The House on Cerulean Sea and Under the Whispering Door by T.J. Klune and Light From Uncommon Stars by Ryka Aoki. Allyson Gavaletz guest hosts this episode, which was produced by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
