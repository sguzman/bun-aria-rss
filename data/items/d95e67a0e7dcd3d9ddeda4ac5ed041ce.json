    "media:description": "In this video I introduce map spaces and functionals, and describe their applications in physics. I also describe how differentiation, integration, and vector fields can be described using infinitesimals, a new view of the continuum based on infinitesimals, and how we can connect infinitesimals, map spaces, and vector fields with the standard study of continuous dynamical systems via differential equations. This approach is illustrated by looking at how to solve the harmonic oscillator system from physics.\n\nA lot of this content was inspired by Lawvere's paper\n\nhttps://github.com/mattearnshaw/lawvere/blob/master/pdfs/2017-everyday-physics-of-extended-bodies-or-why-functionals-need-analyzing.pdf\n\nAnd by Bell's book `A primer of infinitesimal Analysis'\n\nA rigorous approach to this subject, emphasizing the category theoretic foundations, can be found here:\n\nCategory Theory For Beginners: Synthetic Differential Geometry\nhttps://youtu.be/y9ieJ1Gpl6Y\n\n\nMore videos about various things to do with synthetic differential geometry can be found within my playlist:\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCTMeyjMKRkqy3NUHnMeY-PGgsZ963F58\n\nA video about intuitionistic logic and type theory can be found here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rTlirbfRI&list=PLCTMeyjMKRkqTM2-9HXH81tvpdROs-nz3&index=5\n\nA video about the internal language of a topos (the Mitchell-Benabou language) can be found here:\nhttps://youtu.be/66glvnHX-a8",
