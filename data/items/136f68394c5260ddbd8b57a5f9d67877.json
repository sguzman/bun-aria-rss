  "description": "There is a monster that's worse than all other monsters. He's (literally) the father of monsters. His donkey-head scrapes the stars and his hands are a hundred snake heads. He was born for one singular purpose: to destroy the Olympians, and that's just what he'll do. His name is Typhon. And that's just the first story today. Then we launch into the main story, about Theseus and the Amazons. We'll pick back up with our buddy Hercules as he's being terrible and get a background on the Amazons and see why you shouldn't do exactly what Theseus does. --- Sponsors: The Shape of Water!
