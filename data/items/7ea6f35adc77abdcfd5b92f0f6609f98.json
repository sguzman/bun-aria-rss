Charlene shares how she is now furthering the conversation through music, and her podcast, Golden Hour. Then, host Carla Harris sits down with Bing Chen, the founder of non-profit Gold House, to learn how he has spent the last four years putting community and capital behind AAPI representation, helping drive the success of films such as <em>Crazy Rich Asians, Parasite </em>and<em> Minari.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
