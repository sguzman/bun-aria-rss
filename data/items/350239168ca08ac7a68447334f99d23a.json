  "description": "<p>This week, I'm speaking to Christina Kaz and Lilit Devejian, Founders and Principal Designers of LUXYSPACE, an interior design firm based in California with studios in both Fresno and Beverly Hills.</p> <p>Christina and Lilit have a fabulous story and a very inspiring relationship. Both are Armenian, both are incredibly stylish, and both are often mistaken as each other's sisters.</p> <p>The two met whilst working at another firm and very quickly found a kindred spirit in each other. They knew that their own practice was not far away, so they ended up setting up LUXYSPACE.</p> <p>In this interview, we discuss how that process happened, how they worked effectively, and how they developed relationships with high-net-worth individuals, and how they assess whether a client is the wrong or the right fit.</p> <p><br /> ► For your 28-day free trial, go to https://www.SweetProcess.com/boa</p> <p>► Access your free training at http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</p> <p>*******<br /> For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture<br /> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/<br /> Website: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/<br /> Twitter: https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch<br /> Podcast: http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/<br /> iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926<br />  Android Podcast Feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>",
