  "description": "<p>In this compilation I go deep into my lifelong strategy of micro speed and macro patience. Just because Mark Zuckerberg put on a hoodie and built one of the biggest businesses in the world doesn't mean that EVERYONE can do the same. Mark is a special breed, who built a special product, at a special time. He's an assassin as a businessman and just because it feels like he did it overnight, doesn't mean that we all can become just as successful or even a fraction of it in the same amount of time. There's no shortcuts in life and everything that matters takes time. Stop rushing and looking for the easy way out because there is none - period. Please take a listen to this one as so many of you need to hear it. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5524438.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
