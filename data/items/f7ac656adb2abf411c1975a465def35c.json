  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes the above report is my experience with the Florida Skunk Ape. I’m a big fan of your show if you would be interested in interviewing me I’d love to come on.”</p> <p>Here is the report: “In 1974 I was 12 yrs. old visiting my sister M and her family in Davie FL with my cousin A who was 15 at the time. One night we were sleeping on a pull out couch in the sitting room. When we smelled something like a skunk only worse, we asked my sister what it was she said it was the Skunk Ape and he comes around in the hottest summers. We didn’t believe her so we asked our friends and they said it was real.</p> <p>One night while we were sleeping we seen a huge shadow come across the picture window. Then it turned looked at itself and let out a blood curdling scream that scared us half to death. Then it turned and walked to the side of the house and we followed it by going in the side bathroom. There it squatted down to eat a wild watermelon then it went to the back of the house to a man made lake, squatted down and drank some water. A few nights later the beast attacked a wild horse in its coral but the horse got away by jumping over the coral and ran off into the pasture.</p> <p>The rancher came out and took a few shots at the beast but it got away. When the horse came back it had finger prints on its hind quarters, not scratches but finger marks. A few nights later the beast came back and killed a farmer’s bull. The farmer took a few shots at the beast but missed it. At the same time my sister and her husband J were coming home from a night out and the sheriff and his deputy were on patrol. We jumped into Joe’s car and followed the Deputy when the beast stepped out of the darkness and was hit by the police car...\"</p>",
