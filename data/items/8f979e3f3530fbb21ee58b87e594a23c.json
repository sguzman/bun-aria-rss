  "description": "<p>Fear as a Pathway to Loving Presence - Night Travelers - (retreat talk) (2016-05-08) - Shifting our relationship with fear is central to the evolution of consciousness. Our suffering arises when our thoughts, feelings and sense of identity are shaped by fear. As we learn to attend to fear with mindfulness and care, we discover the vast tender presence that has room for the waves, and can fully cherish this life.</p> <p>\"Life’s waters flow from darkness. Search the darkness, don’t run from it.<br /> Night travelers are full of light, and you are too: don’t leave this companionship....<br /> The moon appears for night travelers, be watchful when the moon is full.\"<br /> ~ rumi</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
