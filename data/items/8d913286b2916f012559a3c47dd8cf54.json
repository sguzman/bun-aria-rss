  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, if NFL fans are systemically racist like Roger Goodell says, then people should want nothing to do with the league. If these professional sports owners and athletes think America has racist DNA then we should abandon the NFL, NBA, and the like. If we are racist then Goodell should step down and let an African American take his job. Interestingly, many of these sports-millionaire's specifically choose not to live in the communities that are being plagued by poor Democrat policies, like Watts, Harlem, or the South Side of Chicago and it’s not because they hate the police — it's because these hypocrites don't want to live in neighborhoods with high crime rates. Later, Speaker Pelosi chimes in on the \"Defund the Police\" hype. Kamala Harris, the former Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the State of California claims to be re-balancing and re-imagining public safety, despite these same cities being under their Democrat control for half of a century. Afterward, while the left claims that America is systemically racist, the number of interracial marriages approaches nearly 20% of all marriages in the U.S. There are politicians that commit crimes and we've never defunded them, this just proves that police are being unfairly targeted.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
