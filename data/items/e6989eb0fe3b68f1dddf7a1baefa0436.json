  "description": "Dr. Crystal Dilworth is proving that STEM is for anyone willing to dive headlong into the unknown. Her amazing TEDx talk, delivered in skinny jeans and neon green heels, has gained nearly 100K views and destroys the longstanding myth of the frumpy and unhip scientist. Leveraging the discipline she learned from her modern dance background, she brings together the worlds of science and creativity combining the usually sterile world of research with the mass appeal of pop culture. She has been the go-to host/journalist for countless scientific shows including TechKnow, YouTube's Fail Lab, and Discovery Channel's DNews among others. Get to know the doctor, researcher, actress, and choreographer in this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.  1. “I think our expectations create our reality.”[3:55] 2. “There’s a balance between following your bliss and having that bliss be reasonable.” [15:52] 3. “The worst thing in the world is to have an inquisitive mind or to have questions and to not know the right people or have the right resources to get them answered.” [16:30] 4. “Life means to evolve, and if you’re not evolving through small incremental changes that build up over time to create a large change then you’re probably dead, and that shouldn’t really be a goal of anyone.” [29:33] 5.“Every day I get up and I say 'What are my priorities?' and then I move towards that.”[29:47] 6. “Put your head down and do the training and take the pain and eventually it’s going to pay off.” [30:41] 7. “New challenges are old dragons we’ve already slain.” [35:00]  SHOW NOTES  Crystal shares her thoughts on multiple dimensions and creating your own reality.
