  "description": "<p>Expect to see a fair number of ads when Apple begins streaming Major League Soccer games next year. According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-04/apple-s-next-step-in-ads-will-be-built-around-new-soccer-deal?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the company is building an advertising network to support its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-mls-soccer-streaming-subscription-service-171000757.html\"><ins>10-year agreement</ins></a> with the league. Apple has reportedly held talks with MLS sponsors about airing ads during games and accompanying programming the company has planned for next season.</p><p>It also sounds like diehard fans won’t be able to escape commercial breaks by paying more. <em>Bloomberg</em> reports the company currently plans to air spots across all three tiers of the partnership, meaning you’ll see ads whether you pay for a dedicated package, access the games through your existing TV+ subscription or catch the occasional free match on the company’s TV app.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The move is part of a broader push by Apple to increase how much it earns from advertising. The company’s ad unit currently generates about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ads-report-211050181.html\"><ins>$4 billion</ins></a> in annual revenue. Todd Teresi, the head of the division, has reportedly pushed to increase that number to $10 billion and above. To that end, Apple recently began showing more ads in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-today-tab-ads-152249659.html\"><ins>App Store</ins></a> and is testing search advertisements within its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ads-report-211050181.html\"><ins>Maps</ins></a> app.</p>",
