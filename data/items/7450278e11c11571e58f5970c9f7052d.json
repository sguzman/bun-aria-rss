  "itunes:summary": "Saskia Doherty speaks until the breath is completely gone.\n\nThis program of lecture-performances by sound artists is brought to you by the new cultural logic of capital — real, but honestly, also kind of surreal (algorhythmically-determined, creatively industrial, simulacra sold back to us as authentic alternatives).\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/capitalist-surrealism\n\nCapitalist Surrealism\n24 September 2015\nNational Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Australia Council for the Arts, City of Melbourne and Creative Victoria.\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
