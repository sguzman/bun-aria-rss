  "description": "<p>\"I don’t think conservatism can do its job in a free society in opposition to the institutions of that society,” Yuval Levin told me. “I think it can only function in defense of them.”</p><p>Levin is the director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the author of a number of great books, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Build-Community-Recommitting-Institutions/dp/1541699270\" target=\"_blank\">“A Time to Build.”</a> I wanted to talk to him about a very specific question, though: What will the Republican Party become? Levin is one of its most thoughtful and sober analysts — a temperament that may, I realize, make him unsuited to interpreting its current incarnation, in which a majority of House Republicans voted to reject the results of the 2020 presidential election and one of them is, well, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/opinion/marjorie-taylor-greene-gop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>.</p><p>But Levin’s diagnosis is interesting. Histories of the modern Republican Party often place Ronald Reagan at their center. That is, in Levin’s view, a mistake. “I think Reagan is better understood as a detour from a history that is otherwise a story of a constant struggle between populism and conservatism,” he said. Donald Trump was an inheritor of a tradition that stretches long before him — Pat Buchanan’s tradition, and Strom Thurmond’s tradition. He didn’t form a new Republican Party; he allowed a long-existing part to express itself.</p><p>Behind that lie institutional changes both in the Republican Party and in the broader structure of American politics. That’s why I wanted to talk to Levin for this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show”: He, like me, thinks in terms of institutions. “The question for us in the coming years is whether we can move a little more in the direction of a politics of ‘what does government do,’ and less of a politics of ‘who rules,’” he says.</p><p>That’s exactly the right question, in my view. But we have very different views of what kinds of institutional changes would get us there. I’d like to see a more democratized, majoritarian system. Levin would, among other things, add a filibuster to the House.</p><p>So this is more than just a conversation about how to fix the Republican Party. It’s a conversation about how to fix American politics — how to recenter it on policy that changes people’s lives, rather than symbolic clashes that merely harden our hearts.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><p>“<a href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/big-tech-big-government-challenges-regulating-internet-platforms\">Big Tech, Big Government: The Challenges of Regulating Internet Platforms</a>,” National Affairs, Winter 2021</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Working-Class-Republican-Blue-Collar-Conservatism/dp/0062475266\">The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism </a>by Henry Olsen</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/opinion/biden-inauguration-democrats.html\">\"Democrats, Here’s How to Lose in 2022.
