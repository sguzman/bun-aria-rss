  "description": "This is the final roundtable for 2019 as we head into the new year. And this one packs a few punches. First, we dive into Instagram news where the number of likes are now hidden from your view. How will it impact bourbon Instagram stars? Then we roll into the meat of the podcast talking about Pappy and Sazerac vs The Secondary Market. Lastly, we share what we are thankful for in 2019. I also want to take this opportunity to say thank you to you, the dedicated listeners and viewers of Bourbon Pursuit. We really appreciate the hours you spend with us every week to hear us talk about bourbon.\nShow Notes:\n\nWarehouse X: http://www.experimentalwarehouse.com/\n\n\nMarianne Eaves at TEDxBroadway:  https://www.tedxbroadway.com/talks/2019/11/19/making-the-impossible-and-doing-the-unthinkable-marianne-eaves\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about vintage whiskey collections.\n\nInstagram removes likes.
