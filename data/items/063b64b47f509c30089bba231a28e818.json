  "description": "<p><p>On this special edition of ZBT, we discuss how President Trump's trip to Iraq on Christmas was portrayed by the media, and we compareÂ what we remember about our first trips into combat zones. We make New Year's resolutions, and they are basically to stop being fat pieces of shit. Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer joined us on Hi Haters, but we want you to hear it on ZBT as well. It was,,, weird. (Full interview coming soon!)</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
