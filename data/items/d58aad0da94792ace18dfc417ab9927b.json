  "description": "<p>We define a symmetric monoidal category modelling fuzzy concepts and fuzzy\nconceptual reasoning within G\\\"ardenfors' framework of conceptual (convex)\nspaces. We propose log-concave functions as models of fuzzy concepts, showing\nthat these are the most general choice satisfying a criterion due to\nG\\\"ardenfors and which are well-behaved compositionally. We then generalise\nthese to define the category of log-concave probabilistic channels between\nconvex spaces, which allows one to model fuzzy reasoning with noisy inputs, and\nprovides a novel example of a Markov category.\n</p>",
