  "description": "<p>This week during a romantic getaway with the husband, I had a pretty mind-blowing epiphany. I discuss why the idea of  closure is total 1980's bullshit psychology. Why the show Better Call Saul is really about embracing your inner piece of shit. Each week I get countless emails from Millennials who struggle with inter-personal communication. It's no wonder why - your parents have raised you to be terrified of everything.  You've been over-parented into feeling hopeless about making friends. This episode I'll teach you how to talk to strangers. Also, I discuss my own emetephobia (fear of vomiting). This episode has so much deepness, I could barf! J/K NEVER!!</p>\n",
