  "description": "<p>We revisit the Emergence Proposal in 4d ${\\cal N}=2$ vector multiplet sectors\nthat arise from type II string Calabi--Yau compactifications, with emphasis on\nthe role of axionic fundamental strings, or EFT strings. We focus on\nlarge-volume type IIA compactifications, where EFT strings arise from\nNS5-branes wrapping internal four-cycles, and consider a set of\ninfinite-distance moduli-space limits that can be classified in terms of a\nscaling weight $w=1,2,3$. It has been shown before how one-loop threshold\neffects of an infinite tower of BPS particles made up of D2/D0-branes generate\nthe asymptotic behaviour of the gauge kinetic functions along limits with\n$w=3$. We extend this result to $w=2$ limits, by taking into account D2-brane\nmulti-wrapping numbers. In $w=1$ limits the leading tower involves EFT string\noscillations, and one can reproduce the behaviour of both weakly and\nstrongly-coupled $U(1)$'s independently on whether the EFT string is critical\nor not, by assuming that charged modes dominate the light spectrum.\n</p>",
