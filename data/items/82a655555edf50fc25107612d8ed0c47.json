  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the prosecutors in the Kyle Rittenhouse case have become an instrument of the rioters and looters. Similarly, the U.S Department of Justice has become an agency that goes after the President of the United States and journalists like James O’Keefe. The American Marxists have conquered a significant element of our culture and these institutions that we would've thought would resist, have not. Like law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the U.S military is pushing critical race theory as part of an overall Marxist movement to propagandize. Even local institutions are being nationalized insofar as they are advancing the left's racist, ideological agenda which includes unconstitutional vaccine mandates. Then, MSNBC's Tiffany's Cross attacks truck drivers claiming that the white drivers cut off the black drivers. Cross's suggestion that truckers are racists does not sit well with truckers of all races and genders across America. Later, Buzzfeed maintains that because the FBI opened an investigation into the Steele dossier they felt it was worth reporting on it. Despite learning that the entire dossier was false almost none of the media have retracted their stories.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
