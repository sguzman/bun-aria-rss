  "description": "<p>When Glo Atamno stepped on a plane with a one-way ticket and $500 years back, she knew she wanted a life that was different from the one she was expected to live, one filled with adventure, one that broke the mold of how others had always told her life was “supposed” to be lived. What’s unfolded has been a life of not just adventure, but also profound exploration, growth, connection, and impact. A life of stories. Over a period of years, she also figured out how to build a powerful living around her quest as a creative entrepreneur and online educator. Starting as a travel blogger, venturing to over 80 countries across 6 continents and telling the stories of destinations around the world, she landed features in Forbes, Oprah Magazine, Conde Nast, Essence, BBC, collaborates with major brands, and hosted \"The Glo Show\" podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>But, over time, her journey began to morph into something both bigger and deeper, especially over the last few years, as she felt called to speak honestly and openly on issues of equity, race, and community in a more intentional way. She's the founder of The Social Educators Academy, helping people leverage their social platforms to make a difference and make a living. As we spoke, Glo shared powerful reflections on the travel-centered life she’s been living, her experience both in the U.S. and on the road as a Black woman, and how she’s continuing to evolve her focus, life, and livelihood in new directions as we all emerge back into a changed world.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Glo at:&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/glographics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/glographics/</p><p><a href=\"https://pod.link/1537789031\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Glo Show</a> : https://pod.link/1537789031</p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/4dd2c96e3a6757cc10b3f9859ca91c30\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Guillebeau</a>, who spent a decade traveling to every country in the world, while building a global community fueled by impact and adventure : https://tinyurl.com/GLP-Chris</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
