  "description": "We are thrilled to welcome award-winning interior designer Melanie Turner, previously heard on Episode 10, back to the show! Melanie’s work has been featured in Architectural Digest, Veranda, Traditional Home, House Beautiful, and she just authored her first book Inviting Interiors: A Fresh Take on Beautiful Rooms. She is the founder of Atlanta-based Melanie Turner Interiors and has now launched a storefront in Montana. We talk about Melanie’s extremely varied style, her new book, her thoughts on colors, decorating with kids, putting a joyful spin on practicality, and so much more.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nAll about Melanie’s new book Inviting Interiors: A Fresh Take on Beautiful Rooms.\n\nWhere does Melanie’s unique creativity come from?\n\nHow to have a house palette without being too matchy-matchy.\n\nUtilizing everything in your home.\n\nPushing the boundaries with colors.\n\nThe misconceptions about a family home and decorating with kids in the house.\n\nMaking your house the most comfortable by thinking about how you live.\n\nWhat’s a hot kitchen and a cold kitchen?\n\nMelanie’s signature is often using distinctive art.\n\nBack to Melanie’s kitchens!\n\nBooks are often the great divider with designers. What are Melanie’s thoughts?\n\nWhat does Melanie think future color trends will be?\n\nHow to turn creature comforts into something that brings you joy.\n\nDecorating Dilemma\nHi Angeliki,\n\nSince you said you are done with dark colors, I wouldn’t paint the room that color you have picked out. Although it’s beautiful, it’s very saturated and will make the room feel dark. I would go one to two shades lighter if you want to do a color and be sure to add some white. Otherwise, I would paint it white and look for that teal in an accent pillow, chair, or something else small. The other thing I would suggest is moving the furniture around. I think the bed right next to the door and closet makes the space feel cramped. I would put the bed opposite the wall of the closet, put the desk closest to the door, and the dresser closest to the window so now you have two nightstands where you can add two lights on either side. The bookcase should be on the left as you open the door. That will leave you a clean Zoom background for when you’re working at your desk. We’re going to send you this drawing to show you where to put things!\n\nAnother fun thing you could do would be to paint some of this furniture — properly! Be sure to sand so it doesn’t peel. If you end up painting the room white or ivory, then you could paint one of the pieces that teal you liked.\n\nWe would really love to see some after photos! Good luck and thanks for listening all the way from Greece!\n\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nMelanie Turner Interiors\nInviting Interiors available for Pre-order\nEpisode 10: Melanie Turner\nMelanie Turner Interiors on Instagram",
