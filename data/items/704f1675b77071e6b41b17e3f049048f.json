  "description": "<p>This week, in Bagdad, Arizona, a man is attacked, in his front yard by a masked assailant, who immediately flees the scene. The only evidence at the scene is a little blood, and some shards of potato, baffling the investigators. His new, young bride thinks that her ex-husband must be the killer, but it turns out, she's been shacking up with a local insane man, who works with her, as a nurse's aide, but claims to be a doctor, lawyer, fighter pilot, and CIA agent, as well. He also claims that jail is controlling his thoughts, with a large machine, and writes letters to everyone, including the President of the US to try to get some relief.
