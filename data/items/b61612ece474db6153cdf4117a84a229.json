  "description": "In this month's bonus episode, the gals reminisce about the glory days at their alma maters. Topics include an intense ceremony decorum enforcer, a little-appreciated and not-so-athletic varsity sport, and a chicken finger heist for the ages. Pop open a bottle of Winc's The Independent White Blend, schedule your campus visit, and tune in for Graduation Crimes.",
