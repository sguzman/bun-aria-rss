  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you grow up and what environment you’re exposed to during your formative years can play a significant role in – ‘who you become’. Christian had a run of good luck with an upbringing in an entrepreneurial family. Seeing his Dad chasing his dreams and progressing always motivated him “to keep trying as you never know where it's going to lead you in the end.”</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Schabacker is Steve’s son and currently a full-time police officer that he always wanted to be. Growing up with an entrepreneurial Dad, Christian learned to be relentless as he says to his father: “See, you succeed makes me want to succeed even more.” At only 22 years old, he has come a long way, but that’s not an end to the path of his dreams. Eventually, he wants to start his own company or some side hustle to be “his own Boss”, and build a financially better future for himself and his family.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this very special episode of</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Tactical Entrepreneur</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podcast, the father-son duo engage in a fascinating conversation by having a few laughs and some serious stuff that genuinely touches you with their authentic revelations. Christian lets out what life skills he developed, having been raised in an entrepreneurial family, how he feels about achieving his long-desired goal, what his future dreams are, and so much more.
