  "description": "<p>JRE Review of MMA 70 with Aljamain Sterling</p>\n <p>Aljamain Sterling is a UFC fighter and a bad mother fucker for sure! Check out his highlights on Youtube if you're not familiar with his fights. He has some incredible knockouts and I always enjoy his dynamic attacks. He has an interesting conversation with Joe and really opens up about himself. I really think this guy will be a champion one day. I liked doing this review.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
