  "description": "A hearty thank you to all the wonderful people who came out to our live show in Charlotte, where we did what any good guest would do and mostly just trashed the ACC. But, you know, in fun Fullcast ways. Did this tick off one person in attendance to the point where he almost kind of sort of tried to take over the show? Yes, but he's right that the ACC has won two of the last three national titles, a thing we definitely did not know and nobody talks about.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
