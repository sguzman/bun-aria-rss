  "description": "<p>This week, we look at a guy that took such an intense wrong turn, that it boggles the mind. He started off as the model citizen. He did the right things. He said the right things. But when things went off the rails, they went as far off the rails as we've ever seen. The shocking brutality of his final crime is so heartless, and full of rage, that it's incredible he didn't snap sooner. Why did he do it? Mental illness? Brain damage? A diabolical plan? Or is he innocent? Either way, he's an idiot, and we have a great time pointing it out!! Also, he's not innocent.Follow the rules, always do the right thing, and then commit one of the most heartless slaughters imaginable with Terry Underwood!!Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie WhismanDonate at...patreon.com/crimeinsports or with paypal.com using our email: crimeinsports@gmail.comGet all the CIS & STM merch at crimeinsports.threadless.com</p><p><br> </p><p>Contact us:</p><p>twitter.com/crimeinsports</p><p>crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p>facebook.com/Crimeinsports</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p> </p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
