  "description": "<p>Is there a perception in the art world that big is better? &nbsp;Do you gain more respect if you make larger paintings? This week we debate wether size matters and share our own personal experiences of scaling up our work. We discuss the challenges of working larger, including the need to think differently, choose the right substrate and tools, and - most of all - buy enough paint. We also challenge the notion that big is better and discuss the importance of finding your own desired way of working. We feel that so much of this depends on what your work is about and what feels right to you. The right work will always find an audience, no matter the size. And if it doesn't, does that really matter if you are painting what you love?</p>\n<p>This week's chat also covers internet scams, inspirational emails, school reports that miss the mark, and Alice's first in-person art event in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Ethan Hawke TED talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRS9Gek4V5Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRS9Gek4V5Q</a></p>\n<p>Polly Dutton <a href=\"https://www.pollydutton.co.uk/\">https://www.pollydutton.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p>Rachel Davies <a href=\"https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/abstractportraits\">https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/abstractportraits</a></p>\n<p>You can see '<strong>Canopy</strong>' on this page: <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/landscape-unlocked/\">https://alicesheridan.com/landscape-unlocked/</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
