When it travels overseas and is stored for a month the wine is terrible. But even then, I bet if we tasted it fresh, Beaujolais Nouveau tastes like bananas, bubble gum, and pear candy, with little acid or tannin. Apart from color, it has more in common with a white than a red. It’s fun, but it doesn’t taste that great and as we’ve become more sophisticated in our wine drinking, Beaujolais Nouveau has become less exciting to most people. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sadly this increasing sophistication has had terrible repercussions in the region of Beaujolais — forcing some growers out of business and creating tensions among those who depended on this product for their livelihoods.

This is the stuff wine people go nuts over but that few others know about: the 10 Beaujolais Crus that make distinctive, floral, fresh wine from the Gamay grape. Just south of Burgundy and north of Rhône, on a swath of granite, which is Gamay’s preferred soil, are scattered areas that make outstanding wine. From north to south these are: Saint-Amour, Juliénas, Chénas, Moulin-à-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, Régnié, Côte de Brouilly, and Brouilly.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The wines produced in these Cru run the gamut — from floral and fruity to rich, earthy, and complex. Here’s a quick grouping of each type: </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href= \"http://winefornormalpeople.com/wfiles/2015/12/beaujormap.jpg\"> </a></span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Lighter bodied, more floral, less age worthy:</strong> Chiroubles </span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Medium bodied, fruity with mineral notes:</strong>Brouilly, Côte de Brouilly, Fleurie, Régnié, Saint-Amour</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Fuller bodied, spicy, earthy:</strong> Chénas, Juliénas</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Even fuller and more age-worthy, spicy, and like a cross between Pinot Noir and more floral Gamay:</strong> Morgon, Moulin-à-Vent</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Most of these wines are incredibly well priced for what they are — around US $20 or less — and they taste like nothing else you’ve ever tried. I don’t know of other wines that can boast flavors of iris flowers, violets, or lily of the valley and also have raspberry, earth, and spice notes. The combination of freshness and structure — most Cru have excellent acidity but also a round, soft texture — make these wines like nothing else you’ve ever had. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So clearly, I love the stuff.
