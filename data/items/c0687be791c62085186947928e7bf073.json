And this is not just an American problem. Eighty percent of the world's chronic disease and obesity is in the developing world. We know that food is driving the majority of this death and disease but no one is really talking about it.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman explores the global chronic disease crisis being driven by food and the food system. He also breaks down the principles of his “Pegan” diet, a middle ground between vegan and Paleo, focused on whole-foods; primarily colorful, high-fiber vegetables like kale, cauliflower, peppers, and radishes; healthy fats like extra-virgin olive oil and avocados; some low-glycemic fruits like blueberries and blackberries; free-range meats and eggs, used more like condiments than as the star of the plate; anti-inflammatory nuts and seeds, and flavorful herbs and spices.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Learn more about these all of topics in Dr. Hyman's new book, Food Fix. <a href=\"http://foodfixbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FoodFixBook.com</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
