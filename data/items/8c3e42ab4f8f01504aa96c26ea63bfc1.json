  "title": "Small Giants By Bo Burlingham",
  "description": "Companies that focus on being great instead of being big appreciate the gift of running a business. Burlingham writes about fourteen companies that created businesses that thrived in their communities. The choice to remain great is a conscious choice, as Burlingham explains in this book. To retain control of an idea and mission in business is to do what is right by your customers, suppliers and most importantly your employees. I was fascinated by the lengths at which companies described in this book chose proximity to their values over the financial rewards of size. The book explores the trials and tribulations in this pursuit, but also the logic of making that choice. This book is ideal for those wanting to create businesses that focus on delivering more than just a product. It's for those wanting to create something of value for themselves and the wider community. It inspires the reader to develop a business that genuinely helps everyone involved rather than just the owner.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
