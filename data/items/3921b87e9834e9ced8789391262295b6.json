  "description": "<div>This year Faber and Faber started the project of republishing the late Nobel Laureate William Golding's back catalogue -- starting with <em>Pincher Martin</em>, <em>The Inheritors </em>and <em>The Spire</em>. Sam is joined by his daughter Judy Golding -- author of <em>The Children of Lovers: A Memoir of William Golding By His Daughter</em>-- to talk about Golding the writer and Golding the man. What were the deep fears that drove his work and were eased by drink? How did the war change his worldview? And what was the nature of the religious sensibility that underpinned his visionary allegories of folly and evil?</div>\n",
