  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, support for individual liberty is dead! Mathematical models are flawed, scientists get things wrong and presuming that Americans wouldn't mitigate on their own is erroneous. Using Italy as an example, or China's approach as a model for mitigation is also inappropriate given how unique the U.S is and the steps they took to mitigate since January. Preparedness is our responsibility. Then, fiscal conservatism is dead! We just passed a stimulus bill that isn't stimulating anything. Printing money only attacks our currency because it prompts inflation and weakens our dollar. We must not sacrifice our liberty to fight any virus — we will beat the virus and we must keep our liberty. Later, if the Democrats had their way we'd still be conducting an impeachment trial with endless witnesses. Yet the Trump Administration was taking the necessary precautions to safeguard America from the Wuhan Chinese virus. Afterward, it's concerning that a liberal Democrat from Goldman Sachs and the Hollywood film industry, Steve Mnuchin is now the defacto czar of the American economy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
