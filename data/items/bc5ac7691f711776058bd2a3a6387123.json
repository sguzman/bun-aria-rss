  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about snakes in the PlayStore's walled garden (one of them with a helpful flashlight, and another one with a plumber's cap and a mustache, which must look pretty odd on a serpent). A look at how cyber gangs communicate—they do it a lot like the rest of us. Source code distribution and the jokers who make annoying use of it. More troubling reports about an IPO-ready unicorn. The Johns Hopkins University’s Joe Carrigan explains limitations of fingerprint scanners. Amit Rahav from Secret Double Octopus describes innovations in authentication. Plus, what information do your products collect about you? And how do you know what the vendors are doing with it?",
