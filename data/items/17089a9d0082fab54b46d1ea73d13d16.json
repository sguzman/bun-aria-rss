  "description": "<p>During World War II, Henry Beecher, an anesthesiologist serving in the U.S. Army, noticed that 32% of the soldiers he treated for horrific battle wounds felt no pain. A further 44% experienced only slight or mild discomfort, despite the fact they had shrapnel embedded in their bodies. Beecher hypothesized that the euphoria of surviving battle resulted in the release of a natural painkiller. When morphine was running low in Europe, Beecher thought he could harness the mind’s seeming ability to produce natural painkillers in a different way by injecting soldiers who were about to undergo surgery with a simple saline solution, while telling the soldiers they were receiving morphine. About 90% of these patients underwent the surgery with little or no pain.</p><p>Beecher’s field-expedient placebo treatments would go on to open up decades of research into the power of our expectations.

David and I begin our conversation with how and why the brain operates as a prediction machine, and how the expectations it generates can shape the reality we experience. We then discuss how even when someone’s pain or condition is very real, the placebo effect can have an equally real effect on their physiology — even when people know they’re taking a placebo. We also get into the “nocebo effect,” where your expectation that a drug will have negative side effects, in fact produces those side effects. From there we turn to how the expectation effect has powerful results beyond the medical world, and shows up in the areas of sleep, diet, and fitness, including how thinking of doing chores as exercise actually increases the health benefits of that activity, how reframing your anxiety can turn it into a performance-enhancing boost, and how your perception of getting older hugely affects how you will actually physically and mentally age.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li>Some of the studies mentioned in the show:<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5113234/\">Open-label placebo treatment in chronic low back pain</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32766465/\">Conditioning open-label placebo: a pilot pharmacobehavioral approach for opioid dose reduction and pain control</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425538/\">Mind-set matters: exercise and the placebo effect</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150226/\">Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/get-better-sleep/\">AoM Podcast #661: Get Better Sleep by Stressing About It Less</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/reframing-for-resilience/\">AoM Article: Reframe for Resilience</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With David Robson</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://davidrobson.me/\">David’s Website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/d_a_robson\">David on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/05/710uncAw8cL.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" />\n",
