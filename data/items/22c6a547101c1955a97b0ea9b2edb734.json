We'll also explore specific tips and strategies from our conversations related to how they think about travel, how they personally travel, and the role that travel can play in your life. This includes conversations with:Vagabonding author Rolf Potts about seeing the world now rather than waiting until some vague \"later\" that might never happen.My friend Kevin Rose about hiding tattoos in foreign lands and getting by without knowing the local language.Phil Keoghan from The Amazing Race about a life-changing epiphany earned while shipwreck diving.Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly about favorite travel tools and gadgets on our trip through the mountains of Uzbekistan.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode of The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour!\n\nThis episode is brought to you by LinkedIn and its job recruitment platform, which offers a smarter system for the hiring process.

Over 42 years, he's built Bridgewater into what Fortune considers the fifth most important private company in the US.\n\nAlong the way, Ray took tons of notes on what worked and what didn't work. These were adapted over time for training purposes within his company, and then further refined for the world at large as Principles.
