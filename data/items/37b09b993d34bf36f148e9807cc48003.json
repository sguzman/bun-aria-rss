  "description": "Our guest today Emily C. Butler is a New York City-based interior designer. Her work has been featured in House Beautiful as well as multiple design books such as Elements Of Family Style written by one of our favorite podcast guests, Erin Gates. Emily’s signature style is beautifully grounded in tradition with a modern lightness. She has a particular flair for doing big designs in small spaces by bringing her big “Texas vibes”. We talk about how she does that, her use of color, her love of fabrics, and more!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nHow did Emily get started in design?\n\nEmily describes her style and how her use of color stands out in NYC.\n\nHow Emily manages to fit a lot of style into a small space.\n\nWhat are some tips for setting up a small space?\n\nTips for the “drop zone” for keys, mail, etc.\n\nEmily loves to use wallpaper and fabrics in her designs.\n\nHow Emily uses fun lighting like lamps and sconces in her design.\n\nDetails of the Upper East Side Apartment designed for a family.\n\nWhat is Emily working on now?\n\nHow we use vintage finds in design.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Tara,\nThis is definitely an open space and I see some beautiful marble-type floors. The two cabinets you are referring to seem to be competing with one another because one is for the TV and the other is a China cabinet. I would maybe move the media cabinet against the long wall even though it’s in the pathway. There is a lot of circulation to consider in this apartment and this room is a pathway to multiple spaces. I agree the rug is a little small for the space and it’s also contrasting too much with the floor color so I would go with something more neutral. There is definitely room for more seating in the space; maybe even a pair of ergonomic chairs placed together. You could probably get an L-shaped configuration of seating going if you also add a loveseat and move the China cabinet out. Neutrals can be a little tricky and I see multiple whites in the space so adding some textures could help and add to the beachy theme. Something like a seagrass rug could be great. Where the dark chandelier is, I would suggest sticking with the theme of having a nod to the beach and adding texture with natural material. Once you remove the China cabinet it might not feel as formal in there and this would be a good space for something more natural and casual.\nGood luck, Tara! This is a gorgeous space and please send us the after photos\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nEmily C. Butler\n\nEmily C.
