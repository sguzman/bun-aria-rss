As we gear up for football season in the office it is with great sadness we have to announce that The Pod will now be cut DAHN to only one episode a week. The boys jump right into the Pod FOD, which is a folder compiled of all things around the internet. Today’s FOD includes a “What if” the Marvel series was casted in the ’90’s, Connor’s latest mistress, for the first time ever a live news break, and much much more.
