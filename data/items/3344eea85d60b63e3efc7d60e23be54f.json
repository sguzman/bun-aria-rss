  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the 10-year, $93 million contract Clemson awarded its football coach, Dabo Swinney. The coach had previously said college football players shouldn't be paid, as it would, in his mind, go too far in destroying the sport's amateur model. Also talked about is the NFL Draft, which once again drew record viewership and in-person attendance. The NFL said the draft reached 47.5 million viewers with 600,000 fans in attendance in Nashville. Also discussed is former NBA player Rick Fox's decision to sell the shares of his esports team over what he said was a shareholder's use of racist language. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
