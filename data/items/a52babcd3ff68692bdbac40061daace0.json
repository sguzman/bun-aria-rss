Yet my soul drew back,\nGuilty of dust and sin.\nBut quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack\nFrom my first entrance in,\nDrew nearer to me, sweetly questioning\nIf I lacked anything.\n\n‘A guest,’ I answered, ‘worthy to be here.’\nLove said, ‘You shall be he.’\n‘I the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear,\nI cannot look on thee.’\nLove took my hand, and smiling did reply,\n‘Who made the eyes but I?’\n\n‘Truth Lord; but I have marred them; let my shame\nGo where it doth deserve.’\n‘And know you not,’ says Love, ‘who bore the blame?’\n‘My dear, then I will serve.’\n‘You must sit down,’ says Love, ‘and taste my meat:’\nSo I did sit and eat.",
