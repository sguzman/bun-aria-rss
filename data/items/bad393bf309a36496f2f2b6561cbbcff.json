  "description": "Our audiobook this week is BREW LOVE by Piper Rayne\n\nI’ve lived in the small town of Sunrise Bay, Alaska, my entire adult life. I have a successful business, great friends, and a community I feel a part of. I never felt like I was missing… well, anything.\n\nUntil the day Craig walks into my coffee shop, The Grind. Then he jogs by my coffee shop—shirtless. That was when I knew I was in trouble. Not only was he a nice guy, but he also had a killer body—a by-product of his job as a trainer to MMA fighters, I guess.\n\nWhen he asks me out, I’m flattered, but the man is almost ten years my junior and only a temporary resident of this town. But flattery gets you everywhere, as they say, and in this case, it got him into my bed.\n\nIt’s all fun between us until I start to wonder if we could possibly make this last.\n\nEnter Giveaway: https://bit.ly/3ycYbVT\n\nOther Mentioned Books:\nJisa Dean: https://amzn.to/2SNuDxF\nFifty Shades Audio: https://amzn.to/3wa650n\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
