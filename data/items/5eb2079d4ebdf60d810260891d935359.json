  "description": "<p>Bryce Klehm is an associate editor at <em>Lawfare</em>. Max Johnston is a creative producer at Goat Rodeo. Together, they are the creators of <em>Lawfare</em> and Goat Rodeo’s newest podcast series, <em>Allies</em>, which launched on Monday and covers the history of the Special Immigrant Visa Program in Afghanistan. It's an amazing story. It covers a lot of time, a lot of action and a lot of people, all through the lens of the efforts—legislative and administrative—to get visas for Afghan translators to come to the United States to protect them from Taliban retaliation. Benjamin Wittes sat down with Bryce and Max to talk about the creation of the podcast, and how you take a wonky visa program and turn it into drama. Following the conversation, we’re bringing you the entirety of Episode One of <em>Allies</em>. </p><p>Learn more and subscribe to&nbsp;<em>Allies</em>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/1619035873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://pod.link/1619035873</a>.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
