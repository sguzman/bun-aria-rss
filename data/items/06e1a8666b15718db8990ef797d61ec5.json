    "media:description": "Few genres have had the lasting impact of punk. 1976 is one of those seismic dividing lines in popular music. A history destroying year zero. The point after which everything changed. It was the year that The Ramones debut was released, the year that the first singles from the UK Punk scene were set loose upon an unprepared public. And while the punks wanted to remove themselves from the past, burn all that had come before, nothing happens within a vacuum. These bands didn't appear out of nowhere with the key principles of the genre locked in place. This innovative minimalist, three-chords and the truth, turbo-powered rebellious music had to have precedent. There were other artists that lead up to this era-defining moment in music that are either forgotten, ignored or not given credit. This is how Punk became punk.\n\n#Punk #PunkHistory #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking and Additional Writing by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:00 Before 1964: How Protopunk Became Protopunk\n06:33 The British Invasion\n10:00 Los Saicos\n10:56 US Garage Rock \n16:20 The Velvet Underground\n17:56 The MC5\n19:14 The Stooges\n20:53 Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band\n22:20 UK Protopunk\n24:32 Glam Rock\n29:29 US Regional Protopunk\n33:39 New York & CBGB's\n37:46 Pub Rock\n39:45 The Saints\n40:44 Sex Pistols\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
