  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Face masks have served as the pervasive and omnipresent symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether you’re on a plane, on a coffee run, or at a school, it seems as if masks are a new part of our society at large. But what does the data actually say about mask efficacy? Can wearing a mask actually reduce transmission or infection from viruses?</p> <p class=\"p1\">On this episode of The Model Health Show, we’re diving back into the studies on mask effectiveness, including the safety of cloth masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks. We’re taking a thorough assessment of the data, discussing various types of scientific studies, and cross-referencing the data. You’re going to hear about new studies, studies that have proven the test of time, as well as studies that are commonly cited.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">You’re going to learn the truth about mask efficacy, including different types of masks in different settings. We’re also discussing how human biases can cloud the truth, and how the debate around masks has prevented us from addressing other pressing issues.
