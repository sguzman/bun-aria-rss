  "description": "Are you ready to see your life go to a new level? Then it’s time to walk in greater humility. It takes humility to overlook an insult, to let somebody else be right for the sake of peace, and to not have your way all the time. But if you want to have strong flourishing relationships, Joel will show you how to walk in greater levels of self-control and honor those God has placed in your life. First Peter 5:6 teaches us, “Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, in due time He will exalt you.” When you walk in humility, you will see more of God’s blessings in your life! You’ll come into that due season where God does more than you can ask or think.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
