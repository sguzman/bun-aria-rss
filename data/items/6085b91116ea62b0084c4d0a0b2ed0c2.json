  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WPHT Radio Host, Rich Zeoli, fills in for Mark. Democrats are in disarray and the progressives are waging an intra-party civil war, so the only thing left to do is issue themselves a blue-state tax break by reinstituting the State And Local Tax deduction (S.A.L.T.). Then, despite the massive losses from Tuesday's election, the Democrats have upped the ante and are calling even more Americans racists. The democrat's trade here is the SALT deduction in exchange for the vote of Democrat members of Congress, from moderate districts, to vote for President Biden's Build back Better bill. Later, when federal law enforcement becomes weaponized by corrupt individuals in the government to advance their own political agenda, we have a police state. It’s again been revealed with the arrest of Igor Danchenko that all of the Russian collusion materials were fabricated and had no basis in truth. The phony dossier was created by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, the Democrat National Committee, their lawyers, and freelance spies Igor Danchenko, Christopher Steele, and Charles Dolan, whom they hired to pull it all together. Afterward, Democrats are sour over the \"Let's Go, Brandon\" chants, memes, and songs that they fixate on calling parents racists. Anyone that disagrees with their positions on critical race theory is labeled a racist even if they're black.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
