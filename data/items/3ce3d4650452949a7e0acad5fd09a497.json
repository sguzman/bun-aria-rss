  "description": "This could be anything, such as your Thanksgiving, your Hanukkah, your Christmas, New Years, whatever it is that you guys believe in and want to celebrate. It’s just a way of making our homes feel more welcoming. For us in Utah, it’s cooling down in December and we’re gathering and getting warmer, and celebrating all these things in these cold months, and so your home obviously follows suit and we get more layers. So we’re going to talk about that and some of our favorite holiday traditions, and ways to just make your house merrier. <br /><br />Favorite traditions 1:34<br />What kind of trees we have 12:38<br />The garlands 17:52<br />Favorite candle 19:41<br />Evergreen ornaments 21:56<br />Decorating bedrooms 27:33<br />Favorite gifts to give 28:27<br /><br />“One of my most favorite trees that I’ve ever seen is when we went into a client’s home and she had this incredible property and this beautiful, tall, skinny, gorgeous live tree, and it was just white lights and hundreds of these glass crystal ornaments, icicles.
