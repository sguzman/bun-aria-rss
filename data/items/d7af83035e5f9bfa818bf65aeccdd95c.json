  "description": "Perry Farrell is the creative force behind Jane’s Addiction, Porno for Pyros, and the Lollapalooza festival, but while talking with Marc, it’s clear a lot of Perry's focus these days is on being a dad. Perry sees the parallels in how he was angry at his family as a teenager and how his relationship with his own teenage son is evolving. Also, Perry’s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, gets on the mic with him to talk about their collaborative project Kind Heaven, which is an album, a community event and, they hope, much more. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/baskets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baskets on FX</a>, <a href=\"http://turo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turo</a>, <a href=\"http://allbirds.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allbirds</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZipRecruiter Job Search app</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
