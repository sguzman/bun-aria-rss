  "description": "<p>The penultimate drawing for the VFW live show is complete, which means only 11 more lucky souls will be granted admission to this most exclusive live show. Intern Justin took a trip to Marty Mile, but his aversion to getting robbed and smelling human feces means only disappointment and anger for Kirk (0:31:00). A sports talk radio great has joined Kirk's effort to get Bruce Springsteen on the show. Kind of (0:52:30). Kirk attempts to call into WEEI, leading to a few minutes of The Kirk & Mut Show (0:57:30). Steve from Providence has agreed to undertake the perilous journey from Providence to Northampton in exchange for admission to the VFW live show; S.A.L.G. has some thoughts on that (1:15:30). The show concludes with the indisputably grossest segment in show history.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
