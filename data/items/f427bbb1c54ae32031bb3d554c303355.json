  "description": "<p>On Episode 36, the guys goof on the debacle that is the NHL Awards broadcast, chat about the winners, discuss the Las Vegas Golden Knights expansion draft bounty, talk about the exuberance surrounding the NHL christening Las Vegas as a pro sports city, and yap about a bunch of other stuff. Boston Bruins defenseman Torey Krug joins the show to talk about his road to the NHL and how it almost didn't happen, playing with Zdeno Chara, why he chose Boston over 29 other cities, what he loves about the city, the stigma about undersized players, his second place Norris Trophy vote, and much more. The show closes with #AllRightHamilton questions from listeners.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
