  "description": "<p>Today I’m talking with Allison Askew of Arrow J Beef Co., a first-generation rancher with a lot of irons in a lot of fires. She’s sharing her inspiring story of unconventional homesteading to encourage everyone who doesn’t feel like they fit in any one particular box. If you ever feel like you’re wearing too many hats to actually be good at any one thing, take heart. If you're overwhelmed, or tired of feeling like you're not understood by those around you, Allison has some words of wisdom just for you.<br/><br/>Want to know more about the sustainable, reusable canning lids I mentioned in this episode, and stop worrying about unforeseen shortages that could happen again this summer?
