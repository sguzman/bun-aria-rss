  "description": "Democrat teachers unions backed school lockdowns that had dire consequence for children. New York Times story: The pandemic erased two decades of progress in math and reading. The results of a national test showed just how devastating the last two years have been for 9-year-old schoolchildren, especially the most vulnerable. Worst performers could take decades to rebound and affect economy in the future. Buck says, \"They ruined millions of children's futures because they're cowards and they're partisans and they won't admit it to this day.\" FDA authorizes updated boosters from Pfizer and Moderna, without adequate testing. Clay predicts adults will avoid these, like they are for their kids now, \"And so this is more of our taxpayer dollars just being flushed down the toilet, effectively, because people are over it, and they know that it doesn't work very well.\" Will the media return their awards for fake news stories? And the winner of the best Eddie Murphy movie is...? (Buck says he thinks the voting may have been rigged!)<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
