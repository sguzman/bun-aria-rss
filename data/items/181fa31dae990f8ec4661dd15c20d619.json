  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Jax by Tory Baker\n\nJax Griffith has been a dick to Sloane Watson from the moment he walked into the shop where she works.|\nJax is a friend of the owner, but that’s not why he keeps coming back to the store.\nThere’s just something about Sloane that keeps getting his attention.\nThe problem is, she’s way too young. He’s fourteen years older and that’s a hell of an age gap. He may want her, but Sloane needs to see the world and experience life.\nLogically Jax knows that, but he can’t stop thinking about her, dreaming about her, wanting her.\nEventually, Sloane tempts him way too much. When Jax finally gets his head out of his ass, will she even give him a chance? Or will she walk away?\n\nMore Tory Baker Books\nAmazon » https://amzn.to/3bNZfGk\nFOX » https://amzn.to/2Q9dYU7 \nCRUZ » https://amzn.to/30NpBSQ\nRMR » https://bit.ly/30NMCos\n\nMentioned Book\nGet a Life, Chloe Brown by Talia Hibbert\nCaveman Instinct Series by Hazel Gower\n\nBook Club\nYou Had Me at Hola by Alexis Daria\n\nOther Mentions\nhttps://www.thekey2free.org/\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
