  "description": "<p>Theaters have always shared a special place in history. We crave to be entertained and many of us desire to entertain. Theaters are a place of strong emotions, both those played out by actors and those evoked in the audience. Paranormal activity feeds off of those kinds of emotions. The Capitol Theater was built in the center of Salt Lake City and has entertained Utahans for more than a hundred years. Tragedy has been a part of the Capitol Theater's history as well and that has helped add to the theater's reputation as being a haunted location. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Capitol Theater! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features the Spruce Goose and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features the birth of Belle Boyd. This location was suggested by listener Sue Story and the Research Assistant was Ren Davenport.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-123-capitol-theater.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-123-capitol-theater.html</a></p> <p>Become an intregal part of the show and be rewarded at the same time: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Catch Diane's story that she wrote for The Lift Podcast: <a href=\"http://victoriaslift.com/s1e13/\">http://victoriaslift.com/s1e13/</a></p> <p> </p>",
