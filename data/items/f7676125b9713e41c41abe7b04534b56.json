Jared Carrabis is on his way to an epic showdown with Pitching Ninja. The New York Times has had to retract a major podcast about ISIS that turned out to be a real Kevin Cullen job. Intern Justin comes up with an excuse for missing yesterday's show. We're back in Boston on Monday.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
