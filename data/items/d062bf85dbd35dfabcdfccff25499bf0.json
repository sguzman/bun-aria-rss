  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I had a very intense encounter with an angry Sasquatch in 2007. It completely changed who I am.</p> <p>For the better part of 11 years I’ve done armchair research on the subject and just recently went back into the woods. I’ve only heard one encounter that comes close to what happened to me that day, not that I think it hasn’t happened to anyone else but that it has and they’re just not coming forward like me. I’d like to tell my story and share my experience with you.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and he said “I never believed in bigfoot, I didn’t care about the subject. If they existed it was a Pacific Northwest problem in my mind. The day I was turkey hunting in Mississippi changed my life. I saw what I thought was a black guy walking towards me. An African American family owned most of the land around that hunting lease so I assumed it was my neighbor. As this thing got closer I realized it was not a human. This thing was massive, it went nuts. It was looking at me, I saw everything. I reached for my gun and that is when it went really crazy. It knew what that gun was, no doubt in my mind and it was not happy I was reaching for it. I thought for sure I was going to die.”</p>",
