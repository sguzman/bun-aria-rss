With Travis' impending time in the Z06 we of course discuss that and the potential of its new 8 speed automatic. But we also touch on Top Gear, launching an M4 via a 5\" curb, many bad Bob Dylan jokes, an update on Matt's Lexus LS400 and <a href=\"https://vine.co/xpacNino\">Nino's new status as a Vine celebrity</a>.</p>\n",
