  "description": "<p>This is a very special episode of our podcast. Today Tim and Jon talk with N.T. Wright, a well-known biblical scholar. Wright has heavily influenced many areas of theology, especially through his work outlining the Apostle Paul.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wright outlines his childhood and his original introduction to the Bible (0:00-9:40). Dr. Wright discusses Paul’s mindset as a Jew, especially before his transformation on the road to Damascus (9:40-18:20).</p>\n<p>Dr. Wright explains what he thinks happened to Paul on the road to Damascus. He thinks Paul was meditating on the vision in Ezekiel 1 while on the road. He also explains what he thinks happens during the decade after Paul’s transformation. Dr. Wright also mentions that it’s unusual that Paul never returns to Tarsus in Acts (18:20-31:50).</p>\n<p>Dr. Wright then discusses Paul’s balance between being loyal to his Jewish roots but also believing that the Jews and their God were supposed to be a blessing to all the nations. Dr. Wright says that for Paul, the whole point of the Gospel was to give Abraham his single worldwide family and that through the Jews, God would redeem all humanity. Paul believes that ultimately all people are God’s people, not just the Jews (31:50-end).</p>\n<p>Show Produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Tim Mackie, Jon Collins, Matthew Halbert-Howen</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nOur video on Paul in Acts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVAbkINtRU<br />\nPaul: A Biography, N.T Wright.</p>\n<p>N.T.
