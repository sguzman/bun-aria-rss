  "description": "<p>Liz Dong is two things that usually don’t go together - an undocumented immigrant AND an evangelical Christian.  She’s also a immigrant advocate with World Relief, as well as a member of the Evangelical Immigration Table.  Having read a piece she wrote for Time Magazine, we invited Liz to stop by the studio and talk about her life story and the issues involving DACA, immigration and the church.  Plus, we pause for a moment to remember Hugh Hefner.  Okay - that was long enough.</p>",
