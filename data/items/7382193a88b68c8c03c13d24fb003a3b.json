  "description": "Click here for the the full episode, including an extended interview with Larry Wilkerson on why the FBI is tailing him and why others don’t stand up to the machine.\nLarry Wilkerson, former US Army Colonel and high-ranking member of Bush’s White House as Colin Powell’s chief of staff, has spent his post-government career criticizing our war-mongering policies.\nWilkerson discusses the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the US response from an inside-the-government perspective: He’s worked with Biden and understands his motives. He knows the US oligarchs whose wallets will be hurt if Russian oligarchs are hit. He’s been through the army and Washington and understands why the current strategy isn’t designed to help anyone but the US.\nSo we think he’s a good person to listen to. We also think that may be why the FBI is suddenly following him around.\nAnd, it seems that Wilkerson’s advice on drone strike information doubles as a pretty good characterization of some of the politicians in power today:\n“Your intelligence is never as good as you think it is.”\nPlus, Dems are ripping up the shelters of the unhoused while Republicans are having cocaine orgies. Oh yeah, and @usefulidiotpod is now #truthing on Truth Social.\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots. Check it out.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
