  "description": "<p>Shane Corson, Woody and I sit down and interview Dr. John A. Bindernagel. Dr. Bindernagel is a wildlife biologist who has sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled \"North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch.\" Dr. Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975 largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings. Over the years, he has collected casts of tracks that he believes belongs to Bigfoot. He also claims to have heard the creature near Comox Lake in 1992, comparing its whooping sound to that of a chimpanzee. Bindernagel believes that the Bigfoot phenomena should receive more attention from serious scientists, but has remarked, \"The evidence doesn't get scrutinized objectively. We can't bring the evidence to our colleagues because it's perceived as tabloid.\"</p> <p>We also interview Peter Byrne who has led the life most of us can only dream about. Share his many adventures in India with tiger, elephant, and leopard, and see how a fortuitous championing of a member of the ruling elite of Nepal during a bar brawl prompted Peter to move to Nepal and become a professional hunter there. Move with him to Nepal where he was, for years, the only authorized professional hunter to operate in that country. In the unspoiled wilderness of the White Grass Plains area of Nepal, where there were virtually no roads and the natives did not even know the name of the capital of the country.</p> <p>The final interview was with Rhettman A. Mullis, Jr., PhD-ABD, CAF, MHP (USA), Academic and Field Researcher, Founder and Lead Researcher for \"Sasquatch Investigations and Research: Bigfoot and Bigfootology,\" and Contributing Writer and Editor: Bigfootology.</p>",
