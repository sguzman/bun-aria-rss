  "description": "<p>Cheese makes the world go ‘round. Or, at the very least, cheese often comes in rounds, and we’d go to the ends of the earth to get our hands on some good cheese. In this episode, we take you on a journey through the world of cheese, going around the globe and back again to your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. We spend some time with an English cheesemaker, we talk with a local TJ’s Crew Member who loves cheese as much as we do, and we learn about which wines pair best with certain cheeses, and we find out about a few special cheeses you’ll find in our stores during the holiday season.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode20-Transcript.pdf\"> Episode 20 Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
