  "description": "<p>Las Vegas has always been considered \"Sin City\" because of the permissiveness of what most people consider to be sin like gambling, sex, drinking, prostitution and much more. Las Vegas was a warm retreat for gangsters at one time and some of those gangsters helped Vegas to become the city it is today. People driving towards Las Vegas witness the glow on the horizon from all the neon lights that sparks the imagination. What child hasn't sat stunned in the car watching all the blinking lights? This place is the capital of entertainment and a good time. Las Vegas plays host to more than just the living though. A city caught up in this much emotion is the perfect setting for ghostly activity. Today we explore just two of the places that are reportedly haunted. The Flamingo and Bally's have interesting histories that have led them to be rumored to be haunted. Get out your tokens and loosen up that arm for some one on one with a one armed bandit as we venture into the casinos of Vegas. Moment in Oddity features the Case of Dr. Lemberger and This Day in History features John Jay as first Chief Justice.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-71-flamingo-ballys.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-71-flamingo-ballys.html</a></p> <p>If you enjoy the show, consider supporting us monetarily.
