  "description": "Si Robertson was a football phenom back in the day, and oh, does he have stories. After reliving the near-death experience of going up against Steve \"The Bear\" Jones, Si, Martin, JD, and Phillip play a game of what-ifs. What if prime Muhammad Ali got in the ring with prime Mike Tyson? Who would win if Jack Nicklaus took on Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan took on Kobe Bryant? Could Walker, Texas Ranger beat Marshal Matt Dillon in a fight? And most importantly, would Si rather fight one Martin-sized duck or 100 duck-sized Martins? The boys try to come up with the toughest man who ever lived, and they debate which quarterback is the GOAT: Drew Brees or Tom Brady. Si also attempts to name a fan's baby and shares his advice on raising a daughter.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
