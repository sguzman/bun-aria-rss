  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, WREC radio host Ben Ferguson fills in and provides some reflection on why Joe Biden intentionally left out any mentions of the 77th anniversary of D-Day. The days of mutual respect are gone in the Democrat Party, now they pursue a weakened America and expect the public to rely on the government for food, water, and bread. The way you change a country in one generation is by ignoring the significance of historical events where one's countryman sacrificed their lives in service to America. The extreme left has become the mainstream Democrat Party. Then, Kamala Harris has flown to Guatemala and joined their President to warn Guatemalans to not come to the United States. Harris discouraged illegal immigration despite abandoning the border states where she has ignored the border crisis. Harris has still not flown to the border. Later, federal prosecutors have subpoenaed material related to Andrew Cuomo's book. They are interested in information related to nursing homes. Afterward, the media is now blaming former President Trump for their own failure to cover the lab leak story that Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton suggested early on. The media called virus skeptics crazy conspiratorial \"Trumpers\" and those actions benefited communist China, not the United States. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
