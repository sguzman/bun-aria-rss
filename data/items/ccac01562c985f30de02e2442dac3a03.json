  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emma Willman and I talk about women. What they like. And a loooooot about what they don’t like. It was a funny conversation that I really could only have with a chick who dates chicks. Emma’s standup is hilarious and she’s constantly ranting about how much girls annoy her. I’m sure you guys have your own gripes. Feel free to let me know about them.</span></p> <p><strong>FOR MORE ARI: </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.arishaffir.com/tour/\">Upcoming shows & tickets</a></p> <p>Check out Ari's Patreon for exclusive extra content from this episode with Emma Willmann: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/arishaffir\">Patreon with Emma Willmann</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/arishaffir/\">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/arimerch\">Merch</a></p> <p><strong>FOR MORE EMMA:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/emmawillmann/\">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamemmawillmann\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.iamemmawillmann.com/\">Upcoming shows & more</a></p> <p>Listen to Inside The Closet with Emma and Matteo Lane: <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-the-closet/id1276618551\"> Inside the Closet on Apple Podcasts</a></p> <p>The Music:</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hate Women - Marco Paloma</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">99 Problems - Jay-Z</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Girls - Beastie Boys</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">James Brown - Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This Year</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Thank you to our sponsors!</strong> Go to BetterHelp.com/Ari for 10% off your first month of counseling, and head to 3Chi.com and use code \"Skeptic\" for 5% off your order of Delta 8 products.</span></p>",
