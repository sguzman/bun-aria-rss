But with my schedule, it can be tough to carve out quality outdoor time. So as we hit the end of summer in the U.S., I set a challenge for myself — to get outside every day during the week. And as a member of the Google Assistant team, I knew Assistant could help give me that extra nudge out the door. Here’s how it went.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"3kgim\">Monday</h3><p data-block-key=\"cutk6\">After a full day of meetings at the office, I needed to clear my head. Instead of just heading home like I normally would, I asked my Assistant, <b>“Hey Google, what parks are nearby?”</b> It showed a handful of options near me. I ended up heading to Murphey Candler Park, one of my favorites in Atlanta, for a long walk to help me recharge my batteries.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"Trees and rocks surround a large, glistening lake.\" class=\"article-image--medium\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_6751_4.24.40_PM.max-500x500.jpg\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_6751_4.24.40_PM.max-1000x1000.jpg\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_6751_4.24.40_PM.max-100x100.jpg \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"q6d9b\">Murphey Candler Park in Atlanta was one of the nearby park options Assistant shared with me.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"xe5ws\">Tuesday</h3><p data-block-key=\"24gag\">I typically work out on Tuesdays, so in the spirit of my outdoor challenge, I decided to go for a swim. To help keep me accountable and on schedule, I told my Assistant, <b>\"Hey Google, remind me to go for a swim at 5 p.m.\"</b> When I got that 5 p.m. nudge, I packed up for the day and headed to the pool at my apartment complex.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"A pool with white lounge chairs underneath a brick apartment building.\" class=\"article-image--medium\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/brighter_pool_2_X2pP9g4.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/brighter_pool_2_X2pP9g4.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/brighter_pool_2_X2pP9g4.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"b8fw6\">I took my Tuesday workout to the pool, thanks to a helpful reminder from my Assistant.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"xe5ws\">Wednesday</h3><p data-block-key=\"n1kb\">During a walk around my neighborhood, I started thinking about my weekend plans. The weather forecast showed that Saturday was going to be particularly beautiful, so I texted my friends to see if they’d be up for a picnic. After we agreed on a place and time, I said to my Assistant <b>“Hey Google, add</b> <b>‘picnic with friends’ to my calendar for Saturday at 4 p.m.”</b> to make sure it was blocked on my schedule.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"cgu6a\">Thursday</h3><p data-block-key=\"chboo\">One of the things I love most about working at Google is celebrating work anniversaries, or what we call “Googleversaries.” My friend Akilah hit her third Googleversary on Thursday, so we headed to the pool after work to celebrate. For an extra treat (and to cool off), we decided to get some ice cream — but we didn’t want to lose our poolside spot. This was the perfect opportunity to try out our new Assistant feature with Uber Eats. With a quick, “<b>Hey Google, order ice cream on Uber Eats</b>,” Assistant opened my Uber Eats app to show us nearby delivery options and let us customize our order. Soon enough, our ice cream was on its way.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"A hand holding a pint of cookies and cream ice cream.

She’s an avid hiker and is always looking for someone to explore new trails with. So as I was packing up at the office, I told my Assistant <b>“Hey Google, text Jessica, ‘Let’s go hiking.’”</b> We did a three-mile, scenic hike on the East Palisades Trail — a great way to wrap up the week and my outdoor challenge.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"uber eats gif\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/screen-20220804-134645_2.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"The text “Text Jessica let’s go hiking” appears on a mobile phone with a black background.\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"8uzqh\">Assistant can help you easily send a text, especially when you have your hands full.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"xe5ws\">These Google Assistant features made it easy to stick to my goal of getting outside every day, and they’re continuing to help me soak up the rest of the summer.
