  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, the Democrat majority in the house has voted to table an impeachment effort against President Trump by a margin of 332 no votes to 95 yes votes. Apart from these constant political charades, what issues have they solved for America? Their counterparts in the media continue parading around disgusting Nazi's like Richard Spencer, in order to play guilt by association and smear Trump. Meanwhile, Rand Paul's foreign policy is indistinguishable from the likes of Rep Ilhan Omar. Paul is asking Trump to consider him for a sensitive diplomatic mission. This is an attempt by Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, to get Trump to fire National Security advisor, John Bolton, over his support for the crippling economic sanctions that the U.S has placed on Iran. These aggressive sanctions against the largest state sponsor of terror are the only means the U.S has to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Then, Ilhan Omar doesn't renounce the anti-Semitic BDS movement but she renounces President Trump and our country. Later, in breaking news and as predicted by this program, the federal probe into Trump's \"hush money\" payments as campaign finance violations has ended according to Judge Pauley (Clinton-appointee). Like the pseudo-event that was the Mueller Report, these attacks against Trump are the greatest scandal ever led by the media.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
