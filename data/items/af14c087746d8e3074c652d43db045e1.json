  "title": "#377: Her Name Was Mariah Alvarez - Part 1",
  "description": "<p>In Harlingen, Texas on February 17, 2007, two year old Mariah Alvarez died of blunt force trauma to the head. Her small body was covered with bruises, possible bite marks, her arm had a spiral fracture and her spine and internal organs had also been injured. Mariah's mother Melissa Lucio said that Mariah died from an accidental fall down a staircase. Authorities said Melissa beat her own daughter to death. A jury agreed. Melissa received a death sentence in 2008. Fast forward to 2022, with Melissa's execution date approaching, public outcry stayed her death for now. Her defense is asking for a new trial to present evidence that was ignored by her previous counsel. But can we ever get to the truth? Was there fairness in the charge and investigation into Mariah's death?
