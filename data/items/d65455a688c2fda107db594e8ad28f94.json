A group of Georgians rose up against their German overlords on the Dutch island of Texel.

In just a few hours, they massacred some 400 German officers using knives and bayonets to avoid raising the alarm. </p><br><p>Hitler urged retaliation and it wasn't until 12 days after war had ended that Canadian forces landed on the island and finally put an end to the slaughter.
