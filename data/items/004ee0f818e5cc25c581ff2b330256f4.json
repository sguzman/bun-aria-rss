  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, KARN radio host Doc Washburn fills in. After referring to his notes, President Biden says that there are 17 million more people vaccinated than there actually are in the country. This, from the same president who wrongly said that 150 million Americans had been killed by \"gun violence\" last year. Then, in Pittsburgh, government-funded scientists sought out aborted minority babies for research. Some of these babies are born alive and begs the question of whether this is even legal. A FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request has revealed that Anthony Fauci funded millions of dollars for research on beagles that infected the dogs and then euthanized them. According to the White Coat Waste Project, the dogs suffered painfully when injected with an experimental agent. Later, Rhode Island teachers unions are suing a parent for trying to stop gender theory and critical race theory from being taught in her child's school. The parent responded, \"Game on!\" Afterward, some American generals like Mark Milley are focused on spreading wokiesm more than they are in ending insurgencies.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
