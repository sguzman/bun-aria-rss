  "description": "In Immigrants Against the State: Yiddish and Italian Anarchism in America (University of Illinois, 2015), Kenyon Zimmer, Assistant Professor of History at the University of Texas, Arlington, examines the anarchist movements and ideas of immigrants to the United States from the 1880’s through the 1940’s. Using sources in half a dozen different languages, Zimmer builds an in-depth picture of these movements’ achievements and challenges. This book is a definitive transnational history of working-class immigrant radicalism, which suggests that anarchist ideas are very much still relevant today.\n\n\n\nMax Kaiser is a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne.
