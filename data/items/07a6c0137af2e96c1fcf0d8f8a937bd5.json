  "description": "This month's bonus episode was recorded live in Denver, where the gals may or may not have taken the phrase \"Mile High City\" a little too seriously. Topics include Lucy's favorite euphemisms, a bunch of stealing stoners, and the attempted assassination of the king of reggae, Bob Marley. Grab your lighter and a can of Infinite Monkey Theorem Ros√©, turn on your lava lamp, and tune in for Mile High Crimes.",
