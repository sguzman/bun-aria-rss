The coding, obviously, but also a whole lot of the product side as well.</p>\n\n<p>If that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s not working. Again, maybe there are other factors that I&#8217;m not aware of, but to me this reads as not having a clear product vision and solid designers as part of product teams.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/google-is-getting-left-behind-due-to-horrible-ui-ux/\">I ranted about with Google&#8217;s management interfaces</a>, the interfaces seem completely oblivious to how people will actually use the products. So they fail.</p><div class=\"inline-auto-newsletter\"><div class=\"inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b\">\n<div class=\"text-lg font-bold\">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>\n<div class=\"text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg\">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>\n<div class=\"mt-2\"><form action=\"https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=49fdb7d723\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline\" novalidate > \n            <div>\n            <div class=\"mc-field-group\">\n            <input  placeholder=\"your best email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button text-system\">\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\"></div>\n            </div>\n            </form></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Over, and over, and over.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/google-failure/\">another instance of me complaining about this from 2019</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be clear, Google’s strategic goals and large projects are overwhelmingly respectable (self-driving cars, fighting disease, etc.), and I continue to look up to them as leaders in technology for those types of efforts.But when it comes to their basic web services, their mobile platform, their UI/UX, their sense of design and integration, their attention to detail, and 1,000 other things about how they present themselves, they’re third-rate or worse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been talking about this for nearly 10 years now. And so have thousands of others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"note\">Billions?</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>\n\n<p>At this point I&#8217;ve lost my empathy for them. How in the hell can you continue making the same exact mistake, for like 10 years, which is no-doubt causing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in dozens of products&#8212;but you don&#8217;t adjust?</p>\n\n<p>How?</p>\n\n<p>Whatever. I guess we just slowly wait for someone who knows how to make a GUI to catch up to them in backend competence. Because then they&#8217;ll be in serious trouble.</p>\n</p>"
