They give the listeners an overview of the show and guests (8:00), and then move on to discuss The Fugees reuniting for a show (and tour) (17:02). Our resident Barb gives his opinion on the vaccine and Nicki Minaj's viral tweets (19:35), and then Karen Civil's scandal gets brought up (31:14), which leads to a conversation regarding \"standard\" business practices and how they need to change.  Rory explains to Mal what would've been 'The Activist' competition (42:25), while Mal mourns 'The Messiah'. JD has been calling out Diddy in a VERZUZ, and the guys give their thoughts on a possible winner after discussing the recent battle with Fat Joe & Ja Rule (51:28). This wouldn't be a music podcast without discussing new music (1:14:00), just like we wouldn't be Rory & Mal without a random deep dive... this time featuring Crocs (1:19:30), + more!</p>\n<p>Like, Comment, & Subscribe!<br />\nText us: 917-810-2295<br />\nFollow us on twitter and instagram :<br />\ntwitter.com/newrorynmal<br />\ninstagram.com/newrorynmal</p>\n",
