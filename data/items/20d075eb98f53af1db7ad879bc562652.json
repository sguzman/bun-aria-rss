  "description": "One of Emma’s favorite things to do is give advice, so she’s dedicating the full episode to it based off your questions. From how to deal with crappy friendships, to food and fitness, to getting ghosted (it’s happened to all of us) and how to not be cringy when talking to someone you like. Emma is dishing on everything, nothing is off limits.  \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
