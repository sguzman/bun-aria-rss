Now at Durham, Cuthbert was buried first on Lindisfarne in 687AD,  where monks shared vivid stories of his sanctifying miracles, his healing, and his power over nature, and his final tomb became a major site of pilgrimage. In his lifetime he was both hermit and kingmaker, bishop and travelling priest, and the many accounts we have of him, including two by Bede, tell us much of the values of those who venerated him so soon after his death.\n\nThe image above is from a stained glass window in the south aisle of the nave in Durham Cathedral: 'St Cuthbert praying before his cell in the Farne Island'\n\nWith \n\nJane Hawkes\nProfessor of  Medieval Art History at the University of York\n\nSarah Foot\nThe Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Oxford and Canon of Christ Church Cathedral\n\nAnd \n\nJohn Hines\nProfessor of Archaeology at Cardiff University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
