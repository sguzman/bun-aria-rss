  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the FBI wants to keep the Trump affidavit sealed because the FBI may have spies inside Mar-A-Lago. Merrick Garland was apparently unsure what to do even though they suspected the destruction of documents, so he waited a couple of weeks before he authorized the raid. From the low-level conflicted Magistrate Judge to the politicized prosecutors, the whole thing stinks of a political witch hunt. AG Garland and others must be investigated and exposed for treating America like the Soviet Union. Anyone that behaves as they have must be held to account or these actions will spread. Then, Mitch McConnell has to go as leader in the Senate. He literally attacks the quality of candidates that are not aligned with him, and his silence on the unconstitutional raid on Trump's home is concerning. Later, Sen. Marco Rubio joins the show to discuss his opponent Rep. Val Demmings and the danger of doubling the size of the IRS. Rubio noted that the new IRS is larger than the British Army and will also have deadly force to go after everyday Americans. Rubio said the raid on Mar-a-Lago is a continuation of the 6-year witch hunt on Trump and the proof is in the leaks, no one cares about public opinion when investigations are apolitical. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
