  "description": "This week was a BIG podcast. We had Chael Sonnen on for a full 40 minutes to discuss his pro-life stance on becoming a father (At the 2 min mark), PED’s in sports and who the greatest fighter of all time truly is! We also went into detail about Obama’s absurd comparison between Christians/ISIS at the presidential prayer breakfast and of course, Brian Williams being caught in more lies.  Watch the video-clips below, or listen to the full podcast.
