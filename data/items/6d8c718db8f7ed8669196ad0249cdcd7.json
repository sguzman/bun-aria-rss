  "description": "The spotlight is set on the man who has made non-distilling producers famous. It's an exclusive podcast to the operations behind one of the largest distilleries in the world. Our guest spent nearly 40 years with that very famous Indiana distillery. It's safe to say, Greg Metze probably produced more bourbon and rye in a single year than some master distillers will in a lifetime once you hear about the size and scale of MGP. Show Notes:\n\nLet’s do what we all always do and start from the beginning. Do you remember your introduction into whiskey?\n\nCan you talk about your education and what led you into distillation?\n\nSo lets look at your history at MGP Ingredients. What was your career path and trajectory there?\n\nThe internals of MGPi aren’t discussed very much. How big is the operation there?\n\nWhat was the idea to distill all that rye before it became popular?\n\nAre there more spirits that were produced than others?\n\nWhat was the break out in bourbon vs rye being produced?\n\nDo you pride yourself in knowing that 90% of the Ryes and probably a good percentage of bourbon on the shelves of liquor stores is all from your work?\n\nHow popular was contract distilling 10 years ago?\n\nDo you feel a bit angered or left out knowing there are tons of NDPs out there who are making a fortune telling a story about a rye that you created?\n\nTalk us through the process of selling to an NDP. Are they coming to MGP asking for juice? Is MGP coming to them first trying to sell them?\n\nAre there contracts that say you can or can't market a MGP bourbon or rye?\n\nAre there boundaries on how they market MGP juice?\n\nI'd like to know if they have ever had to turn someone away with either just buying sourced barrels or contract distilling? If so what is the pecking order or criteria?\n\nWhat are NDPs doing to make their product different or if it's all the same stuff?\n\nAre NDPs taking barrel from the same warehouses or how do they pick and choose?\n\nDid the whiskey boom hurt MGP getting rid of aged stocks?\n\nLets talk about Old Elk in Colorado",
