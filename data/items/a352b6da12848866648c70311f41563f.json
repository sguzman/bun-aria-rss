The President can require conditions that must be met in order to receive federal funds as can Congress. States do not have the authority to band together to regulate interstate commerce. According to the Supreme Court decision in Wickard v. Filburn the Court sustained a still deeper penetration by Congress into the field of production. The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon.

Then, what is property? Per James Madison, anything a man can attach a value to and has a right to is his property. As such, and per the U.S. Constitution, Americans have rights to their opinions, their religion, and other forms of personal property that are dissipating each time a state governor poses a new restriction.
