  "description": "<p>We study the inertial migration of a torque-free neutrally buoyant sphere in\nwall-bounded plane Couette flow over a wide range of channel Reynolds numbers,\n$Re_c$, in the limit of small particle Reynolds number\\,($Re_p\\ll1$) and\nconfinement ratio\\,($\\lambda\\ll1$). Here, $Re_c = V_\\text{wall}H/\\nu$ where $H$\ndenotes the separation between the channel walls, $V_\\text{wall}$ denotes the\nspeed of the moving wall, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the Newtonian\nsuspending fluid; $\\lambda = a/H$, $a$ being the sphere radius, with\n$Re_p=\\lambda^2 Re_c$. The channel centerline is found to be the only\n(stable)\\,equilibrium below a critical $Re_c\\,(\\approx 148)$, consistent with\nthe predictions of earlier small-$Re_c$ analyses. A supercritical pitchfork\nbifurcation at the critical $Re_c$ creates a pair of stable off-center\nequilibria, symmetrically located with respect to the centerline, with the\noriginal centerline equilibrium simultaneously becoming unstable. The new\nequilibria migrate wallward with increasing $Re_c$. In contrast to the\ninference based on recent computations, the aforementioned bifurcation occurs\nfor arbitrarily small $Re_p$ provided $\\lambda$ is sufficiently small. An\nanalogous bifurcation occurs in the two-dimensional scenario, that is, for a\ncircular cylinder suspended freely in plane Couette flow, with the critical\n$Re_c$ being approximately $110$.\n</p>",
