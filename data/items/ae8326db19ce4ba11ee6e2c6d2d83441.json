  "description": "<p>We live in a culture in which everyone seems to be talking about Jesus and wants some sort of connection to him — but everybody wants connection on their own terms. A Jesus that’s a projection of your own desires, is really just you, and therefore, is not a Jesus that can challenge you, change you, or help you. That’s why the real Jesus’s call is a powerful thing. In this passage, we see that the call of Jesus is 1) Different; 2) Drastic; 3) Developmental; and 4) Doable. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 22, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 1:14-20.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
