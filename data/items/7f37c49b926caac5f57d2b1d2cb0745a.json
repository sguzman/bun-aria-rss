  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the collection of poems published in 1609 by Thomas Thorpe: Shakespeare’s Sonnets, “never before imprinted”.  Yet, while some of Shakespeare's other poems and many of his plays were often reprinted in his lifetime, the Sonnets were not a publishing success.  They had to make their own way, outside the main canon of Shakespeare’s work: wonderful, troubling, patchy, inspiring and baffling, and they have appealed in different ways to different times.  Most are addressed to a man, something often overlooked and occasionally concealed; one early and notorious edition even changed some of the pronouns. \n\nWith:\n\nHannah Crawforth\nSenior Lecturer in Early Modern Literature at King’s College London\n\nDon Paterson\nPoet and Professor of Poetry at the University of St Andrews\n\nAnd\n\nEmma Smith\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies at Hertford College, Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
