  "description": "<p><p>On Monday's episode of Spittin' Chiclets the West Coast Wagon Tour continues as the guys are joined by Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Immediately there is tension in the room as Stammer called out Biz for his mental midget comments during his intro and the comedy ensues from there. The guys discuss the Lightnings season, how good Kucherov is and some stories from his day with Teddy Purcell and Bugsy Malone who also joined the interview. The boys also talk about good the Blues have been and what has led to their success. Rear Admiral wraps up the show with another gambling corner as well.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
