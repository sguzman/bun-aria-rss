  "description": "<br><center>narrated by Chris Gratien<div class=\"moiwnames\"> featuring Joshua White, Zoe Griffith, Amina Elbendary, and Kristina Richardson </div></center>  <div class=\"hidden_synopsis\">  | Military slavery was critical to the function of most imperial states in the medieval Islamic world. But in a moment of crisis during the 13th century, the cadre of enslaved military personnel or mamluks employed by the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt overthrew that dynasty, establishing their own sultanate that governed Egypt, Syria, and the Hijaz for more than two centuries.   In this episode, we&#39;re examining the making of the Mamluk Sultanate and life in its capital of Cairo. We discuss the institutions and structures established in the city of Cairo as displays of power and charity by Mamluk elite, and we consider the role of urban protest and contention between the streets and the citadel as an integral facet of politics in Mamluk cities. We also shed light on the little-studied community of Ghurabā&#39; who lived on the city&#39;s margins and engaged in one of the earliest examples of printing in the Islamic world.  </div> <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/11/life-in-mamluk-sultanate.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
