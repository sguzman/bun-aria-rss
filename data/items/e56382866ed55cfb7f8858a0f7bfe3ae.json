  "description": "Kate is trying to wriggle out of being the witch for the Rewilding Halloween event – but has failed to find anyone else.  Gleeful Kirsty tells her she’ll have to do it.  Kate says she’d rather be a mother-earth kind of witch than a green evil one.  But Kirsty wants the classic.  Kate complains to Lilian, while they watch Eddie poring over the soil results in the pub.  He’s not happy with the Grange Farm score.  Kate tells Lilian that Kirsty wants the tired old interpretation of witches, rather than representing them as the wise women they were.  When Lilian cackles with laughter though, it gives Kate an idea.  Lilian says no, but Kate is not above begging her. She tells Lilian her whole business is at stake, and Lilian finally relents.  She’ll be the witch. What exactly does she have to do?  \nTracy is stressed about what Chelsea’s having to go through, and Jazzer is very supportive.  He asks her gently if she’s okay with it herself, and Tracy says she just wants what Chelsea wants.  When she asks Jazzer how he feels, he opens up a bit. He knows she’s not ready for a child, and he’s not one for having kids no matter what.  But he finds it hard that there’s the beginnings of a baby right now, and next week, there won’t be. He’s not sure he could do it if the decision was his.  Tracy is touched. It will be tough, but they’ll get through it together.",
