  "title": "Mickle Maher, \"Six Plays\" (Agate Press, 2022)",
  "description": "6 Plays (Agate Press, 2022) collects six plays written over a twenty year period by playwright Mickle Maher. Maher is a legend of the Chicago theatre. He is a founder of Theater Oobleck, which has produced many of his plays since their founding as a student theatre group at the University of Michigan in the 1980s. Maher's plays often riff on an existing literary or theatrical classic (Shakespeare's The Tempest in Spirits to Enforce, Chekhov's Cherry Orchard in The Hunchback Variations) but they're never inaccessibly academic. Rather, they invite audiences into a playful, funny, profoundly moving dialogue with canonical works. In this discussion, we talk about the founding of Theater Oobleck, Maher's teaching methodology, and why the Faust myth spoke to him so profoundly during a time of personal crisis. \nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
