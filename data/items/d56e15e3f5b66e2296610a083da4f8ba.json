  "description": "<p>Quantum measurement is important to quantum computing as it extracts the\noutcome of the circuit at the end of the computation. Previously, all\nmeasurements have to be done at the end of the circuit. Otherwise, it will\nincur significant errors. But it is not the case now. Recently IBM started\nsupporting dynamic circuits through hardware (instead of software by\nsimulator). With mid-circuit hardware measurement, we can improve circuit\nefficacy and fidelity from three aspects: (a) reduced qubit usage, (b) reduced\nswap insertion, and (c) improved fidelity. We demonstrate this using real-world\napplications Bernstein Verizani on real hardware and show that circuit resource\nusage can be improved by 60\\%, and circuit fidelity can be improved by 15\\%. We\ndesign a compiler-assisted tool that can find and exploit the tradeoff between\nqubit reuse, fidelity, gate count, and circuit duration. We also developed a\nmethod for identifying whether qubit reuse will be beneficial for a given\napplication. We evaluated our method on a representative set of essential\napplications. We can reduce resource usage by up to 80\\% and circuit fidelity\nby up to 20\\%.\n</p>",
