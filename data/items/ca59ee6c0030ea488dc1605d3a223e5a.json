  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off with a quick recap of all the Thanksgiving NFL action. The Detroit Lions embarrassed themselves in the early game against the Chicago Bears. Dan Campbell continues to underwhelm as a head coach and right now all signs point to Detroit finishing the season without a win (again). In the afternoon game, the Las Vegas Raiders beat the Dallas Cowboys in one of the sloppiest games we've seen in years. Forget Derek Carr and Dak Prescott; the officials were the stars in this one as the teams combined for 28 penalties. Aside from that, the Cowboys' over reliance on Ezekiel Elliott was puzzling. Backup running back Tony Pollard looked very explosive on Thursday but Dallas insisted on feeding Zeke down the stretch. That's definitely something to monitor as the season progresses. In the nightcap, the Buffalo Bills put a hurting on the New Orleans Saints - just as we told you they would earlier in the week. Cha-ching! Later, WynnBET Senior Trading Manager Alan Berg swings by for a lookahead to all of the rest of the NFL Week 12 slate for the sports wagering perspective. Finally, Jason uses all that dynamite information he got from Berg to close the show with the Weekend edition of the Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
