  "description": "“Black lives matter before death.” (p.132) In her powerful new book, You Can’t Stop the Revolution: Community Disorder and Social Ties in Post-Ferguson America (University of California Press, 2019), Andrea S. Boyles provides vivid ethnographic work and in-depth interviews from the Ferguson protests. She shares discussions and experiences that illustrate that protestor’s actions are both spontaneous and deliberate, but she also explores how peaceful protesting can become framed in a compromising way for the participants. Boyles leaves readers with important implications and take-aways that include recognizing and paying homage to activists on the ground who are continuing this work today.\nThis book would be an excellent addition to any upper-level undergraduate or graduate level Sociology course. Although the focus of the book is on protest movements and race, the materials cover a wide variety of Sociological material that would make it an important addition to any course. Any courses or scholars interested in qualitative methods would benefit from reading Boyle’s account of her complex and in-depth methodology.\nSarah E. Patterson is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
