  "description": "<p>“HUMBLE VOICES CARRY FURTHER IN THIS WORLD.”<br />\nAll of us want to be loved and accepted. It’s how we were brought into this world, and it’s how we should be spending our lives.<br />\nI’ve learned that if you want to get love you have to learn to give it, but it’s not always that easy.<br />\nI’m sure you’ve found yourself around people who you may find creepy or that may hate on you for seemingly no reason.<br />\nYour knee jerk reaction is probably to respond with an attack back, but that does the opposite of what anyone wants.<br />\nHate breeds hate and love breeds love.<br />\nAt the end of the day, how do you want to be remembered? I know I want to be remembered as someone who lit the way with love, compassion, and really tried to understand everyone I encountered.<br />\nOn this episode of The School of Greatness I’ve brought you someone who has been spreading nothing but love around the entire world: Bob Goff.<br />\nBob is one of the most interesting people I’ve ever met. He used to be a lawyer and has since turned his life into one designed to spread love. He is a New York Times best selling author, a diplomat, and a phenomenal speaker.<br />\nHe’s helped build schools and shelters around the world. He’s saved lives by educating witch doctors in other countries, and has even become the Uganda consolut to the US.<br />\nThis was easily one of the most interesting interviews I’ve ever done.<br />\nBob’s mission is one I truly believe in.<br />\nAnd believe it or not despite everything he’s done he still gets haters on social media.<br />\nWe discuss how he deals with those haters, how you can love deeper, and how you can overcome your insecurities.<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 622.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nAre you insecure? (7:34)<br />\nHow do you do what you do? (8:50)<br />\nWhat did you learn from the last 25 years of being magnetic? (12:24)<br />\nWhy did you want to become an attorney in the first place? (15:57)<br />\nWhen did you build your first school? (21:03)<br />\nWhat’s your best piece of advice that does rhyme? (26:17)<br />\nWho are you right now? (28:22)<br />\nHow do you get in touch with the humblest version of you? (30:06)<br />\nWhat does faith have to do with loving difficult people or situations? (32:54)<br />\nHow do you know if you are engaging people too long? (37:05)<br />\nHow do you deal with haters when you’re just trying to spread love? (39:48)<br />\nYou engaged with witchcraft people in Uganda? (43:50)<br />\nDo you go to the witch doctor graduations? (46:17)<br />\nWhat do you still need patience in? (52:27)<br />\nHow did you transfer from being a lawyer to having a massive social media audience? (53:53)<br />\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you think you still need to master? (59:50)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nHow people get caught up in stereotypes (6:46)<br />\nBob’s boat race experience (10:25)<br />\nWhat Bob wants more than anything right now (13:06)<br />\nWho I want to be in 10 years (14:20)<br />\nBob’s first publishing deal (17:33)<br />\nHow to really engage with someone (20:13)<br />\nHow to work towards the success you want (23:01)<br />\nThe way Bob handles haters (30:26)<br />\nHow you can make a large impact in the world (36:04)<br />\nWhy love will be what we’re remembered for (41:29)<br />\nThe biggest lesson Bob’s learned from witch doctors (48:30)<br />\nWhere the best headlines of your book would come from (51:10)<br />\nWhy Bob wrote his latest book (1:00:45)<br />\nPlus much more</p>\n",
