  "description": "<p>The word “spiritual bypass” has been coming up a lot with recent events and I wanted to dedicate a podcast all about what this word means. As a spiritual teacher with an activist background, I have observed personally how many people learning about spirituality take concepts like “oneness” or “the universe has your back” to bypass over real life occurrences and social justice issues.</p> <p>I share my experience with spiritual bypass and how you can know if you are spiritual bypassing today. No judgement—just knowledge!</p> <p>Being part of a conscious online community is more important than ever before. Leave your anxiety behind and get the support, connection and inspiration your soul has been craving in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood all about becoming your highest self.
