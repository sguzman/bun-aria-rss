I will be the most expensive single-athlete deal in sports history, topping a $365 million contract boxer Canelo Alvarez signed last year. In Trout's eight-year career, spent entirely with the Angels, Los Angeles has made the playoffs just once. Also touched on is the American Athletic Conference's new 12-year, $1 billion broadcast deal with ESPN. The largest conference not in the so-called \"Power Five,\" the ACC will see its annual payout to each school more than quadruple under the new deal. The trio also discuss the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament. </p><p>Host: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
