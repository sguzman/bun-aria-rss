  "title": "299 - The Ripper Crew: Chicago's Satanic Serial Killers",
  "description": "<p>Brace yourself for this one. If you can't handle graphic depictions of sexual abuse directed in the most obscene and ridiculous ways towards breasts, this isn't gonna be one you're gonna enjoy. This story truly plays out like a horror film. Some type of Rob Zombie slasher flick. On acid. Robin Gecht is a man with a VERY specific sexual obsession. And that obsession, when he wasnt behind bars, combined with Satanic worship straight out of some 1980s Satanic Panic PSA, led Robin to embark on a spree of sexual violence and murder that left at least eighteen women dead. And helping him were Ed Spreitzer and brothers, Tommy and Andrew Kokoraleis. These four men, dubbed The Ripper Crew,  had a murder van, a hidden Satanic chapel, and a lot of really dark desires they took out on a lot of unsuspecting women in and around Chicago in 1981 and 1982. The truth is stranger than fiction sometimes, and this is one of those times. <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for June is The Rainbow Railroad.
