  "description": "<p>In this episode, we take a trip down memory lane. We visit a campus full of hippos to learn how memories are stored, and drop in on a badger trainer to see how she recalls “the great badger blunder.” We also explore how many memories can our brains store. Hint: way more than you probably think. You may have heard of deja vu, but did you know there are other vus too? We found a lost game show where these vus are contestants. All this plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: do fish have allergies?
