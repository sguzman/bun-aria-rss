Today, Mike and Tim sit down with Pastors, podcasters and leadership trainers Ben Sternke and Matt Tebbe, to discuss their new book \"<em>Having the Mind of Christ: Eight Axioms to Cultivate a Robust Faith</em>.\" The group talks about their Gravity Leadership program, both the podcast and their leadership training, as well as the church they founded, <strong>The Table</strong>, in Indiana. What lead them to plant the church? What did they see in a previous church experience and how did they change those habits? What does it look like to 'have the mind of Christ?'</p>\n<p>The book, through 8 'axioms' that offer a new set of lenses to see through, looks at common pitfalls within our well practiced discipleship efforts, with a focus on \"<em><strong>practices</strong></em><strong> rather than doing the deeper work of learning a new </strong><em><strong>paradigm</strong></em><em>.\" </em>Sternke and Tebbe advocate for a new way of seeing ourselves, the World and God through each of these practices. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike and Tim also spend time discussing an email sent in from a Pastor and listener of the pod who is struggling with wether or not to leave the pastorate.
