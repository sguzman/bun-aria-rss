  "description": "<p>We consider the propagation of gravitational waves in the late-time Universe,\nin the presence of structure, and we also consider the cosmic fluid to be\nviscous. In this work, we investigate the cumulative effect of inhomogeneities\nand viscosity of the cosmic-fluid, on the observables associated with the\nsources of the gravitational waves. Employing Buchert's averaging procedure in\nthe backreaction framework, we consider a model of inhomogeneous spacetime.\nUsing the modified redshift versus distance relation, through the averaging\nprocess in the context of the model, we study the variation of the\nredshift-dependent part of the observed gravitational wave amplitude for\ndifferent combinations of our model parameters, while simultaneously\nconsidering damping of the gravitational wave amplitude due to viscosity of the\ncosmic-fluid. Then, we investigate the differences occurring in the variation\nof the redshift-dependent part of the observed gravitational wave amplitude,\ndue to consideration of viscous attenuation. We show that there are significant\ndeviations after the inclusion of viscous attenuation in our analysis,\ndepending on the chosen value of the coefficient of viscosity. Our result\nsignifies the importance of the effect of viscosity, within the model of an\ninhomogeneous Universe, on precision measurements of parameters of\ncompact-binary sources of gravitational waves.\n</p>",
