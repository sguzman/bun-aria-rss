It’s reaching out to the people on my list that I think this might fit, because generally speaking, I’m not sitting with a blank sheet of paper, dreaming something up.”—RM</p><p>“When I notice someone struggling with something, and then I notice somebody else struggling with the same thing, I’ll think, ‘Huh, I wonder if there’s something there?’”—JS</p><p>“When you do a launch, your list will get bigger. That’s how it works.”—RM</p><p>“When is comes to pricing, people are atrocious at pulling a number out of a hat.”—JS</p><p>“What’s interesting is they found errors in your book, but they engaged with it. This is why we need to get over this idea of perfectionism because people engage for different reasons.”—RM</p><p>“If you’re going to get $245 for this course, then you can reverse engineer how many videos you want to make.”—JS</p><p>“If you think this is a numbers game, you will never launch.”—RM</p><p>“I’m not looking for data to prove to me that it’s going to work. What I’m doing is looking for an opening.”—JS</p><p>“What this process does is it gives you that confidence that you're not going to lose your shirt, that you know how to speak to your ideal client, and that if a bad one sneaks in there, you're going to be done really fast and they'll be out.”—RM</p><p>“I don’t dream stuff up, like, ‘Boy, it sure would be cool if the universe had this in it now!’ It’s always from some struggle I observed.”—JS</p><h2>Sharing is caring!</h2><p>If you enjoyed this episode, please consider sharing it with a few friends who might find it useful.
