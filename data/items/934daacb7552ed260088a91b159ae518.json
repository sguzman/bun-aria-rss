    "media:description": "I asked myself why I've only made 3 COVID-related videos this year, and the answers made me worried about the future.\n\nThis is my second video in a row that could be listened to as a podcast. So stop pestering me about still not having gotten around to starting that podcast. This is actually supreme efficiency pal. But seriously, I know it's kinda boring, it would make me happy if you just stuck it at x2 speed.\n\nI haven't watched this back fully but I hope my message came across reasonably clearly. The last thing I would want to be doing is stoking the culture wars or misinformation which both surround COVID topics, especially vaccination. I'm just trying to say that...shit's complicated, ya get me?\n\nReferences from the video:\n\nICNARC data (UK ICUs) data: https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports\nUK briefing with data showing booster efficacy dropping off to 40% after 2.5 months: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043807/technical-briefing-33.pdf\nMyocarditis risk vs COVID myocarditis risk: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01630-0.pdf\nPreprint of subsequent breakdown: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.23.21268276v1.full.pdf\nCDC guidance on children: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/planning/children.html\n\n-----------------\n\nMore Medlife Crisis:\n\nhttp://www.medlifecrisis.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/medcrisis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXFgI0Lgrwc_fY2ttqQ9Yhg\nhttps://watchnebula.com/medlifecrisis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/medcrisis\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Medlifecrisis",
