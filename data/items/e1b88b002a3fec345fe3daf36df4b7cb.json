  "title": "#23: How Amazon Changed Delivery and How Delivery Changes Everything",
  "description": "This week, it's all about how we buy stuff and how that stuff gets to us. David, Joanna and Christopher bring on WSJ reporter Katie Bindley to talk about how to make sure you're getting the best deals on Amazon-and all the ways what you see on the page might not be what you think. Next, Julie Jargon, the team's new Family & Tech columnist, comes on to talk about a project she worked on before she took up her new gig: The Journal's Delivery Wars series looked at the tension between customers who want everything on their doorstep and businesses who want to actually make money. Finally, Christopher interviews Yariv Bash, CEO of Flytrex, about whether drones could one day deliver everything we need right into our hands.",
