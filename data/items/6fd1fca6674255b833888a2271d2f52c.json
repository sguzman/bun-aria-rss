  "description": "<p>Let $\\Gamma$ be a graph with vertex set $V$, and let $a$ and $b$ be\nnonnegative integers. A subset $C$ of $V$ is called an $(a,b)$-regular set in\n$\\Gamma$ if every vertex in $C$ has exactly $a$ neighbors in $C$ and every\nvertex in $V\\setminus C$ has exactly $b$ neighbors in $C$. In particular, $(0,\n1)$-regular sets and $(1, 1)$-regular sets in $\\Ga$ are called perfect codes\nand total perfect codes in $\\Ga$, respectively. A subset $C$ of a group $G$ is\nsaid to be an $(a,b)$-regular set of $G$ if there exists a Cayley graph of $G$\nwhich admits $C$ as an $(a,b)$-regular set. In this paper we prove that, for\nany generalized dihedral group $G$ or any group $G$ of order $4p$ or $pq$ for\nsome primes $p$ and $q$, if a nontrivial subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a $(0,\n1)$-regular set of $G$, then it must also be an $(a,b)$-regular set of $G$ for\nany $0\\leqslant a\\leqslant|H|-1$ and $0\\leqslant b\\leqslant |H|$ such that $a$\nis even when $|H|$ is odd. A similar result involving $(1, 1)$-regular sets of\nsuch groups is also obtained in the paper.\n</p>",
