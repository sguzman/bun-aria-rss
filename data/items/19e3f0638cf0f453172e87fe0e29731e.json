From February 25-28, he auctioned a total of 33 NFTs commemorating his album 'Ultraviolet', originally released in 2018. 3LAU discusses how he applied his knowledge of game theory to optimize the auction mechanism. The sales totaled $11.7M.</p> <p>3LAU's biggest takeaway from all this is that the music industry is ripe for disruption. NFTs can remove intermediaries and bridge the gap between fans and creators. Transparent, immutable digital goods are increasingly accessible to the public. These tools promote direct-to-consumer transactions, democratization of data, and self-distribution.</p> <p>The argument here is that given the technology of distributed ledgers, record labels are now obsolete. With an investable layer, fans are able to contribute capital and hold equity in an artist's work. 3LAU is pioneering how decentralized tokens can be optimized for medium-dependent art spaces. The future of art is decentralized, allowing infinite collaborative possibilities among fans and creators of all forms of media.</p> <p>Justin on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/3LAU?s=20\">https://twitter.com/3LAU?s=20</a> </p> <p>3LAU Website<br /> <a href=\"https://3lau.com/\">https://3lau.com/</a> </p> <p>3LAU NFT Auction<br /> <a href= \"https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction\">https://nft.3lau.com/#/auction</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣REGISTER FOR COINDESK CONSENSUS 2021 AND SAVE $20 W/ BANKLESS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/consensus2021%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B\">http://bankless.cc/consensus2021​​</a> <br />  ------<br /> CATCH UP ON BANKLESS:</p> <p>🗞️ Weekly Rollup (3/5): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-3lau-and-grimes-nfts-paypal\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-3lau-and-grimes-nfts-paypal</a> <br />  🧢 Weekly Action Recap (3/6): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/weekly-action-recap-177\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/weekly-action-recap-177</a> <br />  📈 Market Monday (3/8): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/eip-1559-on-the-horizon-market-monday\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/eip-1559-on-the-horizon-market-monday</a> <br />  🎙️ Podcast | Bankless 2.0 (3/8): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-welcome-to-bankless-2021-edition\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-welcome-to-bankless-2021-edition</a> <br />  🐦 Follow Bankless on Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ\">https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
