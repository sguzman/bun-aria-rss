  "title": "Ep 113 | Why COVID's Origin Is the Biggest Story in the World | Josh Rogin | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "We need to talk about China. Seriously. It’s behind most of our biggest problems. Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to establish a new world order that does not have our best interests in mind. Human rights? Trade? Pandemic prevention? Just ask the 2 million people in concentration camps, just look at the damage COVID-19 has brought. While we're thinking about whether we can go to a restaurant without a mask, China is deciding which continents to buy and what industries to control. Award-winning investigative journalist Josh Rogin documents all of it in his new book, \"Chaos Under Heaven: Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the 21st Century.\" Rogin was one of the first journalists in mainstream media who refused to dismiss the possibility that COVID-19 originated from a lab in China. Rogin is a columnist for the Washington Post and a political analyst for CNN. On this episode, he joins Glenn to discuss a range of topics, from Anthony Fauci thwarting an honest investigation into the origins of COVID-19 to the Chinese Communist Party, which Rogin refers to as the largest extortion racket in the world. They also cover the downfall of journalism, the rise of the surveillance state, and the disintegration of civil liberties in the name of public health. \n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\nRuff Greens will change your dog’s life.
