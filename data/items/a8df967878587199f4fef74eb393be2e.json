  "description": "<p>A bunch of altruistic hot people join a cult in 1980s West Hollywood, what could possibly go wrong?\n Using footage shot by the cult's (known as The Buddahfield) in-house documentarian, we follow these lovable gorgeous weirdos as they slowly become disenchanted by their 'master' 'lord' 'leader' 'prophet' who claims to have a direct line to God. It all, inevitably, falls apart. Lives are ruined, faiths are shaken, and fruit salads are painstakingly made.Â </p>\n",
