It doesn't matter what you choose to do, you're going to be alive, because you're going to make progress.” - Tony Robbins<br /><br />To say that Anthony Robbins is a legend is to say nothing at all.<br /><br />Beyond being a #1 New York Times bestselling author, Tony is also a founder, partner, or early investor in 100+ privately held businesses with combined sales exceeding $7 billion annually.<br /><br />He’s been honored by Accenture as one of the top fifty business intellectuals in the world, having consulted and coached some of the world’s greatest athletes, entertainers, Fortune 500 CEOs, and four US presidents.<br /><br />Finally, through his philanthropy and partnership with Feeding America, he has provided more than 800 million meals and is on track to provide 1 billion meals by 2025.<br /><br />And it isn’t only his impressive list of credentials that made me so excited to have him as a guest on Impact Theory. Tony’s books, talks, and live events have also had a profound impact on me, both personally and professionally.<br /><br />Our conversation ranged far and wide, covering everything from the secrets to true fulfillment in life to his deep research into the cutting edge of regenerative medicine.<br /><br />If you (like me) feel excited after what Tony shared in this episode, I encourage you to check out Tony’s new book, Life Force: How New Breakthroughs in Precision Medicine Can Transform the Quality of Your Life & Those You Love: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qrXhDa\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3qrXhDa</a> <br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br />00:00 | Introduction<br />02:14 | What Drives Tony to Write Deeply About Big Issues<br />10:13 | Where is the Cutting Edge of Medicine in 2022?<br />16:56 | How Tony Made a Huge Impact Despite the Pandemic<br />21:09 | How to Deal With Weak Links in an Organization<br />24:14 | On Destroying Limitations and Learning to Embrace Risk<br />27:48 | The Foundations of a Culture of Weakness (And How to Overcome It)<br />36:11 | The Most Important Pillar of Lasting Change<br />43:37 | How Tony Continually Embraces Change<br />48:15 | Tony’s Ultimate Breakthrough 2022 Challenge<br />54:36 | What Drives Tony to Learn Deeply<br /><br />QUOTES:<br />“Progress equals happiness. If you keep growing, you're going to feel alive. And if you keep growing, you're going to have more to give. And when you're growing and giving is when life is magnificent.” [25:45]<br /><br />“People need a new perspective. And you can't do it by just sitting and thinking - you’ve got to move your body, you’ve got to change your energy and your focus, because [with a] low level of energy, I don't give a damn how smart you are - you're not going to use all of your ability.” [34:57]<br /><br />“The one common denominator [of] people that are successful over a lifetime is the sustained hunger. Hunger is the number one factor.” [46:04]<br /><br />“I think anybody that gets wired to grow and give is gonna have a really fulfilling life. It doesn't matter what you choose to do, you're going to be alive, because you're going to make progress.” [47:24]<br /><br />“You’ve got to understand, anyone can learn anything if you can just break it down to its simple core.” [56:21]<br /><br /><br />Follow Tony Robbins:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://www.tonyrobbins.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tonyrobbins.com</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyRobbins\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/TonyRobbins</a><br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TonyRobbins\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/TonyRobbins</a><br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/TonyRobbins\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/TonyRobbins</a><br />Order your copy of Life Force here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qrXhDa\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3qrXhDa</a> <br />Sign up for Tony’s Ultimate Breakthrough 2022 Challenge: <a href=\"https://breakthrough2022.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://breakthrough2022.com</a>",
