But that's not the case in the new film \"Get Out,\" written and directed by Jordan Peele (best known for the Comedy Central series \"Key And Peele\"). Gene and guest host Eric Deggans chat with Peele about his new film, check in with African-American filmmaker Ernest Dickerson, who's directed many scary movies and TV shows, and dive deep into race in horror-movie history with Robin Means Coleman, who's been analyzing and writing about the genre for over a decade.",
