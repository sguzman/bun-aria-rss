  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss where Cam Newton may eventually wind up and what makes the most sense for him, and why Chicago decided to go with Nick Foles instead after it was reported that Carolina tried to engage in talks with the Bears. Pat also runs through the Patriots 2020 schedule and the Bucs 2020 schedule and gives his predictions&nbsp;game by game. Joining the show is 13 year NFL veteran, 9th overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, one of the fastest WR's to ever play the game, Ted Ginn Jr. Ted and Pat chat about his high school days playing defensive back and running track, where many thought he could qualify for the Olympics. He chats about what he thinks Cam Newton has left in the tank, the difference between playing on good and poor teams, how he doesn't care about the accolades or the money and just wants to play football next year, and who some of the toughest cornerbacks he has faced during his career (7:55-26:45). Next, 8x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro. Member of the NFL 2000’s All-Decade Team and San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team, one of the greatest Tight End’s in the history of the sport and eventual Hall of Famer, Antonio Gates, stops by. They chat about his career as a whole and how he saw the locker room dynamic change over time, what it was like playing with Phil Rivers and what Indianapolis is getting in him as a QB. He also explains what it was like when the Chargers moved to LA and how that process went, why he loves how the current TE’s play the game, what it was like being a trailblazer for basketball players jumping to the NFL, and what he’s doing now as he looks to move into a bigger role with the Chargers (37:49-54:43). Later, AJ Hawk is back for another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ chat about everything else happening around the NFL including DeShaun Watson liking tweets that make it seem like he wants out of Houston, where AJ thinks Cam Newton is going to wind up, the Colts not being interested in Tom Brady, and AJ shares the story about the first (and probably last) time he met Michael Jordan, and riding around with the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds (1:15:46-2:39:52). Today’s show is fun one. As always, stay safe out there and be smart.
