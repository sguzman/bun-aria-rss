  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Brady Quinn and Ryan Wilson to react to the Rams dealing Marcus Peters (4:00), the Browns giving up on a 2nd-year OL (9:00), what it takes to get suspended for a game by the Patriots like Michael Bennett (16:30), and Darius Leonard's concussion fears (19:15). The guys keep the conversation going on poor officiating in the NFL and potential solutions (25:00). Will, Brady and Ryan re-examine the top picks from the 2015 QB class (36:00), Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota, and what their futures are with their respective teams. Should Cam Newton (44:00) and Nick Foles (49:00) be re-inserted as starters once healthy? Finally, we focus on Jason Garrett's job security (51:00) and compare the Seahawks and 49ers (56:00) in a 5-star question from Apple Podcasts. \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
