  "description": "In Episode 113 I sit down with Naturopathic Doctor Matthew Nagra to talk about how he uses evidence based nutrition science to help his patients upgrade their health. If you are looking for an episode that consolidates several things previously spoken about on the show, along with findings from new research then I think you will really enjoy this episode. Particularly if you like the more in-depth science episodes.\n\nIn this episode we talk about:\n\n\nThe latest EPIC-Oxford study on bone health\n\nThe health advantages that people have who adopt plant-predominant or exclusive dietary patterns\n\nNaturopathy as a form of health care\n\nHow Dr Nagra helps his patients make sustainable changes\n\nCommon questions Dr Nagra gets from patients (Including questions about protein, soy, lectins, cooking oils etc)\n\nHis personal food philosophy\n\nLDL-Cholesterol being an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and his thoughts on the carnivore diet\n\nImportant nutrients and supplements for people reducing their consumption of animal foods\n\nA new study on iodine status in Norwegian pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans.\n\nand much more\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nWebsite to full studies in full for free:\nSci-hub.st\n\nBone Health:\n1 - New EPIC-Oxford study: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01815-3\n2 - How we know this study failed to properly adjust for BMI and calcium intake. Twos studies below show the risk of fracture at varying BMI’s and levels of calcium intake. In the EPIC-Oxford study the researchers adjusted for the wrong part of the risk curve.
