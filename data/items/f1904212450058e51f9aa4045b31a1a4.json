But as we age, those instruments start to get a little rusty. Small changes over time create a variety of imbalances, until one day we wake up realizing we’re flat and out of tune. This leads to things like menopausal symptoms in women, hair loss and belly fat in men, thyroid dysfunction, bone loss, and so much more.&nbsp;</p><br><p>That’s why it’s never too early, or too late, to start optimizing hormonal balance. Today we’re featuring an episode of the <em>Longevity Roadmap</em> docu-series that takes a deep dive into hormones and how they play a critical role in how well, or poorly, we age.
