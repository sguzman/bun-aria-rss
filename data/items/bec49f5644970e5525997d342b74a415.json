  "description": "Today’s guest is acclaimed interior designer and photographer Matthew Patrick Smyth. He has been on ELLE Décor’s “A” List, his work has been featured in House Beautiful, Traditional Home, New York Magazine and more. He also wrote a new book “Through a Designer’s Eye: A Focus on Interiors”. We talk about his polished yet comfortable spaces, his love of artisanal pieces and antiques, his attention to detail and light, and some touching personal stories.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs about feeling at home in a temporary rental, a pregnancy announcement (!), COVID within the family, tearing down and rebuilding a house, a nightmare new build next door, considering new drapery, and dishwasher woes.\n\nMatthew explains how his process begins — starting with the floorplan.\n\nWhere Matthew finds his artisanal pieces and what he loves about them.\n\nMatthew’s love of antiques led him to interior design and carries into all elements of his style.\n\nHow Matthew’s experience as a photographer impacts his design.\n\nThe ways Matthew was able to decorate a casual seaside home and still use antiques.\n\nWhy Matthew has an affinity for round dining tables and what chairs he recommends.\n\nMore about Matthew’s personal home and falling in love with it.\n\nMatthew uses upholstery to modernize an older house with all antique interiors.\n\nMatthew’s love of black(ish) paint.\n\nWhat Matthew does to individualize the work for his clients.\n\nMatthew shares about his work and friendship with Gloria Vanderbilt.\n\nHow is a designer’s eye different from the average person’s?\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Jenny,\n\nFirst of all, thank you for including the floorplan—so helpful! This is a very generous width for a dining room so the sideboard is not going to throw off the room; there’s still plenty of room and no flow problem whatsoever. It’s not a floor to ceiling piece, so your eye will go right over it. I would put a big mirror over the sideboard to reflect the windows and the beautiful view. That will really open up the room. It’s really important to keep that chandelier centered with the windows so I would not touch that. The table centered in the room is the way to go. It’s good that you’re thinking about it now…but don’t overthink it! It’s actually a nicely designed floor plan and well proportioned; I wouldn’t play with that. You’re in good shape, Jenny!\n\nMatthew\nMentioned in This Episode:\nMatthew Patrick Smyth\nMatthew Patrick Smyth on Instagram\nThrough a Designer’s Eye: A Focus on Interiors on Amazon\nZillow Gone Wild on Instagram\nThe Schwartz House on Instagram\nChicology Roller Blinds",
