  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a big topic. There is so much to uncover and  decipher. That it's pretty much impossible for me to do it in one episode. So, the purpose of this episode is to present a collection of information and offer a foundation for us to start.   Information for this topic is in no way complete, there is so much history to cover, it’s nearly impossible, but you can think of this episode as preparation. We will first identify the issue and explore some of the sources for injustice that we see in the built environment. As we work through this, we’re going to be paying attention to the language that is used. Now language can mean many different things, graphic language, geological language, verbal language, any form of communication, I can think of as language. But for this instant we will focus on verbal language or written language, particularly vocabulary, how we use that or omit that to describe these landscape stories that when told over time, become huge influences on how we design space.</span></p>",
