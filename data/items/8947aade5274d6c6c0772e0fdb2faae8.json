  "description": "<p>EPISODE 83 - DAVID MULLEN - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins has the opportunity to talk with cinematographer David Mullen(THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL, NORTHFORK, TWIN FALLS IDAHO). We learn lots of specifics about the shooting and lighting of the film Northfork. He really breaks it all down for us. We also speak in detail about the different ways of flashing film and why you would do it, as well as the ways of taking color out of the visuals on a film. He also shares the difficulty of storyboards that were created without the input of the cinematographer. We cover shooting anamorphic - why and the differences between spherical shooting, his experience of negotiating for a DI finish in the early days of the DI, and how he oversees the look when shooting the packed schedule of television. We learned a lot when talking with David!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Northfork, Akeelah and the Bee<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>",
