  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The sourcing of our food matters on a profound level, but in our culture, unfortunately, many of us are disconnected from this process. We live in a society that is full of fast-food drive-thrus, and with just a few clicks of a button, we can literally have food delivered to our doors. Especially when it comes to meat, there is a vast variety of quality and sourcing. Many folks don’t know the difference between a drive-thru burger and a grass-fed burger, and even some of the most health-conscious consumers can have confusion and overwhelm about the best way to eat.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">In his new book and film, <em>The Sacred Cow</em>, Robb Wolf aims to answer the question: how can we source our food in a way that is ethical, sustainable, and health-promoting? On today’s show, Robb is back The Model Health Show to share some eye-opening insights on regenerative agriculture and the future of farming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode contains important conversations about global warming, meat replacements, and the centralization of our food system. You’re going to learn about how an animal-inclusive food system is actually the most ethical, environmentally friendly, and health-promoting diet available. No matter what your diet preference or paradigm is, there are important takeaways from this conversation that I hope you’ll contemplate.
