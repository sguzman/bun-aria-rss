Bug bounty hunters, defenders, and DevOps or DevSecOps practitioners should not miss this episode! We’ll be taking a look at different cloud infrastructure providers, cloud services, and how this often overlooked or misunderstood attack surface can translate into real security issues, as well as what defenders and developers can do about it.\n\nSHUBHAM SHAH\nShubham Shah is the co-founder and CTO of Assetnote.
