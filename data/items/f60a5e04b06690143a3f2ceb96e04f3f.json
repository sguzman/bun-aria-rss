Talk about that.\n\nWhat’s the average number of discarded barrels that don’t meet some sort of quality assurance?\n\nTalk about char levels for a bit because it’s something that is always said, but never really explained about in depth.\n\nIs the barrel making process getting more expensive on a yearly basis because of demand and material supply?\n\nFor everyone that missed the episode with Chris Morris where we talked briefly about the cooperage, talk about what it means to have a cooperage dedicated to their private whiskey\n\nThe release of Cooper’s Craft happened recently.
