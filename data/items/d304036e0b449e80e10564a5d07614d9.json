  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is talking leftovers! Welcoming guest Eugenia Bone, author of the recently released book “The Kitchen Ecosystem: Integrating Recipes to Create Delicious Meals,” Eugenia chats about great ways to reuse ingredients that you might otherwise discard. “The Kitchen Ecosystem” says that the secret to great meals is this: the more you cook, the less you actually have to do to produce a delicious meal. The trick is to approach cooking as a continuum, where each meal draws on elements from a previous one and provides the building blocks for another. Eugenia shares with Cathy that synchronicity is what defines a kitchen ecosystem and talks about what has inspired her to write with this unique and thrifty perspective.
