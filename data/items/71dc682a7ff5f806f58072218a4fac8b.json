  "description": "Chelsea updates Ben on her clinic appointment. The atmosphere’s awkward as Ben pledges as much support as he can in the face of wired Chelsea. Tensions boil over and they bicker noisily. Brad appears, surprised to see them talking so animatedly. He quickly works out why, and in a misguided attempt to defend his sister, ends up throwing a bungled punch at Ben. He misses and hits a gate post, and as Ben gives first aid advice, Brad calms a little. Ben and Chelsea explain that despite the stressful appearance of the situation, they’re handling it and Ben’s supporting Chelsea. Later chastened Brad apologises to Chelsea, which she accepts whilst pointing out she can look after herself. She tells Brad to keep his knowledge about the baby’s father to himself, and thanks him for trying to stick up for her.\nJim points out to Alan he has an interest in the broken Jack Woolley window at the church, as Natasha approaches the vestry. She brings a proposition from Peggy, to replace the window with the proposed new one. Alan points out the lengthy process for a new design; repairing the existing one would be a lot quicker. Peggy could help fund this if she likes? Natasha’s not impressed; she’ll talk to Peggy. She later reports Peggy wants the Jack Woolley window restored, but redesigned to incorporate key ideas from their original plan. Jim’s not happy; this is just advertising for the Archer family. Alan counsels a wait and see approach. At some stage it still might get turned down.",
