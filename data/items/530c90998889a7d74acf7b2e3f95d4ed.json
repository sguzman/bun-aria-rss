  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas attributed to Sun Tzu (544-496BC, according to tradition), a legendary figure from the beginning of the Iron Age in China, around the time of Confucius. He may have been the historical figure Sun Wu, a military adviser at the court of King Helu of Wu (who reigned between about 514 and 496 BC), one of the kings in power in the Warring States period of Chinese history (6th - 5th century BC). Sun Tzu was credited as the author of The Art of War, a work on military strategy that soon became influential in China and then Japan both for its guidance on conducting and avoiding war and for its approach to strategy generally. After The Art of War was translated into European languages in C18th, its influence spread to military academies around the world.\n\nThe image above is of a terracotta warrior from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor, who unified China after the Warring States period.\n\nWith \n\nHilde De Weerdt\nProfessor of Chinese History at Leiden University\n\nTim Barrett\nProfessor Emeritus of East Asian History at SOAS, University of London\n\nAnd\n\nImre Galambos\nReader in Chinese Studies at the University of Cambridge\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
