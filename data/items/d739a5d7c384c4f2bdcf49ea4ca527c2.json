  "title": "109 - The Chessboard Killer: Alexander Pichushkin",
  "description": "<p>Alexander Pichushkin insisted he’d killed sixty-three people after being apprehended in 2006 but authorities only had enough evidence to convict him of forty-eight murders. The bodies of other victims had vanished. He killed his first victim in 1992 and didn’t get caught until 2006. Not only was he not remorseful, he was proud. He was disappointed that he wasn’t convicted of killing more people than his idol, Chikatilo, convicted of 52 murders in 1992. His goal was kill 64 - one for every space on a chessboard. Why? Why did he want to kill anyone? Who did he kill? How did he kill them? And how did he get away with it for so damn long? We look into all of this, in another dark, October, true crime edition, of Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>Hims</strong>!
