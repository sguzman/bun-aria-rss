Join the Great Mashed Potato Debate of 2021 as the guys discuss the importance of prioritizing family time and \"acceptable\" Thanksgiving meal items.\n\n30:28- Mindset or Environment? Which one dictates your behavior? Your mentality, how you think about everything is important no matter where you are.
