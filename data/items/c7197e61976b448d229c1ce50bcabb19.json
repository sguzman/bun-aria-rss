  "description": "At some point in the past decade, Kurt Andersen felt like he had to figure out America. Coming from a professional career rooted in satire and troublemaking, Kurt had a pretty good vantage point to examine the tug of war between reason and magical thinking that has become a chronic American condition. Kurt talks with Marc about putting this all into his book, Fantasyland, and recalls the founding of Spy Magazine, where he and Graydon Carter took pleasure messing with public institutions like the New York Times, Hollywood, and Donald Trump. They also talk about Kurt's time at the Harvard Lampoon and how he came to host Studio 360. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/lights-out-with-david-spade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lights Out with David Spade</a>, <a href=\"http://stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stamps.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://ziprecruiter.com/maron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZipRecruiter</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
