  "description": "<p>Will Henry, co-proprietor at <a href= \"https://www.lumenwines.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lumen Wines</a> in the cool climate AVAs of Santa Barbara, talks about his life in surfing, environmental activism, photography, and wine. He educates us on Santa Barbara and helps us understand why the region is world class.  Will is partners with Lane Tanner, a force in the Santa Barbara wine industry who help jump start the region in the 1980s. Lumen makes wines that are beautiful examples of how the cool climate of Santa Maria Valley, Sta. Rita Hills, and surrounding areas can result in restrained, yet sunkissed wines. Awesome stuff!!</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Will tells us how he made the jump from sociology major to cellar rat, then to surfing photographer and philanthropist, and now to winery owner (he’s been busy).</li> <li>We talk about the various appellations of Santa Barbara and why it makes such fantastic wine. We discuss the grapes and wine styles too!</li> <li>Will and I debate the effects of the movie 2005 movie <em>Sideways</em>on Pinot Noir and Santa Barbara as a wine region. We discuss why Paso Robles has, in recent years, been so much more popular than Santa Barbara as a tourist destination and why we should all go visit SB!</li> <li>We get a glimpse into Lumen – Will and Lane’s philosophy and why they do what they do. (Spoiler alert: Lane Tanner will be on to give us a more in depth look at the winery next season!). </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> Thanks for listening!
