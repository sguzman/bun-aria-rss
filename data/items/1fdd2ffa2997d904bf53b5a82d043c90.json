It's about rejecting the notion that your best possible state is exactly the same as everyone else's, owning the fact that you are one person with highly unique needs and optimizing everything from your health to your performance around what works best for you. Regardless of whether anyone else responds to something different.</p><p>Generic, broad-based, minimally-effective solutions are out.

So she decided to take things into her own hands. To start treating herself as an \"n of 1\" and hack her own system, with a deep focus on non-pharmaceutical ways to normalize and optimize her hormones.</p><p>That led not only to a profound change in Sara's health, weight, ability and life, but a dramatic shift in the way she practiced medicine and sought to serve others.</p><p>We go deep into this journey and explore the intersection between medicine, biohacking, hormones and life in this week's conversation.</p><p>Watch this week’s episode here, subscribe for our weekly updates below and be sure to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project-podcast/id647826736\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>listen and subscribe on iTunes</strong></a>&nbsp;so you never miss an episode and you get to take each juicy conversation on the go.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
