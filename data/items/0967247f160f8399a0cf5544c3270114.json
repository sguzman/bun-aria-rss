  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obedience is hard when the sun is shining and life is good, but what about when the storm clouds come? When you get a scary diagnosis, or your business goes bankrupt, or your friend rejects you for your faith—this is when obedience feels costly, even like death. The Bible might tell us to expect suffering, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy when it comes. Our natural response in suffering is to turn inward and to focus on ourselves. So when the call to obey comes up, it feels like even more is being taken from us. But in this episode, Laura and Emily provide encouragement for the sufferer, and gospel hope that even costly obedience leads to life.</span> <p>____</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re so thankful for</span> <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ESV Single Column Journaling Bible®, Artist Series</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this mini-series possible!</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">This collection of journaling Bibles celebrates the treasure of God’s word through the artistic talents of his people.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each artist offers a visual entry point focused on a biblical theme or passage, all designed to help readers engage with the Bible.</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Head to</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their website</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to view the beautiful covers and order your copy.
