  "description": "Having obtained both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in bioinformatics, I would like to describe how I experienced studying bioinformatics. Moreover, I would like to discuss whether it was worth studying in the first place, and, finally, to offer some advice to prospective students and graduates.\nWhat is Bioinformatics? Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with developing and applying methods from computer science on biological problems."
