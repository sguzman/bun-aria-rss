  "description": "<p>This week we could not be more psyched to be joined by comedian, writer and actor Solomon Georgio, who you may know from his work on Shrill and High Fidelity. On this action-packed episode, we discuss whether we keep in touch with people from our childhood and debate the need for adult-sized Lunchables. Plus, we get in-depth about the history of the beloved childhood juice, squeezits, and if we really want to see snack foods advertised as sentient beings. Finally, we revisit our change.dork segment where we imagine a world where \"Weird Al\" Yankovic performs at the Super Bowl and Jonah starts a public feud with Maroon 5 that is sure to be making headlines all over the Internet by the time you read this.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
