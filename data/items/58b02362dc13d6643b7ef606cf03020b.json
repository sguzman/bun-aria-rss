  "itunes:summary": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia led to one of the biggest crises our world has ever faced.\nUp until that moment, the Cuban Missile Crisis was probably the closest we have come, until recent events, to World War III.\nIn October 1962, there was a standoff between President Kennedy of the United States and Premier Khrushchev of the Soviet Union over planting missiles in Cuba. The crisis was averted because communication was established.\nIt was decided to put one red telephone on the desk of the President of the United States, and another on the desk of the Premier of Soviet Russia. The communication link was called the ‘hotline’.\nCommunication is vital to all relationships. Setting aside time to build and nurture communication is essential. Jesus has given you a ‘hotline’ to God, but it is not just for emergency use – it is to be used all the time.",
