  "title": "Parkland Students Bring Gun Debate Front And Center",
  "description": "Exactly a week after 17 of their teachers and classmates were shot and killed, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida traveled to Tallahassee to meet with lawmakers, and urge them to take action on guns. Others went to the White House for a listening session with President Trump. And still others took part in a CNN Town Hall, where they confronted senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson and the NRA. Something about this moment feels different — but is it? This episode, host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, congressional correspondent Susan Davis, political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben and national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
