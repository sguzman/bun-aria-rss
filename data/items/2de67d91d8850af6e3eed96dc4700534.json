What captured your attention and made you dream and get excited when you were younger and had no cares or limitations on what was possible or not? Are those things still captivating you now or have you lost sight of them? When you consider what you are now passionate about and excited to accomplish, is there a relation between then and now? This conversation with Ben Greenfield dives into the notion of being pulled toward natural talent and abilities from childhood and Ben’s inclination to allow those things to clue you in on a purpose worth pursuing. Tom shares the reason he’s leaned into the notion of being able to develop skills even in the absence of natural talent. The ideas Ben and Tom explore take you from childhood to reimaging what heaven and the afterlife could possibly be and everything in between.   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction 0:47 | Pulled Toward Natural Abilities 12:34 | Discovering Purpose with Talent 17:18 | Creating Purpose without Talent 24:49 | Rite of Passage for Ben’s Sons 50:08 | What Dissolving the Ego Means 54:52 | Don’t Have to be the Hero 1:01:08 | Responding to Human Touch 1:10:35 | Your Food’s Energy Matters 1:15:12 | Physical and Spiritual Connection 1:20:04 | What the Afterlife Could Be 1:27:48 | Defining a Perfect World   QUOTES: “The key part of the rite of passage is being alone, facing your fears, finding yourself in a space where you must dissolve your ego and understand that there are forces of nature that are more powerful than you.” [31:52]   “Don't try to fix people as much as just try to love people.” [1:01:03]   “The spiritual energy that you get from eating real, whole food derived from nature, as close to nature as possible, there's a certain sacredness in that [...] not just physical, but also a spiritual energy...” [1:12:07]   “As creatures on this planet, we can't disconnect ourselves from the life force of every other creature on this planet.” [1:15:14]   Follow Ben Greenfield: Website: <a href=\"https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/</a> YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bengreenfieldfitness\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/user/bengreenfieldfitness</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bengreenfield\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/bengreenfield</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bengreenfieldfitness/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/bengreenfieldfitness/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BGFitness/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/BGFitness/</a> Podcast: <a href=\"https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/</a>",
