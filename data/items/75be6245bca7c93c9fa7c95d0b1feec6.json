  "description": "<p>Justin messed up by deciding to go and speak for Kirk (and the show) by DMing the Viva La Stool account telling them to stop tagging the show in tweets promoting Chris. Kirk has some thoughts on a Jaylen Brown for Kevin Durant trade. A radio consultant reviews the show and wants Kirk to reset the show every now and then. Vince McMahon has officially retired and #KirkWasRight. Justin’s car is absolutely disgusting. John Stewart declines to participate in “Win a Date With John Stewart”, calls, and more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
