  "description": "With the presidential election just around the corner, 2020 is set to be a big year in the markets. The results of the election will inevitably affect your investments.   Curzio’s own Daniel Creech is back on the podcast to discuss his take on the candidates and how to play election season going forward.   We also discuss how we go about researching our newsletters… and how to manage the volatility of small-cap stocks in your portfolio [13:31].   As we roll into January, we’re about to enter a very important time of the year: conference season. Conferences are some of my favorite places to conduct my boots-on-the-ground research. I break down how attending or following these conferences can lead to incredible gains… and which ones you should be paying attention to in 2020 [42:41]. ------------------------------- Editor's note: In this week's episode, you'll learn all about today's launch of 2-Second Trader. Members receive a trade alert each week based on Rich Suttmeier's incredible algo-trading system. Plus, this service can tell you when to buy or sell almost any stock—at any time. . -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
