  "description": "Three stories of Loki, the infamous trickster from Norse mythology. Most of his hijinks are light-hearted, and end with him getting his comeuppance, but it comes in the form of being a bridesmaid at Thor's wedding or (as in this episode) an extremely uncomfortable game of tug-of-war. What happens when a trick gets taken too far? What is the final act that turns friends into enemies and creates a rift that will consume the worlds? The creatures this week are squat hairy naked dudes. Again. These ones are watching their sodium intake, though. Sponsors!
