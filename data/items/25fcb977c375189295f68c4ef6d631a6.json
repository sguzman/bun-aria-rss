  "description": "Hello everyone. I'm Jane Coaston, senior politics reporter at Vox with a focus on conservatism (Ezra will be back from vacation next week). \n\"Antiracism… is now a new and increasingly dominant religion” writes John McWhorter, “it is what we worship, as sincerely and fervently as many worship God and Jesus.”\nMcWhorter is a Professor of English at Columbia University, a contributing editor to The Atlantic, and an outspoken critic of what he calls “third-wave antiracism.” He believes that our increasingly religious national discourse around race -- with its focus on “safe spaces,” “wokeness” and “white privilege” -- is not only wrongheaded, but even dangerous.\nBut McWhorter isn't that easy to pin down. He acknowledges racism’s pernicious effects on communities of color, but believes that while we are busy calling out individual racism, we are ignoring the issues that most impact black lives: an endless War on Drugs, an unequal education system, and attacks on reproductive and voting rights.\nIn this conversation, we explore what terms like “woke” and “diversity” actually mean, the types of issues that really do impact black communities, the legacy of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the potential virtues of virtue signaling, why The Phantom Menace was (objectively) a terrible movie and much more.\n I hope y’all have as much fun with this conversation as I did.\nReferences: \nJohn's essay \"The Virtue Signalers Won’t Change the World\" \nBook recommendations: \nA Death in the Rainforest: How a Language and a Way of Life Came to an End in Papua New Guinea by Don Kulick \nAmerican Pastoral by Philip Roth \nFurious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee by Casey Cep\nFollow Jane on Twitter @cjane87\nWant to contact the show?
