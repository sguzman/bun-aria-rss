  "description": "<p>The exile’s return to the motherland is the theme around which Lory Bedikian’s poem “On the Way to Oshagan”<i> </i>circles. She, a proud Armenian, stops by a roadside stall on a trip to her home country; and is immediately understood as an <i>Amerigatzi</i>, even though she’s speaking Armenian, not English. The poem could end with this awkward exchange, but instead pushes through, and a connection occurs between the returned-departed and the never-departed: there’s a gift, an invitation, and a bridge across exile.</p><p>Lory Bedikian received her BA from UCLA with an emphasis in Creative Writing and Poetry. She earned her MFA in Poetry from the University of Oregon, where she received the Dan Kimble First Year Teaching Award for Poetry. Bedikian's <i>The Book of Lamenting</i> won the 2010 Philip Levine Prize in Poetry. She currently teaches poetry workshops in Los Angeles.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/lory-bedikian-on-the-way-to-oshagan/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
