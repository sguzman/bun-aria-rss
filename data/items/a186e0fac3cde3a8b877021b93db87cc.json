  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys talk about game 5 of the NBA Finals, and cover how heartbreaking it was to see Kevin Durant go down with perhaps a torn achilles. They cover their reactions to the whole the ordeal, the game in general, and what this means going forward. They also get into NHL Finals chatter, Justin Bieber making the colossal mistake of challenging Tom Cruise to a fight, and Pat and the guys do a deep dive into the Women’s World Cup to educate people that it’s going on right now, and to discuss the incredible soccer being played ahead of the US’s match today. They also chat about potentially becoming a baseball show during the dog days of summer, and what the MLB can do to get the average viewer excited about baseball games, and Pat and the guys give a shoutout for David Ortiz, as Big Papi is still recovering from surgery after an assassination attempt in the Dominican Republic. Also, at the end of the show, fresh off absolutely crushing America’s Got Talent, one of the funniest human beings in the world right now, and hopefully an eventual AGT champion, Indianapolis native, Ryan Niemiller joins the show. He and the guys discuss his road to where he’s at, why he thinks about the way he basically just blew up over night, he talks about the AGT process leading up to everything, what some of his favorite hobbies to do when not performing stand up comedy, and when to potentially see him in the future. It’s an incredible interview with someone who hopefully wins this season of America’s Got Talent, we’re pulling for him (1:18:46-2:34:06). Today’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
