  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about the Hall of Fame game, and why it's nice to just have football back, and they bounce around to several different training camps and look into who has been impressing, and what we can take away from the limited amount we've seen from practice. Joining the progrum to chat about this weekend's second Ice is War event in Edmonton, Alberta, is former GM of the Dansbury Trashers and friend of the show, AJ Galante (18:47-34:46). Later, NFL Insider for NFL Network, and friend of the progrum, Ian Rapoport joins the show to chat about what happens next in the Deshaun Watson case and what he's hearing about what the suspension may be, if Watson's legal team plans to appeal, and his thoughts on what he's seen boots on the ground at several different NFL training camps (1:30:59-1:54:56). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
