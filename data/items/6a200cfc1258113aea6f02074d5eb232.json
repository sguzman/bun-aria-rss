  "description": "<p>Twitter has begun rolling out support for the new, more expensive version of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-price-increasing-8-per-month-180319987.html\"><ins>Blue subscription</ins></a>. As of Saturday, the company’s iOS app now reflects the fact users can pay $8 per month to obtain a verified account. The changelog notes people who sign up for Twitter Blue will receive a checkmark, “just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”</p><div id=\"9741d07d5fcf49699f244d28ec743068\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Twitter shipped its new Blue subscription for verification ahead of Musk’s Monday deadline given to employees.

Additionally, Twitter has yet to update its Android app, and the other perks Elon Musk promised would be part of the revamped Twitter Blue, such as the ability to post longer videos, are listed as “coming soon.” What the updated iOS app does include is a tweaked notification tab that features a column dedicated to displaying tweets solely from verified users.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It’s unclear when all the elements Musk promised will be in place, but he <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-considers-making-verification-a-twitter-blue-perk-051906957.html\"><ins>reportedly gave</ins></a> employees working on making verification a paid feature until November 7th to complete the work or else lose their jobs.
