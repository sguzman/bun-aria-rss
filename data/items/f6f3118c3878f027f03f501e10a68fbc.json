  "description": "<p>On today's ZBT we've got 5 rounds in the magazine .... \n\nROUND 1: A delightful tale of beautiful head. No, we aint talkin Blow Jibbers… A Luxury Bathroom curated by the troops @ Joint Base Lewis McChord will make you wanna flush every other latrine youve ever been to. \n\nROUND 2: Attention to detail remains important. A couple of inspectors at the Mexico= US Border discovered that some strawberry puree would leave you tweaking if you were to add it to your morning smoothie. \n\nROUND 3: Heroes among us. National forest fighter fighters (no word if they were volunteers or not) help rescue a woman who was in a precarious situation deep inside the woods. \n\nROUND 4: Some virtual fisticuffs happened this weekend. A Mil spouse battle took place on facebook and it’s an even more intense rivalry than Army/Navy games. \n\nRound 5: Elon Musk chat because we work on the internet and we have to or else it would be dereliction of duty.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
