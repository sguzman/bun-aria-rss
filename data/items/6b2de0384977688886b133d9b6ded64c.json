  "description": "Daniel Alarcón's (@DanielGAlarcon) new book of short stories, \"The King Is Always Above The People,\" deals closely with immigration and the Latino experience. Alarcón talks to Sam about his own life immigrating from Peru to the U.S. at a young age, the Latino diaspora, and reinventing oneself in a new place. Though Alarcón didn't intend for it to be political, his book gets at what it means to be an immigrant in today's political climate. Alarcón is also host of NPR's Spanish-language podcast, Radio Ambulante. E-mail the It's Been A Minute team at samsanders@npr.org or tweet @NPRItsBeenAMin with your feedback.
