  "description": "In a programme first broadcast in 2017, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss why some birds migrate and others do not, how they select their destinations and how they navigate the great distances, often over oceans. For millennia, humans set their calendars to birds' annual arrivals, and speculated about what happened when they departed, perhaps moving deep under water, or turning into fish or shellfish, or hibernating while clinging to trees upside down. Ideas about migration developed in C19th when, in Germany, a stork was noticed with an African spear in its neck, indicating where it had been over the winter and how far it had flown. Today there are many ideas about how birds use their senses of sight and smell, and magnetic fields, to find their way, and about why and how birds choose their destinations and many questions. Why do some scatter and some flock together, how much is instinctive and how much is learned, and how far do the benefits the migrating birds gain outweigh the risks they face?\n\nWith \n\nBarbara Helm\nReader at the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow\n\nTim Guilford\nProfessor of Animal Behaviour and Tutorial Fellow of Zoology at Merton College, Oxford\n\nand \n\nRichard Holland\nSenior Lecturer in Animal Cognition at Bangor University\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
