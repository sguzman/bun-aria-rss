  "description": "<p>Tim Dillon and Dan St Germain came over to talk about conspiracy theories. Both those guys are way into that stuff so that's all they talk about anyway. </p> <p> </p> <p>Get Dan's brand new comedy album, No Real Winners Here at DanStGermain.net or wherever you buy albums. I think I said 500 times that it was called Bad At The Good Times but that was his old album. I messed up. Get No Real Winners Here. I mean, get both if you want. He's been funny for a long time. But definitely get No Real Winners Here. At Danstgermain.net. Jesus. The whole reason we even got the idea to do the podcast in the first place was to use the opportunity to hype his album. And then I didn't even get that part right. I mean, come on. So please help me make up for that by making No Real Winners Here the top album on iTunes. Get it. It'll be a good purchase regardless of my mess-up. But now it'll also help get me out of a mistake. Please. Or if you don't buy albums, at least go listen to it on Spotify and tell Dan how you like it. No Real Winners Here. </p> <p> </p> <p>And Watch Tim Dillon on the Netflix 15 minutes sets. Streaming now. </p> <p> </p> <p>I'm in Edinburgh at the Fringe Festival every day at 6pm at the Hive. It smells like vomit and there's no cell phone reception. I love it there. You can get tickets ahead of time before they sell out and then pay what you want after the show. Or, I save as many seats as I can for walkups for no charge. But get there EARLY!</p> <p>In September I'll be in Austin at Cap City Comedy Club. October in Phoenix, November through Europe. Tickets on sale at arishaffir.com/tour</p> <p> </p> <p>Oh! And I forgot to remind you. Shroomfest is August 25-27 this year. Last minute efforts right now to get supplies. See you on the other siiiiide.</p>",
