  "description": "<p>Remember the first Gulf War? No you don't! At least, not according to French postmodern philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who wrote a series of essays during and after the Gulf War explaining why it wasn't happening. At least, it wasn't happening the way we all thought it was. It has something to do with simulacra and hyperreality and a bunch words none of us understand, but Connor and Dan try their damnedest in this new ep of Drunken Philosophy! Enjoy!</p>",
