  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, there are two nations facing a soft or silent (non-violent) coup attempt, the United States and Israel. Just as the President of the United States has been subjected to false FISA warrants, spying, special counsel investigations and now impeachment, the same is going on in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Part of the problem is that the people are getting scammed by the leftists media in both countries. Then, critics of this program are now attacking Mark’s satirical humor. Obviously a system that is designed to remove a sitting president cannot be used once that individual is no longer a sitting president. Lamentably, leftwing ideologues in the media will try to pass anything off as fact. Later, Joy Behar is upset that Trump's approval is going up and support for impeachment is going down. Afterward, President Trump took to Fox News to discuss the \"fake whistleblower\", which this program has noted does not legally qualify for anonymity under the Inspector Generals' whistleblower statute.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
