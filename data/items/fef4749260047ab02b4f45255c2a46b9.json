  "description": "<p>Image segmentation is important in medical imaging, providing valuable,\nquantitative information for clinical decision-making in diagnosis, therapy,\nand intervention. The state-of-the-art in automated segmentation remains\nsupervised learning, employing discriminative models such as U-Net. However,\ntraining these models requires access to large amounts of manually labelled\ndata which is often difficult to obtain in real medical applications. In such\nsettings, semi-supervised learning (SSL) attempts to leverage the abundance of\nunlabelled data to obtain more robust and reliable models. Recently, generative\nmodels have been proposed for semantic segmentation, as they make an attractive\nchoice for SSL. Their ability to capture the joint distribution over input\nimages and output label maps provides a natural way to incorporate information\nfrom unlabelled images. This paper analyses whether deep generative models such\nas the SemanticGAN are truly viable alternatives to tackle challenging medical\nimage segmentation problems. To that end, we thoroughly evaluate the\nsegmentation performance, robustness, and potential subgroup disparities of\ndiscriminative and generative segmentation methods when applied to large-scale,\npublicly available chest X-ray datasets.\n</p>",
