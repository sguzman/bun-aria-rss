It was about the reality of her day-to-day life as an ER doc during the early days of the pandemic. It was a devastating, powerful, deeply human read. That led me to her beautiful and, at times, heartbreaking, yet hopeful New York Times bestselling memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-beauty-in-breaking-a-memoir/9780525537380\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Beauty in Breaking.</em></a><em> (</em>https://bookshop.org/books/the-beauty-in-breaking-a-memoir/9780525537380)</p><p>Graduating from Harvard and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, for her entire career, Michele has sought emergency medicine positions in hospitals that serve under-resourced communities, often communities of color.
