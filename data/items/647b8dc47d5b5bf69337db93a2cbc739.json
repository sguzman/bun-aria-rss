  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, Sam is joined by Christopher Prendergast, Professor Emeritus of Modern French Literature at Cambridge and the author of the new book <em>Living and Dying With Marcel Proust</em>. In the centenary year of Proust's death (and the English publication of <em>Swann's Way</em>) he tells Sam (among other things) how the structure of <em>A La Recherche </em>is more straightforward than many think, why that madeleine was nearly a slice of toast, and about the great unsayable at the heart of Proust's great story.   </div>\n",
