  "description": "Greg Jenner is joined by historian Dr Gillian Kenny and comedian Catherine Bohart in 16th century Ireland to look at the life of the pirate queen, Grainne O’Malley. Against the backdrop of the changing legal landscape of Ireland as it faced brutality from incoming English administrators, we hear about the difficult decisions Grainne was forced to make to ensure her family's survival. From bold changes to her appearance as a teenager to ensure her place on her father's ship, to aggressive actions on a castle that refused to serve her food. Grainne O’Malley was not a woman to be messed with and this strength and defiance would lead to an unlikely understanding with Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nProduced by Cornelius Mendez\nScript by Greg Jenner and Emma Nagouse\nResearch by Jessica White\n\nA production by The Athletic for BBC Radio 4.",
