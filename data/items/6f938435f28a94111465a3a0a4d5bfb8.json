  "description": "Special Operations Forces Truth #1: Humans are more important than hardware. Guest Vice Admiral Timothy Szymanski shares how he made the difficult decision to go to the Naval Academy, almost was removed during an academic board, faced a conduct board his junior year for misbehavior, and then changed career goals from being a Navy pilot to answering the call to become a SEAL. <br /><br />Vice Admiral Szymanski explains how his experiences built a foundation of resiliency and determination.  The ability of special operations forces to persevere mentally through the BUD/S and later transitioning to a leadership role. Mistakes will be made, but accountability and the idea that “failure is not final”, and “no is not terminal” is the theme of his story. <br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> SOFcast is the U.S. Special Operations Command official podcast where we harness the power of storytelling to connect you directly to thought-provoking and unique perspectives from our force.
