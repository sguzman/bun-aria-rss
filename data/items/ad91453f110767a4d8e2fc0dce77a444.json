  "description": "There is someone that isn't happy that the family of Zeus and Hera is sitting on Olympus. Well, there are many people that aren't happy about it. Actually most people except for Zeus and his family aren't thrilled about it. Even then, they all kind of hate each other. Regardless, someone finally comes along to do something about Zeus and his ilk. Someone from their past...and she's coming with an army...an army that has the ability to finally put an end to the Olympians once and for all. The creature this time is a jacked angry unicorn with fabulous hair. --- If you have time, please go to http://takemysurvey.net and take a quick survey. It would be a massive help for me and Myths and Legends.
