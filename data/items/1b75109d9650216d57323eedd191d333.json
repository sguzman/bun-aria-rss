  "description": "<p>Conscious Prayer – Finding Refuge in Loving Awareness (retreat talk) - Prayer is a communing with our enlarged being. This talk examines less conscious forms of prayer, and how we can evolve the power of our prayers by opening into the depth of our longing, and reaching toward our true belonging (given at the 2016 IMCW Spring Retreat).</p> <p>How I yearn to belong to something, to be contained in an all-embracing mind that sees me as a single thing.<br /> And I yearn to be held in the great hands of your heart.<br /> Oh let them take me now.<br /> Into your hands I place these fragments, my life, and you my God spend them however you want.<br /> ~ Rainer Maria Rilke</p>",
