  "description": "We bring you possibly the most important episode in Pick Six podcast history. The Bengals are unfathomably in the Super Bowl for the first time in 33 years so we had to bring on two Cincy legends that played not only in Super Bowl 23 but also in Super Bowl 16. Will Brinson and John Breech welcome on John's dad, Jim, who is the leading scorer in Bengals history as well as the greatest left tackle of all time, Anthony Munoz. The former Bengals discuss their excitement around this year's team including when they realized this group could be special and their favorite moments of the playoff run. They also highlight how deserving the Cincinnati fans are and focus on the kicking of Evan McPherson and the offensive line play before dishing out keys to victory for Super Bowl 56. Then, the fun continues as Munoz and Breech take us down memory lane for the Freezer Bowl as well as Super Bowl 16 and Super Bowl 23 with endless stories you won't believe.\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
