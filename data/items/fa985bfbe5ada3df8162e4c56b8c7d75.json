  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life Podcast this week, our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins, and Thomas Banks sit down for a special conversation with Jason Baxter, author of <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3CKyqQY\">The Medieval Mind of C. S. Lewis</a></em>. Jason is a speaker, writer, and college professor who writes primarily on medieval thought and is especially interested in Lewis’ ideas. You can find out more about him and his books at <a href= \"https://www.jasonmbaxter.com/\">JasonMBaxter.com</a>.</p> <p>Our hosts and Jason discuss a wide range of ideas, including the values of literature, the sacramental view of reality, why it is important to understand medieval thought, the “problem” of paganism in Lewis’ writings, and how to approach reading ancient and medieval literature.</p> <p>Be back next week when we will begin digging into Bram Stoker’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3RJeVMN\">Dracula</a></em> together and learning more about this late Victorian Gothic novel. It’s not what you might think!</p> <p>Get the latest news from <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/\">House of Humane Letters</a> by signing up for their e-newsletter today!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>My part has been merely that of Walter Scott’s Old Mortality, who busied himself in clearing the moss, and bringing back to light the words, on the gravestones of the dead who seemed to him to have served humanity. This needs to be done and redone, generation after generation, in a world where there persists always a strong tendency to read newer writers, not because they are better, but because they are newer. The moss grows fast, and ceaselessly.</p> <cite>F. L. Lucas</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>It is the memory of time that makes us old; remembering eternity makes us young again.</p> <cite>Statford Caldecott</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>It is my settled conviction that in order to read old Western literature aright, you must suspend most of the responses and unlearn most of the habits you have acquired in reading modern literature.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis, from <a href= \"https://archive.org/details/DeDescriptioneTemporum/mode/2up\">“De Descriptione Temporum”</a></cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>What then is the good of–what is even the defense for–occupying our hearts with stories of what never happened and entering vicariously into feeling which we should try to avoid in our own person?…The nearest I have yet got to an answer is that we seek an enlargement of our being. We want to be more than ourselves…[In] reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the Greek poem, I see with myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <h3>Victory</h3> <p><em>by C. S. Lewis</em></p> <p>Roland is dead, Cuchulain’s crest is low,<br /> The battered war-rear wastes and turns to rust,<br /> And Helen’s eyes and Iseult’s lips are dust<br /> And dust the shoulders and the breasts of snow.</p> <p>The faerie people from our woods are gone,<br /> No Dryads have I found in all our trees,<br /> No Triton blows his horn about our seas<br /> And Arthur sleeps far hence in Avalon.</p> <p>The ancient songs they wither as the grass<br /> And waste as doth a garment waxen old,<br /> All poets have been fools who thought to mould<br /> A monument more durable than brass.</p> <p>For these decay: but not for that decays<br /> The yearning, high, rebellious spirit of man<br /> That never rested yet since life began<br /> From striving with red Nature and her ways.</p> <p>Now in the filth of war, the baresark shout<br /> Of battle, it is vexed. And yet so oft<br /> Out of the deeps, of old, it rose aloft<br /> That they who watch the ages may not doubt.</p> <p>Though often bruised, oft broken by the rod,<br /> Yet, like the phoenix, from each fiery bed<br /> Higher the stricken spirit lifts its head<br /> And higher-till the beast become a god.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yPxatr\">Beauty in the Word</a></em> by Stratford Caldecott</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MKHhFO\">An Experiment in Criticism</a></em> by C.
