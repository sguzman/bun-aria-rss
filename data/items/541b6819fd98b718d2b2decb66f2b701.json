  "description": "Every so often, the thirst stars align, or the thirst goddesses smile down on us, or whatever you want to call it... and well, it all came together for us this week. We manifested a long held TAK desire — we got to interview Jake Johnson! ::scream:: He told us about his new adult animated show Hoops, working on Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, and why he thinks the pandemic has affected the way people see Nick Miller. \nIn Slate Plus, we spoke to a few of our very favourite writers of romance and romantic comedy novels — Rebekah Weatherspoon, Alisha Rai, Mhairi McFarlane, Jasmine Guillory, and Alyssa Cole — and asked them three burning questions about romance world building, meet-cutes, fave tropes, and how the pandemic is changing the way they write.\nAs usual, you can follow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Our music is by Tanya Morgan. You can find show notes, and more on our Tumblr at thirstaidkitpodcast.tumblr.com.
