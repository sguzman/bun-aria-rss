The winner will be announced on October 2, 2020 on the <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/ANGStanford\">House of Humane Letters Facebook page</a>!</p> <p>Angelina opens the discussions with the point that Lewis changes the story of Psyche throughout the book, especially in this section. Cindy shares how the last couple of chapters in this week's reading made her feel and the tension of wanting to choose sides. In these scenes, we see again the theme of disordered loves and the rift in the relationship between Orual and Psyche, as well as Orual's descent further into self-deception.
