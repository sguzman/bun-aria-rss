  "description": "James T. Harris is on the program discussing child development, figures of authority, and above all, respect. The impeachment hearings will go on, but nothing of substance will come of them. President Trump continues to act on behalf of the American people, even while the entire opposition in Congress wastes countless hours trying to get rid of him. James recounts the students he taught who sought to find solutions to poverty in inner cities. Their motives were pure, but their reasoning was fundamentally flawed. Is there a war being waged against Thanksgiving? A video filmed at a “Christian” college in Minnesota sure makes it appear that way.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
