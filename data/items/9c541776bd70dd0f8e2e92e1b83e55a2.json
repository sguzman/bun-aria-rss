  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news that the NFL has officially decided to move the Steelers/Titans to Monday night, and to chat about everything going on with that situation, Pat welcomes in ESPN NFL Insider, the king of the Adam Bomb, Adam Schefter (5:17-11:40). Next, 17 Year NFL Quarterback, 3x Pro Bowler, and current NFL analyst on ESPN NFL Countdown, Matt Hasselbeck joins the program. Pat and Matt discuss the situation going on with the Titans, and how having to potentially play on Tuesday would hurt the Steelers. Plus Matt explains what Joe Burrow needs to do better so he doesn't get killed, and his thoughts on the Bears QB carousel (22:31-50:15). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, member of the Broncos 50th anniversary team, and current color commentator for NFL on Fox, Mark \"Stink\" Schlereth joins the show. Pat and Mark chat about how difficult it would be to play a game on Sunday without having any physical reps during the week, especially for an offensive lineman, who he thinks is going to get fired first, Vic Fangio or Adam Gase, what game he's calling this weekend, and much more (53:06-1:16:42). Lastly, on another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ discuss everything going on with the outbreak in the Tennessee Titans locker room, plus dive through the ESPN power rankings and give their thoughts (1:16:44-1:47:52).
