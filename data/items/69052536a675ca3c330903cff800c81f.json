    "media:description": "www.strandbeest.com \nJust like our bodies, beach animals are made up of elementary building blocks: the cells. Our cells copy themselves, but strandbeest cells are copied by students. The cells of a strandbeest  are nothing more than a tube with holes in it on specific places. Those tubes are attached to other tubes with tie-wraps. After three hours, a beach animal was born. At a wind speed of 25 km/h, the beast could walk on the wind (without a sail).",
