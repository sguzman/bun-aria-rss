  "description": "<p>WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. We learn a lot of coping mechanisms when we’re younger. They help us get through tough times. But so many of us are still carrying around tactics that are no longer needed. They can make us defensive. They can prevent us from developing relationships. And they can hold us back from our goals. We need to “update our software.” Our situation has changed, but our brain has stayed the same. By working through your issues and not being afraid to change, we can learn healthier ways to move through the world. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about letting go of the things that no longer serve us with a world-famous comedian: Whitney Cummings. Whitney Cummings is a stand-up comedian, actress and producer. She created the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls, the NBC sitcom Whitney, and the movie The Female Brain. She was also a producer and writer for the ABC revival of Roseanne. So get ready to learn all about codependency and reinventing yourself on Episode 832.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhen did you realize you were good at stand up? (6:30)<br />\nWhat are you most proud of? (29:00)<br />\nWho was more influential growing up- mom or dad? (51:00)<br />\nHow do you deal with the Hollywood ups and downs?
