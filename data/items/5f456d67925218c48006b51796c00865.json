  "description": "<p>BE A CONSCIOUS SAMARITAN. Most of us know the parable of The Good Samaritan. It tells the story of an injured man at the side of the road. The priest crosses to the other side and ignores the man in need of help. The Levite does the same.  The Samaritan, though, stops and cares for the man. But let’s zoom out a bit. Is there something we could do on a more global scale so that less men are left injured and uncared for on the side of the road? People are living with chronic trauma. Every day is a struggle. If there is a way to help more people at once, we should be open to making those changes. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about caring for those who are in need with a 2020 candidate for President of the United States: Marianne Williamson. Marianne Williamson is an internationally acclaimed lecturer, activist and author of four #1 New York Times bestselling books. She has been a popular guest on television programs such as Oprah, Good Morning America, and Bill Maher. In 1989, she founded Project Angel Food, a meals-on-wheels program that serves homebound people with AIDS in the Los Angeles area. To date, Project Angel Food has served over 11 million meals. Marianne also co-founded the Peace Alliance. Marianne is seeking to harness the power of love to fight the hate she sees in the world. She teaches us to go “all in” for the causes we believe in while being unattached to the result. So get ready to learn how to overcome the fear of failure and change the world on Episode 838.<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/838 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
