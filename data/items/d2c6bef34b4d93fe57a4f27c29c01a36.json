He recently got engaged and the family didn&rsquo;t know he was that serious about this woman. She&rsquo;s cute but she&rsquo;s clueless. She&rsquo;s 57 years old and she got divorced about 4 years ago and doesn&rsquo;t know how to do anything for herself. She&rsquo;s never paid bills, bought groceries or put gas in her car. My uncle thinks it's cute, but as he gets older, it won&rsquo;t be practical..................................</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
