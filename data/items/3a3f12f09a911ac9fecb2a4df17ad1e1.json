  "title": "Willie Robertson's Mistake After 'The Masked Singer'",
  "description": "Willie appears on “The Masked Singer” and the boys have plenty to say about his new attitude. Phil’s new dog isn’t much of a duck dog, but he'll clean your duck blind. Stone can't convince Phil that dogs don’t speak English. Si talks about how his weenie dog died and how he could have followed suit if he’d have made the wrong move. Si also gets into his battle with a former girlfriend's chihuahua and gives some “don’t ever do” advice about hornets. John-David shares fan stories of their first kills and answers questions about hunting other people’s land and finding the right church.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
