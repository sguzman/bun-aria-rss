  "description": "<p>Rev. angel Kyodo williams has been bridging the worlds of liberation, love, and justice her entire adult life. Her critically acclaimed book, Being Black: Zen and the Art of Living With Fearlessness and Grace was hailed as “an act of love” by Pulitzer Prize winner Alice Walker, and \"a classic\" by Buddhist pioneer Jack Kornfield. And, her book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DEI3Pu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radical Dharma: Talking Race, Love & Liberation</em></a>, has been inviting communities to have the grounded, real, hard conversations necessary to become more awake and aware of what hinders liberation of self and society. Known for her willingness to sit with and speak uncomfortable truths with love. Rev. angel notes, \"Love and Justice are not two. Without inner change, there can be no outer change. Without collective change, no change matters.” And right now, we are in a moment where we need change, on every level, personal, interpersonal, cultural, and societal. Rev. angel was my guest on the show a number of years ago, and that led to a friendship that has been a true gift in my life. I wanted to invite her back both to explore her personal experience and evolution of thought around identity over the last few years, and also learn from her deeply wise, insightful and, for many, surprising lens on what it takes to step into this moment equipped for the quest for collective liberation.</p><p>You can find Rev. angel Kyodo williams at: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zenchangeangel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://angelkyodowilliams.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://go.revan.gl/belonging\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rev. angel's Belonging audio program</a></p><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/83ea764825570531f64dd801f171bfbd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bishop Michael Curry</a> about the healing power of love, even now.</p><p><strong>My new book is available for pre-order:</strong></p><p>Order&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked: Discover Your Unique Imprint for Work that Makes You Come Alive</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and get your book bonuses!</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
