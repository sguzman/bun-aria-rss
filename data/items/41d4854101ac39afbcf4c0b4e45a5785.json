  "title": "The Anti-Diet | Evelyn Tribole (January, 2020)",
  "description": "I, like many people, have the potential to get pretty dysregulated around food and body image. A lot of men don’t talk about this stuff, but there is plenty of evidence that this is a unisex issue. Especially during the holidays, when we’re surrounded by treats and stress-eating because we can’t see our family, or we can -- and they’re making us crazy. \nThis interview you’re about to hear changed my life. That’s an overused phrase, but in this case, it happens to be true. I came into this conversation with a rather hostile attitude toward my own body, filled with unrealistic expectations and unsustainable restrictions. Over the course of this encounter, you will hear my mind start to change. And ever since this interview was recorded, about a year ago, I have been working one-on-one with my guest, Evelyn Tribole, on these issues. \nEvelyn is the co-creator of something called “Intuitive Eating,” which you can think of as kind of the anti-diet. Diets, she argues, do not work. Worse, they lead us to mistrust our bodies, so we misread their signals and don’t even know when we’re hungry or when we’re full. Her approach is backed by science, and powered by mindfulness. \nWhere to find Evelyn Tribole online: \nWebsite: https://www.evelyntribole.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/etribole\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/evelyn.tribole\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/evelyntribole/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfkldY3O0ly3XRh9B8Wt9A\nExcited about our upcoming New Year's Challenge?
