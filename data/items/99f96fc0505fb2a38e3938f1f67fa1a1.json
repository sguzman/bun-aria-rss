  "description": "Guest Dick O'Brien, Principal Editor at Symantec, joins Dave to discuss their team's research, \"Noberus: Technical Analysis Shows Sophistication of New Rust-based Ransomware.\" Noberus is new ransomware used in mid-November attack, ConnectWise was likely infection vector.\nSymantec, a division of Broadcom Software, tracks this ransomware as Ransom.Noberus and our researchers first spotted it on a victim organization on November 18, 2021, with three variants of Noberus deployed by the attackers over the course of that attack. This would appear to show that this ransomware was active earlier than was previously reported, with MalwareHunterTeam having told BleepingComputer they first saw this ransomware on November 21.\nNoberus is an interesting ransomware because it is coded in Rust, and this is the first time we have seen a professional ransomware strain that has been used in real-world attacks coded in this programming language. Noberus appears to carry out the now-typical double extortion ransomware attacks where they first steal information from victim networks before encrypting files. Noberus adds the .sykffle extension to encrypted files.\nThe research can be found here:\nNoberus: Technical Analysis Shows Sophistication of New Rust-based Ransomware",
