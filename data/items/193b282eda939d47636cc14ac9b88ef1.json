    "media:description": "In this video we analyze the trajectory of a moon about a star in search of a square orbit.  It turns out that it's not too difficult to create a reasonably square orbit.  Interestingly, the trajectory of a moon about a star is identical to the trajectory of a point on a wheel that rolls without slipping around the outside of a circle!\n\nSupport this channel: One of the most helpful things you can do to support this channel is to share this video with others you think would find it interesting.
