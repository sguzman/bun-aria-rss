  "description": "Sadie's good friend — and doppelgänger — Lydia Dozier has some solid advice for us about how her good friend started pursuing a relationship with her and how her heart changed about him. She also talks about how she went from a no-party girl to a never-miss-the-party girl and when she finally encountered the Lord and had her life transformed. Sadie and Lydia share hope for anyone who hates the cycle they find themselves in but can't find a way to stop. And Lydia describes how surrendering her life to the Lord led her to a role at Fellowship for Christian Athletes working with high school students. May the Lord give us eyes to see and ears to hear, the good and faithful way He cares for us every day.\n\nhttps://give.cru.org/sadie or text SADIE to 71326 — Get a free copy of Sadie's book \"Live on Purpose\" with your gift!\n\nhttps://abide.co/sadie — Get 25% OFF your premium subscription for a limited time!\n\nhttps://www.blueland.com/whoa — Get 15% off your first order of any Blueland products!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
