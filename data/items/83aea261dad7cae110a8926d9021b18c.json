  "description": "What ever happened to predictability? Well, we're throwing it out the window today, as special guests Liz Lopatto and Kwame Opam join Nilay and Sam, with a very special crossover cameo at the top of the show. It's a rare condition, this day and age, to read any good news on the newspaper page, so it's a mixed bag of topics this week. We've got Furious 7, Microsoft's newest Surface, the ongoing Californian drought, Amazon Dash and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Only time will tell if all these dreams fit under one umbrella, but we hope you enjoy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
