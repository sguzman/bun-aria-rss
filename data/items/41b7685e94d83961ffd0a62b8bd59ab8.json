    "media:description": "Top Solar Energy Producing Countries, Per Person, 1990 - 2022\nIn this video I look at countries trying to move off fossil fuels by producing more solar energy. I used per capita (per person) because it shows us who is putting more of their resources into the transition to solar energy.\n\nSolar energy has been used by humans since the beginning of time. The first use of solar energy was for cooking and heating. Here are some important dates in the history of solar energy production:\n\n1883 - First solar cells made from selenium at 1% efficiency\n1954 - First solar cells made from silicon at 6% efficiency, at $300/watt\n1960 - Hoffman Electronics achieve 14% efficiency by 1960\n1964 - Nimbus launched with solar panels able to power entire spacecraft.\n1973 - University of Delaware  builds first building powered by solar roof tiles similar to Tesla solar tech\n1979 - President Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the White House at $70/watt\n1985 - University of South Wales achieves 20% generation efficiency\n1999 - National Renewable Energy Laboratory achieves 33.3% efficiency\n2016 - University of South Wales achieves 34.5% generation efficiency\n\nThank you for watching! \n\nMusic: Epic Motivation by Roman Cano from melodyloops.com",
