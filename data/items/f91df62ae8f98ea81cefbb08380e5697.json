  "description": "President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment by every Senate Republican except … Romney. The former Republican presidential nominee changed his mind at the last minute, but was he ever a conservative? One caller asks Glenn how Romney, Mike Lee, and Harry Reid can all fit into the same church. And head researcher Jason Buttrill joins to preview tonight’s must-watch special. The evidence is clear: Everything from Benghazi to impeachment are linked, and it’s way beyond corruption! Glenn will expose what can only be described as Iran-Contra II: Obama’s secret wars. Catch “Ukraine: The Final Piece (The Billion-Dollar Question)” TONIGHT at 8 p.m. ET for FREE on YouTube and BlazeTV.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
