  "description": "Today I talked to Eric Rupp about his book The Transformational Travel Journal: Your Guide to Creating a Life-Changing Journey (TTC, 2020).\nEric Rupp is a founding partner at the Transformational Travel Council, and runs an insightful naturalist guiding company. He’s a traveler, storyteller, an engineer, a carpenter, a designer, and a woodsman. He’s built traditional Spanish stone homes in Andalucia, Spain, and run a small university in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. He currently splits his time on- and off-grid around Seattle, Washington.\nMy favorite part of this episode was Eric describing the Unpacking List before you go on a trip, i.e., preparing to dispense with one’s usual routines and mental habits to prepare for the life-affirming physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and mental challenge that a fulfilling travel experience will entail. Along the way, the episode touches on Joseph Campbell’s “hero” narrative, as a good journey has both an internal and external component. The episode also looks at how one might form new neural pathways through immersive sensory and social activities, and grow via meaningful conversations with fellow travelers. Finally, no journey is complete without reflecting on it afterwards.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of eight books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc. (https://www.sensorylogic.com).
