  "description": "<p>It's time for another taste of Field Hockey on the show today as we speak with Canadian Olympian Oliver Scholfield about his journey into the sport and his Olympic experience. We learn from Oliver just why we chose to stick with field hockey throughout his youth after playing a variety of different sports and just how his Olympic dream helped along the way. We also learn about how it was transitioning into playing the sport in Canada from the UK and how important it is to him to try to continue to grow the sport in the country moving forward. Added to this we find out just what the team mascot of Team Canada is and why they may not be invited back to play in Malaysia anytime soon. It's a fun and entertaining chat that you simply can't miss!</p>",
