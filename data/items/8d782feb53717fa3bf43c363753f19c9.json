  "description": "Our relationship to food goes far beyond its nutritional value. What we eat can help us tap into something deeper, whether it brings up treasured memories or allows us to escape our own lives for just a few bites. That duality is captured by two different books in today's episode; while <em>Crying in H Mart </em>by Michelle Zauner explores how cooking Korean food helped the author grieve her mom's death, <em>Gastro Obscura</em> by Cecily Wong and Dylan Thuras takes readers to each continent to learn about its cuisine. In interviews with NPR's Ari Shapiro, Zauner and Wong talk about how food shapes our worlds. ",
