  "description": "<p>It’s Christmas!!!! But what does Christmas have to teach us about economics? Well…quite a lot in fact as you’ll soon find out as you listen to this festive special by the Economics in Ten team. What’s the best present you can give according to economists? Should you get a real tree or a plastic one from an environmental economics perspective? What can the ‘12 Days of Christmas’ teach us about inflation? There are plenty more festive questions to be answered plus you get our guide to the top gifts to satisfy the budding economist in your household. Guiding you through as always are Pete and Gav, your friendly neighbourhood economists with technical support (and jingle bells) from Nic. Music comes from Jukedeck and you can create your own at <a href=\"http://jukedeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jukedeck.com</a>. Have a merry Christmas everyone!!!</p>\n",
