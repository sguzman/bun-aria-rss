  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, new details obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that Hunter Biden’s Ukrainian gas firm pressured former President Obama's State Department to end corruption allegations against Burisma from Britain and the U.S. There's lots more information on Hunter Biden in this new report but the Democrats in the press won't report on this because they are too busy pushing the notion that President Trump has obstructed justice — even though Congress doesn't have the authority to violate the separation of powers. Of course, the Senate can summarily dismiss these bogus charges and we the citizenry can change the makeup of the house by voting, short of that it’s a frustrating waiting game. At no other time in American history has Congress used subpoenas as the basis for an impeachment case. Historically, these matters have been negotiated by Congress and the White House, but when the entire process is a plot with no interest in negotiating any compromise it creates a crisis because there is no commitment to the rule of law. Then, Rep Adam Schiff says we don't need the Whistleblower but the problem is Schiff himself is a material witness because he colluded with the whistleblower and hired former Obama-era White House National Security staffers who briefly served under Trump and now work on the Intelligence committee he chairs in Congress. Then, Congresswoman Katie Hill erred in judgment and shouldn't have served in Congress. It was an abuse of her office, not a question of millennials versus other ages. Afterward, author Randy Barnett calls in to discuss his new book, \"An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
