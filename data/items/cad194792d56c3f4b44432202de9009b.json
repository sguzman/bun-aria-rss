She’s been named a top event designer by Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and her design work has been published in The Wall Street Journal, Architectural Digest, Milieu, Town and Country, The Financial Times, and The New York Times. She established her design firm in 2010 and launched her online shop during 2020 called house and parties, which is a mix of private labels, artist commissions, and vintage pieces. “If your goal in hosting a party is to impress people, you have lost from the very beginning.” 24:36<br /><br />Transitioning interiors to parties 4:18<br />How it begins with the clients 8:23<br />The headwear 12:46<br />The hostess 15:33<br />What to include in an intro 19:08<br />Inspiration 19:54<br />How is design a part of party planning? 22:21<br />The essentials of throwing a great party 24:45<br />A party trick 27:25<br />Dressing for a party 32:50<br />Rebecca’s dream party 34:04<br />The party favor 35:55<br />Music 38:11<br /><br />“To me, the smaller parties that are like 60 tops are really where the magic happens because you have that time to stand back and pinch your chin, and move the little ditties around and step back, and play with the lighting.
