  "description": "<p>At the beginning of Luke 15, Jesus is speaking to religious leaders who look at him fraternizing with “sinners.” They basically ask Jesus: “Why are you hanging out with all these lost people?\" In response, Jesus gives three parables about lostness, ending with the parable of the lost son. Jesus is trying to get across a new idea of what it means to be spiritually lost. In the parable of the lost son, then, Jesus gives us a new understanding and a new category for spiritual lostness.</p>\n<p>In this sermon, we'll see what that category is, how you can judge whether you’re in the category yourself (what the signs are of that condition), what do you do with it if that’s you, and lastly, what are some of the implications for the church.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 9, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:17-32.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
