  "title": "b-matching as improvement of kNN",
  "summary": "Below is an illustration of b-matching from  (Huang,Jebara AISTATS 2007)  paper. You start with a weighted graph and the goal is to connect each v to k u's to minimize total edge cost. If v's represent labelled datapoints, u's unlabeled and weights correspond to distances, this works as a robust version of kNN classifier (k=2 in the picture) because it prevents any datapoint from exhibiting too",
