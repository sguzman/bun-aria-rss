  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about some who think that IoT botnets may be best considered an instance of a more general problem with poorly secured endpoints. Good digital hygiene can be good digital citizenship. IoT device recalls follow the DDoS against Dyn. Attribution of the attacks remains up in the air—Clapper looks at \"multinational hackers, Jester looks at Russia (and Russia looks at Jester and sees Vice President Biden), and yes, John McAfee is looking at North Korea. Joe Carrigan from The Johns Hopkins University's Information Security Institute inventories IoT devices, and Malcolm Harkins from Cylance shares his thoughts on taking risks.",
