A 3,200 mile transcontinental run.</p><p>This is the story of Robbie Balenger.</p><p>Just 6 years ago, Robbie laced up his first pair of running shoes to alleviate the stress he was experiencing&nbsp;managing a restaurant.&nbsp;A small act, that first run set in motion a chain of events that led to a passion for running long distances, followed by a purpose-driven mission&nbsp;promote a message — the power of a plant-based diet to fuel athletic performance. Prevent and reverse certain lifestyle maladies. Ameliorate suffering. And redress climate change.</p><p>What Robbie didn't expect? The many extraordinary ways running creates community. Unites people across the economic divide. And bridges the political differences that&nbsp;drive us apart.</p><br><p>I was unfamiliar with Robbie until an e-mail hit my inbox courtesy of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend and former podcast guest, Olympic cyclist Dotsie Bausch (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dotsie-bausch-355/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 355</a>).

I jumped at the opportunity.</p><p>On March 16, I showed up at dawn in Huntington Beach to meet Robbie for the first time and help kick off his momentous attempt.</p><p>Running the first several miles alongside Robbie and a small crew of supporters, I immediately took to his earnest yet humble disposition. His passion for promoting the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. And his determination to reach New York a mere 75 days later.</p><p>We struck up a friendship that day. I kept keen tabs on his progress over the following months. And made him a promise:</p><p>Finish the run and you earn a seat at the podcast table.</p><p>All heart, he indeed finished it.
