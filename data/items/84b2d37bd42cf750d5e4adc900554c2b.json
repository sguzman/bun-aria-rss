  "description": "<p>Getting To The Root Of And Getting Rid Of Heartburn And Reflux | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://paleovalley.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paleovalley</a></p><br><p>Most of us have experienced heartburn at one time or another, but for millions of people it is a chronic and painful condition. As a result, acid-blocking medications are among the top-selling drugs in America today. However, taking an acid blocker does nothing to address whatever is causing the heartburn and these drugs can have all sorts of negative side effects. Additionally, while acid blocking drugs block acid that can cause symptoms of heartburn and reflux, your body actually needs stomach acid to stay healthy. So, the key isn’t taking the drug. It’s finding the cause.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Todd LePine to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to treating heartburn and reflux. Together they discuss how to find the real causes of reflux and heartburn, get rid of them, and use the right foods, nutrients, and lifestyle therapies to heal the problem.</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Dr. LePine is the head of the Scientific Advisory Board for Designs for Health and a consultant for Diagnostic Solutions Laboratory. He enjoys skiing, kayaking, hiking, camping and golfing in the beautiful Berkshires, and is a fitness enthusiast.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Athletic Greens and Paleovalley.</p><br><p>Right now Athletic Greens is offering Doctor’s Farmacy listeners a full year supply of their Vitamin D3/K2 Liquid Formula free with your first purchase, plus 5 free travel packs.
