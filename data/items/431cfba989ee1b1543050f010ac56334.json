  "title": "85 - The Spanish Inquisition",
  "description": "<p>The Spanish Inquisition started in 1478 and lasted all the way until 1834 - and it was terrible the whole time. But it was at its worst in the first hundred years, when thousands and thousands of innocent people living in the new Spanish Empire were ruthlessly tortured and many of them burned alive for, mostly, maybe being Jewish in a country that was aggressively Catholic. Find out how the Catholic church rose to power, how the Spanish empire was formed, why inquisitions were carried out, and how they were carried out, in this torture-filled edition of Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Check out the My West Coast Buds podcast!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by Hims! Hims is one-stop shop for hair loss, skincare, and sexual wellness for men. <a href=\"https://www.forhims.com/timesuck\">Go to ForHims.com/Timesuck</a> and get a trial month of everything for only $5!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by the new Parcast podcast, Gone!
