  "description": "A 22-year-old Good Samaritan with a handgun stopped a mass shooting at an Indiana mall. It is yet another example of a good guy with a gun stopping a bad guy with a gun, compared to new details emerging in the ultimate failure with law enforcement in Uvalde.\nWhen it comes to the corrupt January 6th committee, Democrats want everyone they subpoena to submit to their one-sided show trial, yet refuse to release the transcripts of depositions. Donald Trump did not take any illegal advice, he didn't call in the military, and he didn't call in the Dept. of Homeland Security to stop or interfere in the election or transition. Yet the Jan 6th committee continues to fabricate narratives to try and secure an indictment based on the 14th Amendment.\nWhat is this national climate emergency all about? President Biden now claims he will legislate on his own because Congress won't give him what he wants. The left will burn down whatever gets in the way of achieving their political will. Biden and the radical Marxists he surrounds himself with are destroying everything they can get their hands on.\nHunter Biden has had more than 150 flagged financial transactions and why he is under federal investigation for money laundering and tax evasion. It is known that he has made at least $31 million from Chinese interests. AG Merrick Garland has announced that no prosecutions will be made if they can have a potential impact on a political campaign - the exact opposite of what they are doing to Donald Trump. \nThe January 6th Committee intends to embarrass Republicans including former President Trump in their primetime hearing. AG Merrick Garland says that the DOJ conducts their investigations in private and the investigation into Trump via the sham January 6th Committee, which he claims is the most important investigation in US history and portends to set the stage for an indictment of Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
