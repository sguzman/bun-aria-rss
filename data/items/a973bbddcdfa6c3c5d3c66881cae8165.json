Later, World Series Champion, All-Star, friend of the progrum and Shortstop for the Atlanta Braves, Dansby Swanson joins the show to chat about the 2nd half of the baseball season and how he stays locked in, his All-Star experience, cheating in baseball, why he loves the game, and more (1:05:11-1:39:50).
