As Whitney notes in her new book,<strong> toxic positivity tends to shut down conversations, and often stops people from truly connecting—especially when it comes to the hard “stuff” we all face as we lives our lives. </strong>Even if someone is just trying to be nice by saying things like “everything happens for a reason” or “remember, the glass is half full”, the person sharing their pain and struggles can feel silenced by these seemingly innocuous platitudes. It can make the person struggling feel like their distress is making the other person uncomfortable or scared, which often feels like rejection.</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/toxic-positivity-what-it-is-how-it-hurts-what-to-say-instead</p>\n<p>Get her book here: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/673005/toxic-positivity-by-whitney-goodman/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>BetterHelp: Cleaning Up The Mental Mess listeners get 10% off their first month at </strong><u><strong>betterhelp.com/drleaf</strong></u><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-The Melanie Avalon Biohacking Podcast:&nbsp;Visit </strong><a href=\"https://melanieavalon.com/\"><u><strong>MelanieAvalon.com</strong></u></a><strong> for episode lists and transcripts, and search for </strong><em><strong>The Melanie Avalon Biohacking Podcast </strong></em><strong>on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts!
