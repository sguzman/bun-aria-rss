  "description": "For over two decades, every time you turned on a Mac, you were greeted by a familiar sound. It’s appeared as a punchline in The Simpsons, and in movies like WALL•E. It’s a sound some of us tried to hide from our parents as we turned on the computer in the middle of the night. It’s a sound that’s transcended technology; the sound that makes a Mac feel like a Mac. But no longer; the iconic Mac startup chime is going away. \nBut, while we all recognize the sound, we rarely think of who made it. On the eve of the boot beep's retirement, Mark Bramhill, from the podcast Welcome to Macintosh talks with creator Jim Reekes about the most fun and iconic sounds he designed during his time at Apple. \n20K is hosted by Dallas Taylor and made out of the studios of Defacto Sound. \nConsider supporting the show at donate.20k.org \nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/letitbeep\nLearn more about your ad choices.
