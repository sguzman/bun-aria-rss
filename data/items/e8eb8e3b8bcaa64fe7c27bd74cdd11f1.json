  "description": "<p>This week, in Libertyville, Iowa, when police are alerted to cats, eating an unknown flesh, they unravel quite the tale. A woman met a man at a function for singles, and they married within weeks. Turns out, he's not as great a guy as she thought he was, which is proven by the opinion of just about everyone who ever met the man. The marriage doesn't go too far without problems, and eventually those problems result in one of the most wild, crazy murders, ever, culminating with corpse seeking cats. The trial that follows is even crazier, so definitely buckle up for this one!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out that corn sounds very boring, that the past is a good indicator of the future, and that cats can be just as good at finding bodies as dogs!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
