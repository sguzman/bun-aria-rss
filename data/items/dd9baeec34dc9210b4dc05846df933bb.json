  "description": "In this episode we explore a God who disappoints everyone.  There are gaps between our moments of fulfillment, and we've bought into the informercial Jesus product that's supposed to satisfy all of our deepest needs and desires. How do we reconcile living with disappointment? We also offer the \"#6 Blessing\", Andy doesn't know his Bible, and Mike reminded us that hockey is not important.  We'd love your thoughts and look forward to your comments below!\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
