  "description": "It's episode 01 of The NoSleep Podcast presents: The New Decayed. On this week's show we deal with the trauma people can face from their… Inner Demons.\nDisclaimer: This is our first experimental miniseason. For this five-part series you’ll be joining Jessica McEvoy and Olivia White as they delve into the experimental, dark abyss of horror. Instead of taking an extended break during the European tour, we thought we’d try out something new. We’ll be taking this miniseason in directions outside of the usual mandate of The NoSleep Podcast. Some episodes of this miniseason are not for the faint of heart. Some are not for the squeamish. It’s not mandatory listening. If you choose to consider this a break and wait for Season 14, that’s fine. If you choose to join us, then brace yourselves. We’ll be taking you places.\n\"Ghosts on Drugs\" written by Robert Stahl (Story starts around 0:09:17)\nTRIGGER WARNING!\nProduced by: Phil Michalski\nCast: Graham Rowat\n\"Janelle’s Baby\" written by Mr. Michael Squid (Story starts around 0:25:01)\nTRIGGER WARNING!\nProduced by: Phil Michalski\nCast: Atticus Jackson & Jessica McEvoy\n\"The Strangler\" written by Gemma Amor (Story starts around 0:37:27)\nTRIGGER WARNING!\nProduced by: Phil Michalski\nCast: Jessica McEvoy\nClick here to learn more about the voice actors on The NoSleep Podcast \nClick here to learn more about Hasani Walker's Kickstarter \nClick here to learn more about artist cvasiacru \nClick here to learn more about Robert Stahl \nClick here to learn more about Mr. Michael Squid \nClick here to learn more about Gemma Amor \nExecutive Producer: David Cummings\nHost: Jessica McEvoy\nThe New Decayed showrunner: Olivia White\nMusical score composed by: Brandon Boone\n\"Shards\" illustration courtesy of cvasiacru\nAudio program ©2019-2020 - Creative Reason Media Inc. - All Rights Reserved - No reproduction or use of this content is permitted without the express written consent of Creative Reason Media Inc.
