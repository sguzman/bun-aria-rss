    "media:description": "For over 6 years, 100 million views per month was the norm for Kwebbelkop. However, in mid 2021, something changed. In the 12 months that followed May 2021, Kwebbelkop's viewership fell by approximately 90% to an average of between 5 and 20 million per month. What caused this decline? Was it something to do with his break up with Azzyland? Or the disintegration of the Robust group with Jelly and Slogo / Slogoman? Was it something to do with his new second channel Bloo? Or perhaps something to do with him feeling the need to flaunt his wealth? This video will explore How Kwebbelkop Lost His Entire Audience In 1 Year.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§",
