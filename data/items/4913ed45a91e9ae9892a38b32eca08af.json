  "description": "<p>John Maxwell teaches that the greatest responsibility of a leader is to raise up more leaders, and this episode is dedicated to helping you do that by showing you how to spot potential leaders. What makes up a good leader? John shares three key characteristics to evaluate a person’s leadership capacity: character, desire, and discipline. He breaks down each characteristic to make them readily identifiable. </p> <p>Mark Cole and Richard Chancy zoom out and share helpful ways to look for these characteristics in the hiring process. Then Mark zooms in, turns the spotlight on the listener, and encourages us to live out discipline on a daily basis. He shares that every major good decision costs more than expected and takes longer than hoped for, but is worth it. Let the guidance in this episode help you keep growing as a leader while you’re intentional to raise up new leaders. </p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Makeup That Makes Up a Leader Worksheet.
