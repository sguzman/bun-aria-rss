  "description": "<p>Your stepdaughter is 14 and has been living full time with you and your husband for about eight years. Every other weekend she spends with her mom, who you know is a sex worker. The stepdaughter just says her mom works away, but doesn't know what she does. Recently you were sent a screenshot of a Facebook post from another mom in your stepdaughter's class asking if it was real. The post had an ad for your stepdaughter's Mom's \"services.\" You haven't answered yet because you don't know what to say. Since it's out on Facebook, should you give the stepdaughter a heads up that her mom takes money for sex, or do you let her get blindsided by the kids in school?
