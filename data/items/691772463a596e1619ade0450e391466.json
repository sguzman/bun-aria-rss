  "description": "<p>Motivated by the observation of a pair density wave (PDW) in the kagome metal\nCsV${}_3$Sb${}_5$, we consider the fate of electrons near a p-type van Hove\nsingularity (vHS) in the presence of local repulsive interactions. We study the\neffect of such interactions on Fermi surface \"patches\" at the vHS. We show how\na feature unique to the Kagome lattice known as sublattice interference\ncrucially affects the form of the interactions among the patches. The RG flow\nof such interactions results in a regime where nearest neighbor interactions\nexceed onsite repulsion. We identify this condition as being favorable for the\nformation of CDW and PDW orders. We conclude that in the weak-coupling limit,\nCDW order is the dominant order, whereas PDW order sets in at intermediate\ncoupling.\n</p>",
