  "description": "On today's show, Pat and AJ Hawk welcome in Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 2x MVP, 8x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, QB for the 2-0 Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers, for another Aaron Rodgers Tuesday. Pat, Aaron, AJ, and the boys discuss this last week's game against the Lions, what he does on his off days, his newest State Farm commercial, his pregame playlist, and why he's been playing so well and seems to be enjoying things more (1:57-37:59). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, TE for the Cleveland Browns, and friend of the program, Austin Hooper joins the show. Pat and Austin discuss how good it feels to get in the win column, what Kevin Stefanski has been like as a Head Coach, his relationship with Baker Mayfield and Odell Beckham, the Pac12 being dead, and his thoughts on people saying TE's don't care about blocking (38:01-52:58). Lastly, 16 year NFL veteran, 2x Pro Bowler, Pat's former teammate and friend of the show, Mike \"Pops\" Adams joins the program. Pat and Mike break down the Monday Night game between the Saints and Raiders, some of the tricks that he used to get away with things on the football field, if there's cause for concern with Drew Brees, how teams defend guys like Darren Waller, why Jamal Adams is so special, and why Earl Thomas doesn't have a job yet (54:43-1:15:48).
