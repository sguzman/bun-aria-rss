  "description": "<p>Becoming an Olympic medalist doesn’t tell the story. It wasn’t until the klieg lights dimmed that&nbsp;she was compelled to meet herself. The inner journey that ensued forged the amazing person&nbsp;she’s now become.</p><p>Meet&nbsp;Caroline Burckle.&nbsp;Friends call her Burks.</p><p>A fellow former competitive swimmer, today’s guest is a 23-time All American and 2-time NCAA Champion. In 2008, she was crowned NCAA Female Swimmer of the Year in recognition of breaking Janet Evans’ legendary 500 freestyle NCAA record—a seemingly impossible task and the oldest record on the books at the time. Later that same year, Caroline would qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where she won bronze as a member of the women’s 4×200 freestyle relay.</p><p>More interesting however, and certainly more relatable, is Caroline’s path post-swimming. A close cousin to my conversations with Olympians&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/anthony-ervin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Ervin,</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/apolo-ohno-539/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apolo Ohno</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/john-moffet-558/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Moffet,</a>&nbsp;hers is a hard-wrought journey of self-discovery shrouded in institutional neglect and even, at times, abuse. Let’s just say she weathered some shit. But she faced it. She showed up and did the work. And she emerged at peace with her past and her self—now hellbent on helping forge healthier lives for the next generation of Olympians.</p><p>Beyond the play-by-play of&nbsp;Caroline’s storied career, her experiences as a young swimmer, and what it was like to stand on the Olympic podium, this is a conversation about&nbsp;the psychological struggles she faced as a prodigious athlete. Her battle with depression. And her familiar addiction to people-pleasing.</p><p>It’s also an alarming exposé on the harmful paradigms perpetuated by calcified athletic institutions—and what we must be done to better support the next generation of Olympians.</p><p>But more than anything, this is a playbook on how to find power in vulnerability. How to listen to your body. And most importantly, how to use your voice.</p><p>One of my very favorite people, Burks and I are buddies going back several years. A powerhouse and a humble empath, her energy is infectious. And I’m honored to share her story with you today.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch our exchange on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K96Htyd35k\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube.</a>&nbsp;And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>May her words inspire you to seek own your truth.
