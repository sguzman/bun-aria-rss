  "description": "My special guest tonight is author Michael Fitzhugh Bell who's here to discuss how he believes that a covert group is responsible for years of torture, kidnappings and harassments with the use of microchips. Get his book The Invisible Crime: Illegal Microchip Implants and Their Use Against Humanity on Amazon.\nBook Description:\nAn innocent man becomes the unwitting target of a secret criminal organization using high-tech weaponry, microchip implants, and mind control on its victims, leaving no evidence. The organization is covert, highly organized, well-funded and uses the latest technology. This heinous, unconscionable crime has gone global—and rapidly has become a huge national problem. \nAuthor, Michael Fitzhugh Bell is drugged, abducted, raped, and surgically implanted with illegal microchip implants; all done without his knowledge or consent. Michael is tracked, stalked, and tortured, 24/7—and physically burned remotely with directed energy weapons which most people don’t even know exist. His every thought and feeling is being read in real time by his perpetrators via GPS and current cellular satellite systems, making him, quite literally, a human piñata. Michael must prove his crime to the police and a judge before his attackers erase his memories and murder him.\nThis story goes one step beyond Dr. John Hall’s own chilling tale of organized stalking by proxy. It is the author’s personal account of being electronically stalked and surgically implanted with micro-electronic transmission devices. It is the story of Michael’s uphill battle with doctors, lawyers, police, F.B.I., C.I.A., and a secret, global criminal union operating above the law. Beginning in Hollywood, California, Michael’s journey towards resolution will take him around the world—Madrid, Spain; London, England; Patagonia, Argentina; North and South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas; and back to southern California.\nThis book contains medical evidence, M.R.I. and ultrasound images, all clearly showing non-therapeutic /tracking torture devices. Surprisingly, these devices are legal and are available for purchase by anyone on the Internet. They are known as psychotronic weaponry; combing the words psychological and electronic.\nDespite the most determined efforts to destroy him, Michael remains optimistic and focused, relentless in his pursuit to find his way out this never ending terror and nightmare of a labyrinth which has become his life. \n\nWanna get creeped out?
