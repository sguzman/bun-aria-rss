  "description": "<p><p>For our Memorial Day episode, we want to remember our fallen heroes, while also making you laugh, just like they would have wanted. Chaps interviews Torey Sonka, a gold-star wife of a Marine that Chaps trained during his time in the Corps. She details how she coped with losing her husband, how her work with cancer patients has helped her heal her own wounds, and the legislation that prevents her from marrying the second love of her life. Afterwards, the squad answers questions from the listeners. </p><p>Happy Memorial Day from the ZBT family to yours! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
