  "description": "<p>Grace is not something you earn. It's not a reward, or something you pray or ask for. And it has nothing to do with karma, or your past actions. You don't deserve grace – it just falls on you.</p> <p>What's remarkable about grace is that the more you acknowledge it, the more it appears. Grace can be a guiding force when your intent is pure and your will is strong, but something else pushes you through.</p> <p>Janet Taylor knows the power of grace. When her daughter landed in the emergency room after overdosing on drugs, Janet didn't know what to do. She didn't even know how to react – with fear? Anger? Sadness? When she finally let go of what she couldn't control and gave in to faith, that's when she started to appreciate her daughter's progress away from addiction, even the smallest steps.</p> <p>Jenn Ferris also knows the power of grace. As a child she was abandoned at a bus stop in her village in India. She could have chosen to put a negative meaning on that, and many other things in her life, events that were out of her control. But you'll see how grace appeared her life, because her heart was open and her faith was strong.</p> <p>To learn more about the gift of grace, visit www.tonyrobbins.com/gifts.</p>",
