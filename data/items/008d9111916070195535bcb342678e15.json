  "description": "<p>Today we take a fun and sometimes concerning tour around the United States looking at laws that are still on the books that either definitely shouldn't be, shouldn't have ever been, are sadly necessary, or are just plain... odd. Did you know that in Indiana it's illegal to have a \"<em>a covered clearly erect penis\" </em>at a city park? Or that it's illegal to use a ferret to help you hunt in West Virginia? It's also illegal to sell dog hair in New York. And if you've ever been in a \"duel with deadly weapons\" in Kentucky you can't become a state attorney. In Idaho, cannibalism carries a special punishment. Anal, oral, and premarital sex are illegal in Idaho. As is adultery. So many outdated laws that should've never existed in the first place. And so many WTF laws. It's just a misdemeanor to barter a baby in Pennsylvania. But having sex with your first cousin in Utah is a felony. Also, it's illegal to own seven or more dildos in Texas. And on and on and on. We go over actual state, county, and city legal codes for so, so, SO much legislative strangeness today. Hail Nimrod and I hope you get some laughs out of this madness.<br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions donate this month to <strong>The Ocular Melanoma Foundation</strong>, in honor of Alex Roach, a Timesucker who was taken from his family at the tender age of just 33 (amount to be announced next week). The Ocular Melanoma Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and is one of the leading research and patient support organizations focused on ocular melanoma-eye cancer.</p>\n<p>To find out more, go to <a href=\"http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/\"><strong>http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/m1LVfkBh5x0\">https://youtu.be/m1LVfkBh5x0</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
