  "description": "<p><strong>Get your tickets, ladies and gents! Because it's another rendition of Drunken Philosophy at the Movies. This week, Connor and Dan take one for the collective team and watch God's Not Dead 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the straight-to-video Christian-focused feature and insult to Nietszche's memory, God's Not Dead. This movie is bonkers and barely related to philosophy despite stealing it's title from a famous philosophical text, but it provided lots of catharsis for your hosts. Enjoy the little break from learning, the pod will be back next week with more straight up philosophy.</strong></p>",
