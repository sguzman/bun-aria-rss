This goes beyond the simple <a href=\"http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2015/02/07/dashboards-versus-data-visualization/\">data visualization or dashboard </a>— sometimes (severely) depicted as <a href=\"http://www.esourcingforum.com/archives/2016/05/11/dashboards-big-data-minitel-internet/\">Minitels of Big Data</a> !</p><p>Difficulties to go to production can come from several factors :</p><ul><li>Data Scientists findings remain trapped into their computers, because their are not conceived to be shared in a compatible way with the enterprise IT, or not enough user friendly</li><li>End users are not involved early enough in the project — at the end the question of the <em>business alignment</em> is raised</li><li><a href=\"http://www.artefact.is/news/pourquoi-ce-dialogue-de-sourd-entre-si-et-m%C3%A9tiers\">Organization is unsuitable</a> : silos between <a href=\"http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/\">the “thinkers” and the “doers”</a>, source of frustration</li><li>and so on …</li></ul><h4>The traditional way of doing things</h4><p>Kaggle, <a href=\"http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/why-we-need-methodology-data-science\">internet</a>, MOOCs, … teach us how to drive a “Big Data” project : scoping, data gathering, cleaning, analysis (data visualization), modeling, reporting (dashboards), production.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CjA-6iNb49nJ-FF0B7IwPw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This approach is <em>firstly</em> focused on the <strong>technical</strong> aspects, to lead <em>secondly</em> to the <strong>application</strong>. It has been suitable during the last 3 years, while entry barriers were mainly technological.</p><p>But a <strong>breakthrough</strong> is happening : Data Science tools are now becoming<strong>mature</strong>, more and more easy to use, by an increasing number of collaborators. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/machine-learning/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/machine-learning/\">Microsoft</a> launched their specialized data platforms, <a href=\"https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/11/apache-spark-2-0-technical-preview-easier-faster-and-smarter.html\">Spark 2</a> will be launched, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/732225628628385794\">deep learning</a> is going mainstream.</p><p>Let’s take an analogy : for a startup in the <em>digital economy</em>, in many cases <a href=\"https://salon.thefamily.co/french-engineers-and-entrepreneurship-its-complicated-340ff349db1#.hx9qp5bhy\">it isn’t technology that makes the difference</a>. (but rather, it is a well-designed interface, an exceptional customer experience). This is the same for Data projects : usage, <a href=\"http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/10/what-we-learned-at-wrangle-2015-data-science-is-about-people/\">people</a> and design are the <strong>critical success factors</strong> — no more technical aspects only.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L2wstsuklCvAcuqNJ43LTw.jpeg\" /></figure><h4>Towards an new approach</h4><p>That’s why it’s time to change, and reverse the cycle of Data Science projects:</p><blockquote>No more starting from the Data Lake, to reach the application, but starting from the application and going back to the Data Lake</blockquote><p>In many cases, everybody can find satisfaction:</p><ul><li><strong>Business users</strong> can express their needs early in the project</li><li><strong>IT teams</strong> can anticipate production, and prepare the suitable environment</li><li><strong>Data Scientists</strong> finally know which precise problem they have to crack, and can concentrate their energy on it</li><li><strong>Software developers</strong> are involved early in the application development, which is favorable to agile increments, and a better engagement</li></ul><p>This <strong>innovative</strong> approach, breaking <a href=\"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-poc-problem\">the culture of the permanent POC</a>, is at the center of Zelros product value proposition. From day 1 of the project, a minimum viable <strong>Data Application</strong> is deployed : software still limited, but functional, prone to refinements. These Data Applications help our customers to <strong>incarnate</strong> their projects, and concentrate teams towards a<strong>common goal</strong>, reachable in a <strong>few weeks</strong> — and no more <strong>several months</strong>.</p><p>Try this recipe in you future project, we would love to hear about your feedbacks.
