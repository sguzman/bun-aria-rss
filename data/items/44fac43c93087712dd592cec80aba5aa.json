  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 90: Featuring Mike Commodore",
  "description": "<p><p>This week's first episode breaks down Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final and why Washington now has a stranglehold on the series. Then old friend Mike Commodore stops by to chop it up and tell some wild stories. He fills us in on getting into Edmonton street fights, attending every North American teammate's Cup party in 2006, how Mike Babcock screwed Mike Modano out of 1500 games played, his annual golf trip with Whits, a wild tale about his buddy who flew private with Ernie Els, and much more. Commie never disappoints.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
