Amanda was a single mom who was extremely close with her 4-year-old daughter. On August 14, 2005, she had plans to meet the alleged father of baby Hayden, Bryan Westfall, to discuss his role in the baby's life. She dropped her daughter off and left to meet him at the Hillsboro Civic Center in Hillsboro, Missouri. Amanda promised to be back in a couple hours. When she didn't return, her family grew concerned because she was so close to her due date. They were worried that she may be experiencing a medical emergency. They began frantically searching for her and found her car parked at the Civic Center. Amanda's mom, Bertha, contacted Westfall who told her several conflicting stories about what transpired that day. Amanda and baby Hayden remain missing and Bryan has refused to speak about Amanda's disappearance for almost 13 years.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Amanda Jones, the FBI is currently offering a $20,000 reward.&nbsp;You can submit a tip anonymously online at <a href=\"http://tips.fbi.gov \" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tips.fbi.gov </a>or by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI.&nbsp;You can also contact the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department at 636-797-5562.
