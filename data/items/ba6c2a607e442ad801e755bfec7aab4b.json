  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news that Tyrod Taylor didn't play due to a collapsed lung from an injection into the ribs by the team doctor. To get more information on the Tyrod Taylor situation, Pat welcomes The Insider Of All Insiders, ESPN NFL Insider and originator of the Adam Bomb, Adam Schefter. Pat and Schefty discuss all the developments with Tyrod Taylor and how common this is in the NFL, how difficult it was to keep getting texts of players being out for the season on Sunday, and how his in-laws still don't have any idea about what he does for a living (17:17-26:02). Next, CBS NFL color commentator, one of the voices of Madden, and NFL Network analyst, Charles Davis joins the show. Pat and Charles chat about how things have been differently calling games so far this year, his thoughts on why the NFL has gone off without a hitch and why it's much more of a struggle in college football, what it's like being one of the voices of Madden and how painstaking of a process it is, his thoughts on the Ravens and why he thinks they got better, and his thoughts about Mitchell Trubisky in Chicago (30:19-51:36). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and member of the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame, Deuce McAllister joins the program. Pat and Deuce chat about what he's seen from the Saints so far and what he thinks they need to do better, if he's heard anything on Michael Thomas' status for Sunday Night, and how difficult swallowing his pride was when the Saints drafted Reggie Bush (53:44-1:08:25). Lastly, on another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ are joined by the man who popularized fantasy football, host of the Fantasy Focus Football Podcast, Mr. Roto himself, Matthew Berry joins the program. Pat, AJ, and Matthew chat about the best strategies when playing fantasy football, some of the players Matthew has been keeping his eye on, if he sees any great fantasy football GM's eventually getting jobs with NFL teams, some of the worst punishments he's heard, and some of the guys he likes for this weekend (1:08:27-1:31:47).
