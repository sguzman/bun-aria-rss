  "description": "<p>County fairs across the country have been canceled.  Thankfully here in Wyoming, we were still able to participate in this great tradition.  If you’ve never been to a county fair, it’s effectively a lot of sitting around mixed with moments of controlled chaos.  Why do we do it?  That’s the question we get asked most frequently by friends and neighbors.  With the significant amount of time and effort required to move our entire life to the fairgrounds for a week, on the surface it wouldn’t seem to make much sense.  However, the true gift of the fair and the homestead, in general, is the independence it teaches our children.  It fosters curiosity and accelerates their growth as children and sticks with them well into adulthood.  Listen today to find out why everyone in your family will greatly benefit from the county fair.</p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!
