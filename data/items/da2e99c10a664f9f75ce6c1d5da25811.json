  "description": "As Food People, we know our way around a dinner party—or at least, we did, before we couldn’t attend or throw any for almost two years. During that hosting hiatus we had plenty of time to think about what made dinner parties great but also what made them stressful, exhausting, and way too much work. This week on the show, Amanda talks to Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco and Associate Food Editor Zaynab Issa about the new rules they’re following when it comes to entertaining in a post-lockdown world. They debate outsourcing the main course, skipping dessert, and what makes a “compelling and dynamic” salad. Along the way, we also turn to Katherine Lewin—owner of Big Night, a brilliantly stocked, expertly curated dinner party shop in Brooklyn—for a crash course on cheese and charcuterie.\nStuff we talk about in this episode:\n\n\nShoui Kim’s Red Wine and Soy–Braised Short Ribs recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-wine-and-soybraised-short-ribs\n\n\n\nChris Morocco’s BA’s Best Lasagna recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ba-best-lasagna\n\n\n\nAndy Baraghani’s BA’s Best Bolognese recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-bolognese\n\n\n\nChris Morocco’s Weeknight Ragù recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/weeknight-ragu\n\n\n\nCamille Becerra (De Maria, NY)’s Bitter Greens and Avocado Salad with Seaweed recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bitter-greens-and-avocado-salad-with-seaweed\n\n\n\nCamille Becarra’s tips for a compelling and dynamic salad: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/chicory-2017-vegetable-of-year\n\n\n\nChris Morocco’s Radicchio Salad with Pickled Grapes and Goat Cheese recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-pickled-grapes-and-goat-cheese\n\n\n\nMolly Baz’s Anything-Goes Green Goddess Salad recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-goddess-salad\n\n\n\nRick Martinez’s Obscenely Chocolatey Chocolate Cookies recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/double-dark-chocolate-cookies\n\n\n\nMina Stone’s Super Lemony Olive Oil Cake recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/super-lemony-olive-oil-cake\n\n\n\nHow to Turn a Cheese Plate Into a Main Event: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cheese-plate-party\n\n\n\nBig Night Website : https://www.bignightbk.com/\n\n\n\nTrade Street Jam Company Website: https://tradestjamco.com/\n\n\n\nQueens San Francisco Superette Website: https://www.queenssf.com/\n\n\n\nRead Our New Package on How Dinner Parties Have Changed: https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/dinner-parties\n\n\n\nNew Rules for Dinner Partying, (Emphasis on “Partying”): https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dinner-party-rules\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
