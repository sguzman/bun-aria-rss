This podcast is a time capsule that documents what I've done and gone through but more importantly, who have helped me in every aspect and stage of this journey. All the struggles and challenges I've encountered in the last 12 years were all worth it and honestly might have discouraged me if not for my village. Thank you to each and every guest for going back through time with me and sharing all the nuggets of wisdom you all so generously gave to me and to my community. Thank you to my team for making this podcast happen. Thank you to my community for listening and sharing the love. I wish this motivates you and gives you that push that you need to go for your passion and dreams. You got this!</p>\n<p>For more info and show notes please visit delinamedhin.com.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to celebrate your village by using the hashtag #ShareYourVillage.</p>\n<p>It's a wrap for Season 1 of It Takes A Village, The True Story of A Beautypreneur.
