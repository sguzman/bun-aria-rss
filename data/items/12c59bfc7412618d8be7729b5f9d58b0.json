  "description": "Comedy Central’s Corporate is a deep, dark dive into American corporate life that is one of the most promising new comedies to debut in years. Set in the nondescript but completely soulless corporation Hampton DeVille, Corporate finds dark yet incredibly funny humor in the concept of just trying to survive within the sorts of corporate structures many of us work in every single day.\n\nThe series was co-created by Matt Ingebretson and Jake Weisman (with series director Pat Bishop), and Ingebretson and Weisman also star. That’s notable because before Corporate, the two were mostly known for making and starring in web videos. They mark just the latest example of online talent crossing over into the television mainstream (if you can call Corporate “mainstream”).\n\nAs the series prepares to air the last two episodes of its first season (it’s already been renewed for a second), Ingebretson and Weisman join Todd to talk about how to make a funny comedy with visual flair, why the horrors of corporate life are great fodder for a TV show, and what’s funny about the fact that we’re all going to die. (Trust us; it’s funny!)\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
