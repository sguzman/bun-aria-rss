  "description": "In the third episode of our four-part series, called “Ground Truth or Consequences: the challenges and opportunities of regulation in cyberspace,” we take at risk and regulation in the financial sector, specifically how it intersects with cyber security. How do organizations operate in a heavily regulated global financial environment, while protecting their employees, their customers, and the integrity of a system largely built on trust?\nJoining us are Valerie Abend from Accenture and Josh Magri from the Bank Policy Institute.\nLater in the program we'll hear from Jason Hart, CTO for enterprise and cybersecurity at Gemalto. They're the sponsors of this show.",
