  "description": "<p>“It’s not what happens to you that defines who you are, it’s ultimately your decisions.”  - Elizabeth Smart<br />\nThere are a lot of heartbreaking things that happen in this world. I’m sure you have your own stories.<br />\nBeing a victim doesn’t end with the event. It continues on for a lifetime.<br />\nIn the end, you have no control over what happened to you. There’s no going back. What you do have control over is the decisions you make on the other side -- how you let these tragedies affect you.<br />\nYou need to not only stay strong but also learn to forgive.<br />\nWhen I say this, I say it from personal experience. I have gone through abuse when I was younger, and I understand how it can disrupt you to your core.<br />\nBut forgiveness isn’t for them. It’s for you. Forgiveness doesn’t mean what happened is ok. It doesn’t mean you let go of what happened and consider everything to be just fine. It doesn’t eliminate what happened.<br />\nForgiveness is about allowing yourself to move forward as a better person. It’s about growing, rather than letting these events disrupt your life anymore. It’s about becoming stronger and learning from the situation to help others.<br />\nThere is no one who knows this better than today’s guest on The School of Greatness: Elizabeth Smart.<br />\nIf you haven’t heard of Elizabeth Smart, she was kidnapped by complete strangers at the age of 14 and held captive for 9 months. She endured nearly every terrible thing you can imagine.<br />\nToday, Elizabeth is a NYT best-selling author and has dedicated her life to bringing empowerment to survivors and awareness to these crimes.<br />\nOn this episode, we discuss the biggest lessons she’s learned about forgiveness, her definition of hope, the importance of owning your story, and the biggest lesson she learned from her captors.<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 629.<br />\nWhat’s been the biggest lesson about forgiveness for you?
