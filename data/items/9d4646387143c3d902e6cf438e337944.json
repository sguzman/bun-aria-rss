  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Justices and judges can be frustrating but at no time should anyone ever threaten a judge, but today Sen Chuck Schumer has gone beyond the pale and threatened two Supreme Court Justices saying, \"I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have unleashed a whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.” Now, if a common citizen, or lawyer, were to make that statement they would likely be arrested and disbarred. It’s funny how the national judge's organization is silent on this, not offering a list of 2000 Justice Department employees condemning Schumer. Where are the law professors and the media outrage over these threats from a sitting U.S Senator? Chief Justice Roberts did indeed fire back issuing a stern admonishment to Schumer. Then, despite the United States having the best most ethical law enforcement of any nation, it’s always painted as racist and bad. People of faith and their charitable volunteerism along with their beliefs are the spine of this country and they're under attack. But to the Democrats race-baiting, and trashing the constitution is what matters most — for them, it’s the party over patriotism — and that's wrong. Neighbors looking after neighbors and family looking after family is what it's all about. Later, President Trump has made more of an effort to gain support with African American voters than any other Republican ever. Biden says he'll destroy the car industry and the union jobs that go along with it, just like he'll destroy the coal industry by supporting the green new deal and leftist policies. Finally, Charlie Kirk calls in to discuss his new book, The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas that Will Win the Future.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
