  "description": "<p>On October 25, 2012, NYPD Office Gilberto Valle was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping after his estranged wife Kathleen had turned her computer over to the FBI following using spyware and uncovering Gil's sexual obsession with cannibalism. He'd been sharing photos of her and other women with other cannibalism fetishists and writing in graphic detail about how badly he wanted to have her kidnapped, raped, tortured, killed, and eaten. Was Gil planning on killing his wife and other women? Or was he does sharing fantasies? Did he get arrested and sent to prison for committing nothing more than thought crimes? We dig into Gil's story today, and take the longest look at cannibalism we've done so far. What is humanity's history with cannibalism? Is it bad for you? Why do some people become sexually aroused by the thought of eating human flesh? All this and more on another morbidly curious  edition of Timesuck.
