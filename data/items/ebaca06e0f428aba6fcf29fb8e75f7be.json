As the midterms draw nearer, Trump has planned campaign-style rallies in the battleground states of Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Donald Trump has never stopped campaigning,&rdquo;</em> Conway said. <em>&ldquo;As he would say: wait and see.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Trump himself has repeatedly dropped hints that he intends to run for office again, telling supporters that they will<em> &ldquo;be very happy&rdquo;</em> with his decision. <em>&ldquo;I ran twice. I won twice&hellip;I will probably have to do it again,&rdquo;</em> he said at a rally in Texas last month.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/636408e485f5404eeb7b6277.jpg\" alt=\"President Joe Biden is shown speaking at a White House event on Wednesday.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565917-poll-us-voters-expect-biden-impeachment/\">Voters expect Republicans to impeach Biden – poll</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>Conway&rsquo;s statement came on the same day that three of Trump&rsquo;s former advisers told Reuters that they expect an announcement shortly after the midterms. One of these advisers stated that Trump would enter the race between the elections and Thanksgiving, which falls on November 24.</p>\n<p>Republicans hold a three-point advantage over Democrats heading into the midterms, according to an average of 17 polls compiled by <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2022-generic-congressional-vote-7361.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real Clear Politics</a>. Looking forward to 2024, polling over the last month generally shows Trump and Biden within six points of each other. A Wall Street Journal survey published on Tuesday showed the two tied at 46%.</p>\n<p></p>",
