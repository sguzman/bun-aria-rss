  "description": "Over the last 24 hours, some of us Short Wavers celebrated Pi Day the only way we know how: eating some yummy pie and thinking math thoughts. Here on the show, many of us are math enthusiasts. But none of us claims to be a math perfectionist. We think there's at least as much joy and insight in the mistakes as there is in what we get right. It's a lesson we discussed in today's episode about Matt Parker's book, <em>Humble Pi</em>. It's an oldie but a goodie from our archives.We hope it inspires you to continue to celebrate pi and math everyday.",
