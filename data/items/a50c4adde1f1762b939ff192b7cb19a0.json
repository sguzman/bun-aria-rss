  "description": "In Episode #209, I sit down with Dr Kristina Harris Jackson to deep dive into the effects of omega-3 consumption on lactation and pregnancy.\n\nDr Kristina Harris Jackson furthers The Proof’s exploration of omega-3s in this episode, offering her expertise in a discussion centred around maternal health. Nutrition during pregnancy can be a sensitive and confusing topic; when parents are trying to do everything they can to ensure optimal health outcomes, the abundance of available information is overwhelming. Today, Dr Harris Jackson provides some much-needed clarity and insight into omega-3s and pregnancy.\n\nIn this episode, we cover a whole suite of information around omega-3s across early life stages. You will learn about the importance of nutritional biomarkers and exactly how important omega-3s are during pregnancy. We also discuss the potential effect of DHA on gestation length, inflammation during pregnancy, and how genetic variations may affect omega-3 conversion. Finally, Dr Harris Jackson shares supplementation guidelines, outcomes, and plant-based sources of omega-3s.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nKristina’s story (1:42)\n\nOmega-3s explained (17:51)\n\nPregnancy & omega-3s (22:15)\n\nExplaining the mechanisms (30:58)\n\nOptimal intake of omega-3s (38:12)\n\nSupplementing (1:02:26)\n\nLong-term effects on children (1:47:43)\n\nSummary of what’s important (1:53:55)\n\nOutro (2:00:56)\n\n\nTo read publications from Kristina Harris Jackson, PhD, discover them here.
