  "description": "<p>Killer Mike is an incredible rapper and very interesting person. Check out his music and see what you think if you’re not familiar with his work. Also he has a new show on Netflix so he’s staying very busy. Really enjoyed his conversation with Joe and hope he goes back on soon.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
