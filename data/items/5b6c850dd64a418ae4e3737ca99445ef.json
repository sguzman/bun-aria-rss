And of course that immediate pain communicates to us that something is wrong- it keeps us from further hurting ourselves. But then oftentimes there is some inflammation or swelling that occurs after the fact.

So in a way that ongoing pain from any swelling could be seen as a good thing! Though uncomfortable, it can be a sign of forward-looking health. And similarly, we’re attempting to take a more positive approach to what seems like the disconcerting problem of a shrinking middle class. We actually think there is more good than bad happening with a middle class that seems to be hollowing out. Listen to find out why this seems like a bad trend at first glance, who has been climbing the financial ranks, who is actually considered ‘rich’, what this means for you, and then finally what you can do to get ahead with your finances.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Stiegl Radler Zitrone (fancy-speak for lemon)!
