  "description": "<p>The objective of this three-part work is the formulation and rigorous\nanalysis of a number of reduced mathematical models that are nevertheless\ncapable of describing the hydrology at the scale of a river basin (i.e.\ncatchment). Coupled effects of surface and subsurface flows are considered.\n</p>\n<p>In this second part, we construct a benchmark catchment scenario and\ninvestigate the effects of parameters within their typical ranges. Previous\nresearch on coupled surface-subsurface models have focused on numerical\nsimulations of site-specific catchments; here our focus is broader and\nemphasises the study of general solutions to the mathematical models, and their\ndependencies on dimensionless parameters. This study provides a foundation\nbased on the examination of a geometrically simple three-dimensional benchmark\nscenario. We develop a nondimensional coupled surface-subsurface model, and\nextract the key dimensionless parameters. We then apply asymptotic methods in\norder to discuss some potential simplifications, including the reduction of the\ngeometry to a two-dimensional form, where the principal groundwater and\noverland flows occur in the hillslope direction. Numerical solutions\ndemonstrate the effects of model parameters and provide guidance on the\nvalidity of the dimensional reductions.\n</p>",
