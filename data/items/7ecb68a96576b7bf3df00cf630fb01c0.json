  "description": "<p>We hope you had a great holiday and that you enjoyed our last series, The Domino Effect. If you stepped up to Mark and Richard’s challenge last week to perform a year-end review, you’ll find this episode extremely helpful and practical. This lesson walks though the systems that John Maxwell has set in place in his own life to maximize his time, increase his capacity, and connect with others. </p> <p>There’s so much practical, helpful content in this episode that Mark and Richard are going to sit back and let John take the wheel.</p> <p>If you listened to our previous series where we talked about The Domino Effect of personal changes, this lesson falls under the category of performance. If you didn’t listen to that series, you’ll want to check it out at MaxwellPodcast.com/domino.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Create a System Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/system and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.maxwellpodcast.com/domino\">The Domino Effect Series</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/No-Limits-Blow-the-Cap-Off-Your-Capacity-_p_2793.html\"> <em>No Limits</em> by John C.
