  "description": "From mediation to melatonin to putting on a pair of socks, we all have routines to help us reach that blissful state of slumber. These are the ones that work:<br/><br/>- Forget sheep. Instead, use mental imagery — picturing a walk in the woods or a stroll on a beach — to help relax. <br/>- Relaxation and meditation apps can help you unwind. <br/>- Melatonin supplements might ease your way into sleep, but too much melatonin could disrupt it. <br/>- Over-the-counter sleep medications may knock you out, but they won't result in effective sleep.<br/>- If young kids wake you in the wee hours, don't react in a way that increases their stress — but do find strategies that make it no fun to be up.<br/>- Sleep rituals are personal. If you believe in yours, that might be all you need.",
