  "description": "This week we’re talking about one of the most haunted objects in the world. The Dybbuk box stepped on the ebay scene in September 2001 and nothing has ever been the same. The word, “Dybbuk” comes from Jewish folklore and literally means, “to cling.” An otherworldly spirit was captured in the box during the holocaust and when Kevin Mannis bought it at an estate sale, brought it home and opened it, his life changed forever. So did the lives of the next two owners, and anyone who has seen the movie The Possession, based on the box! Keep it weird, but not so weird that you open a cursed box and ruin your life!<br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nSimplisafe: Go today to <a href=\"http://SimpliSafe.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">SimpliSafe.com/morbid</a> and get a FREE security camera, plus a 60-day risk-free trial with any new system order.<br>\n<br>\nThriveMarket: Go to <a href=\"http://ThriveMarket.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">ThriveMarket.com/MORBID</a>.
