  "description": "<p class=\"\">Misogyny is the hatred of women, practiced only by a few bigoted men. A hatred, which is far from systemic. Sexual and domestic violence are at record lows and continue to decline. Women are entitled to equal pay, positions of power, and bodily autonomy, and these rights and liberties have been enshrined in law and accepted by the general population. Feminism is the rule, misogyny the exception: we are all feminists now.</p> <p class=\"\">This couldn’t be from further the view of <a href= \"http://www.katemanne.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kate Manne</a>, Associate Professor at <a href= \"https://philosophy.cornell.edu/kate-manne\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Cornell University</a> and author of the hugely popular and multi-award-winning, <a href= \"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/313/313936/down-girl/9780141990729.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny</a>. Today, Kate is not only one of the world’s leading feminist philosophers (labelled as “The Simone de Beauvoir of the 21st century” by Amanda Marcotte), but according to <a href= \"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/prospect-worlds-top-50-thinkers-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prospect Magazine</a>, one of the “World’s Top 10 Thinkers”.</p> <p class=\"\">Today we’ll be discussing Kate’s newly released, <a href= \"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608442/entitled-by-kate-manne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women</a>. Kate calls us to radically rethink our understanding of the nature and function of misogyny. Misogyny is <em>not</em> the hatred of women and girls, practiced by the few, it is controlling and punishing those who challenge male entitlement, practiced by the many. Misogyny is the law enforcement branch of the patriarchal order - a deterrent, a warning, a whip - which sustains the hierarchy of men over women. As history and the personal experiences of women so often attest to, those at the top of hierarchies often expect things from those beneath them.</p> <div id=\"block-bd57f811e186f8eb6bf7\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p class=\"\"><strong>Contents</strong></p> <p class=\"\">Part I.
