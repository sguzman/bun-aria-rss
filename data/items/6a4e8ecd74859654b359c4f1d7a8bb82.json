  "description": "With Election Day looming this year, Americans began to shutter their windows, put up plywood on the storefronts and they watched National Guard troops rumble into their cities. What should be a celebration of democracy and possibilities is has gained an air of dread we've never seen in most of our lifetimes. That suggests that regardless of the election's outcome, we face much deeper problems in our society. How do we address those? We discuss with Nils Gilman of the Berggruen Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Perhaps it is a time to ask some very fundamental questions. Please join us for this thought-provoking discussion.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
