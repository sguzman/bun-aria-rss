  "description": "Now, this is a special episode! Not only do we get an over-the-moon John Breech because his favorite quarterback ever has a new team, where he'll probably be the starter...But we also get the return of former Superfriend, Sean Wagner-McGough...That can only mean one thing: Andy Dalton has signed with the Chicago Bears! Will Brinson and Ryan WIlson are also along for the ride, but the pod belongs to Breech and Bleep. The guys offer a near-immediate reaction to the Dalton signing, plus other quarterback moves that have happened over the past 24 hours including Ryan Fitzpatrick heading to Washington and Jameis Winston returning to the Saints. What do these flurry of moves mean for Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson trade scenarios? The free agency recap continues with analysis on more big splashes from the Patriots with the addition of another high-priced tight end, Hunter Henry. We also cover Leonard Williams' deal with the Giants, questionable moves by the Bengals and losses by the Steelers. Finally, Brinson, Wilson and Breech dish out winners and losers from the first two days of the \"legal tampering\" period. \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
