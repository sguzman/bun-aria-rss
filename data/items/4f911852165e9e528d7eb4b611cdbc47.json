  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane talks to a two-million-dollar man. That's how much money Artie Lange was able to keep after a roller-coaster career, multiple brushes with law enforcement, and battles with heroin, meth, and cocaine addictions. Lange talks about his encounters with Andrew Dice Clay, Lorne Michaels, Norm Macdonald, and more. Blind Mike gets to the bottom of Lange's nose: Did he really snort glass? The crew also learns that Lange's relationship with Howard Stern is good (right now) and prostitutes are surprisingly accurate with hypodermic syringes.
