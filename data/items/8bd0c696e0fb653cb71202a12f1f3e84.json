  "description": "<p>EPISODE 57 - TURNING THE TABLES - Shawshank Redemption</p> <p>In this episode, we get the tables turned upon us! Greig Fraser leads the conversation and asks US the questions. He starts by diving into our collaboration process and then moves onto the movie SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. In addition, he chose 5 clips from the movie to discuss. We list and describe the clip in an accompanying PDF file for this episode that can be accessed by the link below. We also strayed from the movie discussion to talk about choosing the format of a movie, why one shoots anamorphic, choosing the camera for 1917, the pressure on the DP when trying to wait for the right light and the joy of seeing the performance as you are shooting. It’s a fun episode which Greig skillfully leads. Don’t miss it. <a href= \"https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/teamdeakins/ClipList2-sm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use this link to download the PDF file.</a></p> <p>REQUIRED EPISODE VIEWING: Shawshank Redemption</p> <p> </p>",
