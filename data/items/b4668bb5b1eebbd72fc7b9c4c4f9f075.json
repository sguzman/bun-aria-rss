  "description": "Our audiobook this week is PARTY PRINCESS by Lana Dash\n\nWhat happens in Vegas…isn’t always what you expect.\n\nBETH\nAs the bride’s younger sister, I’ve always found myself hidden in her long casting shadow. But when we all head out to a club in Vegas, I’m mistaken for the pop princess, Fiona Day. When I’m ushered past the velvet rope into the VIP section, I come face to face with my celebrity crush growing up. Can I keep up the ruse that I’m not who they think I am, or will the spotlight I’ve always wanted reveal the truth?\n\nSHAWN\nAfter becoming a household name when I was ten, I’ve lived my life in a fishbowl. Everything about my life is managed by other people, including who I&#039;m supposed to date. So when my manager tells me that he&#039;s set up a publicity relationship with pop star Fiona Day, I&#039;m less than thrilled. But when we meet, she&#039;s nothing like I expected. Will this fake relationship for the press actually turn into something real?\n\nGET THE eBOOK NOW:  https://amzn.to/3sZifdd\nLana Dash: https://amzn.to/38OpgH0\nGiveaway:  https://bit.ly/3lJhzVe\nBAD BRIDESMAIDS: https://amzn.to/3GkVBkX\nCURVY GIRLS&#039; GUIDE: https://amzn.to/3Gf5Abq\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
