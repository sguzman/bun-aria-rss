  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Rounding the corner on Season Three, and we’re missing Kresley Cole! This week, we read a book neither of us have read before — Kresley’s <em>Captain of All Pleasures</em>. A Victorian pirate book about a ship race. We talk about the magic of the debut romance, why pirates are often times icky, and why setting a book on a boat is risky business.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we’re back with an interstitial, and in two weeks, we’re reading a romantic suspense—<em>Whiteout</em> by Adriana Anders.
