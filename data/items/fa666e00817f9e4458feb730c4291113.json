  "description": "<p>Who doesn’t want to earn more money?! In a time where we’ve seen wage growth stagnation, workers want to make more or in some cases, they can’t seem to get out of the cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck. Side hustles are the answer! There are lots of pros and cons which we cover, but not all side hustles are created equal. In our new sharing or gig economy, oftentimes the default response to just go drive for Uber or Lyft, or even charge Bird scooters- but we argue that these are dead end ‘hustles’ and aren’t much better than punching the clock at a traditional job. Listen to the entire episode as we list some options and discuss what a better, scalable side hustle looks like.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Tears of My Enemies by Monday Night Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
