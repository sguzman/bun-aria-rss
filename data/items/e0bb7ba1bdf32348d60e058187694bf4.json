  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p><br></p><p>\"We love you chant\" at Trump rallies. Cheating stories already coming out of PA. Rush discusses Fox & Friends appearance. No president has worked this hard for his country. Trump wants every American to have the best possible future. Freedom is fragile: All it took was a virus for Gavin Newsom to tell citizens how to celebrate Thanksgiving in their own homes. Clips from Rush on Fox & Friends. Rush doesn't buy conventional wisdom that early voting is all Democrats. How can you have exit polls with so many mail-in ballots. Exit polls can be wrong, called election for Kerry at 5PM in 2004. Trump voters are angry at the effort to take down Trump and have been waiting to vote for 4 years. Trump voters are the most enthusiastic voters. Win or lose, Trump has already remade the GOP, the Never Trumpers won't get it back. Rush on his cancer diagnosis and his gratitude for his life and country. The day Rush realized how precious life is. Caller says regular rank-and-file Democrats will reject socialism. All eyes on Pennsylvania, stories of cheating already.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p><br></p><p>High turnout in Florida. The Democrat Party doesn't deserve to win. We cannot reward the people who tried to overturn the election of 2016 with a coup based on lies. We cannot reward people who despise the country as founded and want to remake it into a socialist country. Will America survive if Trump loses, like life went on after Clinton won in 1992? Trump has made us energy independent, eliminated our reliance on Middle East and the Democrats want to reverse it. The people who will run America if Biden wins despise the country, think it's the problem in the world. America is a blessed miracle. The problem in the world is not enough capitalism. Rush explains why capitalism is so vital to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p><br></p><p>Rush talks to Donald Trump Jr. about how Election Day looks on the ground, Democrat strategy to contest the election, the freedoms and liberties at stake today.

Don Jr.'s final push to vote. Rush talks to Governor DeSantis on Florida's overwhelming GOP turnout. Facebook censors Mark Levin.
