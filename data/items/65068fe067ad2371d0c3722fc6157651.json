  "description": "This week, the gals salute some of the brave men (AND women, thank you very much) who helped to birth, spank, and cut the umbilical cord of this great nation. Topics include some badass revolutionary secret agents, tax-induced riots, and just how weird Benjamin Franklin truly was. Top off your canteen with Rodney Strong Cabernet Sauvignon, dish up some oyster-flavored ice cream, and tune in for Founding Fathers F*ckery (live from Philadelphia)!",
