I’ve held out on intimacy with him until l got a commitment and he did not have a problem with that. The night that I got the ring, I gave in and we had sex that night. It was not what I expected at all. I’d seen him naked a million times and I knew what he was working with, but I had no idea if he knew what to do with it.............................................................</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
