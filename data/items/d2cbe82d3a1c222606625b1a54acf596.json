  "description": "The impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the country have been widely discussed—but what about the impact on New York City, specifically? In their new anthology, New York After 9/11 (Fordham University Press, 2018), Susan Opotow and Zachary Baron Shemtob examine how life in New York City was drastically altered as examined from various perspectives such as psychology, public health, medicine, architecture, and others. For our interview, Susan Opotow and I discuss the long-term effect of 9/11 on New Yorkers’ lives—how their psyches, relationships, and day-to-day patterns of living were changed for good. We also take up how government entities responded to the tragedy and what can be learned from such responses for informing future disaster-readiness. This interview will be of interest not only for New Yorkers but for anyone interested in the impact of catastrophes on people and places.\nSusan Opotow, Ph.D. is a social psychologist and Professor at the City University of New York, where she is a core faculty member of sociology at John Jay College and of psychology at the Graduate Center.\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami. He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in gender and sexuality, eating and body image problems, and relationship issues. He is a graduate and faculty of William Alanson White Institute in New York City and former chair of their LGBTQ Study Group; and faculty at Florida Psychoanalytic Institute in Miami. He is also a contributing author to the book Introduction to Contemporary Psychoanalysis: Defining Terms and Building Bridges (2018, Routledge).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
