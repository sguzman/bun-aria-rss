Is he listening to this episode?&#13;\n*   With Micah gone this week, we're joined by two of our listeners, Alex and Stefanie, who do their best impressions of the NY News Anchor.&#13;\n*   Patrons in the U.S. have received their mugs, but we need to know if they arrived okay! And if yours arrived broken (rare but possible), let us know.&#13;\n*   This week's episode is [sponsored by Puffs the Play](http://puffstheplay.com/mugglecast)! Receive a special discount on tickets to see Puffs at New York City's New World Stages.&#13;\n*   Chapter by Chapter continues with Chapter 2 of Half-Blood Prince: Spinner's End.&#13;\n*   The brilliance of this chapter is how Snape is playing Bellatrix and Naricissa simultaneously but in different ways.&#13;\n*   How much does Voldemort know about Dumbledore's injury? He can't know about the Horcrux… right?&#13;\n*   Does one line from Bellatrix help make Delphi's existence canon?&#13;\n*   Why would Bellatrix have such a hard time trusting Snape's word when Voldemort is content with his reasoning? And what should she do if she had ever learned the truth?&#13;\n*   Who is the MVP of the chapter? Those poor elves…&#13;\n*   We rename the chapter to reflect what really happens.&#13;\n*   Crackpot Theory: Has Bellatrix made an unbreakable vow before?&#13;\n*   Have questions or comments about HBP Chapter 3?
