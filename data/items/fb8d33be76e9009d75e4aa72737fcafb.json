Mini-stories are fun, quick hit stories that  don’t quite warrant a full episode and two months of hard reporting, but they’re great 99pi stories nonetheless. This week we have stories of 60s cult TV shows, semi-useless gadgets, woo woo miracles cures, and a modern Christmas tradition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=27729&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Mini-Stories: Volume 5</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.radiotopia.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Support Radiotopia today!</a></p>\n",
