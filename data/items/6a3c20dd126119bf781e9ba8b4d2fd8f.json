  "description": "<p><p>What do the Catholic Church, the British monarch, WEEI and Winchester High School all have in common? They're all the subject of Kirk Minihane's ire on today's episode of the show. Minihane reacts to yesterday's breaking news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are eschewing royal life in favor of a more common existence in Canada (0:15:00). Winchester High School is officially dead to Minihane after they invited Boston Globe hack Shirley Leung to talk with students about journalism (0:28:25). Mike Francesa has drifted off into the Radio.com ether where he now does a 90-minute show with few callers and virtually no listeners; Minihane tunes in for some thrilling Wichita State basketball talk (0:45:25). Blind Mike comes prepared for a heated discussion about the Babson College adjunct professor who said Iran should release a list of American cultural sites it intends to bomb (1:11:12). Minihane delves into the Catholic Church thanks to a problematic column for the Boston Globe's Kevin Cullen (1:35:29). The radio show that replaced K&C on WEEI spikes the football over Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (2:01:22).Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
