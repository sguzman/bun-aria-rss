  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, one-party rule is becoming the norm, and even worse most forms of communications (big tech and big media) are run by the left. The idea of progressivism has its roots in the philosophies of Hegel, Marx, and Rousseau and concentrates on egalitarianism and autocratic government. Progressives don't hold on to any permanent truths and seek to rewrite or recreate history. From Cicero's teaching, it's known that virtue is the cornerstone of good government in our Constitutional system and that is not possible when corruption and immorality abound. Later, propaganda is the invisible arm of corrupt governments. Mao, Stalin, and other followers of Marx don't believe in half-Marxists; they destroy what exists and attack the history that came before to promote their revolution. Does anyone know that it wasn't Pelosi who set off these fanatics (who had their attack planned well in advance of Trump's comments)? The BLM bail fund endorsed by Kamala Harris refuses to disclose who they bailed out and she's never apologized for supporting it. When and if Republicans regain power in Congress, the House of Representatives must vote to repeal this unconstitutional impeachment of an innocent man. Then, patriots must stay away from Washington, DC. President Trump has authorized 25,000 National Guard troops and the use of lethal force to protect the Capitol against any violence during the January 20th inauguration. Afterward, Economist and Presidential Advisor Steven Moore call in to discuss Joe Biden's proposed 1.9 trillion-dollar stimulus plan. Moore calls the plan fiscal atrocity and a wish list of liberal, programs stating that the current unemployment rate is equal to the rate for most of the Obama administration and trillions of dollars weren't spent then. Moore argues that 2/3rds of workers will make less money at work than they would if they stay home.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
