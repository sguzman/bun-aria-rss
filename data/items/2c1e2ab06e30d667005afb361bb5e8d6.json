  "description": "I (Daniel) am behind the mic this week as Frank conducts some boots-on-the-ground research into some of his latest ideas. Microsoft (MSFT) is buying gaming giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for around $70 billion. I highlight some details around the merger… Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s incredible deal-making track record… and how this deal sets up Microsoft to become a massive player in the metaverse trend. [1:35] And Microsoft isn’t alone… The world’s largest companies are all investing heavily in the metaverse. In fact, Frank just released his 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) , which includes several stocks set to benefit from this massive growth trend over the coming years. [15:40] I explain why MSFT is a great long-term investment… and why I see a potential arbitrage opportunity in ATVI right now. [16:45] As inflation continues to move higher, so does crude oil—it just hit a seven-year high. I break down the current geopolitical risks to the sector… why investors should brace for oil prices to continue rising… and a few names set to profit from higher crude prices.
