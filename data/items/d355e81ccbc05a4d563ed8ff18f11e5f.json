  "description": "<p>This MMA show was a conversation between Joe and Brendan Schaub about UFC 235. That was a totally stacked card that had some controversy. A conversation needed to be had and Iâ€™m really glad these two got time to go over it. I had some thoughts about these fights so it was nice to review them.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
