  "description": "<p>This paper introduces an abstract spectral approach to prove effective\nequidistribution of expanding horospheres in hyperbolic manifolds. The method,\nwhich is motivated by the approach to counting developed by (Lax-Phillips\n1982), produces highly effective, explicit error terms. To exhibit the\nflexibility of this method we prove effective horospherical equidistribution\ntheorems in $T^1(\\mathbb{H}^{n+1})$ and in the higher rank setting,\n$\\operatorname{SL}_n(\\mathbb{R})/\\operatorname{SO}_n(\\mathbb{R})$.\n</p>",
