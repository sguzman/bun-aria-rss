  "description": "<p>In this week's Phil Vischer Podcast, Skye introduces his new book <em>Futureville</em>. They discuss the current conflict between Hobby Lobby and the new contraception mandate, which leads to a conversation about the role of government and civil disobedience. They talk about the \"controversy\" around the Neil Patrick Harris ad for the Super Bowl, and then a petition to designate the Roman Catholic Church a hate group. The podcast ends with a discussion about whether or not our churches, Christian radio, and Christian entertainment have become too \"family friendly\" and paint an unrealistic portrait of faith.</p>",
