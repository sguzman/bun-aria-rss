  "description": "<p>Deep in the darkest heart of the Philippines sits a terrifying creature. As night falls it begins the hunt for human blood, stalking its prey in the shadows of your town, neighborhood and even your own home.</p> <p>Its tongue drips in hunger, emitting a tick-tick-ticking noise from the vast darkness. This is the aswang, the most feared creature in Philippine folklore.</p> <p>According to Philippine folklore, an aswang is an evil, shapeshifting creature that shares the grotesque characteristics of werewolves, vampires and ghouls. It has no consistent image or description because its appearance varies per region. People have often characterised them based on hearsay, which is why the term aswang has commonly been used as a catch-all description for most evil creatures that lurk in the night.</p> <p>But sometimes….things are not quite as they appear.</p> <p>“To the superstitious, the Huk battleground was a haunted place filled with ghosts and eerie creatures.” -Air Force Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale</p>",
