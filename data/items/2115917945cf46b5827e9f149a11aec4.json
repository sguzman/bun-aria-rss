  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin, If conservatives don’t go to vote in two weeks, it will be our fault if we lose the country to the Left’s radicalism. This election is so consequential because it’s about you. What kind of country do you want to have? How can we allow these rogue leftists to control any part of our government? There are no moderates or centrists in the Democrat party. They out-radical each other. They do not have any fidelity to the rule of law, the Constitution. Then, we have Jamal Khashoggi who we believe was brutally murdered. Yet the Washington Post didn't miss a chance to blame this on President Trump and implicate Mark even though he wasn't even on the air when it was reported! Mark doesn't manage CRTV and is not the managing editor of the 20 plus conservative commentators that appear on CRTV yet multiple news agencies have tried to connect him through \"guilt by association\". Yet again, the media has missed the mark misconstruing the truth. Afterwards, we honor and reflect on the life and legacy of Mark's late father Jack Levin. A devoted husband, father, small businessman, author, illustrator and self-taught Constitutional historian. Mr. Levin was the author of six books including the soon-to-be released title \"Our Police\" available for pre-order on Amazon now. Finally, Chip Roy calls in to discuss his run for Texas’ 21st Congressional District.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
