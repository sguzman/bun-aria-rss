  "description": "<p>DO NOT YOU SKIP THIS ONE. Listen. Give flies a chance. Everyone loves a bee, but meanwhile flies are out here with all kinds of bodies and adaptations, inhabiting the least inhabitable lands, pollinating your future lunch, shimmering in rainbows, having lifelong love affairs, and burrowing in your back to eat your flesh. It’s a wild world and Australian Dipterologist Dr. Bryan Lessard creaks open a door to a wonderland of fly facts. Open a spot in your heart for shiny metallic ones, soft velvety goths, tiny humpbacks named after bodybuilders, and flies that give their lives to further medical research. Oh also: how to kill the ones in your kitchen — if you choose to. But after this, you might open a window and gently suggest their exit first.</p><p>Dr. Lessard’s <a href=\"https://brytheflyguy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a></p><p>Follow Dr. Bryan Lessard on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrytheFlyGuy\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> & <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bry_the_fly_guy/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>A donation was made to <a href=\"https://donate.wwf.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\">WWF</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/dipterology\" target=\"_blank\">More episode sources and links</a></p><p>You may also enjoy our episodes on: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/aperiology\" target=\"_blank\">Aperiology (MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/entomology\" target=\"_blank\">Entomology (INSECTS)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/forestentomology\" target=\"_blank\">Forest Entomology (CREEPY CRAWLIES)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/scorpiology\" target=\"_blank\">Scorpiology (SCORPIONS)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/melittology\" target=\"_blank\">Melittology (BEES)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/lepidopterology\" target=\"_blank\">Lepidopterology (BUTTERFLIES)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/thermophysiology\" target=\"_blank\">Thermophysiology (BODY HEAT)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/carnivorousphytobiology\" target=\"_blank\">Carnivorous Phytobiology (MEAT-EATING PLANTS)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/planariology\" target=\"_blank\">Planariology (VERY COOL WORMS I PROMISE)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-extras\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts and bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/smologies\" target=\"_blank\">Smologies (short, classroom-safe) episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Become a patron of Ologies</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, masks, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://www.jarrettsleeper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of <a href=\"https://www.mindjammedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">MindJam Media</a></p><p>Transcripts by Emily White of <a href=\"https://www.thewordary.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Wordary</a></p><p>Website by <a href=\"https://www.kellyrdwyer.com/photo\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly R.
