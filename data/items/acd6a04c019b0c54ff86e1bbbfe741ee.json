The hepatitis B virus, though second to be named, was first to be discovered, and effective vaccines and treatments have been available for decades.

In this episode, we weave our way through the complicated biology of this virus and its deadly potential, the strange history of its identification that shows that you don't have to be looking for something to find it, and the current status of this virus that underlines how safe, effective tools for disease prevention are only as good as our delivery infrastructure.
