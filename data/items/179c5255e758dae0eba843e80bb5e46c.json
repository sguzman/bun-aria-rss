  "description": "In Episode #208, I’m joined by expert researcher Dr Bill Harris to discuss the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and human health.\n\nIncreasingly, online nutrition conversation is moving away from scientific literature and is more heavily influenced by marketing and controversial claims for personal gain. Whether people are making these statements to grow their online community or capitalise on a financial opportunity, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are yet another topic surrounded by bold claims.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn about the different types of dietary fats and why saturation is important in terms of human health. We cover the connection between cholesterol, fat saturation, and heart disease; the benefits or potential concerns of consuming omega-3s; supplementation guidelines; omega-6s and inflammation; the difference between adequate and optimal intake; and much more.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nWhat are fats? (5:21)\n\nHarris’ research (10:28)\n\nDietary guidelines & saturated fats (12:45)\n\nMonounsaturated fats (24:40)\n\nUnsaturated fats (27:37)\n\nOmega-6s (33:47)\n\nOmega-3s (49:21)\n\nSupplementing (1:21:04)\n\nDHA - prostate cancer & brain health (1:40:16)\n\nOutro (1:55:09)\n\n\nYou can learn more about Dr Bill Harris’ research at the Omega Quant and Fatty Acid Research Institute websites.
