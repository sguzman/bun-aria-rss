  "description": "“Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is a ridiculous one.” Voltaire\nYou know too much, yet understand too little. And it’s the same for me, and everyone you and I happen to know.\nAnd, so it begins.\nWhat follows are a series of posts and audio-casts that respond to this living human condition, bringing together practice materials from non-Buddhism, post-traditional approaches to Buddhism, and the work of Peter Sloterdjik. Each post represents a visit to the Great Feast and provides ideas for practice for those who simply cannot find a home in mainstream Buddhism, Mindfulness, Atheism, or some other form of spirituality.\nThis first part engages Socrates and the Buddha and tosses a practice salad of exiting ingredients for the hungry practitioner.\nIt can be read and re-read here if you still have appetite for more here. \nMatthew O'Connell is a life coach and the host of the The Imperfect Buddha podcast. You can find The Imperfect Buddha on Facebook and Twitter (@imperfectbuddha).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
