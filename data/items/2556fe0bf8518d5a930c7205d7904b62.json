We’ll quickly get acquainted with one Marie de Roux and follow along with her as she makes the choice between the two eligible bachelors she met within a few weeks of each other. Will she pick the Irishman, Patrick O’Connor who had money from honest work and also some money lending on the side or will she go with Frederic Manning who claimed to have an inheritance coming any day now?
