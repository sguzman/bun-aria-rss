  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, thirteen years ago I became friends with a newly-married, young couple at church. They have two children and they are good God-fearing people with large hearts. The only problem is that they are not book smart and the wife is lacking in the common sense department too. They both speak terribly and their subject and verb agreement is always off. Their spelling is even worse...............</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
