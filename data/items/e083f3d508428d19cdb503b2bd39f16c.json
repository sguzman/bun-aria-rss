  "description": "<p>Any fan of Modernism has DWELL Magazine somewhere in their house.  It’s a venerable but relatively recent publication, started in 2000 by <strong>Lara Hedberg Deam</strong> in San Francisco.  She’s still the owner, and like a winning NFL coach, she’s been stocking the team over nearly 20 years with winning players like <strong>Karrie Jacobs, Michela O'Connor Abrams, Amanda Dameron</strong>, and former podcast guest <strong>Alison Arieff</strong>. </p> <p>With a motto of “at home in the Modern World,” DWELL helped re-energize a terrazzo (that’s our new collective noun) of Modern movements:  small houses, modern houses, green houses, sustainable house, micro houses, and prefab houses.  Today we go remote with host <strong>George Smart</strong> in New York, where he sits down with <strong>Bill Hanley</strong>, Editor and Chief of DWELL since February 2019.</p> <p>Hanley is a New York City-based writer, editor, and media producer, focusing on design, art, and urbanism. He was previously the digital director at Surface magazine, senior digital editor at Architectural Record, news editor at ARTnews, staff writer at Rhizome, and editor at ArtInfo.</p>",
