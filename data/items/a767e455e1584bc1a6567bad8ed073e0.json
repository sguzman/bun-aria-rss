  "description": "<p>Today, I'm joined by Haesue Jo, Licensed Therapist & Head of Clinical Operations at BetterHelp, with years of experience providing individual and family therapy in community mental health. Her current clinical focus includes working with individuals with a variety of presenting problems, including anxiety, relationship and family issues, trauma, community violence, gender identity, and depression.</p><p>It’s going to be a little different today as I take the client seat and get a first hand experience of what it’s like to be in a therapy session. This is Part 1 of a 2-Part special episode and we open the conversation by talking about my childhood experiences - how it affects my adulthood, the memories that may seem as passing but are actually traumatic, and how these can possibly lead to repression of painful memories. Haesue also helps uncover the challenges surrounding racism, bullying, identity crisis, teenage struggles, and finding your safe space and security.  </p><p><i>This episode is sponsored by </i><a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/\"><i>BetterHelp</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>What We Discuss:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 Intro</li><li>00:03:36 Why therapists start with talking about childhood </li><li>00:10:22 How did you feel about school in general?</li><li>00:16:26 Repression of painful memories </li><li>00:25:16 How do you feel about being othered?</li><li>00:31:29 What I remember as a teenager</li><li>00:35:04 Choosing to be understood than be liked</li><li>00:42:59 Dealing with racism</li><li>00:50:12 Did you want to understand bullies? </li><li>01:00:02 Can you change your identity?</li><li>01:02:55 When you have some form of security</li></ul><p>Episode Resources</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/\">BetterHelp</a></li></ul><p>Do you want to meditate daily with me?
