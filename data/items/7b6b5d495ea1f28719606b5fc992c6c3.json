  "description": "<p>Readers? There's a new damn president, as a matter of fact. And the Las Culturistas are sort of feeling America and wanting to help change New York City for the absolute better. For that reason the boys welcome Eliza Orlins, beloved <em>Survivor </em>icon and public defender. She's running for Manhattan D.A. and talks with LC about her plan to not simply reform but transform our racist criminal justice system to something that works for all New Yorkers once she is elected in June. Eliza shares how her years representing thousands of New Yorkers and taking on the current D.A. Cyrus Vance inspired her to run for his office. Also, getting your reality TV *MOMENT* in a tube top, how the literal culture that made her say culture was for her (<em>Survivor</em>!) ended up putting her on the map, and some general reactions to the fact that there is a new damn President, as a <em>matter. of. fact</em>. GRLLOOOOOO!!!!! Gonna have to celebrate... THAT one.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
