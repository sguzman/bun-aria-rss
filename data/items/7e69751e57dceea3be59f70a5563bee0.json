  "description": "It's the one question everyone in the world has on their minds--other than will Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson really run for president in 2020.  And that is where will Johnson's predecessor as commander-in-chief, Donald Trump, engage in his first shooting war?  North Korea is seen as perhaps the most frightening candidate...but also, according to our experts, it is probably not the most likely.  Iran seems far more likely.  But what about Venezuela?  What about his next meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell?  Our intrepid gang of Deep State insiders--Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford, and David Sanger of the New York Times (and Harvard) consider our options.
