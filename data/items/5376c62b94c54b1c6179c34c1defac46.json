He tells Dan this week how he has used his own curiosity in others to build powerful relationships.  He takes us back to when he was a law clerk at Warner Bros. delivering papers to the biggest names in Hollywood and how he was able to overcome personal obstacles to strike up conversations he would turn into connections.  Grazer also discusses how he uses transcendental meditation to calm feelings of anxiety and fear. We also discuss his latest book, Face to Face: The Art of Human Connection, his secrets on how to engage with others, and the importance of eye contact is when it comes to building relationships.\nPlug Zone\nFace to Face: https://www.amazon.com/Eye-Contact-Power-Personal-Connection/dp/1501147722\nA Curious Mind: http://www.grazeriscurious.com/\nSocial: @BrianGrazer\nAn Evening with Joseph Goldstein and Dan Harris: Staying Sane in a Crazy World\nhttps://www.nyimc.org/event/an-evening-with-joseph-goldstein-and-dan-harris-staying-sane-in-a-crazy-world/\nDan’s Book Recommendations: https://www.tenpercent.com/reading\nTen Percent Happier Podcast Insiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
