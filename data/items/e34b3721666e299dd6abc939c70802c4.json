  "description": "<p>The DeFi Mullet is a classic Bankless thesis that we've begun to watch play out right in front of us. This week, we bring on Cuy Sheffield from Visa and Diogo Mónica from Anchorage to explain the DeFi mullet from the Fintech side of things.</p> <p>This episode explores how crypto payments are extending beyond retail and into institutions, and how Fintech platforms like Visa are leveling up with the utilities provided by Anchorage to support crypto. Blurring the lines between the two worlds is shaping up to be a fascinating corner of our industry, and there's a ton of new concepts to dive into throughout this conversation.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 OPOLIS | YOUR CRYPTO CAREER<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Opolis\">https://bankless.cc/Opolis</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGGREGATOR<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE YOUR ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a> </p> <p>🧙‍♀️ ALCHEMIX | SELF-PAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">http://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 6:30 Visa & The DeFi Mullet<br /> 15:03 Anchorage & The DeFi Mullet<br /> 18:55 Volatility & Engagement<br /> 25:52 Crypto Rewards<br /> 34:13 How Payments Work<br /> 41:08 Settlement Layers<br /> 46:22 What Anchorage Does<br /> 50:30 Stablecoins & Bridging<br /> 1:00:09 Teaching Visa About Crypto<br /> 1:06:10 Immutable Transactions<br /> 1:13:22 Visa CryptoPunk<br /> 1:22:09 Central Bank Digital Currencies<br /> 1:28:04 Trusting Institutions?<br /> 1:31:52 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
