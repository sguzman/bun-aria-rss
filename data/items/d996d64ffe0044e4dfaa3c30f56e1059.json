  "description": "<p>Spending money is OK- as long as that spending aligns with your values! In this episode, we cover the challenging topic of: the big why that’s behind money. Why do we spend and save? All too often, we go through life doing the things that we're 'supposed to do' without actually considering whether or not those things bring us joy and align with our values. We find ourselves living stock lifestyles as we mindlessly subscribe to the spending patterns that we see around us- STOP! Instead let's try to spend our money intentionally and with purpose, where personal goals and mission statements guide us along.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we each enjoyed a bottle of Voodoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA by New Belgium, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
