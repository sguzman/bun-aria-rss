  "description": "Toasted barrels are all the rage right now, but why? Do they taste better than the regular bourbon counterparts? Or has the consumer shifted their taste profile? In this episode, the Bourbon Pursuit team sits down and blind tastes our way through four samples and we ponder on many questions in the toasted category. Where did it start?
