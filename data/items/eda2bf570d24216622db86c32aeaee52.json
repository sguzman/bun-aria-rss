  "description": "<p>Every day in Pawnee is a sweet treat, and today Rob and Alan are having seconds! In \"Sweetums\" Leslie and Ron become adversaries when a dishonest candy company vies for a concessions contract. On today's episode find out why the Pawnee citizens can be swayed by candy, where you can buy a \"what's crackin'\" belt buckle, and why this episode marks the shift from documentary to hilarious comedy. Got a question for the Pawnee Town Hall? Send us an email: <a href=\"mailto:ParksandRecollectionTownHall@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">ParksandRecollectionTownHall@gmail.com</a> Or leave a 30-Second voicemail at: (310) 893-6992</p><p> </p><p>The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department considers a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market \"nutritious\" snack bars to park visitors. Ron supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie initially supports the deal as well, until Ann informs her they are filled with unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors so they can make an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he is drinking during a recent outing. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's dashingly handsome CEO Nick Newport Jr. (<i>Gary Weeks</i>) and impossible cute kids, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience cheers with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak (\"turf and turf\"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having \"been a horse's ass\".</p><p>For the B-plot, Tom attempts to move out of his home after his divorce from Wendy. Mark reluctantly helps Tom with his pickup truck. Dona, April, Jim, and Andy help with the move, while Tom himself works very little. At the end of the episode, Tom learns that his new home has a gas leak and that he is unable to move into his new home until Monday. Tom asks the gang to take the boxes into their own homes, but they ultimately bring his possessions and leave them in the Parks and Recreation Department office. Throughout the move, April continues to develop romantic feelings for Andy, who remains oblivious to her affections. When April's boyfriend Derek and his gay boyfriend Ben arrive at Wendy's house, they mock Andy, which prompts April to refer to their behavior as \"really gay for a gay couple”. The episode ends with a DJ Rhoomba dressed as a ghost, haunting Jerry and following him down the hallway of City Hall.</p>\n",
