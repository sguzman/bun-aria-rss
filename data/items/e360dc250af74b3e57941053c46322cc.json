  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 60, our WJC coverage continues with Team USA's Brady Tkachuk. The affable BU freshman and 2018 draft-eligible forward joins us to talk about playing in a major outdoor game, #BillsMafia, having an NHL dad, would he ever chuck knucks with his brother Matthew of the Calgary Flames, the upcoming Beanpot, and a lot more. Whits and RA kick things off discussing the Winter Classic and its future viability, why the Montreal media lets the Canadiens front office/ownership off the hook, and the newly-named U.S. Olympic squad then finishes up with #AllRightHamilton.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
