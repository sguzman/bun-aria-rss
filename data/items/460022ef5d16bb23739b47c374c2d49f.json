  "description": "Are there topics you avoid because you don’t want to “go there” with your kids (or yourself)? What do you think would happen if you did? This week, Dr. Becky explores these questions and more in a raw, real, and powerful conversation with her friend Jelani Memory, father of six and founder of A Kid’s Company About. He gets radically honest about the most difficult aspects of his childhood—from being the only Black kid in class to having a strained relationship with his dad—and how processing these experiences led him to publish stories he wished he had as a kid. While his company helps parents talk about tough subjects with kids, Dr. Becky and Jelani reveal how stories like “A Kid’s Book About Shame” can be just as healing for grown-ups, too. You’ll leave this episode reflecting on the impact of your own upbringing, the power of “feeling your feelings,” and how to talk to kids about topics we all too often avoid. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
