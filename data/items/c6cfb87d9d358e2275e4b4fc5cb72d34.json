  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Spectre and Meltdown have continued to receive patches, and they may not be as performance-killing as feared. F-Secure says if you leave your laptop alone it could be pwned in 30 seconds. Mobile ICS apps seem to be getting less, not more, secure. Google boots more bad stuff from the Play Store. Monero miners afflict unpatched Oracle WebLogic servers (so patch). The US Congress considers a Huawei ban. Johannes Ullrich from SANS and the Internet Stormcast podcast on IoT gifts. Guest is Phil Reitinger from the Global Cyber Alliance, an international, non-profit organization headquartered in New York City and London that is focused on eradicating systemic cybersecurity risks. And New Jersey is considering solving one of its biggest problems: droning under the influence. Sprung from cages on Highway 9 or not, don't try that on the turnpike, kids.",
