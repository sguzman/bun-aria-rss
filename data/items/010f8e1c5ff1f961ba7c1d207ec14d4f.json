  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 4/15/21",
  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this program has been focused on what the democrats are doing with immigration and other critical issues for nearly two decades. Sixteen years ago the book \"Men In Black\" thoroughly explained how left-wing politics had eroded the Supreme Court. Now, Democrats have followed Chuck Schumer's lead to continue threatening the Court by expanding it to weaken it so that activist Justices can legislate from the bench. This program has always supported term limits for the Supreme Court, however, in the current political environment, it's being used to manipulate the power of the court not to protect its integrity. Democrats are using every instrumentality they can to move their unpopular agenda forward because they know they could never pass these measures legitimately. Then, James O' Keefe has been suspended from Twitter permanently. O'Keefe called in to discuss his plans to take legal action against Twitter for trying to silence him following the bombshell video his organization released on CNN's own admission of propaganda on hidden camera. Afterward, Dan McLaughlin from National Review calls in to discuss how the Democrat Party is wielding power through surrogates in big corporations. Finally, Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York joins the show to announce his campaign for Governor of New York and his plan to put NY back on track to save the state.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
