Others include the ability to leave things behind when you're ready to move on, finding supportive people to talk to, remembering that our goals will shift anyway, and learning to rely on your own internal validation.&nbsp; We also reconsider reels and talk exhibition prep, framing, and the misery of celebrity life, so this is one not to miss!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mentioned&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Louise's free course <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1huvcf/metadata/edit\">https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-fyj-2022</a></p>\n<p>Alice's new work <a href=\"\">https://alicesheridan.com/duality/&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>The Reel that's going crazy...
