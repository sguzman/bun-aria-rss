  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview Karen Glass. Karen is part of the Advisory of <a href= \"http://www.amblesideonline.com\">AmblesideOnline</a>. She has four children, ages 13 to 27, who have been homeschooled using Charlotte Mason’s methods from beginning to end. She has been studying and writing about Charlotte Mason and Classical Education for over twenty years, and has written <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2vmsRYW\">Consider This</a></em> to share the most important things she has discovered about the connection between them. We are giving away a copy of her newest book, <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2TmkS6c\">In Vital Harmony</a></em>, to 2 lucky listeners who share about this podcast episode on Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag #invitalharmony.</p> <p>After sharing their commonplace quotes, our hosts dive into this conversation with Karen about how she became a lover of books. She talks about her voracious reading as a child and teen. Karen also recounts how her mediocre education did not discourage her reading life but just gave her more time and reason to read. This leads into a meaty discussion among Karen, Cindy and Angelina about self-education, homeschooling and lifelong learning.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Let us consider an apple. If we approach it synthetically, we take it as we find it–in its state of wholeness and completeness–and we eat it. Once eaten, it is digested, absorbed, and becomes a part of us. If we approach it analytically, we take it apart–not in a natural way, which is merely a smaller portion (here is half an apple!), but rather, here is the fiber, here are the vitamins, here is a bit of water, and some sugar. Suppose we ingest each bit–a spoonful of fiber, a vitamin pill, a swallow of sugar-and-water. On paper, we have consumed the same thing in both cases–equal portions of nutrition–but there is a very, very large difference. Only one of those meals tasted good and created an appetite for more.</p> <cite>Karen Glass</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>However difficult it may be to characterize correctly the medieval class system, it is even more difficult to grasp medieval thinking, which was broadly metaphorical and analogical, rather than merely logical and rational.</p> <cite>Thomas Cahill</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Remember that the uttermost penalty was reserved for him who could say to his brother “Thou fool!” because contempt was the most un-godlike quality which man could display. Beware above all things lest a little knowledge only reinforce conceit and lead you into a false world where self is enthroned, far away from the true world which is illuminated by the love of God, manifested in the Person of the Incarnate Word.</p> <cite>Mandell Creighton</cite></blockquote> <h3>A Poison Tree</h3> <p><em>by William Blake</em></p> <p>I was angry with my friend; <br /> I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br /> I was angry with my foe: <br /> I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br /> <br /> And I waterd it in fears,<br /> Night & morning with my tears: <br /> And I sunned it with smiles,<br /> And with soft deceitful wiles. <br /> <br /> And it grew both day and night. <br /> Till it bore an apple bright. <br /> And my foe beheld it shine,<br /> And he knew that it was mine. <br /> <br /> And into my garden stole, <br /> When the night had veild the pole; <br /> In the morning glad I see; <br /> My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>Amazon Affiliate links are used in this content.</em></span></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cbqtoM\">Consider This</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/384oTlb\">Mind to Mind</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cdTnEs\">Know and Tell</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TmkS6c\">In Vital Harmony</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3c7wQtf\">Mysteries of the Middle Ages</a></em> by Thomas Cahill</p> <p><em><a href= \"https://archive.org/details/thoughtsoneduca00creigoog/page/n9/mode/2up\"> Thoughts on Education</a></em> by Mandell Creighton</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vbCoSS\">Bedtime for Frances</a></em> by Russel Hoban</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ajPFaX\">Petunia</a></em> by Roger Duvoisin</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cfQkvQ\"><em>Dorrie’s Magic</em></a> by Patricia Coombs</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VoAyIL\"><em>Watership Down</em></a> by Richard Adams</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VoASHt\">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a></em> by J.
