  "description": "<p>Matt & Bow are actually tickled and thrilled to welcome the truly funny and \"helareos\" Jimmy Fowlie to Las Cultch! On this ep, the three homosexual men chat about hidden perversity in Disney media, <em>Strangers With Candy</em> and <em>The Real World</em> as formative culture. Jimmy opens up about how a recent breakup has been affecting his comedy, and the boys get into it about modern gay relationships and how they can sometimes lead to making empty threats in WeHo Gold's Gym parking lots. Plus, the queers reveal the weird and very fucked ways they started masturbating. All this, a truly haunting I Don't Think So Honey from Jimmy, and a performance of \"Sparks Fly\" by Tayla Swiff.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
