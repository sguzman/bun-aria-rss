    "media:description": "I have tried very hard to avoid any obvious spoilers for those who don't know the story yet. This means that I couldn't talk in detail about some important themes that happen later into the game, without having to give away major plot details. I hope you still enjoy my overview of the Steins;Gate world and what it means to me.\n\nI discovered today an excellent video called \"Steins;Gate Unlocked\" on the channel Beyond Ghibli: https://youtu.be/pQpOz3KVK_s\nI enjoyed it very much and do recommend it!\nJust in case you think this is an odd coincidence (it is - but then, lots of videos have been made about Steins;Gate) - I've been working on my video the last 3 weeks. ðŸ˜Ž\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Intro\n01:20 The game: LE and history\n06:35 Makise Kurisu figure\n07:50 Is Steins;Gate \"slow\"?\n09:40 the Butterfly Effect (Chaos Theory)\n10:05 Mayuri figure\n11:55 The other Steins;Gate games\n14:30 Steins;Gate Elite limited edition\n15:18 The anime\n16:10 The ScienceAdventure series\n16:38 Why is SG important to me?\n\nSteins;Gate is rated M (Mature 17+) by the ESRB. My video is therefore NOT suitable for children as per the COPPA legislation.\n\n#SteinsGate #VisualNovel #MakiseKurisu #Mayuri",
