  "title": "PMS 2.0 175 - The Coronavirus Is A Rather Large Deal. Also, ESPN's Dan Orlovsky & The Athletic's Senior NBA Insider Shams Charania Stopped By To Talk About Life",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat reacts to the expanding news of how serious the coronavirus pandemic is and further looks at how it is going to impact sports for the foreseeable future as the NCAA just announced they are canceling March Madness, the NBA is suspending it's season, and more leagues are looking into doing the same. Also joining the show is 12 year NFL Quarterback, current NFL analyst at ESPN, and friend of the program, Dan Orlovsky. Dan chats about just getting back from Disney World and going through the anxiety of making sure his family is okay as people are starting to be quarantined and go into lockdown. Dan and Pat also chat about Tom Brady's free agency, why the coronavirus won't inhibit teams from going after Brady, and why Dan thinks the Bucs are a very interesting and promising destination for Brady to end up (14:39-28:53). Also joining the show is Senior Lead NBA Insider and Analyst for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania. Shams discusses breaking the news that Rudy Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for coronavirus, what the next steps and precautions are for the NBA as a whole, when he sees the NBA resuming its season, and what it was like interviewing Gobert in person just two weeks before he tested positive for coronavirus (28:55-34:24). Lastly, Oklahoma City Thunder beat writer for The Athletic, Erik Horne stops by to chat about what it was like being in the arena as the Jazz/Thunder game was cancelled, the pulse of the fans in the stadium and whether they knew exactly what was going on, and what he's hearing around the league in terms of when teams will resume practicing and playing, and what teams are doing in terms of trying to stop the virus from spreading. At times like these, it's important for all of us to stick together and find a way to persevere through this. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
