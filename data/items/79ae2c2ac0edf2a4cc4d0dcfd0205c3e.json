  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does trainer and fitness model Whitney Johns have one of the best bodies in real life and on the socials, but she is a super smart and down to earth business badass. Bunnie and Whitney talk about how her app Fit With Whit is helping people at home now more than ever, a few of her health and fitness tips, what it was like to be a professional bodybuilder, and what she really eats in a day. Then, Whit and Bunnie play a hilarious game of ‘Would You Rather’. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> Whitney grew up in Idaho in a Mormon family.
