  "description": "George Conway, conservative lawyer and outspoken Trump critic, joins Preet Bharara for a special episode of Stay Tuned, \"Diagnosing Trump.\" A longstanding member of the Federalist Society who played a critical role in Clinton's impeachment, Conway is one of the few conservative voices openly challenging Trump’s presidency—and calling for his impeachment.\n\nYou may be familiar with Conway’s other half: Kellyanne Conway, who currently serves as Counselor to the President. Despite his wife’s work, Conway continues to publicly pen—on Twitter and in editorials—his virulent criticisms of Trump.\n\nIn this exclusive, wide-ranging interview, Conway discusses why Trump’s narcissism renders him incapable of carrying out presidential duties, the likelihood and contours of impeachment, the 2020 presidential election, and whether history will be kind to those who stayed silent during Trump’s tenure.\n\nTo hear bonus clips from the interview, try two free weeks of CAFE Insider membership.\n\nSign up to receive free references and supplemental materials for Stay Tuned episodes, a weekly newsletter, and updates from Preet.\n\nAs always, tweet your questions to @PreetBharara with hashtag #askpreet, email us at staytuned@cafe.com, or call 699-247-7338 to leave a voicemail. \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
