  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you ever wonder if maybe your Mom was right? As a 15 year old ‘sexually ignorant Midwest teenager’, Ryan Vermouth’s weeping mother confronts him. She knows he’s gay… he doesn’t think so, yet he fears she might know him better than he knows himself. So when Ryan attends his college’s annual drag ball with Bisexual/Bicoastal Jenny-cum-Johnny, he learns some empowering adult lessons about lube, bondage tape, and how clarifying it can be to transform your childhood traumas into joy, connection, and new, nourishing kinks. #TwoGoodHands #Bullied #LightlyGenderBent #YouDontHaveToKnow</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Sex is Good, but have you Tried’ (Donna Missal)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Ryan Vermouth has always been intensely curious about people, which is why he became a social scientist, an actor, and kind of a slut. Six months and two variants ago, he was scheduled to perform at the August show until it was canceled—but he couldn't be more excited that the delay has given him a chance to be a part of Bawdy’s anniversary show (and also to further workshop his story in therapy).</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Episode links:<br /></strong></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>May is Share-a-Story month:</strong></span> <strong>Wanna send me a story, in written form or in your own voice?
