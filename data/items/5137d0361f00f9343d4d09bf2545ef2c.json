  "description": "<p>End-to-end encryption is a way to keep messages private. It&#8217;s sometimes used by apps, which basically turn those messages into unintelligible chunks of data as soon as a user hits &#8220;Send.&#8221; The idea is that no one, except sender and recipient, can access that message. Not hackers, not third parties, not even the app platform itself. And you need special &#8220;keys&#8221; stored on an individual device to decrypt it. But many messaging platforms don&#8217;t have this kind of encryption, and some provide it only as an option.
