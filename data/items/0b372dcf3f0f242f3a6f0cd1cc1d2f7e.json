  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, there's a serious question as to whether the Biden Administration manipulated the census numbers to mitigate the negative fallout of Democrats losing seats in the house based on population. Nancy Pelosi claims she's not concerned that the latest census will eliminate Democrat house seats after the recent growth in Latinos because of immigration. No society can withstand mass migration; this is a concept that even Democrats once agreed with. For more than 50 years the Democrats have been deceiving the public about the elimination of immigration quotas from any one particular region of the globe. Cesar Chavez a prominent Democrat and agriculture labor leader vehemently opposed illegal immigration because of the detriment it had on Americans of Hispanic heritage. Then, Biden is stopping military veterans from meeting up in the pentagon parking due to COVID but allows thousands to cram into border facilities that are only designed to house hundreds at. Later, LatCrit is a theory that the U.S. has never belonged to White Europeans but instead to indigenous people and no White person can dictate that. Afterward, Oprah Winfrey's book calls for a strengthened sense of self-worth while she supports people that call most Americans racist. Finally, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani joins the show to reveal the truth behind the aggressive unconstitutional harassment and breach of his Attorney-Client privilege. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
