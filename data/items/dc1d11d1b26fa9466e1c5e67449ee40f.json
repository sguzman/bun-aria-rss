    "media:description": "After a horrific attack on an Israeli family by a Lebanese teenager working with the Palestine Liberation Front (a faction of the PLO) in 1979, Israel looked for an ally to help create a secure buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon. \n\nHowever, working with the  President-elect of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel, proved to have deadly consequences. His paramilitary group, the Phalangists massacred between 800 and 2,000 people in two Palestinian refugee camps called Sabra and Shatila. \n\nWith the world in an uproar over the horrific news of this event, all fingers pointed blame towards Israel. Although the IDF entered Lebanon to stop the PLO’s terror, Israel accepted responsibility for the part they played in the dark story of Sabra and Shatila. \n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video— Is Israel An Occupying Power?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqssx4rmAWo&list=PL-DNOnmKkUaY5PZL4kwVKfceXPI8G-lIV&index=4\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nExecutive Producers:\n— Debra Klein\n— Avi Naider\n— Jerry Ostrov\n— Barry Skolnick\n\nGold Level:\n— Blavatnik Family Foundation\n— The Associated’s Insight Israel Forum\n— The Crane Foundation\n— Aimee & Jerry Ostrov\n— Skolnick Family Charitable Trust\n\nSilver Level:\n— Sig and Miriam Feiger Family Foundation\n— The Messinger Family Charitable Fund\n— Rachie and Jon Teller\n\nBronze Level:\n— The Bernstein Family Foundation\n— Jewish Federation of Broward County\n— Betsy and Philip Darivoff\n— Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit\n— JCRC of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia\n— Marilyn and Neville Isaacson\n— Corie and Michael Koss\n— Steve Miller\n— Pamela Rose\n— Kim and Perry Shwachman\n— Marci and Andrew Spitzer\n\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\n\nAssociated Press\nBBC\nBritish Pathé\nwww..CottonwoodMansionMuseum.com\nDutch National Archives\nHistorical Jewish Press website – www.jpress.org.il – founded by the National Library and Tel Aviv University\nIDF and Defense Establishment Archives\nIsraeli Government Press Office.
