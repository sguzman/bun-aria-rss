  "description": "The first 4 episodes introduced you to Stephanie Cadena, Chase’s mother, and Brad Clement, the friend who was the last known person to see Chase before he vanished 3 years ago. The person you have not heard from yet is Amanda Massner, Chase’s wife. This is unfortunate, since, Brad said some pretty bad things about Amanda when Nancy Grace confronted him in episodes 3 & 4. We still hold out hope the Amanda will talk to us directly,  but until then, we can let you hear what Amanda said in the first weeks after her husband went missing.  \n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
