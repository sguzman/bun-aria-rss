  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss watching the election coverage last night and how impressed they were with John King, Bill Hemmer, & Steve Kornachi's talent with their boards and touch screens, and how difficult of a job that must be. Pat also gives out his exactly halfway through the NFL season awards and takes a look at Thursday night's game between the 49ers and Packers. Joining the show is a Pro Bowler, a man coming off having 226 total yards and 4 touchdowns against the Packers, Running Back for the Minnesota Vikings, Dalvin Cook. Pat and Dalvin chat about his special day on Sunday and if he knew things were going to go that way when he got on the field, if it's tough playing in the cold being from Florida, what it is about being from that area in Florida that produces so many NFL players, his running style, and how tough this season has been with the Covid protocols (24:12-38:51). Later, VP of Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sport podcast, former VP of Finance for the Green Bay Packers, and friend of the show, Andrew Brandt, joins the program. Pat and Andrew discuss why the Packers didn't make a move at the deadline, why that is typically not a strategy in Green Bay, what he thinks will ultimately happen with Stephon Gilmore, and why he thinks a lot of marquee players will be released this offseason with the cap going down drastically (54:02-1:07:20). To close the show, Pat and AJ Hawk discuss the Packers not making any moves at the deadline, if he thinks they're angling to put Jordan Love in a position to play, his thoughts on the Thursday Night Game, and more (1:09:40-1:31:24).
