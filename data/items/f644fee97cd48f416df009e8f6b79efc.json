  "description": "The male G-spot is the prostate. Yes, men have a G-spot too and it’s in their butt. The time has come to leave your fears behind, and go on an adventure through the backdoor. My guest Charlie Glickman, author of The Ultimate Guide to Prostate Pleasure: Erotic Exploration for Men and Their Partners, explains how to pleasure the prostate, from finding it to stimulating techniques. Before you Poo-poo the idea of prostate pleasure, have an open-mind (and a open behind). If men stopped resisting everything they think challenges their masculinity, they could be free to experience a lot more pleasure. Plus, a dude who’s actually secure with himself and his sexuality won’t be worried if something he’s doing is considered manly or \"straight\" enough. Use coupon code EMILY for 15% off at <a href=\"http://www.goodvibes.com/display_category.jhtml?id=catalog70002_cat33804&sort=priceDescend&kbid=162346\">Good Vibrations</a>: <a href=\"http://www.goodvibes.com/display_category.jhtml?id=catalog70002_cat33804&sort=priceDescend&kbid=162346\">http://bit.ly/19rLghs</a>.
