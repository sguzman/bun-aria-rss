  "description": "<p>Evan Ratliff is cofounder, CEO, and editor of The Atavist, a monthly magazine of long-form, non-fiction journalism, and, more recently, a platform (called just \"Atavist\") for other publications and organizations to use to publish stories to many destinations: the Web, mobile apps, EPUB for e-readers, and beyond. We talk about both aspects of the operation and what led the magazine to build its own content-management and publishing system, and then to turn around and resell that as a product. (We spoke just before the magazine part of The Atavist added a subscription option to its iOS app.)</p>\n\n\n\n",
