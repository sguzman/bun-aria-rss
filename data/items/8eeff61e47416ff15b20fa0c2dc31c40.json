  "description": "<p>It’s February 9, 1999. Hae has been missing for three weeks. A man on his lunch break pulls off a road to pee, and stumbles on her body in a city forest. His odd recounting of the discovery makes Detectives Ritz and MacGillivary suspicious. For instance, why did he walk so far into the woods - 127 feet - to relieve himself? And that’s just the start. A look into the man’s past reveals some bizarre behavior.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/zsYOyC2Ljyw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",
