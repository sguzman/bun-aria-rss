  "title": "PMS 2.0 112 - Matt Hasselbeck, Macho Scotty Smalls, & A Peek Inside Our Lives",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record the show live from the box truck in Greenville, North Carolina. He chats more about his take on marijuana in the NFL after Percy Harvin publicly stated that he was high during every NFL game he played in, and why Pat thinks that is more beneficial to players long term than pain killers and other remedies. Also stopping by the box truck is friend of the show and Pat’s teammate both on the field and the broadcast booth, Matt Hasselbeck, joins the show with the entire Temple University football video team including the certifiable content machine that is Macho Scotty Smalls. They chat about the punting challenge he issued to Pat, and the $10,000 purse for charity that is now on the line. Scotty and the Temple football video guys chat about what it means to be Temple Tuff, being from near Philadelphia, their takes on Philly cheesesteaks, and Matt recounts a hilarious story that occurred during his time in Seattle. Pat and the boys also vent about all the technical issues that are still plaguing the studio and the box truck, and whether or not everything will ever work the way it was intended to. Don’t forget to tune in to #TNFonESPN as Pat, Matt, Adam Amin, and Molly McGrath call the action between Temple and ECU at 8 PM EST on ESPN. Today’s show is a therapeutic, fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
