  "title": "25 - How NOT to Talk to an Atheist - Guest Mark Salomon",
  "description": "In this episode we feature our friend Mark Salomon, who emailed us for help after a crash and burn debate with an atheist on another podcast he was a guest on, The Pastor with No Answers (https://soundcloud.com/pastor-with-no-answers).  We'd encourage you to go and listen to both (yes, both) episodes where, unexpectedly, Mark finds himself in a debate with an atheist, and not a conversation.  We've all been there.  Mark Salomon sings for the band Stavesacre and was a leading archetype for the birth of the \"Christian\" punk and hardcore scene in the 80's and also hosts his own podcast, Never Was.  We also uncover really what the Ohio State colors represent for Mike.  Share and enjoy.  All links for this show are in the producer notes below.  Warning, there is mild profanity used in this episode.
