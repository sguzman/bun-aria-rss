  "description": "Ohio State-Nebraska! Vandy-Auburn! Iowa-Penn State! TCU-Baylor! These are but a few of the games that we managed to not discuss this week, in part because Spencer's internet connection died before we could. (The other part: we're biased and hate your team.) What did we talk about instead?\n- How Alabama is sabotaging its own championship hopes\n- When we decided LSU was dead\n- Designing a fitting trophy for Michigan State-Rutgers\n- Why the Pac-12 gives Spencer maximum entertainment\n- Ryan's the one mad at Florida now apparently\n- Special guest Brian Floyd breaks down Arizona\n- The holiest path ahead for Hugh Freeze\nLearn more about your ad choices.
