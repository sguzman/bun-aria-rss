We are shuttling pounds and pounds of food into this tube we have called the digestive system several times a day and we don’t give it a second thought—it’s pretty crazy when you think about it. The gut is responsible for our ability to turn food into fuel; to absorb and even create certain nutrients; to rid the body of harmful toxins on a daily basis. We rely on it to do so much for us.&nbsp;</p><br><p>It’s also one of my favorite topics as a Functional Medicine doctor—poop, the microbiome, the gut-immune and gut-brain connections—there are so many angles we need to look at with gut health and they can tell us an amazing amount of information about the rest of the body. That’s why I’m so excited for this week’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, where I sit down with my friend and colleague Dr. Todd LePine to take a deeper look at digestive health and the fascinating collection of life forms we carry around inside and on us, called the microbiome.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Joovv and Thrive Market.</p><br><p>Recently I shared with you that I’m really excited to be working out with a trainer. And while I’m loving these new workouts, I am not always loving feeling sore the next day. That’s why I’m so excited about a new tool I found that helps me recover faster, it’s a red light therapy device called Joovv. Red light therapy is a super gentle non-invasive treatment where a device with medical-grade LEDs delivers concentrated light to your skin and cells. It helps your body produce more cellular energy and reduce oxidative stress, which helps tired and damaged muscle tissue repair and regenerate faster.
