While some of us may have the God-given gift of evangelism (Eph. 4:11), all of us are called to make disciples—but what does this look like in the context of everyday mom life? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss what it means to be a faithful presence in our communities, showing our neighbors what it looks like to hope in Christ. There are a lot of reasons it can feel scary or hard to share the good news of the gospel with those we know, but we can trust that as we pursue obedience in Christ, the Holy Spirit is working in us to bear fruit in our life and the lives of others.</span></p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our generous donors.
