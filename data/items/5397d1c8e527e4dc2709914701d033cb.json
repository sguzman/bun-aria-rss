    "media:description": "Procrastination plagues us all, including fictional characters Rick and Morty. In Season 6, Episode 4, Rick Sanchez invents a “Somnambulator” to get work done while he’s sleeping. Humans, unfortunately, can’t rely on sci-fi technology to save us. What can help us, however, is learning how to sympathize with our future selves.\n——————————\nCREDITS: \nWritten by Jack Nicastro, Abby Richardson, & Sean W.
