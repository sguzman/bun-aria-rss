The industrial production (IP) index measures the real output of the manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities industries; the reference period for the index is 2017. Manufacturing consists of those industries included in the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, definition of manufacturing&nbsp;<em>plus</em>&nbsp;those industries—logging and newspaper, periodical, book, and directory publishing—that have traditionally been considered to be manufacturing and included in the industrial sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A complete description of the market and industry structures, including details regarding series classification, relative importance weights, and data sources, is available on the <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/About.htm\" title=\"About G.17 Industrial Production Capacity Utilization Releases\">Board&#8217;s website</a> about G.17 Industrial Production Capacity Utilization Releases.</p>The post <a href=\"https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2022/08/fred-expands-g-17-industrial-production-and-capacity-utilization/\">FRED Expands G.17 Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://news.research.stlouisfed.org\">St. Louis Fed Economic Research</a>."
