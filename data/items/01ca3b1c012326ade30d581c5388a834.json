  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, nothing has changed in the last 24 hours following the Capitol building siege, yet Democrats and Republicans alike are turning on President Trump. Some going as far as calling for the removal of the President in his last 13 days in office by way of the 25th Amendment, as well as threats of another impeachment. Plus, Cabinet Secretary Elaine Chao has announced her resignation just eight days shy of the administration's end.  The media is falsely claiming that Trump incited an insurrection. These vile remarks by the media are cancerous to our republic. One publisher has gone as far as canceling the book deal of one Republican Senator for his support of the constitution at yesterday's electoral vote count and certification.  Later, the double standard of the Democrats and RINO’s for only calling out violence when they don’t agree is appalling. The fact is President Trump did not make any calls for violence, period. Afterward, Ben Domenech of The Federalist calls in to discuss the consequences of the capitol assault.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
