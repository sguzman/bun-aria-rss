  "description": "<p>In part 1 (0-19:15), Tim and Jon quickly review the last episode. Tim says the entire scriptural<br />\ncanon is to be viewed as “wisdom literature,” but the books that specifically pertain to Solomon,<br />\nProverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and Job are considered to be the classic wisdom<br />\nbooks.<br />\nThen they dive into examining the trees in the garden of Eden. Specifically the “Tree of the<br />\nKnowledge of Good and Evil.” Tim notes that the Hebrew word ra<code> doesn’t necessarily imply “evil;” it only means “bad.” Tim shares some other examples of the Hebrew word ra</code> in the Bible.<br />\nGood/Bad condition or quality:<br />\nJeremiah 24:1-2<br />\nthe Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord. One basket<br />\nhad very tov figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very ra’ figs, so ra’ they could<br />\nnot be eaten.<br />\nProverbs 25:19<br />\na ra’ tooth and an unsteady foot, is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.<br />\nPleasant/unpleasant, beneficial/harmful:<br />\n1 Kings 5:4<br />\nBut now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no enemy or ra’.<br />\nJudges 16:25<br />\nIt so happened when they were tov of heart, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may<br />\namuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made<br />\nhim stand between the pillars.<br />\nEcclesiastes: 2:16-17<br />\nFor the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered; the days have already come when both<br />\nhave been forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die! So I hated life, because the work that<br />\nis done under the sun was ra’ to me.<br />\nTim’s point is that to use the English word “evil” loads in too many ideas about moral issues<br />\nbetween good and evil. Because of this, a more accurate translation would be “the tree of the<br />\nknowledge of good and bad.”<br />\nIn part 2 (19:15-30:00), Tim notes that Adam and Eve are depicted as being in their moral<br />\ninfancy in the garden. They don’t know what is right and wrong. They need God to teach them<br />\nhow to be wise and how to choose what is right from wrong. Here are some other passages that<br />\nuse the Hebrew phrase “tov and ra’” or “good and bad” to illustrate this moral infancy in the<br />\nBible.<br />\n“Knowing tov and ra’” is a sign of maturity. The phrase appears elsewhere to describe children:<br />\nDeuteronomy 1:39<br />\n“...your little ones... and your sons, who today do not know good or evil, shall enter there, and I<br />\nwill give it to them and they shall possess it.<br />\n1 Kings 3:7-9<br />\n“Now, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am</p>\n<p>but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. So give Your servant a heart that<br />\nlistens, to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this<br />\ngreat people of Yours?”<br />\nIsaiah 7:15-16<br />\n“[Immanuel] will eat curds and honey at the time He knows to refuse evil and choose good. For<br />\nbefore the boy will know to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread<br />\nwill be forsaken.<br />\nThe narrative in Genesis 1-2 has shown that God knows what is “pleasant/beneficial,” and he<br />\nwill provide tov (the woman) when something is not tov (man being alone), that is, ra’. So the<br />\ntree represents a choice: Will they live with God, allowing him to know/define tov and ra’?<br />\nPresumably they need this knowledge as they mature, but the question is who will teach it to<br />\nthem? Will they learn from watching God’s knowledge at work?<br />\nAdam and Eve are portrayed as “children.” The tree of knowing tov and ra’ represents two<br />\noptions or modes for how to know and experience tov and ra’: Will they “take” this knowledge for<br />\nthemselves, so that they “become like elohim,” knowing what is tov and ra’? Or instead, will they<br />\nallow God to teach them wisdom? The gift of God to the man and woman became the means of<br />\nthe downfall. Instead of waiting for God to teach them “knowing good and bad,” they chose to<br />\ntake it for themselves, in their own time and way.<br />\nGenesis 3:6<br />\nWhen the woman saw that the tree [of knowing good and bad] was good for food, and that it<br />\nwas a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise (Heb. śekel), she<br />\ntook from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.<br />\n“Wisdom” = śekel (להשכיל:(<br />\n“śekel refers to a kind of wisdom. Its core meaning is “insight,” the ability to grasp the meanings<br />\nor implications of a situation or message. Śekel is consequently discernment or prudence, the<br />\nability to understand practical matters and interpersonal relations and make beneficial decisions.<br />\nIt later comes to include intellectual understanding and unusual expertise.” (Michael V. Fox,<br />\nProverbs 1–9: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, vol. 18A, Anchor Yale<br />\nBible [New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 2008], 36.)<br />\nIn part 3 (30:00-39:45), Tim and Jon discuss the fallout of Adam and Eve’s decision to eat from<br />\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and bad. When God holds “trial” with Adam and Eve, their<br />\nresponse is to “fear” Yahweh, but in a way that drive them away from him.<br />\nGenesis 3:8-10<br />\nThey heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man<br />\nand his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.<br />\nThen the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” He said, “I heard the<br />\nsound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”<br />\nThen they blame each other: man and woman, united in their rebellion and divided by the<br />\nfallout.<br />\nGenesis 3:16<br />\n“Yet your desire will be for your husband,<br />\nAnd he will rule over you.”<br />\nThis is the opposite of the ideal vision in Genesis 1:26-28 where man and woman rule together.<br />\nThe two are no longer one, but rather two, trying to gain leverage over one another.<br />\nIn part 4 (39:45-end), the guys discuss how God acts mercifully after Adam and Eve eat of the<br />\ntree. Tim then starts to look forward to the stories of Solomon and how it hyperlinks back to the story of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nMichael V.
