  "description": "<p>Donald Trump took office 977 days ago, and it has been exhausting. Independent of where you are politically, I think we can all agree that the news cycle coming out of Washington DC has been very intense for anyone who has been paying attention at all. One of the reasons for the fervor is Trump’s role as a very norm breaking president. If you like him, that’s why you like him, if you hate him, that’s why you hate him. But my reaction to all this, was that I realized I didn’t really know what all the norms and rules are, so I wanted to create for myself a Constitutional Law class and the syllabus would be determined by Trump’s tweets. This is where my friend, neighbor and brains behind this operation, Elizabeth Joh, comes in. She is a professor at the UC  Davis school of law and she teaches Con Law. And since June of 2017, she has been kind enough to hang out with me and teach me lessons about the US Constitution, that I then record and release as the podcast <em>What Trump Can Teach us About Con Law</em>. We call it <em>Trump Con Law</em> for short.</p>\n<p>After a long hiatus, we’re back with monthly episodes, so I wanted to reintroduce it to the 99pi audience because you may not know about it and because people often comment that the nature of the calm historically grounded, educational discussion is a soothing salve amidst the chaotic and unnerving political news of the day.</p>\n<p>We’re presenting two classic episodes on Impeachment and Prosecuting a President.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-trump-can-teach-us-about-con-law/id1242537529\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href=\"https://radiopublic.com/TrumpConLaw\" target=\"_blank\">RadioPublic</a></p>\n",
