    "media:description": "I'm almost sold on the idea of the Apple Watch Ultra but I am slightly on the fence about its size. Will it just feel too big to wear day to day?\n\nIn this video I compare the Apple Watch Ultra with my Apple Watch Series 5 to see just how much bigger it feels and looks. \n\nMany thanks to the Apple Store in Bath for being very accommodating with their filming policy. (I was allowed to film the device but not customers, staff or audio, which I felt was more than reasonable so I'm very grateful for that). \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is in stock for next day delivery from Amazon UK (with 5 months 0% finance too): https://amzn.to/3y24Qni (using this link supports the channel at no cost to you, much appreciated)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nðŸŽ¬ My YouTube camera gear:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing these links to buy items helps support this channel at no cost to you!\n\nðŸ“· Camera:\nAmazon UK: https://amzn.to/3fFHMQO\nAmazon US: https://amzn.to/2VasWIQ\n\nðŸ“¸ Lenses:\nAmazon UK: https://amzn.to/36cawNP https://amzn.to/36eVZ3W\nAmazon US: https://amzn.to/3q8QY4Y \n\nðŸŽ¤ Mic:\nAmazon UK:  https://amzn.to/36cVgjM\nAmazon US:  https://amzn.to/36bAyAU\n\nðŸŽ§ Audio interface:\nAmazon UK:  https://amzn.to/3mfkAeN\n\nðŸ’¡Studio light:\nAmazon UK: https://amzn.to/3Csigdo\nAmazon US: https://amzn.to/3IYDimb\n\nðŸŽ¶The music in my videos: \nhttps://artlist.io/Ben-572654\n\nðŸ”ŒSave Â£50 when you switch to Octopus Go with this link (UK): https://share.octopus.energy/aqua-eagle-751",
