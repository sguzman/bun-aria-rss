  "description": "Crypto analyst and trader Jason Pizzino is optimistic that Bitcoin will hit a seven-figure price over time.\n\nIn a new video update, Pizzino tells his 263,000 YouTube subscribers that it’s “not too far out of the question” for the king cryptocurrency to rally by around 25 times and reach a price of $1,000,000 per BTC.\n\n“A 25x might seem like it’s a little far-fetched. But as we can see from December 2018 to the current top in 2021 in November, it’s basically been a 22x return. So 2,100% here. So it’s not too far out of the question. But I just think it’s going to take a lot more time than people are expecting.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
