File up your belly on each inhale. Drop your shoulder and soften your body on each exhale.</p></li>\n<li><p>Say these eight phrases to yourself, or your own variation of them. Consider which resonates with you the most:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>a. “In the presence of fear, I will make space for courage.”</p>\n\n<p>b. “In the presence of self-doubt, I will make space for self-belief.”</p>\n\n<p>c. “In the presence of hurriedness, I will make space for slowing down.”</p>\n\n<p>d. “In the presence of overwhelm, I will make space for rest.”</p>\n\n<p>e. “In the presence of overthinking, I will make space for letting go.”</p>\n\n<p>f. “In the presence of chaos, I will make space for inner peace.”</p>\n\n<p>g. “In the presence of confusion, I will make space for clarity.”</p>\n\n<p>h. “In the presence of pain, I will make space for self-compassion.”</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Bring your attention to the line from this meditation that resonates with you the most.
