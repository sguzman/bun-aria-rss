But if you feel the allure, then you're in for a treat&nbsp;with this week's guest — because&nbsp;Louis Cole&nbsp;is the master.</p><p>With almost 2 million subscribers on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/FunForLouis\" target=\"_blank\">Fun For Louis</a>&nbsp;YouTube channel (plus<a href=\"http://instagram.com/funforlouis\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;1.5 million on Instagram</a>), this British-born dreadlocked globetrotter&nbsp;was one&nbsp;of the first (if not the very first) daily travel vloggers to break out — an internet personality so sensational, YouTube crown prince Casey Neistat (RRP <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll73\" target=\"_blank\">73</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll144\" target=\"_blank\">144</a> & <a href=\"http://j.mp/richroll174\" target=\"_blank\">174</a>) dubbed Louis the godfather of daily vlogging.</p><br><p>Louis has crossed India on a rickshaw and skydived high above Dubai. He has skateboarded along Sydney Harbor and sailed a hot air balloon in Kenya. From kayaking in New Zealand to salsa dancing in Cuba, it's just another day of fun for Louis — a guy committed to sucking the marrow out of life.</p><p>But the true allure of Louis isn't travel. And it isn't vlogging.</p><p>No, Louis' greatest talent is his ability to inspire wonder. Imbued with a rare enthusiasm for embracing all that life delivers, he has an infectious touch when it comes to encouraging his followers to pursue big dreams while he enjoys his own.</p><br><p>After a brief training progress report with my coach Chris Hauth, this week I sit down with Louis to find out exactly how he created such an&nbsp;extraordinary life.</p><p>This is a conversation about cultivating imagination, then translating that imagination into reality. It's about the mindset, tools and practices required to craft the trajectory of your wildest dreams. And to embrace the life you deserve.</p><p>An old soul with a big heart, Louis is a truly beautiful guy.&nbsp;I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a></p><p>Join us for&nbsp;our next retreat at Ballyvolane in Ireland, July 24-31, 2017.
