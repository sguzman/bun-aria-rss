This is a completely new and unique challenge. this was CRAZY!\n\nFree $15 with Code DREAMYT: http://cash.app/13+\n\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.18 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and survive 100 floors on a Minecraft death elevator. We challenged a developer to code 100 floors that increase in difficulty, with one goal, kill us! If they kill us before we beat the 100th floor, they win. If we survive 100 floors, we win. 100 floors may feel like 100 days of hardcore in this challenge :)\n\nIf this video gets 2,000,000 likes we'll do it again :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin",
