  "description": "<p>A stimulus check, tax refund, or any large windfall doesn’t happen all that often, so it’s no surprise that we’re not all that great at doing something smart with that money. Most of us think of it as a bonus that we should spend! And for people who diligently prioritize saving and investing every single month of the year, that might be ok. But for most people, a more thoughtful approach is in order. Much of it depends on your specific situation, and so we have some thoughts as to what you should be doing with that money when it shows up in your account. We can approach it with the numbers in mind, or values front and center- where you do you land?</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Space Lettuce by Monday Night Brewing! And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
