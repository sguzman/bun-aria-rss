  "description": "<p>It’s vitally important to discuss financial optimism because a LOT of folks have negative money scripts floating around their heads. Their pessimism hurts their current view of their money and their future financial wellbeing. How can we combat that? Financial optimism. We need to understand the good that currently exists in our lives and cultivate a hopeful attitude towards our finances. When we’re pessimistic about the current state of our financial health, it leads to inaction and that creates a cycle that secures that pessimism for the long term. It’s time to flip the script, change how we view our finances, and start doing awesome things with our money!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Caramel Macchiato Stout by Old Bust Head- a big thanks to Matt’s in-laws for donating this beer to the show this week!
