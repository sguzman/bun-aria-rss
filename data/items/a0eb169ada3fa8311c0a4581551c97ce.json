  "description": "<p>Happy New Year, podcast family! To kick off 2021, we’re starting a new series called Defining Greatness. We recorded this series last year just before COVID-19 drastically changed the way many of us live our lives. After recording it, we decided that it wasn’t the right time to release the series.</p> <p>But, with high expectations for the new year––which we believe will be a year of greatness and transformation––this is the perfect series with which to kick off 2021, and we’re excited to finally share it with you! In this series, John shares the qualities he believes make great leaders great. In part one, John shares how great leaders think and how they prepare.</p> <p>We’re also excited to have Traci Morrow back on the podcast with Mark Cole. Together, they discuss how their own thinking habits play a role in their leadership, influence, and growth.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Defining Greatness Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Great and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.johnmaxwell.com/changeyourworld/\"><em>Change Your World</em> by John C.
