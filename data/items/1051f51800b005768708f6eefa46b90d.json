  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, another radical jurist appointed by Barack Obama says that the DOJ needs to prove more in order to add the citizenship question to the U.S census, also quashing the request to change their legal team. Conveniently this happens in time to potentially miss the census. Also, the planned anarchy, havoc, and chaos at our border is reminiscent of the Cloward-Piven strategy which aimed to sabotage capitalism. In the same way, the Democratic Socialists are promoting the Cloward-Piven strategy by overwhelming the border, in true Saul Alinsky fashion. A massive recruitment or drive of aliens flooding the border is akin to their original strategy of creating a revolt amongst poor people to mobilize them en masse to clog up government agencies. Cloward and Piven submit that fear and chaos fosters ripe conditions to introduce radical change. The left wants to use race-based politics to attack our citizenship and change our population. Later, the individual mandate of Obamacare is the linchpin of the taxation argument made by Chief Justice Roberts. Coupled with Justice Kavanaugh's non-originalist judicial philosophy, will prove to hurt the court. Afterward, Senator Elizabeth Warren says that \"she's there\" agreeing that Israel is occupying land that is not theirs, thus embracing Hamas' position.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
