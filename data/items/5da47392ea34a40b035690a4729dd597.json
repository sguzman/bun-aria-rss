  "description": "<p>Both these guys are comedy standup legends. They have a new Netflix special out called Bumping Mics. It’s a 3 parter and is fantastic if you’re into standup comedy. They have been friends with Joe for many years so this conversation was just great. I love to review these types of podcasts the most.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
