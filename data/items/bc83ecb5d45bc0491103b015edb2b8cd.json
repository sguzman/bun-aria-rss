  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak with two guests. My first guest shares with us three separate incidents that happened to him. The first guest writes \"Brown County State Park, east of Nashville, Indiana spring of 1990. I was operating a crane during a change-out at Otis Elevator in Bloomington, Indiana 7   12 hour shifts for 2 weeks.   My cousin was getting married in Columbus the next day and I was going to stay in Columbus, go to the wedding, then back to Otis for the last half of my shift. About 1-1:30 am I was coming to the entrance to the state park, in the middle of the road a guy was doing jumping jacks trying to get me to stop.  I pulled over, pulled out my Rugar 10-22 just in case and stepped out of the van. Something was on the north side of the road about 30 ft. up. This guy was scared to death, I jumped back in the van, unlocked the door and he dove in. We were being pelted with good size rocks. The guy had crapped his pants and I don't blame him.   In the rear view we could see the silhouette of this thing, it was big and pissed.   We stopped at the gas station about a mile east and he changed into a pair of sweats I had in the back.  We did not go back to check out what the thing was or if it was still there.\" I will also be speaking to Tony who is a truck driver and had an encounter while on the job. He will talk about some recent sightings that he just had and talks a little bit about his research. Tony saw a creature on two legs running a long the highway.</p>",
