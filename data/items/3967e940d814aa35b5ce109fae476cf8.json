And we speak to Colin Barnes, Emeritus Professor of Disability Studies at Leeds University, about the historic struggle for disabled rights and recognition. \n\nPhoto: A disabled woman on her mobility scooter is carried away by four policemen after obstructing the traffic outside the Houses of Parliament.
