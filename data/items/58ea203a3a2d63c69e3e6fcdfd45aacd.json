First, June has allergies and looks to Jess and Nicole for direction on her new identity as an allergy haver, and Nicole fills us in on why her voice is so sexy and gives us a review of the Vegas stage production of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Then, Nicole dishes about the dog that ruined her SATs and all the movies she hasn’t seen. Finally, June and Nicole bond over the wild yet wonderful sh*t that happens in acting school. Remember Deep Divers, sometimes you're a mermaid, and sometimes you're just seaweed on the floor. </p><p>For more info on Child Abuse Awareness month go here <a href=\"https://preventchildabuse.org/\">https://preventchildabuse.org/</a></p><p>Visit the Pinterest Board <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/thedeepdive\">pinterest.com/thedeepdive</a></p><p>You can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod</p><p>June Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram</p><p>Jessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram</p><p>Check out the Jane Club at <a href=\"https://www.janeclub.com\">www.janeclub.com</a></p><p>Send us your The Deep Dive theme or any questions you might have to thedeepdive@earwolf.com</p>\n",
