  "title": "The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss",
  "description": "This book is a revolutionary insight into how we see our own working lives. Ferriss explains that in order to live the life of what he terms the ‘New Rich’ we need to create a structure around us that allows us to be absent from our work yet reap the financial benefits. Ferriss suggests that we make the best use of automated services such as outsourcing personal assistants to reduce costs when initially establishing a business. Focus on increasing productivity during the work day by prioritising and reducing unnecessary tasks can lessen the one's working hours. This book is not directed solely at business owners, but can also provide value for anyone wanting to increase productivity inside and outside work. Following steps such as Pareto's 80/20 rule can really help workers to focus on the tasks that matter the most. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
