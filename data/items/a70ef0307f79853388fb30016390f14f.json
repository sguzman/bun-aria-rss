An exploration of Eduardo Valdés-Hevia’s many dark and brilliant worldbuilding projects.  \n---\nSupport Valdés-Hevia: https://www.patreon.com/valdevia \nFollow Valdés-Hevia: https://twitter.com/Valdevia_Art\nSee More Art: https://valdevia.art/ \n\nFollow Luke Baker: https://twitter.com/spacemacchiato\nFollow David Romero: https://twitter.com/CinemamindDavid\n \nHave you ever seen a photo of a planet made entirely of living flesh? Or an insect-human hybrid that can control minds? Or a thousand-foot-long sea serpent that emerges in Iceland every year? These images might look like they come from some long-lost paranormal case file. But this is actually the work of the brilliant artist and worldbuilder Eduardo Valdés-Hevia, who has spent the last several years bringing to life a menagerie of nightmares.\n\nBrought to life through a combination of old photographs and new elements, Valdés-Hevia’s art merges history and the surreal, with images that feel like they come directly from classified historical documents. The artist creates stand-alone images as well as richly detailed series with dense, interconnected lore. So, for this entry into the archive, we’ll investigate the monsters and madness of these dark case files.\n\n Now, prepare yourself for the terrors of Valdés-Hevia…\n\n\n0:00 Welcome to the Horror\n1:40 Megalamorpha - Part I\n5:19 The Façade\n7:19 Assorted Terrors\n10:03 Megalamorpha - Part II\n13:27 Xipe-Totec\n15:03 The Lycanthrope Project\n17:44 Megalamorpha - Part III\n19:49 Support the Artist\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
