We will see what it is and what you can do with Azure DevOps platform. How to use it for your software development projects and generally how\nis this relevant for you as an engineer? We will see different features and use cases of Azure DevOps. How it all works and how you can implement the whole software development and deployment lifecycle with it.\nWe will also review the Azure DevOps architecture and how it works in the background and finally we will also compare it with alternative tools and talk a bit about which of these tools you need to learn for your career with so many alternative options.\n\nAs the name suggests Azure DevOps is a DevOps platform. It is a software as a service offering, which was created to basically be a one-stop shop for implementing all your DevOps processes for your project.\n\nSo it's basically a technological implementation of the DevOps process, which covers the whole software development lifecycle and it has features for each part of this lifecycle.\nSo in this tutorial, we will go through the steps or parts of that software development lifecycle and see how the various Azure DevOps services map to those parts.\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ T I M E S T A M P S ‚è∞  ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n00:00 - Intro and Overview\n00:42 - What is Azure DevOps?\n03:16 - Azure Boards\n05:35 - Azure Repos\n03:16 - Azure Boards\n07:52 - Azure Pipelines (Build Pipeline - CI)\n15:09 - Azure Artifacts\n16:44 - Stages in Azure Pipelines\n18:44 - Templates in Azure Pipelines\n20:09 - Environments in Azure Pipelines\n21:17 - Release Pipelines (CD)\n23:17 - Test Plans\n24:44 - Azure DevOps Architecture\n26:35 - Pricing Model\n26:56 - Service Connections\n29:20 - Comparison with other platforms\n33:51 - Which technology to learn?\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Want to learn more? üöÄ  ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \nFull Python course                                            ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2W9UEq6\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Connect with me üëã   ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \nINSTAGRAM             ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/32UVSZP\nDEV                            ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3h2fqiO\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Courses & Bootcamp & Ebooks üöÄ      ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \n‚ñ∫ Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             üëâüèº  https://bit.ly/3gEwf4V\n‚ñ∫ High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             üëâüèº   https://bit.ly/3nIouPW\n‚ñ∫ Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      üëâüèº   https://bit.ly/3mPIaiU",
