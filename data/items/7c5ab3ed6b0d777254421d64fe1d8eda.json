First, Anna and Regina discuss their early inspirations and explain why it takes thoughtfulness to play someone stupid or insane. The ladies then pitch a remake of \"The Golden Girls\" - and even improvise a scene from the show! Regina also educates Anna and Sim as to why the classic sitcom \"Good Times\" is the most frustrating show in history. From there, the gang turns to listener calls. They first talk to Carolyn, whose friends are becoming a little too involved in her relationship. Anna, Regina, and Sim then give Jen advice about how to disinvite her drunk sister-in-law to her upcoming wine tasting bachelorette weekend.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
