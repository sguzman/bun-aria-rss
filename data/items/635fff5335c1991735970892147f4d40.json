  "title": "Episode #67: How to Stop the Shame Spiral",
  "description": "We have all felt shame and guilt in our lives, and sometimes it feels like it never ends. We feel guilty for feeling guilty, and we feel ashamed to feel shame... We cannot seem to escape the shame spiral. Sound familiar? If you are struggling with shame, guilt, or condemnation then this episode is for you. In this episode I discuss why we feel shame, what it does in our brains and bodies, and how to get out of the shame spiral for good. This is the third episode in my Think Learn Succeed Book Club Podcast Series.\nTo get even more tips and tools to help you improve your mental health be sure to sign up for my weekly newsletter: https://drleaf.com\nThe SWITCH app is coming to iTunes and Google Play early 2019!!\nFor more info on my new app SWITCH go to: https://theswitch.app. get 30% off a year subscription when you pre-order today: http://theswitch.app/promo/\nAbout the 2019 Mental Health Initiative:\nI am making 2019 the year of mental health! Each month I will tackle a specific problem, issue, and concept related to mental ill health. I will be discussing major issues in the current mental health system AND how to find healing for yourself or a loved one.\nI’m excited to announce that for the February and March Mental Health Initiative we are going to be doing another book club! Over the next eight weeks we will be going through my latest book, Think Learn Succeed!\nI decided to spread the book over two months because there is just so much to unpack and discuss. Like the January Perfect You book club, there will be weekly YouTube Live sessions that go over the assigned chapters as well as blogs and podcasts related to topics and concepts in Think Learn Succeed.\nHow you understand and use your mind is predictive of how successful you will be. Nothing will work unless you get your mind right first. Think Learn Succeed is all about helping you make that switch to a life well-lived, filled with meaningful success.\nSo how do you join the book club?\n1. Get the book!
