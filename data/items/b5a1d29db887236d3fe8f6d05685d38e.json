  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Why aren't the DC Metro Police having their funding slashed? Is it because politicians' lives are more important than any other citizen's? Weren't the riots of last summer much worse than the January 6th riot? Unlike last summer, not a single firearm has been recovered by the FBI in their investigation into the Capitol Building riot. While the left calls this an \"insurrection\" there were no firearms. Yet, the DC Police are getting an increase to their budget in addition to the 6,000 National Guardsmen and razor wire fences currently protecting the Capitol. Nancy Pelosi called federal law enforcement officers \"storm troopers\" except when they're protecting her. Then, the latest installment of the 2 trillion dollar COVID relief bill was passed straight down party lines with Kamala Harris making the tie-breaking vote. Similarly, the H.R. 1 Bill is fashioned the greatest voting reform effort of modern times, likely because it guts the country's voting system. Anthony Fauci says schools need to update their heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems so the COVID funding is warranted. Yet, in July 2020 several pediatricians said they'd send their kids back to school, and that was before there were therapeutics and vaccines. Afterward, Dr. Marc Siegel joins the show to discuss the latest coronavirus developments in Texas and other parts of the country. Siegel praised Governor DeSantis for his leadership in managing the infection in the state of Florida and pointed to the hypocrisy of the Biden Administration. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
