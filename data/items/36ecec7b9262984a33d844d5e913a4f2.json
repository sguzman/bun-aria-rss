  "description": "<p>In this episode of Architecture, Design & Photography we sit down with our good friend and fellow creative Probably Joel. We first met Joel when we hired him as a documentary photographer to shoot behind-the-scenes of a documentary film we were working on. It was a quick introduction. We immediately flew to the other side of the country, jumped in a 1987 Toyota van and spent three weeks filming and driving across the country. Through all of that, we got to know Joel and his approach to photography. We sat down with him for a discussion on what's he been up to since that fateful road trip.</p>\n",
