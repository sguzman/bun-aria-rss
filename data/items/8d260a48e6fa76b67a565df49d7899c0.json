  "description": "What are Deep State Radio nerds thankful for this Thanksgiving?  We poll our experts and we get just the responses you would expect.  One said he is thankful we have not had a nuclear war with North Korea...yet.  Of course, many said they were grateful for Robert Mueller.  And while others mentioned being grateful for all the faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State themselves...almost all of our experts showed a lot of love all our Deep State Radio nerds.  Break out the box wine, pop a ear bud into your ear, and covertly  listen along instead of having to endure your crackpot relatives around the Thanksgiving table.  Happy Thanksgiving from all of us down here in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark to all of you out there living the Twilight Zone reality  that has become our daily lives.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
