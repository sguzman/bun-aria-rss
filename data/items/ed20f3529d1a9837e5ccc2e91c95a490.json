The prime suspect in both cases has an interesting criminal history. Ward Weaver III is a man with a violent history and he is the son of a serial killer. This week we examine a much requested case from Oregon. This case unlike any other will make you question if serial murder runs in the family. Join the Captain and Nic as we crack a few beers and talk though this strange tale.
