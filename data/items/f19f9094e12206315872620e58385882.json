  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this program has maintained that it's crucial for the American people to know the identity and background of the so-called whistleblower. Several publications have cited a CIA employee, Eric Caiaramella, with ties to President Obama, Joe Biden, John Brennan and the Democrat Party, including an operative from Ukraine who dug up dirt on Trump in 2016. According to Paul Sperry of Real Clear Investigations, a former CIA Analyst assigned to the White House until he circumvented the chain of command regarding meetings that President Trump had and was suspected of leaking them prior to his departure from the National Security Council. Media reports indicate that GOP Members have questioned whether Ciaramella was involved with Lt Col. Vindman and lawyers for the Democrats indicated that Ciaramella was of no consequence. What we're witnessing are Stalinesque tactics to take down the President, and cover up the cabal of those involved. The beauty of our litigation practice, not the circus the Democrats are conducting, is that the accused have a right to defend themselves, a right to question their accuser and a right to their records and evidence. That's why the Democrats are changing the rules. As part of the 2016 investigation, it should be determined if there were any violations of the Espionage Act and the so-called whistleblower should be questioned by US Attorney Durham. Later, Alcee Hasting is an impeached federal judge that was removed from office and is now in Congress making impeachment rules. While Tom Morrison testified saying there was no quid pro quo corroborating what Ukranian President Zelensky said as well. both on substance and process this whole thing is a sham as the democrats are simply working toward a pre-determined outcome. Afterward, Virginia State Majority Leader Todd Gilbert calls in to explain the importance of Tuesday's Assembly elections.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
