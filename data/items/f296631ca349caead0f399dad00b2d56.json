  "description": "<p>Parton saturation is one of the most intriguing phenomena in the high energy\nnuclear physics research frontier, especially in the upcoming era of the\nElectron-Ion Collider (EIC). The lepton-jet correlation in deep inelastic\nscattering provides us with a new gateway to the parton saturation at the EIC.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that azimuthal angle anisotropies of the\nlepton-jet correlation are sensitive to the strength of the saturation momentum\nin the EIC kinematic region. In contrast to the predictions based on the\ncollinear framework calculation, significant nuclear modification of the\nanisotropies is observed when we compare the saturation physics results in e +\np and e + Au scatterings. By measuring these harmonic coefficients at the EIC,\none can conduct quantitative analysis in different collisional systems and\nunveil compelling evidence for saturation effects.\n</p>",
