  "description": "Dolen Perkins-Valdez says she's attracted to what she calls \"silences in the archives,\" or – holes in our recollection in history, particularly those in African American history. In her new historical novel <em>Take My Hand</em>, she tackles forced sterilizations inspired by the 1973 case of the Relf sisters. On Weekend Edition Sunday, Perkins-Valdez told Ayesha Roscoe about her decision to tell this story from a nurse's perspective, the double-edged sword of birth control for Black women, and her goals on writing from real life.
