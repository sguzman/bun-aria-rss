  "description": "Hear the ad-free episode at http://usefulidiots.substack.com\n2021 was a shit show, so who better to help us dig through it than friend-of-show Thomas Frank, author of Listen Liberal and What’s the Matter with Kansas.\nSo what happened in 2021? Democrats and Republicans definitely both sucked. Covid got better and then a lot worse. Dems didn’t do the one thing to ensure they’d never lose another election. And politics turned from policy to pure culture war.\nWe go through it all, why it happened, why it sucked, and what it means for 2022.\nPlus, Biden’s giving up on Covid (and has something in his throat), Republicans embrace unemployment for certain people, and a sad announcement before a final penis story.\nIt’s all this, and more, in this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
