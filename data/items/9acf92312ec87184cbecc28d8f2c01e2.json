  "description": "Earnings season is well underway… Netflix just reported solid earnings and continues to gain subscribers. Daniel and I discuss the streaming giant’s new hit show, Squid Game, and how the company continues to be the king of great content. [2:00] United Airlines also reported a strong quarter... and foresees a coming bottom to COVID impacts. This is great news as travel returns to pre-pandemic levels. [8:40] In other airline news, Southwest decided to back off vaccine mandates. Daniel explains why this issue goes beyond airlines… and how mandates can hurt local economies. [10:40] Facebook has chosen Coinbase to roll out its crypto wallet, Novi. Daniel shares why he’s bullish on the social media giant despite not being a fan of its services. [22:05]  Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high today. The news comes on the heels of the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which began trading this week. I explain why I expect the momentum to continue—and whether you should buy BITO. [25:45]  Next, I break down some data on why supply chain issues will continue to cause stress across the economy—particularly in one sector. [29:58] I also share some quick thoughts on Procter & Gamble’s strong earnings. [33:55] And finally, there’s never been a better time to get into the crypto space. And with the special offer we just released TODAY for my Crypto Intelligence advisory… you can lock in a free crypto pick. [35:16]  Enjoyed this episode?
