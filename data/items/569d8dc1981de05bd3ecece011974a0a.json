  "description": "<div>It’s estimated that the average age of a British farmer is 59. This raises questions about the future of British farming. Are young people just not interested?<br>\n<br>\nOn this episode, <em>The Spectator’s</em> economics editor, Kate Andrews takes a look at the next few decades for British farming. Young farmers are part of the picture, but we’ll also be discussing the role played by immigration especially post Brexit. The agricultural pressures and questions around self-sufficiency given the war in Ukraine. And how to balance all of this with greater concern for climate change. Kate Andrews is joined by George Eustice, the Secretary of State for DEFRA, Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the Farmers’ Union and Beth Hart, vice president for Supply Chain and Brand Trust at McDonald’s.<br>\n<br>\n<em>This podcast is kindly sponsored by McDonald's.</em>\n</div>\n",
