  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Congress violated the separation of powers of our Constitution with Rep. Ro Khanna introducing an amendment to limit the president's ability to use federal funds to use military force against Iran. This legislative maneuver negates the spirit of the Constitution and is hidden inside of the Defense Reauthorization Act to force President Trump to veto the defense funding bill or agree to this nonsense. Iran threatens the existence of our country, is moving toward nuclear weapons, and the Senate better step up and correct it. This same Congress wants to hand over power from the Commander-In-Chief to themselves just to undermine the president. This disgrace is extraordinarily irresponsible and an outrage we have not seen in modern history. This is yet another example of Congress and the Democrats to tie the hands of one particular Commander-In-Chief — President Trump! Then, Chuck Schumer snaps his fingers and poof Secretary Acosta resigns, even though Jeffrey Epstein is their guy, their donor, welcomed in all of their circles. Yet, black Christians in Nigeria and Sudan are being slaughtered including young girls. All of the women of color in Congress have been silent on Boko Haram's massacres of Christians; utter silence from Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Later, Dr. Sebastian Gorka calls in to discuss how a reporter confronted him at the at the White House Thursday.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
