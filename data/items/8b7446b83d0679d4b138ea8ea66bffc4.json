  "description": "<p>My guest for this episode is <a href= \"http://economics.gmu.edu/people/mkoyama2\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Koyama</a> of George Mason University. Our topic is a recent paper titled, <a href= \"https://mason.gmu.edu/~mkoyama2/About_files/StateCapacitySurvey.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\"States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints,\"</a> which Mark coauthored with Noel Johnson.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Just recorded at great podcast with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/GarrettPetersen\">@GarrettPetersen</a> on my work on state capacity (with <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ndjohnson\">@ndjohnson</a>).</p> — Mark Koyama (@MarkKoyama) <a href= \"https://twitter.com/MarkKoyama/status/867460218703269888\">May 24, 2017</a></blockquote> <p>As stated in the paper, \"state capacity describes the <em>ability</em> of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods.\" That said, state capacity does not mean big government. A state may have the power to impose rules across its territory, but it doesn't have to use that power in a tyrannical way. Another way of saying that is to say that having a high state capacity is compatible with Adam Smith's desire for \"peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.\"</p> <p>One metric that researchers use to measure state capacity is tax revenue per capita. But as Mark is careful to point out, a state with less state capacity can still sometimes achieve a relatively high income through tax farming. This is the practice in many pre-modern states of auctioning off the right to extract tax revenues to local elites in different regions.</p> <p>We discuss the rise of modern nation-states in various regions, and why some states developed more state capacity than others going into the twentieth century. In particular, we discuss Europe's transition away from a feudal system ruled in a decentralized way by monarchs who held power based on their personal relationships with local lords. England's <a href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution\" target= \"_blank\">Glorious Revolution of 1688</a> allowed it to develop its state capacity earlier than other European nations, with a centralized tax system controlled by parliament.</p> <p><img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src= \"http://economicsdetective.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/per-capita-tax-revenues.png\" alt=\"Per Capita Tax Revenues\" /></p> <p>By contrast, continental powers like the French Ancien Régime and the Hapsburg Empire were legally and fiscally fragmented, leading them to develop their state capacity much later than England.</p> <p>We also discuss the development of state capacity in Asia, and why Meiji Japan was able to develop its state capacity much faster than Qing Dynasty China.</p> <hr /> <p> </p>",
