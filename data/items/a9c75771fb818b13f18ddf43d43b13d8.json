  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, seven justices violated the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution ruling that a sitting President can be indicted by a state court. This damages the Office of The Presidency. Now a President can be subpoenaed under a pretext and can be used to politically embarrass any President under this precedent. The Supreme Court has two justices and seven politicians now. Regarding the House Democrats' request for President Trump's taxes, the Court should have not even taken up that case since it had nothing to do with legislative oversight. Then, it’s shocking how far the rogue Judge Emmet Sullivan has taken his opposition to the ordered writ of mandamus with Gen. Mike Flynn. Later, Joe Biden who has been discredited for lying and plagiarism for many years has taken to Pennsylvania for a campaign stop. Bide announced his new plan from Sen Bernie Sanders which limits any form of school choice and leans heavily on the federal government for control over state issues.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
