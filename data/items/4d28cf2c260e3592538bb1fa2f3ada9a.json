Ice has the flu and can't record so I bring you three tips for New Year's Eve:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">1. Drink from \"fine\" to \"poor\", i.e., don't drink the best stuff last!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">2. Don't bring great stuff to a party or dinner if it won't be appreciated</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">3. Try lower priced sparklers like Cava, Crémant, American Sparkling wine, Prosecco, Sekt, or for a cool, unusual twist -- Champagne made from one of the 19,000 growers in this region of France who made wine that really reflects the land and is less \"homogenized.\"</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">And the resolutions:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">1. More podcasts and online classes in 2015!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">2. More podcast interviews in 2015</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">3. All internet wine ordering, all (ok, most) of the time!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">I hope you've had a wonderful 2014 and that 2015 is full of health, wealth, and happiness!</span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Thank you for listening and for your support!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Elizabeth</span></p>",
