  "description": "<p>Fully pairing all elements of a set while attempting to maximize the total\nbenefit is a combinatorically difficult problem. Such pairing problems\nnaturally appear in various situations in science, technology, economics, and\nother fields. In our previous study, we proposed an efficient method to infer\nthe underlying compatibilities among the entities, under the constraint that\nonly the total compatibility is observable. Furthermore, by transforming the\npairing problem into a traveling salesman problem with a multi-layer\narchitecture, a pairing optimization algorithm was successfully demonstrated to\nderive a high-total-compatibility pairing. However, there is substantial room\nfor further performance enhancement by further exploiting the underlying\nmathematical properties. In this study, we prove the existence of algebraic\nstructures in the pairing problem. We transform the initially estimated\ncompatibility information into an equivalent form where the variance of the\nindividual compatibilities is minimized. We then demonstrate that the total\ncompatibility obtained when using the heuristic pairing algorithm on the\ntransformed problem is significantly higher compared to the previous method.\nWith this improved perspective on the pairing problem using fundamental\nmathematical properties, we can contribute to practical applications such as\nwireless communications beyond 5G, where efficient pairing is of critical\nimportance.\n</p>",
