  "description": "Now we're cooking! As we get into the Top 90 in our overall PPR rankings, we're looking at a lot of guys who could be league winners for you. We've got proven players like Jarvis Landry, Marvin Jones and LeSean McCoy. We've got unproven players with upside like Derrius Guice, Mike Williams and Miles Sanders. Also, the TE debates are great in this episode, and we seem to have trouble figuring out which Giants WR is the best and if we actually want one of them on our team.
