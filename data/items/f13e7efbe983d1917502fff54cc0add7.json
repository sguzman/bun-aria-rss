  "description": "Every piece of treasure has its price. Whether you’re buying or selling, looting or discovering, each artifact contains its own set of rules. You could gain wealth, and prestige or maybe you’ll lose it all, including your life. All’s fair for the hard rules of treasure. First, we’ll explore an old house with endless bounty and dangers within. Next, we’ll find an old mysterious chest in our own backyard. After that, we’ll come home to some strange occurrences with a living-room rocking chair. And finally we’ll bet it all on a coin toss. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
