  "description": "<p>In recent years, there has been extensive research on planar metasurfaces\ncapable of arbitrarily controlling scattered fields. However, rigorous studies\non conformal metasurfaces, such as those that are cylindrical, have been few in\nnumber likely due to their more complex geometry. Here, wave propagation in\ncascaded cylindrical structures consisting of layers of dielectric spacers and\nazimuthally-varying metasurfaces (subwavelength patterned metallic claddings)\nis investigated. A wave matrix approach, which incorporates the advantages of\nboth ABCD matrices and scattering matrices (S matrices), is adopted. Wave\nmatrices are used to model the higher order coupling between metasurface\nlayers, overcoming fabrication difficulties associated with previous works. The\nproposed framework provides an efficient approach to synthesize the\ninhomogeneous sheet admittances that realize a desired cylindrical field\ntransformation. Design examples are reported to illustrate the power and\npotential applications of the proposed method in antenna design and stealth\ntechnology.\n</p>",
