  "description": "Nadia Amoroso’s Representing Landscapes: A Visual Collection of Landscape Architectural Drawings (Routledge, 2012) is a collaboration between landscape architecture professors and practitioners leading the field today. The inspiration for the book came from her design studios. She wanted to demonstrate to students how they too could produce beautiful graphics by utilizing a software workflow. The book is divided into the major visual language alphabet for landscape architects: diagrams and mapping, presentation plans, axonometric, section-elevations, perspectives, modeling, and finally case studies. Each section contains an essay describing the graphic elements and usefulness for students and professionals. Nadia Amoroso is the co-founder and Creative Director of DataAppeal, a visualization firm that focuses on the creative mapping of digital media, urban design and GIS representation. She also actively teaches design studios at the University of Guelph. Her academic background includes degrees in Landscape Architecture & Urban Design from the University of Toronto and a PhD from the Bartlett School of Architecture.  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
