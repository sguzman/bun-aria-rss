  "description": "Federalism is the partition of power between state and national governments, with an emphasis on the states – a core American principle that attorney Josh Hammer believes we are leaving behind. Hammer is the editor at large at the Daily Wire and of counsel for First Liberty Institute, specializing in religious liberty and First Amendment cases. He is a steadfast advocate for America’s return to the federalist principles of our founding and, just as importantly, the Judeo-Christian values of our Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
