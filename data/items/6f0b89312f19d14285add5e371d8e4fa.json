  "description": "The Jets and Seahawks upgraded their run games, the Packers and Chiefs (and many other teams) drafted wide receivers and three QBs were drafted in Round 3. We recap Day Two and start with Fill in the Blank on Breece Hall (2:40), Ken Walker (6:55), James Cook (9:45), Christian Watson (13:00) and Trey McBride (15:40) ... Heath makes the case for Mark Andrews and Travis Kelce as first round picks now that so many other TEs have seen their value take a hit (17:15), and then we go through the rookie wide receivers who were selected on Friday (19:05). We give some scouting reports and Fantasy takes and eventually some rankings (28:00). How many will be drafted in redraft leagues? Obviously we like Watkins, but Skyy Moore, George Pickens and Alec Pierce are intriguing as well ... More thoughts on the rookie RBs (32:30), NFL veteran winners and losers (39:30), rookie QBs (44:40), rookie TEs and the veteran QB that moved up to #4 in Heath's rankings ...
