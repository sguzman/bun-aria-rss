  "title": "90 - The Golden State Killer",
  "description": "<p>On Tuesday, April 24th, 2018, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was taken into custody by local police and FBI agents when he stepped outside his Citrus Heights home, a quiet suburb of Sacramento. The man believed to be the East Area Rapist, also known as the Golden State Killer, the Visalia Ransacker, and the Original Night Stalker had finally been captured, forty-four years after his crime spree began. He’d started ransacking over 100 Sacramento area homes in 1974. He’d progressed from burglary to rape by 1976, raping over 50 California women and girls. And he’s believed to have killed for the first time in 1975, killing 12 men and women by 1986. He was a sadistic monster and it's incredible that he was finally apprehended. Learn all about his crimes, his arrest, and the innovative DNA database detective work that was used to finally catch him.</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>AmeriGas! </strong>Go to <a href=\"https://mytimesuckgrill.com/\"><strong>MyTimeSuckGrill.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>between now and July 4th<strong> </strong>and enter your name and email to register to win a free Weber Spirt II – E 210 grill ($400 value).
