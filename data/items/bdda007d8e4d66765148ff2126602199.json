    "media:description": "The storytelling in this lesson is designed for level B1 but the exposure to the language is beneficial for all levels!\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn vocabulary related to reading the newspaper and solving a mystery. Through storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and to participate in the plot of the mystery. \n\nSpanish CI (Comprehensible Input) and TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) have been proven to be effective and engaging ways to learn a language. If you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, subscribe to my channel for more TPRS and Comprehensible Input videos to come!",
