  "description": "Being in two different places at once — it's one of the deeply weird things that happens in the quantum realm. On the panel for this week’s episode are New Scientist journalists Rowan Hooper, Penny Sarchet, Donna Lu and Jacob Aron. The team begins by discussing a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2231968-this-tiny-glass-bead-has-been-quantum-chilled-to-near-absolute-zero'>super-cool experiment</a> that hopes to demonstrate quantum physics by placing a solid object in two places at once. They also explore revelations about the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532680-600-who-invented-the-alphabet-the-untold-story-of-a-linguistic-revolution/'>ancient origins of the alphabet</a>, and examine a report from Wuhan City on the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532683-300-will-the-coronavirus-become-a-pandemic-and-what-happens-if-it-does/'>coronavirus outbreak</a> and the realities of what life in China is like right now.
