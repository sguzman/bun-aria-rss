Was Cordelia a terrible person? yeah for sure but she was also just doing her thing no matter what everyone thought and that my friends is pretty badass. lol. I would love to hear what you think! Sorry if this is a little too long! Sometimes there's so much information I never know what to cut out. Anywho, hope you have a wonderful day ahead. I love and appreciate you so much<br>\nx o<br>\nBailey SarianÂ </div>\n",
