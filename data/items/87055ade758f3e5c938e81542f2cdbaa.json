Lisa, 33, was initially apprehensive but absolutely trusted Janelle, 31, to do it. Janelle told Truly: “It wasn’t even a question, it was the first thing I wanted to do to help her.” The pair, from Seekonk, Massachusetts, then decided to post a video about it on TikTok as a way of challenging some of the taboos around breastfeeding. While they got a lot of love and positivity for it, they also received judgemental comments. People said it was ‘wrong’, ‘weird’ or that Lisa must be jealous. But Lisa and Janelle believe it’s brought them closer and want to continue to normalise taboos around breastfeeding. Lisa told Truly: “What does it matter? It’s my sister-in-law, it’s my baby and he’s getting fed and he’s happy and he’s healthy so it shouldn’t matter how he’s getting those nutrients.” \n\nFollow the family here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/janellemcaloon/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@nellesworld  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/lisa.mcaloon/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@lisamcaloon \nhttps://www.instagram.com/joshuamcaloon/ \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jay.mac/ \n\nVideographer: Keith Macri\nProducers: Emika Berry, Becky Robinson\nEditor: Helen McKee\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",
