  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by former Iowa Hawkeye and current TE for the San Francisco 49ers, George Kittle, who is making waves in the league right now. They chat about being overlooked in the league, who some of his favorite TE's are, what Kyle Shanahan's offense is like, and how Pat Angerer changed his football career (4:23-21:32). Later, Pat brings the guys in to talk about the new blog on PatMcAfeeShow.com and what they'll be writing about. Digs covers some NFL news and gives out a few of his weekly awards, Zito and Connor talk Twitchcon and how the political attack ads are taking over TV, Todd chats about his comedy show from last weekend and dives into Brock Lesnar in the UFC and Floyd Mayweather getting into MMA, and Nick pops in to talk Lowe's closing several stores, Pete Davidson, helicopters crashing, and a little hockey talk. Today's a great one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
