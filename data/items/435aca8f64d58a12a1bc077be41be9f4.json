Are you doing the carnivore diet? Vegan? Keto? The choices and variations of every diet plan available is nearly endless. At the heart of the matter, diet consciousness is a question of overall health and better managing and preventing diseases and conditions that hinder your performance and destroy your ability to live a happy and healthy life. In this episode, nephrologist and intermittent fasting expert, Dr. Jason Fung, exposes the overarching importance of understanding your body’s hormonal response to insulin activated by what you eat and the frequency with which you eat. He also breaks down the three major paradigms for cancer, and ranks the danger of a poor diet as high as cigarette smoke in terms of high risk contributors of cancer.
