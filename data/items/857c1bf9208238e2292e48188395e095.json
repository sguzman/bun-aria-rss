  "description": "<p>Conditional independence models associated with directed acyclic graphs\n(DAGs) may be characterized in at least three different ways: via a\nfactorization, the global Markov property (given by the d-separation\ncriterion), and the local Markov property. Marginals of DAG models also imply\nequality constraints that are not conditional independences; the well-known\n`Verma constraint' is an example. Constraints of this type are used for testing\nedges, and in a computationally efficient marginalization scheme via variable\nelimination.\n</p>\n<p>We show that equality constraints like the `Verma constraint' can be viewed\nas conditional independences in kernel objects obtained from joint\ndistributions via a fixing operation that generalizes conditioning and\nmarginalization. We use these constraints to define, via ordered local and\nglobal Markov properties, and a factorization, a graphical model associated\nwith acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). We prove that marginal\ndistributions of DAG models lie in this model, and that a set of these\nconstraints given by Tian provides an alternative definition of the model.\nFinally, we show that the fixing operation used to define the model leads to a\nparticularly simple characterization of identifiable causal effects in hidden\nvariable causal DAG models.\n</p>",
