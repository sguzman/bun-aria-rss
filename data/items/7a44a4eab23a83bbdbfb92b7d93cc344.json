  "description": "<p>This week The Cigar Authority welcomes to the show Justo Eiroa from JRE Tobacco, the company that makes Aladino Cigars. As we know the favorite cigar of Mr. Jonathan is the Aladino Corojo Reserva but today on the show we smoke a cigar from the Care Package in Aladino Connecticut. Made in Honduras we discuss everything Aladino and we might even have some news on an upcoming release to share with you. We will let you know what we think of one of our favorite Connecticut wrappers.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we recap the sold out Two Guys Smoke Shop 34th Anniversary and share with some sound bites that our own Ed Sullivan was able to capture. We will do this while we light up a Aladino Corojo Reserva.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
