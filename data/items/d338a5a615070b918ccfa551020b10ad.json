Even if the pandemic will fade in the second half of the year, gdp in developing countries, measured at purchasing-power parity, will be 6.6% smaller in 2020 than the IMF had forecast in October.<br>\n<br>\nIn this episode we dig into the topic and sketch the possible tools that emerging economies can use to face the liquidity crisis. The conversation presents the analysis of the authors of a <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/2020/05/covid-19s-reality-shock-for-external-funding-dependent-emerging-economies/\">Bruegel Policy Contribution</a> the topic. <br>\n<br>\n<em>Episode's guests: </em><br>\nAlicia Garcia Herrero, senior fellow at Bruegel<br>\nElina Ribakova, deputy chief economist of the Institute for International Finance<br>\n<br>\n<em>Hosted by:</em><br>\nGiuseppe Porcaro, head of outreach and governance at Bruegel<em><br>\n</em><br>\n\n</div>\n",
