  "description": "<p>#QOTD: Just show me some love!!</p>\n<p>Everything trickles from the top. For a long time I used to talk about the \"rich-kid syndrome\" and how they didn't have it in them to hustle their way to building a sustainable business. What I've learned, however, is that this doesn't apply to everybody. </p>\n<p>When it comes to business, like anything else in life, it all stems from the top. Just like a business' culture stems from its leaders, the way a child sees the world and their approach to life all comes from how they were brought up. When I meet with these \"rich kids\" I spend almost all my time trying to figure out what their past was like. How did their parents raise them? Did they spoil them or did they make them work for what they wanted? And so, this really has nothing to do with the kids themselves but more so about who their parents were and how they decided to pass on the family legacy. </p>\n<p>I know that my kids are going to be \"rich kids\" but that doesn't mean I'm going to spoil them. I'm not going to let them become soft and I will most certainly let them know what it means to work and sweat for something that they want, because I know that it's up to me to instill those qualities within them from the onset. </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578193.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
