  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, we now have a Democrat Party that wants to take the wealth of our citizens and transfer it to others, a Party that wants to destroy private industries, and a Party that embraces and promotes infanticide. This is called fascism! Yesterday, their Marxist ideology was called out by Billionaire Democrats Howard Shultz and Mike Bloomberg denying the idea that free healthcare is the governments sole responsibility. Then we must choose whether we will base our American system on the government as statists or upon our founding documents as constitutionalists. Republican leadership must stop embracing big government and embrace you and I—the American people! Then, where does our morality come from? Should one religion prevail over others, or should we ban religion altogether? No. Its certain that our founders wanted to perpetuate a Judeo-Christian sense of morality and deism. Killing babies is murder and the so-called moderate Governor of Virginia has showed us just how radical he really is with this new abortion bill he's touting and NY Governor Andrew Cuomo is the new Kermit Gosnell hiding late-term abortion behind \"reproductive rights.\" When America doesn't protect its babies you know that it’s a corrupt dying culture. Also, a European newspaper released a 1998 video of a shirtless, then-Mayor, Bernie Sanders in Russia singing \"This Land is Your Land\" with several shirtless Russians in Moscow. Mysteriously the video was published recently and then taken down by the same European newspaper. Afterwards, new information from Investors Business Daily proves that more election fraud than was suspected took place in Texas due to non-citizens voting.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
