  "description": "Enjoying a glass of bourbon while smoking a cigar seems like an average Friday night to some people. However, pairing a bourbon and cigar can be more complicated than you think. We sit down with Jake Glancy and Jeremy Kendrick of Jake's Cigar Bar to get a complete cigar 101 lesson on everything from cuts, types, leaf varieties, and more to understand how the unique flavor of a cigar will compliment different types of bourbon.

What's the initiative?\n\nDescribe the different shapes of cigars\n\nWhen you're smoking a cigar do your taste buds or receptors change rather than drinking bourbon alone?\n\nWhat's the sweet spot for the third in your opinion?\n\nI'm going to throw some bourbons at you and you tell me what cigars would pair well.\n\nTalk about higher in proof bourbons like Stagg Jr and barrel proof bourbons and the cigars that pair well\n\nIt seems like Four Roses pairs well with any cigar\n\nTalk about barrel aged cigars\n\nWhat about something super light like 80 proof Basil Hayden\n\n\nRye whiskey is growing in popularity.
