  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast Sam is joined by the historian James Holland to talk about his fascinating new book <em>Brothers In Arms: One Legendary Tank Regiment's Bloody War from D-Day to VE-Day. </em>James's story follows the Sherwood Rangers from El Alamein to the D-Day Landings, and on through the last push through Europe into Germany. On the podcast he tells Sam how he put together this richly detailed account and what it was like, hour by hour and day by day, for the men who fought in tanks.Â </div>\n",
