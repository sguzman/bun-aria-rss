  "description": "<p>Kyle Kinane had me over to his flat in Edinburgh, Scotland to do an album commentary on his first album, Death of the Party. This is the 6th of these comedy album breakdowns I do with the comedians. Kyle is legit one of the best comics in America and this was a real treat to get to do with him. We talked all about his first release. Where the bits came from, style, technique, all of it. By the way, Shroomfest starts Saturday and goes till the end of Monday!</p>",
