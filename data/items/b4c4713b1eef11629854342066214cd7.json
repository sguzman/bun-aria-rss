  "description": "<p>We extend recent results on discrete approximations of the Laplacian in\n$\\mathbf{R}^d$ with norm resolvent convergence to the corresponding results for\nDirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space. The resolvents of the\ndiscrete Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians are embedded into the continuum using\nnatural discretization and embedding operators. Norm resolvent convergence to\ntheir continuous counterparts is proven with a quadratic rate in the mesh size.\nThese results generalize with a limited rate to also include operators with a\nreal, bounded, and H\\\"older continuous potential, as well as certain functions\nof the Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians, including any positive real power.\n</p>",
