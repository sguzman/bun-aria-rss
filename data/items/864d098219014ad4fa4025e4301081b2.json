  "description": "Hello and welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! For the most part, today’s show is not too different from others. Well, aside from one thing... I’ve got a headache. And although there’s a lot to cover… today I take a moment to step away from the market-talk. No “shots fired” or anything, but there’s just a few things I need to clear up. And every once in awhile it’s a bit more fun hosting a show - without any filter. I use this occasion to talk about the last newsletter I worked for… one of the biggest insurance scams in the world… and my apparent faulty claims on Boeing’s automation front. As for the markets… Last week, I touched base on one of the largest bubbles on planet - Chinese real-estate. Time to short? ...Not so fast. On today’s show, I dig a little deeper. And by looking at the big picture, this is a situation that almost makes too much sense. Tune in as I explain why investors need to pump their brakes on this particular trade… Then, for today’s main segment, I talk about about the one and only - Tesla (TSLA). And why anything you read on this stock, you must take with a grain of salt. This is not a buy, or sell. In fact, I’m indifferent… But at least I tell the truth. Special thanks to Matt, Jake, Michael, Brian, and Joseph. Keep the questions coming!",
