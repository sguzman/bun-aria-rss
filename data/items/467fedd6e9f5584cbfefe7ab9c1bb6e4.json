    "media:description": "Out of every conspiracy theory thought up by mankind, \"Australia Doesn't Exist\" has to be the nuttiest. So nutty, you might expect nobody in the world to believe it. However, YouTuber RagReynolds is one of the few who is pushing this conspiracy theory into the mainstream. It makes flat earth seem like a logical theory, and it makes for some great entertainment.\n\nThis is, The YouTuber Who Thinks Australia Doesn't Exist.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§\n\nAlso, the idea for this video was inspired by \"LazarBeam\" who posted a video on a similar topic in May 2018 titled \"it turns out AUSTRALIA IS FAKE?\" You can watch his version here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykquKRbsFRs",
