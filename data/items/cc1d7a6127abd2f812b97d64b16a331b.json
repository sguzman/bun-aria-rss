  "content:encoded": "<p>I already mentioned the <a href=\"http://beautifuldata.net/2015/01/2014-highlight-statistical-learning/\">Hastie &#038; Tibshirani course on statistical learning</a> as one of my personal highlights in data science last year. My second highlight is also an online course, also by leading experts on their field (this time: Big Data and data mining), also based on a (freely available) book and also by Stanford University professors: Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajamaran and Jeff Ullman&#8217;s course on &#8220;Mining Massive Datasets&#8221;.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://beautifuldata.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ullman_mmds.jpg\" alt=\"ullman_mmds\" width=\"449\" height=\"253\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1111\" srcset=\"http://beautifuldata.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ullman_mmds.jpg 449w, http://beautifuldata.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ullman_mmds-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 85vw, 449px\" /></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in data science or data mining, chances are high that you have already been in touch with <a href=\"http://www.mmds.org/\">their book</a>. It can safely be considered a standard work on the fascinating intersection of data mining algorithms, machine learning and Big Data. The 7 week course is the online version of the Stanford courses <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/\">CS246</a> and the earlier version of <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mining/2009/index.html\">CS345A</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mmds.org\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://beautifuldata.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mmds_cover_v21.jpg\" alt=\"mmds_cover_v21\" width=\"95\" height=\"137\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1115\" /></a>The course is very dense and covers a lot of territory from the book, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does Map Reduce work and why is it important?\n<li>How can I retrieve frequently appearing combinations from very large sets of items such as shopping baskets?\n<li>How to retain information about a datastream that does not fit in memory?\n<li>What are the most common tasks in supervised machine learning and how to implement them?\n<li>How do I program an intelligent system for recommending movies?\n<li>How to compute optimal placements of online advertisements?\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the lectures are on a beginners to intermediate level, but some lectures cover very advanced topics. What I especially liked about this course is that a lot of the material covered really is state-of-the-art in data mining. Some algorithms &#8211; e.g. the <a href=\"http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/bigclam-wsdm13.pdf\">BIGCLAM community detection</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/697.full\">CUR matrix decomposition</a> &#8211; had only been developed about year ago.</p>\n<p>So, take a look at the book, and if you haven&#8217;t already: enroll at the <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/mmds-001\">Coursera course website</a> to make sure you won&#8217;t miss the next session of this course.</p>\n",
