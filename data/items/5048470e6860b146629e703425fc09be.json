After entering a home they believed to be empty was not, they were confronted by the armed homeowner who shot and killed the oldest boy, Danzele. Danzele's four childhood friends were charged with his murder (despite being unarmed). We focus on the youngest of the group, Blake and his family, as they fight to reduce his 55-year sentence over a period of 4 years. \"1275 Days\" is a 'David and Goliath' tale that not only explores the complicated issues surrounding juvenile incarceration in America, but exposes the financial and emotional burden families of the incarcerated face. </p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Reality Life with Kate Casey</p><p>Patreon: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.patreon.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Cameo: <a href=\"https://www.cameo.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cameo.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Twitter: @katecasey</p><p>Instagram: @katecaseyca</p><p>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/</a></p><p>Amazon List: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca</a></p> \n <br><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
