  "description": "2010-10-20 - Part 2 - Mindfulness of Emotions - Our conditioning is to live in a reactive trance of either resisting or become possessed by strong emotions. This reactivity fuels a trance of being separate from others, and feeling defective and insecure. In this class we explore how to free ourselves from this suffering by bringing a mindful and kind awareness to the stories and feelings that make up our emotional life. Please donate at www.tarabrach.com or www.imcw.org. Thank you!",
