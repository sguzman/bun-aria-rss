    "media:description": "If 2004 was the year of Franz Ferdinand for the NME crowd, then 2005 was all about Bloc Party. With razor sharp guitarwork, disco beats and Kele Okereke’s anguished yelp, they brought the indie set heartache you could dance to. \n\nIn spite of studio issues, Gang of Four comparisons and feuds with Britpop elderstatesmen, with Silent Alarm Bloc Party unleashed one of the most exciting British debuts of the decade. A reaction to the reductive boring rock’n’roll surrounding them, they added life, vitality and whatever they could find into their jagged yet sensitive post-punk. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Banquet.”\n\n#BlocParty #indie #musicdocumentary \n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:42 Bloc Party: The Early Days\n03:48 Banquet: \"Turning Into Myself\"\n10:30 The Making of Silent Alarm: \"...Hoping For a Miracle?\"\n18:46 The Aftermath of Silent Alarm\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
