  "description": "This week we have an exciting story from Greece about a fight between a Monster and a Prince. You have to be a bit brave to listen, because the monster likes snacking on children ……but it’s only a story monster and you’ll be pleased to hear that it has a very happy ending. It’s told by the kids’ comedian Tiernan Douieb, so it’s also very funny. Let us know if you were brave enough to listen all the way to the end.\n\nIf you'd like to support the show or subscribe for ad-free episodes you can find us on our Ko-fi page - HERE\n\nSee acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.",
