  "description": "<p>The average workout program that is being sold today is no more than a bunch of exercises thrown together to make you FEEL like something is happening without producing any results. Then to add insult to injury, these crap program purveyors pitch you on expensive supplements that they claim make the difference between success and failure in the gym. Here's the fact: Your workout (combined with a healthy diet and sufficient rest) is the KEY factor that determines if you will build any significant muscle or not. Supplements, in spite of all the hype and attention, play a very small role (possibly unmeasurable) in how your body adapts and builds. So why all this focus on supplements? Because they are a huge money maker and play into peoples' frustration and desire for the quick fix. If you want gains you must put your focus on how your workouts are designed and executed, not on supplements. Excellent workout design, also known as workout programming, is not an easy task and requires a very high degree of expertise and experience. Sal, Adam & Justin are often asked what makes an expertly programmed workout and why the MAPS programs work so well. You will soon learn why this is not a simple question to answer.
