  "description": "<p>We give a linear response relation for perturbations in relativistic stars\nand classify them in terms of implicit and induced perturbations. The focus in\nthis article is on the induced perturbations which may arise due to internal\nsources in dense matter compact objects. Based on the linear response relation,\nan Einstein Langevin equation is given and its solutions for a simple case are\nobtained in closed analytical form as a first exercise. Our results show how\nperturbations in relativistic stars can arise due to a cumulative effect of\nmesoscopic scale fluctuations in the dense matter fluids, which otherwise seem\nto be screened off at hydrodynamic scales due to averaging. We discuss the\nrelevance of such a framework and its potential towards building up a theme of\nresearch in asteroseismology using a first principles approach.\n</p>",
