  "description": "Noah Hawley is a world builder. He created the TV shows <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Legion</em>, so he is no stranger to getting an audience immersed in his worlds. His new novel <em>Anthem</em> is no different. But it doesn't take that much imagination, despite the fantasy creatures: This world is remarkably similar to ours. Hawley was interested in looking at the state of the world that is getting passed down to future generations. Hawley told NPR's Ayesha Rascoe his goal was to write \"a fantasy novel about our real world or a realistic novel about the fantasy world that we're living in.\" Mission accomplished.",
