  "description": "Astra Taylor’s new book has the best title I’ve seen in a long time: Democracy May Not Exist, But We’ll Miss It When It’s Gone.\nI talk a lot about democracy on this show, but not in the way Taylor talks about it. The democracy I discuss is bounded by the assumptions of American politics. This, however, is not a conversation about the filibuster, the Senate, or the Electoral College — it is far more diverse and far more radical.\nTaylor and I cover a lot of ground in this interview. We discuss how what it would mean to extend democracy to our job and schools, whether animals, future humans, or even nature itself can have political rights, how democracy thinks about noncitizens and children, and what would happen if we selected congress by lottery.\nSomething I appreciate about Taylor’s work is it’s alive to paradoxes, ambiguities, and hard questions that don’t offer easy answers. This conversation is no different.\nReferences: \nThe link between support for animal rights and human rights\nInterview with Will Wilkinson \nBook Recommendations: \nHow democratic is the American Constitution? By Robert Dahl  \nAbolition Democracy by Angela Davis \nThe Two Faces of American Freedom by Aziz Rana \n*******************************************************\nWant to contact the show?
