  "description": "<p>If you are familiar with Tony’s events, then you definitely know about <a href= \"https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/business-mastery/\">Business Mastery</a>. This 5-day immersive seminar is a deep dive into the business growth strategies, systems and resources that you need to take your business to the next level. It’s not just a business growth conference. It’s a platform for explosive growth. You learn the innovative strategies that industry leaders like Apple, Zappos and Facebook used to find massive success. You address the critical factors impacting your own business, and learn how you can refocus and realign with the winning business strategy and psychology to compete and innovate in any economy. Because when it comes to business, it shouldn’t be about surviving - it should be about thriving - absolute mastery, ownership of purpose, and fulfillment like no other.</p> <p>In the next three episodes, we’re taking you to a special segment in Tony’s Business Mastery event, where Tony holds a panel discussion with the business leaders behind today’s fastest growing companies. And in this first episode - you’ll hear from Slava Rubin, the co-founder of crowdfunding powerhouse <a href= \"https://www.indiegogo.com\">Indiegogo</a>.</p> <p>Rubin founded Indiegogo in 2008 alongside Danae Ringlemann and Eric Schell and has since seen the crowdfunding site explode, hosting over 600,000 crowdfunding campaigns since its inception. Indiegogo now has about 100 employees. And nearly 15 million people from all over the world go to Indiegogo each month to discover ground-breaking products and services that are solving the world’s problems.</p> <p>You’ll hear Slava talk about how the crowdfunding platform persevered through 93 no’s from venture capitalists. How they finally found their niche. How they continue to stand out from the crowd (no pun intended). And what the future of crowdfunding looks like for Indiegogo.</p>",
