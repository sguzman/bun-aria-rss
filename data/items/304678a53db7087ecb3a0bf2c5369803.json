  "description": "Happy Birthday to Buck's Mom! Clay had a great Halloween party for many reasons, but also because: \"We had a guy and a girl dressed up as a cowboy and an Indian. And I thought that was great, mocking the costume police.\" Biden going to Miami, where Dems are hemorrhaging base voters. Buck says it would have been much wiser to have used Biden in New York, and \"Joe Biden's advisors say Florida is a MAGA dystopia. Sunshine and no taxes? What are they talking about?\" Biden can't win a referendum on results. Credit to Clay's wife Lara for manning the Fireball machine this Halloween to fire up parents. NJ Governor Murphy says it's racist for Republicans to play the \"crime card.\" Clay's new beer is helping him live out his fantasies. Clay and Buck look forward to election night analyzing results together in Nashville. Do your country a favor and don't vote Libertarian, although Buck points out many Libertarians may be voting with us: \"Libertarians apparently don't like sky-high inflation or getting hit on the head with a club on the street either. Go figure.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
