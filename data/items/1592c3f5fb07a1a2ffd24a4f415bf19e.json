  "description": "<div>This is one BIG HAUL! We went to not 1, not 2, but 3 places to find healthy snacks just for you! In this episode, Lisa and the gang are trying snacks that crunch, chew, sip, and snap! Plus, the gang taste tests 2 new dips that are OUT OF THIS WORLD! And we’ve got a new protein puff that you’ll be one-clicking on Amazon ASAP. It’s SO GOOD! So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. And when it’s over, visit our <a href=\"https://www.hungry-girl.com/pages/foodcast\">Foodcast</a> page for a list of all the products!</div>\n",
