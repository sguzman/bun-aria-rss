Please remember that these materials are really meant for professionals and are not a replacement for treatment plans:\nhttps://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets/dbt/none \n\nI KNOW THE LIGHTING ISN'T GOOD THANKS FOR POINTING IT OUT!\n\ndog feet friend zone (hello YouTube algorithm you look lovely today)\n\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/caroline_konstnar/\n\nReddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/carolinekonstnar/",
