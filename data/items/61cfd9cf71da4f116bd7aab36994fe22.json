  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys hold the first ever penitentiary pen pal draft. The rules are simple; each participant selects two people currently in prison to write letters to and the first person who successfully receives two correspondences wins, and some of the picks will definitely surprise you. The guys also cover Jock Jams and uncover the truth about Gary Glitter, waiting until the last minute to plan Pat's charity golf outing (which is tomorrow), talk about the release of today's new OCW (Mexican Celebration), talk about the white kid who smashed the amateur 100m dash record, which snowballs into a conversation about Oscar Pistorius, try to decide what is the appropriate amount of time before people can start discussing spoilers from Avengers: End Game without having to worry about someone knocking your teeth out, and Gorms checks in on an Italian man from Pennsylvania who had a rough time accepting a break up. Today's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas</p>\n",
