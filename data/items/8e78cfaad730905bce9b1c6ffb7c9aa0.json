That's true, and Engels even said that their work was 'destined to do for history what Darwin's theory has done for biology' (Preface to the 1888 English Ed. Communist Manifesto). But I think in my phrasing I implied that Darwin preceded Marx. Marx had already developed historical materialism (in his twenties during the 1840's) before On The Origin Of Species was published (1859). So the order of events was: 1) Marx develops historical materialism 2) Darwin publishes On The Origin Of Species 3) Marx and Engels praise Darwin and Engels says they are destined to do for history what Darwin did for biology. That being said, Darwin did have a significant effect on Marx's outlook, moving him towards scientific positivism and somewhat away from Hegel's mysticism, lending to the discrepancy between 'Young Marx' and 'Old Marx.' Jonathan Spencer talks about that transformation at length in Karl Marx: A Nineteenth Century Life.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:38 Private Property\n10:54 Historical Materialism\n21:25 Communism\n27:49 Totalitarianism\n30:05 Adaptations Of Marxism\n31:13 What Is Marxism?\n\nSources:\n\nTwo Treatises Of Government - John Locke\nEconomic And Philosophical Manuscripts Of 1844 - Karl Marx\nCapital - Karl Marx \nThe Communist Manifesto - Karl Marx & Frederick Engels\nSocialism: Utopian and Scientific - Frederick Engels\nThe Principles Of Communism - Frederick Engels\nThe German Ideology - Karl Marx\nKarl Marx's Funeral - Frederick Engels\nThe Poverty Of Philosophy - Karl Marx\nAnti-Duhring - Frederick Engels\nCritique Of The Gotha Program - Karl Marx\nKarl Marx - Isaiah Berlin \nKarl Marx: A Nineteenth Century Life - Jonathan Spencer\nA History Of Western Philosophy - Bertrand Russell\nLetter From Engels To August Bebel 1884 - Frederick Engels\nThe Open Society And Its Enemies - Karl Popper\n\nTheme music: Double Soul - Unfinished Sympathy",
