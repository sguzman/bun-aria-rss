  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Part 6. Jesus, Divorce & Purity Culture. Jesus is on a roll, with a thread running through Anger & Lust to Divorce. Here, He is pressed with an old argument between two differing Rabbinical ideas. Jesus offers another. What is He doing? Jesus answers one thing and flips the script on another. What is the ideal God set for the covenant of marriage? How is that broken? We look at Rabbinical ideas of gender structures and how they still play out today and how we might choose against them.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
