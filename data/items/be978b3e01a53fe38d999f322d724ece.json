  "description": "<p>April 03, 2004. La Cygne, Kansas. On April 3rd, 2004 the normally reserved and laid back Alonzo Brooks decided to go to a house party with his friends. Alonzo couldn’t drive, so he rode with his friend Justin Sprague. They all arrived and were having a good time, until Justin left the party, leaving Alonzo stranded. Alonzo didn’t come home the next day and hadn’t contacted anyone about where he was. Nearly a month later, his body was found in a creek at the site of the party. To this day, no one knows what exactly happened to Alonzo that night, or how he ended up in that creek.</p><p>For our bonus episodes visit: patreon.com/generationwhy </p><p>...Listen ad free with Wondery+.
