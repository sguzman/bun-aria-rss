  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, President Trump announced that John Bolton will be the new National Security Advisor, replacing HR McMaster. He is building a powerful team with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, James Mattis as Secretary of Defense and now John Bolton. Also, this is biggest spending Congress in modern history. This Republican spending bill is so huge we haven’t seen anything like it since 2009, and Trump needs to veto it. This spending is so massive is makes Obama’s spending look like a joke. Anyone who votes for this bill can never again claim to be a conservative. This is a sell out by the Republicans, they gave Democrats everything they wanted, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are thrilled. It is time for Mitch McConnell to step down. We need fresh voices, fresh thinking, charismatic leaders who have a reason to be elected. This now becomes a moral dilemma, Republicans campaigned one way and are now doing the complete opposite. Rep Mark Meadows and Rep Jim Jordan, who both voted no on, call in to discuss this massive spending bill. Finally, a House probe accused James Clapper of misleading Congress about disclosing information to CNN. Who in the Obama administration didn’t lie?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
