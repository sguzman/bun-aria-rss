  "description": "The Shutdown Fullcast talks mostly about the time we cooked food on a redneck shopping cart grill on a fire made from burning furniture stolen from a Haverty's dumpster. This may seem odd, but the idea of a dominant victory over a good team by the Florida Gators? So overwhelming to Ryan and I that celebrating Floridian squalor is the only way to reset our expectations and return to something like reality.\nTopics:\n--We get immediately to the question: \"How shocked are you that Florida was really good for one game?\"\n--A brief recollection of Florida horrors of the past\n--A warning against pitying Ohio State fans, ever\n--Why Alabama beat Georgia, and why Ole Miss lost to Florida, and a further discussion of styles making fights\n--A lengthy discussion of the most Florida moments in our lives! This includes minivans dying at Checkers, falling off of recreational vehicles, and eating roadkill deer with pocketknives.\n--A review of the coming weekend, where Jason insists he doesn't hate Cal, Ryan and I are certain we're losing to Mizzou after a great Ole Miss game, and how we all know LSU is gonna make the playoff with three losses.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
