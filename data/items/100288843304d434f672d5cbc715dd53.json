  "title": "Lisa Waddington and Anna Lawson, \"The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Practice\" (Oxford UP, 2018)",
  "description": "The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Practice: A Comparative Analysis of the Role of Courts (Oxford UP, 2018) brings together an extraordinary collection of data and analysis which concerns how domestic courts interpret and apply the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is the first thorough comparative collection of research which brings together the approaches to the interpretation and application of the CRPD in domestic courts across thirteen jurisdictions from around the world. In this groundbreaking book, leading global scholars in disability law, Professor Lisa Waddington and Professor Anna Lawson, give the reader unique insight into the influence that the CRPD is having in domestic courts. The first part of the book provides an extensive comparative analysis of the role of the courts in bringing about compliance with the Convention. The second half of the book brings together these findings, offering understandings into the implications for human rights law and theory, contextualised more broadly in international human rights law. This work will be the basis for extensive research into the uses and application of the CRPD, especially with regards to the function and limits of the role of the courts in disability rights enforcement. \nThe book is be an essential resource for any scholar or student of disability law, international law, and human rights.  \nLisa Waddington is a Professor, and Endowed Chair of International and European Law in the faculty of law in Maastricht University in the Netherlands.
