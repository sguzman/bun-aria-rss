Today on the show, Alex explains how the prodigiousness of the Third Infantry Division was due to effective leadership, and the sheer fact that they were in combat so long, serving from the very beginning of the war in Europe to its very end. We then get into the stories of Britt, Daly, Ware, and Murphy, unpacking their varied backgrounds, how they earned their Medals of Honor — and many more decorations besides — and what their lives were like after the war. We end our conversation with what Alex has personally taken away from the stories of these brave men.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Infantry_Division_(United_States)\">Third Infantry Division</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cmohs.org/recipients/maurice-lee-footsie-britt\">Maurice Britt's Medal of Honor Citation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cmohs.org/recipients/michael-j-daly\">Michael Daly's Medal of Honor Citation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cmohs.org/recipients/keith-l-ware\">Keith Ware's Medal of Honor Citation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cmohs.org/recipients/audie-l-murphy\">Audie Murphy's Medal of Honor Citation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/lessons-in-manliness-from-byron-whizzer-white/\">AoM Article: Lessons in Manliness from Byron “Whizzer” White</a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Patch\">General Alexander Patch</a></li><li>Audie Murphy's <i>To Hell and Back</i> — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PAqt57\">the book</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wH7xsX\">film</a></li></ul><h2>Connect With Alex Kershaw</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://alexkershaw.com/\">Alex's Website</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/05/81IXmHZPorL.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Listen to the Podcast!
