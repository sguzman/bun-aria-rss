  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Robert Falkner, Dr Rita Floyd | This lecture, part of a series on Strategy: New Voices will explore the strategic nexus between great power conflict, energy independence and climate action, and how to develop effective international strategies that help us prevent catastrophic global warming.\nThe war in Ukraine has heightened concerns over the impact that geopolitical instability will have on future climate change and energy policy. Great power tensions and conflict threaten to harm the search for international cooperation on global challenges. At the same time, Russia’s military aggression has galvanised European powers to seek strategic autonomy and reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports. Will it also end up galvanising leading powers to accelerate the net zero transition?",
