  "description": "<p>This week on The Cigar Authority broadcasting live from the Toscano Sound Stage in Salem, New Hampshire... We had a listener right an email a few months back suggesting that we try smoking a cigar with a breathe-right strip. This is the week we channel our inner spaz and see how it changes things if at all.</p>\n<p>We will fire up an AVO Caribe in the first hour and a yet to be determined cigar in the second hour as Barry returns from vacation. Join us for all of this and the usual suspects including the VS Question of the Week, Offer of the Day, Cigar News, The email of the week and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority broadcasts live on Saturday at 12noon on our website, TheCigarAuthority.com as well as Facebook Live, YouTube and is available on your favorite podcast catcher.</p>\n",
