  "description": "<p>True Crime Tuesday reveals a Monster: The Life & Crimes of Wayne Chapman with guest David McGrath</p>\n\n<p>Wayne Chapman has admitted to molesting up to 100 boys across multiple states and remains a suspect in the 1976 disappearance of a 10-year-old Lawrence, MA boy.</p>\n\n<p>The term Monster is thrown around sometimes too generally but in describing Wayne Chapman it fits, and yet still, it feels like it only scratches the surface of what he truly is.  From early onset attraction, manipulation and molestation to a much larger, darker and terrifyingly complex web of predators, Wayne Chapman is among the most terrifying...and worse yet, he is back out, among the population.<br>\nDavid McGrath, a forensics investigator has spent 7 years on his obsession to understand this monster and uncover his hidden past. Through multiple interviews and recollections of eyewitnesses and survivors to court transcripts to a face to face encounter, McGrath takes us into the dark with no promise of light at the end of this tunnel. It is a revealing and horrifying look at someone born a monster, not groomed, abused or mistreated, from the day he was born, Wayne Chapman was evil. </p>\n\n<p>Get your True Crime books here: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/darknessradiodave\">https://www.amazon.com/shop/darknessradiodave</a> </p>\n",
