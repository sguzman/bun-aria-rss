  "description": "On Wednesday, October 26th, we will be launching a new podcast called Not Even Mad, featuring Gist host Mike Pesca (heard of him?), Wired contributor and self-proclaimed liberal Virginia Heffernan, and author of the bestselling Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington, Jamie Kirchick, who holds many conservative positions on the issues. So, as a preview of the new podcast, we’ve invited Virginia and Jamie on The Gist to discuss the brokenness of our current political discourse, and also to debate how the Democrats lost the post-Dobbs polling momentum. Is it really just about gas prices? Also, an analysis of “talking your book,” or as Mike describes it “a prediction based on predilection.”\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
