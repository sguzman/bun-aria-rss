  "description": "<p>Olympic figure skater, Adam Rippon, won the world over not only with a medal-winning performance at the 2018 games, but also with his disarmingly honest, unfiltered and funny on-camera presence. Rippon is an artist, athlete, and activist who's known for his passionate support for LGBTQ+ rights and the freedom to be oneself. He's been named to the 2018 TIME 100 List of Most Influential People, honored by the Human Rights Campaign, appeared on Ellen, Colbert, and Kimmel, and recently released his memoir <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35KuJZ5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beautiful on the Outside</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/35KuJZ5). Adam's journey, however, has been anything but easy. In today's conversation, we talk about his rough start in skating, what turned it into a passion, and the yearslong struggles that come with trying to be the best in the world. We also explore how he stepped into and decided to share his sexual identity, grappled with perfection, family, expectations and eventually reclaimed control of his life and, in no small part, his happiness.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
