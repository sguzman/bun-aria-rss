  "description": "<p>Welp, Dorit pushed and prodded, and at long last Erika Jayne cracked.  And it all happened on a junk boat.  Yes, it was the long-awaited Hong Kong vacation on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and Dorit found herself tangled up in Rinna's milkshake \"sixth sense,\" and naturally this spilled over into a generally tense confrontation on the aforementioned junk.  We're not sure how this is all going to work out, but we're pretty sure Erika's succinct and stone-faced dismantling of Dorit will be replayed in our heads for days to come.  Join Ben and Ronnie as they dissect everything in this wacky episode.
