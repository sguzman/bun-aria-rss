  "description": "<p>Continuing the line of thought of an earlier work, we provide the first\ninfinite family of quadratic number fields with everywhere unramified Galois\nextensions of Galois group $SL_2(5)$, the (unique) smallest nonsolvable group\nfor which this problem was previously open. Our approach also improves upon\nprevious work by yielding the first infinite family of real-quadratic fields\npossessing an unramified Galois extension whose Galois group is perfect and not\ngenerated by involutions. Our result also amounts to a new existence result on\nquintic number fields with squarefree discriminant and additional local\nconditions.\n</p>",
