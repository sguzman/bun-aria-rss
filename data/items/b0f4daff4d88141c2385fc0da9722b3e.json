And what does Biden owe those women now, as he seeks the Democratic nomination for president?\nGuest: Dahlia Lithwick, writer for Slate and host of the Amicus podcast. \nPodcast production by Mary Wilson, Jayson De Leon, and Anna Martin, with help from Samantha Lee. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
