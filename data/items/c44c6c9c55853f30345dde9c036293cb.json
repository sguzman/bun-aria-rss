  "description": "75 years ago this week -- on June 6, 1944 soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force undertook the largest amphibious invasion in military history.\nMore than 150,000 U.S., British and Canadian troops, landed on the heavily fortified beaches of Normandy to liberate France and the Continent from 4 years of brutal Nazi Occupation.\nAs the operation began, Armed Forces Radio broadcast a message to the troops from the Supreme Allied Commander and future President, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nGeneral Eisenhower knew that many under his command would not survive the landing – and more than 4,000 people were lost that day.\nBut as he sent his troops into battle, General Eisenhower expressed confidence in their courage – and told them that the righteousness of their great and noble cause would eventually lead to victory over the forces of fascism, tyranny and oppression.\nSo to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day we give Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower the final word.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
