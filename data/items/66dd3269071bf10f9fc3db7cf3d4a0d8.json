  "description": "“Human rights in public policy are constructed by diplomats and politicians in an international legislative process, not discovered amongst the clouds of metaphysics.” In \"Advanced Introduction to the Politics of International Human Rights (Edward Elgar, 2021), David P. Forsythe, general editor of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Human Rights (5 vol.) and pioneer of the field of human rights and international relations studies distills insights gained over his long career about the progress and challenges of the human rights enterprise in a world that remains structured by a life-and-death competition between territorial states.\nA self-defined “liberal realist” Forsythe believes that “individuals can make a difference in constructing a world sympathetic to human rights – up to a point”. In this slim volume, he stresses the difficulties of interjecting human rights into foreign policy and international politics, while recognising the considerable progress that has been made over time. Focusing on international organizations, states, corporations, and private advocacy groups, Forsythe addresses key themes including war, migration, climate change, and slavery.\nNicholas Bequelin is a human rights practitioner with a PhD in history and a scholarly bent. He has worked about 20 years for Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, most recently as Regional director for Asia. He’s currently a Visiting Scholar and Lecturer at Yale Law School.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
