  "description": "<p>In the story of the prodigal son, we see a story about the meltdown of community and the restoration of it. The key theme we’re going to look at in this sermon, which is crucial for the restoration or the renewal of community, is the theme of repentance.</p>\n<p>Even though the word is not in this passage, what we have when the younger son decides to go back to his father is an example of repentance. This sermon will look at the importance of repentance, the anatomy of it, the key to doing it, and the kind of community that results from it. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 12, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:11-20.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
