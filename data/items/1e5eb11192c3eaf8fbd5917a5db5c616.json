  "description": "<p>April 02, 1993. Jamestown & Sonora, California. Parents often say that if anyone ever harmed their child they would take action. Ellie Nesler's son, William, returned from a bible camp one summer but was almost a different person. His demeanor and his actions caused his mother concern but she could not get him to talk with her about it. One year later, William confided in an aunt and the truth came out. A dishwasher at the camp had sexually abused the six year old. Daniel Driver, who had encouraged William to go to the camp, had molested and raped children in the past but had only gotten a slap on the wrist. Little did he know that Ellie Nesler wasn't going to let him get away with his crime this time.
