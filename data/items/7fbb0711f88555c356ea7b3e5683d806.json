  "description": "<p>New Sounds returns to Ireland for the fourth part of our series on the country's contemporary music scene. For Part 4, host John Schaefer speaks with Derry-based composer Neil Burns whose work bridges atmospheric pop and contemporary classical music. Burns discusses his piece \"Walls of Sound,\" a kind of audio tour of Derry, Ireland's city walls that includes processed environmental recordings and spare accompaniment. Neil Burns also shares how his atmospheric pop work has informed his approach to his contemporary classical composition. Later in the hour, John Schaefer meets with Greg Caffrey in Belfast to discuss making music through tough times in Belfast and the Hard Rain Soloist Ensemble he founded.</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-image\"><img class=\"mcePuppyImage\" src=\"https://media2.wnyc.org/i/650/484/l/80/1/Neil_burns242.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Burns\">\n<div class=\"image-metadata\">\n<div class=\"image-caption\">Composer Neil Burns</div>\n<div class=\"image-credit\">(<a href=\"http://www.cmc.ie/\">courtesy of the artist</a>)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> PROGRAM #3718 New Music from Ireland Part 4 (First aired on 4/23/2015)  </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Neil Burns<br>WORK: Things That Came After (1) [2:17]<br>RECORDING: Mood Music Vol. 1, 2006-2013<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/mood-music-vol-1-2006-2013\" target=\"_blank\">neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Neil Burns<br>WORK: Bishop’s Gate to Ferryquay Gate [4:38]<br>RECORDING: new music::new Ireland two<br>SOURCE: Contemporary Music Centre<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.cmc.ie\" target=\"_blank\">www.cmc.ie</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Neil Burns<br>WORK: Ferryquay Gate to Foyle Street [4:25]<br>RECORDING: Walls of Sound<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/walls-of-sound\" target=\"_blank\">neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Comrade Hat<br>WORK: The Path That Goes On [2:50]<br>RECORDING: Follow the Dawn<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://comradehat.bandcamp.com/album/follow-the-dawn\" target=\"_blank\">comradehat.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Neil Burns<br>WORK: The Great White Osprey [5:30]<br>RECORDING: On Thin Ice<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/on-thin-ice\" target=\"_blank\">neilburnsmusic.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Kate Ellis, cello ; Linda Buckley, vocals<br>WORK: Jump, excerpt  [:45]<br>RECORDING: Jump<br>SOURCE: Diatribe Records<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://shop.diatribe.ie/album/jump-2\" target=\"_blank\">shop.diatribe.ie</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Ireland String Quartet<br>WORK: Greg Caffrey: béal mouth beul mooth [2:24]<br>RECORDING: AHRC Irish and Scottish Poetry Project<br>SOURCE:  <a href=\"http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SeamusHeaneyCentreforPoetry/beal/\">Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: The Hard Rain Soloist Ensemble<br>WORK: Greg Caffrey: These are the clouds about the fallen Sun [:57]<br>RECORDING: Hard Rain Ensemble<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.hardrainensemble.com/#!caffrey-greg/c14ce\" target=\"_blank\">hardrainensemble.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: The Hard Rain Soloist Ensemble<br>WORK: Morton Feldman: Duration I [:30]<br>RECORDING: Hard Rain Ensemble<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.hardrainensemble.com/#!feldman-morton/cziw\" target=\"_blank\">hardrainensemble.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: The Hard Rain Soloist Ensemble<br>WORK: Iain McCurdy: Philharmonie [1:09]<br>RECORDING: Hard Rain Ensemble<br>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.hardrainensemble.com/#!iain-mccurdy/cdy2\" target=\"_blank\">hardrainensemble.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Craig Ogden<br>WORK: Greg Caffrey: Deluge [3:30]<br>RECORDING: First Construction in Nylon<br>SOURCE: Cactus Records <br>INFO: <a href=\"http://cactusrecords.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cactusrecords.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Craig Ogden<br>WORK: Greg Caffrey: First Construction in Nylon [3:42]<br>RECORDING: First Construction in Nylon<br>SOURCE: Cactus Records <br>INFO: <a href=\"http://cactusrecords.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cactusrecords.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>",
