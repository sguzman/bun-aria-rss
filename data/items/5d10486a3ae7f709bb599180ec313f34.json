  "description": "Many governments have done an excellent job at propping up businesses during the pandemic. For example, paying companies to furlough workers will, in theory, enable those businesses to quickly bounce back, with a workforce ready to go. But what if the pandemic drags on for years to come? Already governments are talking about how they will claw back the massive increase in government spending. And, whilst large corporations might have the cash to survive, perhaps after a little restructuring, small businesses have the most to lose. They have also borrowed the most. So how does the global economy come back from this? Prof Steve Keen tells Phil Dobbie that it’s a shame this hasn’t been seen as an opportunity to embrace modern monetary theory. But it’s been shunned by governments and central banks who prefer the old way of doing things, which will be highly detrimental to all of us, but particularly those most in need.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
