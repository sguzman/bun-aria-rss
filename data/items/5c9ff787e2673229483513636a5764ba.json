  "description": "<p>The rise of language models such as BERT allows for high-quality text\nparaphrasing. This is a problem to academic integrity, as it is difficult to\ndifferentiate between original and machine-generated content. We propose a\nbenchmark consisting of paraphrased articles using recent language models\nrelying on the Transformer architecture. Our contribution fosters future\nresearch of paraphrase detection systems as it offers a large collection of\naligned original and paraphrased documents, a study regarding its structure,\nclassification experiments with state-of-the-art systems, and we make our\nfindings publicly available.\n</p>",
