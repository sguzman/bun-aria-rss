  "description": "<p>This episode, which largely tackles fear from both a conceptual and emotional standpoint, has been called one of the \"smartest episodes of all time\" by both Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang. After creating art almost immediately (readers: please send us your pictures!), our hosts discuss The Squid Game and how it excited Bowen and triggered Matt, the insane return of The Morning Show, cartoonish violence vs. grounded violence in film and television, haunted house culture, what the girls are smoking lately and anticipation about what Kyle Richards \"is giving\" in the upcoming Halloween Kills. Also, ADELE IS COMING, a deep-dive on \"what Hoku is doing right now\" (there are many red flags), KIM K IS COMING, and recaps of this week's Potomac and Salt Lake City. Have you been enjoying the simple pleasures of autumn? Should it be called \"30\"? Do you think Bowen's Crystal Kung Minkoff impression will earn him an Emmy next year? Watch this space.
