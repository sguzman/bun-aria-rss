  "description": "<p>In this 138th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss what fatwas and cancel culture have in common. Why are we allowing zealots to decide what we can say and do by fiat? The circuitry of religion has an ancient history (even when it goes off the rails, as in the attack on Salman Rushdie); it is being hijacked by a secular cult. This new cult is targeting apostates, and heretics. The new cult does not admit when it is wrong—the CDC simply puts out new guidelines that recommend treating vaccinated and unvaccinated people as equivalent. The new cult sneaks in ideology when you’re not looking. The new cult is anti-science, anti-reality, and anti-democracy.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Thesis: personalized nootropics for motivation, creativity, confidence and more.
