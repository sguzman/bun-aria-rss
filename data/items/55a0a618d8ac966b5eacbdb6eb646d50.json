  "description": "LIVE Questions - God's Plan, Depression, And Waiting On God\n\n1. Does God have a plan for our lives? It seems pretty hopeless to think that we're the victims of other people's free will, or that everything is just up to us. Some people say God has plans and purposes, while others say we have the freedom to choose. Which one is accurate?\n\n2. How do you deal with depression and anxiety?\n\n3. Why does God so often make us wait for things that are really important to us?\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nWatch LIVE on Facebook, Thursday mornings between 11am-12pm.\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
