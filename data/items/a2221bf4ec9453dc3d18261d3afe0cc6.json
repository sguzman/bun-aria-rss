  "description": "Our audiobook this week is HIS VIRGIN QUEEN by MINK! \n\nNarrated by Lance Greenfield and Mackenzie Cartwright\n\nI knew I was going to be sold by my father. A bride offered to forge an alliance or seal a deal. Even so, I still held onto the hope of living free of the families. But when I’m given to Antonio Tuscani, I realize my thin dreams of escaping this life were just that—dreams. Giving up, I accept my fate … Until a fierce-eyed boss, Nick DaVinci, shows up on my wedding day to exact lethal vengeance.\n\nI came for Tuscani blood, and I took it. The doe-eyed bride in her white dress and veil of innocence doesn’t bat an eyelash when I do what I was born to do. I’m the head of the most powerful mafia family in the city, and I didn’t get here by sparing enemies. But Sophia’s demeanor intrigues me, and soon I realize she is far more than a mafia princess. She is a queen, and I will stop at nothing to keep her by my side.\n\nHIS VIRGIN QUEEN by MINK in ebook: https://amzn.to/3iAHivB\nHIS DEADLY DARLING (connected to this week’s audiobook!): https://amzn.to/31MhNAB\n$50 GC GIVEAWAY!: http://readmeromance.com\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
