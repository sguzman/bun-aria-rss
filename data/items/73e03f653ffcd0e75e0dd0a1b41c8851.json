  "description": "<p>What kind of masks should you wear? How many people have had COVID-19 and don’t know? Do antibody tests work? When will we have a vaccine? Is it okay to picnic? Will there be a second wave? You need updates and we’ve got ologists. The wonderful Dr. Shannon Bennett from the first Virology episode joins us again, as well as New York City physician Dr. Mike Natter from the Diabetology episode. These two warm, informed professions dispel rumors, explain what life has been like on the front lines, address medications, describe new symptoms, “proning,” rates of asymptomatic folks, where to wear a mask, how to use gloves and whether or not the balcony saucepan symphonies at 7pm every night delight or annoy them. We’re in this for the long haul folks, but we’ve got each other. </p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Mike Natter at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mike.natter/?hl=en\">Instagram.com/mike.natter</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_natter/status/1250854756500865024?lang=en\">Twitter.com/mike_natter</a></p>\n<p>Dr. Shannon Bennett at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/microbeexplorer\">twitter.com/microbeexplorer</a> and <a href=\"http://instagram.com/microbeexplorer\">Instagram.com/microbeexplorer</a></p>\n<p>Donations went to <a href=\"https://www.foodbanknyc.org\">Food Bank for New York</a> and <a href=\"https://tickets.calacademy.org/donate/i/onetimedonation\">California Academy of Sciences</a> </p>\n<p>Check out the podcast <a href=\"http://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs\">Science Vs.</a> </p>\n<p>More Ologies Coronasodes: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/virology\">Virology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/handsondeck\">All (Washed) Hands on Deck</a></p>\n<p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/virology2\">alieward.com/ologies/virology2</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\">alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and STIIIICKERS!</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies?lang=en\">twitter.com/ologies</a> or instagram.com/ologies</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AlieWard\">twitter.com/AlieWard</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward/?hl=en\">instagram.com/AlieWard</a></p>\n<p>Sound editing by <a href=\"http://jarrettsleeper.com/\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of MindJam Media & <a href=\"http://www.stevenraymorris.com/\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p>\n<p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
