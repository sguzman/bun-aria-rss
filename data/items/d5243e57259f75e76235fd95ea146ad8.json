  "description": "The worst speech from the worst president of all time. Who embarrasses themselves more every time they open their mouth: Biden, Kamala Harris or Karine Jean-Pierre? Flashback: In July 2020, the DNC ran an ad attacking President Trump for trying to open schools. Gavin Newsom's in-laws fled from California to Florida during the pandemic, made a political donation to Ron DeSantis. DeSantis releases fantastic ad on Democrats ripping him for keeping schools open. Thank God for red state governors who fought for in-person schooling. Joe Weasel, director and producer of “Fight for Football -- the fight to save the 2020 season,” joins Clay to discuss his film (with special appearance by Clay Travis). Buck calls from L.A. to give his analysis on Biden's dementia Stalin speech.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
