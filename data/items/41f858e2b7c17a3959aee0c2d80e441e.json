  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Does our faith shape our politics, or is politics shaping our faith? Justin Giboney is an attorney, a political strategist, and the co-founder and president of the AND Campaign. Rather than fighting over whether we should vote red or blue, Giboney believes Christians should use their influence to push both parties toward the love and truth of Christ. He talks with Skye about why that is more necessary and more challenging than ever. Also this week, a new book explores the intersection of white evangelicalism and masculinity leading the Holy Post crew to debate who’s less masculine—Phil or Skye? Plus, a South African couple has made an award-winning gin from elephant dung. Bottoms up!</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gin-elephant-dung-south-africa\"> https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gin-elephant-dung-south-africa</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://religionandpolitics.org/2020/07/07/the-price-of-white-evangelical-patriarchy/\"> https://religionandpolitics.org/2020/07/07/the-price-of-white-evangelical-patriarchy/</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"> </p>",
