  "description": "<p>John Maxwell reminds us time and time again that within every challenge is an opportunity to learn, grow, and lead. The challenge of uncertainty is no different. Uncertainty causes us to think differently and creatively, and to stay focused on the present. It tests our character, our strengths, and our wisdom.</p> <p>In this episode, John teaches us to embrace these benefits of uncertainty, so we can lead when it matters most. In the discussion portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks discuss how to build and not get buried when uncertainty takes us out of “automatic.”</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Embracing the Benefits of Uncertainty Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Benefit and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Intentional-Living-Hardcover_p_2787.html\"> <em>Intentional Living</em> by John C.
