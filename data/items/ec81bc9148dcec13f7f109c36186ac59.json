It's just so incredibly humbling and I hope that that vibe comes through in our discussion. We talk about his future, the importance of self-awareness in his upbringing, social entrepreneurship, and my advice for how he should approach his future. Love the energy coming from this kid. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5180551.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
