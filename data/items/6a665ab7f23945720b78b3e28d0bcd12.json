  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here with Bully by Penelope Douglas. It's a new adult romance between middle-aged-sounding high schoolers who used to be best friends until he turned into a super villain and started bullying her. Listen, a lot of it didn't work for us, but the sexy times did. It was also an incredible vehicle for raceway noises, learning about arborists, and Melody climbing so high on an anti slut-shaming soap box that I doubt we'll ever see her again. \n More Bonus Content: \n Erin's got attitude, Mel's got disclaimers, Cult housekeeping, book recs are NEVER a reflection on the person who recommended them, name opinions, Melody cannot let go of all the girl-on-girl crime, *Bing Boong Bong Bird Click* What Are Arborists? with Erin, vrooom vrooom beep beep! \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n Melody: Please, please, PLEASE donate to The Yellowhammer Fund to help our sisters in Alabama and https://abortionfunds.org/ (The National Network of Abortion Funds) to help our sisters all over the nation access basic medical care and take charge of their reproductive futures. \n Erin: ...
