  "description": "<p>Spoke to a hunter yesterday that had two encounters over the years with these creatures. The first encounter he had was out hunting in Idaho. He noticed an elk running in his direction. What concerned the hunter was something must have been chasing the elk. The hunter says, “I looked up and the elk changed directions and started heading right at me, the elk ran right passed me like it could careless I was there, confused I watched it pass by and then turned back around to see this very large creature giving chase come to a complete stop. It had a rock in its hand, I had never seen anything like this before. We stared at each other for what seemed like forever and what happened next I will never forget….”</p>",
