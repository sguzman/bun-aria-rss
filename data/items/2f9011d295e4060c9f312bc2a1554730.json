That eventually led her to a career in marine science studying sharks and rays. But until relatively recently, she had never met another Black woman in her field. <br/><br/>That all changed in 2020 when she connected with a group of Black women studying sharks through the Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarleeMJ_/status/1267492308745945088\">#BlackInNature</a>. Finding a community was so powerful that the women decided to start a group. <br/><br/>On today's show, Jasmin talks with host Maddie Sofia about Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS) and how it's supporting women of color through hands-on workshops and community building.
