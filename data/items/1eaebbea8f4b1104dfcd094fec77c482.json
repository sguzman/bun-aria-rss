He tells us about his experiences of working with DP Mandy Walker and the various movies they’ve collaborated on. He also shares the challenges of filming Mad Max: Fury Road and Alien Covenant. In the latter movie, he worked closely with the production designer so lighting could be placed in the set as part of the design. We talk about the different styles of lighting and what they require. A detailed look at lighting through the eyes of a gaffer!</p>",
