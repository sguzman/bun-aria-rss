  "description": "I've read about 100 management books by now but if there's something that always bothered me it's the lack of first principles thinking. Basically it's a ton of heuristics. And heuristics are great, but when you present heuristics as true objectives, it kind of clouds the underlying objectives (and you end up with weird proxy cults like the Agile movement ðŸ‘¹ â€“ not that I disagree with it, I just wish they could derive it from a more systematic understanding of project management)."
