Don’t forget to give us your name and where you’re from.</p>\n<p>Tim and Jon responded to four questions.</p>\n<p>(0:40) Felipe from Brazil: “Hi Tim and Jon! My name is Felipe. I am from Brazil, and my question concerns the rebellion of the Sons of God in Genesis 6. Supposing this story talks about actual divine beings as opposed to human kings, do we know for sure the author’s version of the story is the same as 1 Enoch’s, that the divine beings had actual sex with human girls and had actual super-human kids?”</p>\n<p>(36:12) Bradley from Kentucky: “A passage that's always been interesting to me is 1 Samuel 16:14, where God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul. It's connected to a passage you mentioned in 1 Kings 22, one of the only other places where this spirit type is mentioned. I was just wondering how your understanding of the Divine Council helps us understand God's sovereignty through this passage.”</p>\n<p>(42:20) Jeremy from California: “I'm hoping you can shed some light on Luke 10: 17-20. This is the passage where the 72 disciples return from preaching and report to Jesus that even the demons submit to them in his name. Jesus then responds by alluding to Isaiah 14 regarding the fall of the king of Babylon, but he connects it to the fall of Satan. What's going on here? Does this passage refer back to the fall of the Elohim you mentioned that takes place in the early chapters of Genesis? And does this confirm that \"The Satan\" is the chief of all of the fallen Elohim just like the king of Babylon is the chief of fallen rulers?”</p>\n<p>(1:04:52) John from Houston: “My question is about the term \"Son of God\" and how that is used in the New Testament. If we look at Romans 8, we can see that we can accept adoption as sons of God in relation to the only begotten son of God, but this seems like a totally different usage of what you guys described from Genesis. So is there any connection that can be made there?”</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nCheck out all our resources at www.thebibleproject.com</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins, Matthew Halbert-Howen.</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Rosasharn Music</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n",
