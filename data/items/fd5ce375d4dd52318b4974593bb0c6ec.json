The story of this forward progress will be told by NFL head coaches, owners, players, and of course, the women themselves. It's a story that hasn’t been told before - and one that will continue to unfold each day of the NFL season. <em>Earnin' It</em> is produced by iHeartRadio, Sam Rapoport and Jane Skinner Goodell.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
