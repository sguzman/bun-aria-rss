    "media:description": "SOMIS, CA - OCTOBER 27: Jose Espitia, 39, harvest marigold flowers for Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) at Mi Rancho Conejo on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2022 in Somis, CA. Zeferino Garcia, a pioneering Oaxacan entrepeneur, is the owner of Mi Rancho Conejo. Dia de Muertos is a holiday traditionally celebrated on November 1 and 2, originating in Mexico. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pay respects and to remember friends and family members who have died. Traditions connected with the holiday include honoring the deceased using calaveras and aztec marigold flowers known as cempazuchitl, building home altars called ofrendas with the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these items as gifts for the deceased (Wikipedia).(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)",
