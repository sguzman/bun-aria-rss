  "description": "<p>Join Avery on another solo episode that's part of Battle and Banter's Korean War 70th Anniversary Series, detailing the Battle of Unsan. Taking place between October 25th and November 4th, 1950, the fighting that took place around the North Korean village of Unsan, some 50 miles north of the Ch'ongch'on River, marked the beginning of hostilities between the United Nations forces and the Communist Chinese Forces (CCF) during the Korean War. It was also the first time during the war that a significant group of Chinese and American forces engaged each other in a major battle. The battle would prove to be one of the first Chinese victories of the Korean War, and signaled that the tide was about to turn again...against the U.N. forces in country. Next episode will be our 50th Episode Special so in the meantime, enjoy!</p>",
