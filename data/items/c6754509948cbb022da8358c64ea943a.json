  "description": "I can't think of a better way to describe the music of Rodrigo y Gabriela than with three words: \"heavy metal flamenco.\" And yet the duo doesn't play heavy metal — its members perform instrumentals on nylon-string guitars — nor does it play Spanish dance music. But the term fits because the pair's fierce guitar riffs feel powerfully electric, and because Rodrigo y Gabriela's rhythmic style showcases a frenetic strum that conjures the energy of flamenco.",
