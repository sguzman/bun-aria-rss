  "description": "<p>Here’s a saying that we’ve all heard- don’t put all your eggs in one basket. That makes a lot of sense but does it apply to investing? Is one fund enough if you’re invested in a diversified index fund? Or maybe you’re thinking- forget index funds, what about bonds? Shouldn’t I be invested in those as well? These are all questions that we’re going to address during this episode where we discuss asset allocation and how it is that we personally invest. Everyone wants to make wise investing decisions, but in an attempt to diversify we can easily become overwhelmed with the pure quantity of different investing options that are available. For example crypto, REITs, and NFTs just to name a few. Spending <em>some</em> time thinking about asset allocation is smart but simplicity has its advantages. Listen in as we do a deep dive on asset allocation today to put your mind at ease and help you think through what a solid diversification strategy looks like.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Haptic by Halfway Crooks Beer!
