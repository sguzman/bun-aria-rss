  "description": "Boundaries aren’t selfish. They’re self-preservation. If this idea makes you uncomfortable, believe us, you’re not alone! So many of us grew up learning to tune out our own needs in favor of pleasing others. Here’s the thing: Now, as adults, that circuit no longer serves us. If you feel exhausted, resentful, or overwhelmed… this episode is for you. Dr. Becky talks with therapist and best-selling author of “Set Boundaries, Find Peace” Nedra Tawwab about all things boundaries: what they really mean, where to start, how to set them, what makes them so hard, how to handle pushback, and more. You’ll learn the difference between “self-care” and “after-care,” why saying yes is just as important as saying no, and a ton of actionable strategies (including how Dr. Becky and Nedra manage their calendars to avoid over-committing). Remember: Your needs and wants matter, even when others have different needs and wants.<p/>\n<p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
