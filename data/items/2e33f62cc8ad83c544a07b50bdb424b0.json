  "description": "<p>Friday 9/15- Today on the show we had our girl CARDI B in the building!! (soon to be the first female rapper since Lauryn Hill to hit number one with her song \"Bodak Yellow\" on the Billboard Hot 100 without a feature if the culture allows this). She spoke about her relationship with Migos member Offset, new album, and even though she has new ride she still doesn't have her license. But hey, who has the time for that when she's meeting people like Beyonce! Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Floyd Mayweather because he defended Donald Trump comments on grabbing women by the p***. Moreover, we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners are givers or takers when it comes to the bedroom. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
