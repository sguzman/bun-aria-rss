Bush’s first pitch, and the desperation for the Yankees and Mets headed into the weekend. Then, Karl Ravech stops by to talk about the Yankees lacking the vigor the Blue Jays are playing with, Jacob deGrom and Sandy Alderson not being on the same page with deGrom’s elbow, and Hunter Renfroe’s comments on the Red Sox’s COVID-19 outbreak. Later, Todd Radom has the Forgotten Franchise and the weekly quiz.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
