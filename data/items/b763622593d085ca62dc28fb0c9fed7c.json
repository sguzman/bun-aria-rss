  "description": "Jamison Family Deaths. October, 08, 2009. Red Oak, Oklahoma. Bobby and Sherilynn Jamison, along with their daughter, 6 year-old Madyson, drive out to a remote area near Red Oak, Oklahoma to look at property. They are intending to move out there from Eufaula, Oklahoma. After this, no one hears from the family again. A search involving over 100 law enforcement and civilians fails to turn up the family's whereabouts, but their truck is located. Inside the truck is their now emaciated dog and many of their personal items. It would be four more years before their remains are discovered about 2.7 miles from where their truck was found. What could have happened to this family? Rumors suggested many possibilities: possible cult involvement, drugs and gangs, as well as strange behavior by Bobby and Sherilynn in the time leading up to their disappearance.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
