  "description": "Yochi, Zack, and special guest Alexia Underwood talk about why President Trump's top aides begged him not to congratulate Vladimir Putin for winning this week's sham Russian election -- and why Trump ignored them and did so anyway. On Elsewhere, they talk about Venezuela's decision to take a page from the Bitcoin playbook and develop the world's first state-run crypto currency, the petro, and why Russia may soon roll out one of its own. Alexia shows off her Arabic accent, Zack deftly uses the phrase \"fiat currency,\" and Yochi marvels at the possible creation of the phrase \"crypto-ruble.\" \nLearn more about your ad choices.
