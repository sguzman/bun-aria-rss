  "description": "<p>We have something amazing in store for you and it's the return of our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pzlr\">Sandy Weisz</a>! If you think the riddles haven't been good in a couple years, well, this is the episode for you. All that and we've got a woman living her best life, a newsroom that's a little too comfortable, a living room that's definitely uncomfortable, a journey into a classic children's book and an unhelpful tourist. Oh, and did we mention Sandy is back? Because he is and you can listen to him on this episode!
