  "description": "In Episode 80 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz, or Dr B, to go through some of the most common gut health questions out there! If you have tuned into the Plant Proof podcast before you have no doubt come across my previous conversations with Dr B - he is incredibly knowledgeable and has a unique ability to break complicated science down and turn it into simple practical tips.\n\nIf you haven't listened to the previous episodes with Dr B I highly encourage you check them out - Episode 17 (How to build a healthy gut) and Episode 70 (Ex vegans & their gut health issues). With so many bloggers and unqualified people providing advice on gut health these days it's refreshing to hear from a Gastroenterologist who genuinely understands the science inside out.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\n\nHeavy bloating and gut health\n\nHow our mind can affect digestion\n\nHow to identify if your gut needs repair\n\nThe role of Archaea in our gut\n\nPreparing food to improve digestion\n\nAre there benefits to supplementing with food enzymes or drinking bone broth\n\nSeasoning food\n\nJuicing & gut health\n\nWhat do we need to know about TMAO\n\nIBS & 'leaky gut'\n\nWhat does a regular bowel routine look like\n\nand much much more\n\n\nHope you enjoy the episode friends. If you have any comments or questions, Dr B (@theguthealthmd) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you.\n\n\nAll episodes with Dr Will Bulsiewicz\nEpisode 17 - Building a health gut\nEpisode 70 - Ex Vegans & their Gut Health issues\nEpisode 80 - Part 1 of our Gut Health Q & A\nEpisode 81 - Part 2 of our Gut Health Q & A\nEpisode 102 - A Healthy Gut is Fiber Fueled\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
