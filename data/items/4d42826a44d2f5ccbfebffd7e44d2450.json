  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Have you ever used an under-inflated rubber doll to jumpstart your reunion-slash-sex party? Sex educator Reid Mihalko spends more than a year hunkered down with his partner during the pandemic, which sets a personal record: the longest time he’s ever gone without a threesome. No more! Reid hatches a plan to host a writer’s retreat in a Northern California yurt with many of his sex-positive friends, and after travel and quarantining and rapid tests, nobody remembers how to connect anymore. What better way to get your strap-on gangbang going than to put that board game blow-up doll to good use?
