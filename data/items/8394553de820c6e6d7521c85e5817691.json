PROOF is a podcast that takes us into the curious, unexamined corners of the food world, and in this episode they ask: Do burgers need ketchup? The birthplace of the burger, Louis’ Lunch, doesn’t think so. The family-run business has maintained a strict no-ketchup policy since they opened in 1895. We infiltrate this notorious ketchup resistance cell to try to understand why ketchup is such a polarizing condiment.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
