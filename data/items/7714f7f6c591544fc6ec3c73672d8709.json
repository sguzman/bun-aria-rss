    "media:description": "I'll livestream code and explain everything you could want to know about Transfer Learning using TensorFlow. \n\nTransfer learning occurs when you take a model trained to perform a certain task and reuse it to perform another task. Often enormous resources are required to train a model to do a sophisticated task. If you can find a model that was trained on a related task you can cut your development time.\n\nIn this video I'll cover all of the following Live : \n\n✳️ Transfer Learning\n✳️ TensorFlow Hub\n✳️ Multi-Class Convolutional Neural Networks\n✳️ Downloading & Processing Data\n✳️ Activation\n✳️ Pooling\n✳️ Optimizing Performance\n✳️ Minimizing Overfitting\n✳️ Augmenting Images\n✳️ ResNet\n✳️ EfficientNet\n✳️ Much More!\n\nCode is Here : https://github.com/derekbanas/tensorflow/blob/main/tf_transfer.ipynb\n\nMY UDEMY COURSES ARE 87.5% OFF TIL July 16th ($9.99)\nhttps://www.udemy.com/\n\n➡️ Python Data Science Series for $9.99 : Highest Rated & Largest Python Udemy Course + 56 Hrs + 200 Videos + Data Science https://bit.ly/Master_Python_35\n\n➡️ New C++ Programming Bootcamp Series for $9.99 : Over 23 Hrs + 53 Videos + Quizzes + Graded Assignments + New Videos Every Month https://bit.ly/C_Course_35",
