  "description": "Don’t miss our live episode of Climavores in New York City on October 20! Sign up here for a night of live audio and networking with top voices in climate journalism. \nDepending on which headlines you read, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will either hurt U.S. electric vehicle sales by replacing existing tax credits with complicated new ones or build out a North American battery supply chain and rev up EV sales. So which is it?\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Sam Jaffe, vice president of battery solutions at E-Source, about the key provisions of the IRA’s EV and battery tax credits. Sam explains how the IRA will spur a North American EV battery supply chain in the long run but will also create winners and losers along the way. \nThere’s a $30 billion pot of money for various tax credits and limited time to make use of them. Who will get to it first? There are already some early movers.\nSam explains the key provisions:\n\nThe EV components tax credit reduces the cost of EVs whose batteries contain materials assembled in the U.S. or its free-trade partner countries. This includes electrodes, electrolyte components and cells. \n\nThe strategic minerals tax credit reduces the cost of EVs whose batteries contain minerals mined and processed in the U.S. or its free-trade partner countries. These minerals include lithium, cobalt, and rare earth metals, among others.\n\nThe 45X advanced manufacturing production credit reduces the cost of making batteries in the U.S.\n\nCertain credits ratchet up the percentage of materials required to qualify over several years. So once an EV model qualifies, it will have to maintain eligibility by getting a larger and larger share of its components and minerals from approved countries.\n\n\nThey also cover which part of the battery industry will benefit more– the EV battery side or the stationary storage side. And Sam explains why he’s paying attention to the Treasury Department’s forthcoming guidance on the tax credits.\nResources:\n\n\nThe New York Times: For Electric Vehicle Makers, Winners and Losers in Climate Bill\n\n\nCanary Media: Private-sector reactions to the Inflation Reduction Act\n\n\nCanary Media: 6 clean energy companies that are ramping up US manufacturing\n\n \nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
