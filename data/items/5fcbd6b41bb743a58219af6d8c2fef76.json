  "description": "<p>Are you a leader or just a manager? According to John C. Maxwell, a manager’s goal is to do things right. A leader’s goal is to do the right things.</p> <p>In this episode, we’re continuing our discussion on moving from ordinary to extraordinary as a leader. John touches on the importance of realism, change, thinking, attitude, and planning in the journey to becoming extraordinary.</p> <p>Mark and Richard follow up with a discussion on the balance between realism and creativity. How does a leader embrace realistic thinking without smothering the creative fire? They also explore why most people have the “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it” mentality––a mentality that thwarts innovation and change.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Ordinary to Extraordinary Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
