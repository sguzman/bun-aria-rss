  "description": "John and Mary Beth Tinker—teenagers in Iowa during the mid-1960s—wore black armbands to school one day as a symbolic protest against the Vietnam War. They were both suspended and later sued the Des Moines school district for violating their First Amendment rights. The armbands may seem mild compared to the vocal walkouts we see today. But at the time, it was described as \"a disturbing situation within the schools.\" In this landmark case, the Supreme Court weighed whether freedom of speech extends to public students.\n\nIf you love Unprecedented, you can support the show and more great podcasts from WAMU by heading to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NigOkC\">wamu.org/donate</a>.",
