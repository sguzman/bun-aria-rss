  "description": "<p>Mike T. Brown went from tackling running backs in the NFL to tackling the tech world. He’s created a revolutionary fantasy gaming platform that is reshaping philanthropy. He has raised money for his company by way of a little known funding method called equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is something that every business owner should be aware of because it allows you to raise large amounts of money in short periods of time without any bank funding. It is also something that every investor should be aware of because it allows you to obtain ownership in companies at their beginning stages, which could potentially lead to huge profits down the line. Mike gave us insight on equity crowdfunding, he also explained how he transitioned from the NFL to the tech world and he explained how his company Win-Win will change the landscape of fantasy sports.
