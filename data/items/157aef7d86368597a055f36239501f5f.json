  "description": "<p>In this episode I get deeper into codependency and control - all the fun stuff like what if you don't have to react to things right away? How obsessing never helps and boundaries in general are good things. Reading a book about it called \"Codependency No More\". Also, my latest analysis of Molly Sims' Youtube page - FYI she's way better at Momming than I am.  Who the fuck is updating their \"story\" on Instagram constantly?! More lessons from social media. I answer an emailer who wants to hang with her ex - should she? Another lady is depressed despite keeping a structured daily routine - should she take anti-depressants? My first emailer from Manila writes in about how to get her life in the Philippines. </p>\n",
