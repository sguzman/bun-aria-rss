  "description": "<p>On Monday, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration for anyone over the age of 18. It&#8217;s the second vaccine the FDA has approved for use by adults, but parents seeking official guidance for children under 5 are still left with plenty of questions and not many answers. Then we catch up on the news we missed over the weekend, including Spotify&#8217;s response to the Joe Rogan controversy, a racist smear campaign against a presidential nominee for the Federal Reserve Board and how fashion brands could be edging toward the end of consumer-friendly seasonal sales. Plus, we have serious fun with a couple of interactive projects and a musical Make Me Smile!</p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything we talked about on the show today:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/592072-fda-fully-approves-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-company-says\">&#8220;FDA fully approves Moderna COVID-19 vaccine&#8221;</a> from The Hill</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/us-parents-kids-under-five-covid-vaccine\">&#8220;&#8216;We are so tired&#8217;: US parents and doctors say kids under five left behind in Covid vaccine race</a>&#8221; from The Guardian</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotifys-platform-rules-and-approach-to-covid-19/\">&#8220;Spotify&#8217;s Platform Rules and Approach to COVID-19&#8221;</a> from Spotify</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-nominee-racist-criticism_n_61f367eee4b02de5f516fa2a\">&#8220;Biden&#8217;s Federal Reserve Nominee Lisa Cook Is Facing A Racist Smear Campaign</a>&#8221; from The Huffington Post</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bank-america-says-it-expects-seven-fed-rate-hikes-this-year-2022-01-28/\">&#8220;Bank of America says it sees seven Fed rate hikes this year&#8221;</a> from Reuters</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition\">&#8220;Wordle has been bought by The New York Times, will &#8216;initially&#8217; remain free for everyone to play&#8221;</a> from The Verge</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fashion-brands-hope-covid-will-banish-end-of-season-sales-11643376788?mod=hp_minor_pos21\">&#8220;Fashion Brands Hope Covid Will Banish End-of-Season Sales&#8221;</a> from The Wall Street Journal</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/27/us/politics/congressional-gerrymandering-redistricting-game-2022.html\">&#8220;Can You Gerrymander Your Party to Power?&#8221;</a> From The New York Times</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/redistricting-mini-golf/\">&#8220;Play mini golf to see how politicians tilt elections using maps&#8221;</a> from The Washington Post</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-reports-37-new-covid-19-cases-among-olympics-personnel-jan-30-2022-01-31/\">&#8220;COVID cases mount as athletes, personnel arrive in Beijing&#8221;</a> from Reuters</li>\n<li>Miles the Music Kid’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXWxw306cVTRV0QgWjglVtQ/videos\">YouTube</a> channel</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What’s making you smile this week?
