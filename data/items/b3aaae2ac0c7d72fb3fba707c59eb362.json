  "description": "<p>This podcast was recorded after my trip to the Découvertes en Vallée du Rhône, a wine trade fair that I was invited to by <a href=\"https://www.vins-rhone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Inter-Rhône</a>. It was a wonderful learning experience and I stayed on for a few days afterwards to explore Hermitage, Côte Rôtie, Condrieu, St. Joseph, Crozes-Hermitage, and in the south, Beaumes de Venise with Claude Chabran of Rhonéa, Gigondas with Elisa Cheron from <a href= \"https://www.sergedoreselections.com/gigondas-vielles-vignes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Familie Cheron of</a> <span style= \"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href= \"https://www.sergedoreselections.com/gigondas-vielles-vignes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domaine du Grand Montmirail</a>,</span> and a self-guided tour of vineyards in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. It was a fantastic trip and I am grateful to the people at Inter-Rhone for the opportunity.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/IMG_3649.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"302\" height=\"403\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Découvertes en Vallée du Rhône at Palais des Papes in Avignon, Elizabeth Schneider, Wine For Normal People</span></em></p> <p> </p> <p>If you are curious about some of the people I mention as partners in crime in the show:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.mattwalls.co.uk/\">Matt Walls</a>, Rhône expert, Decanter’s Rhône contributor, author of Wines of the Rhône</li> <li><a href=\"https://cluboenologique.com/author/adamlechmere/\">Adam Lechmere</a>, editor of Club Oenologique and prominent wine writer</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.elizabethgabay.com/\">Elizabeth “Liz” Gabay, MW</a> – Rosé goddess (and the world’s foremost rosé expert)</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.wineanorak.com/wineblog/\">Jamie Goode of Wine Anorak</a> and author or several books</li> <li>Also, not mentioned by name (with apologies, but MC Ice had me thinking of Brits – these guys are fantastic), <a href= \"http://www.kurtiskolt.com/\">Kurtis Kolt</a>, a great writer and consultant from Vancouver, Canada and <a href= \"https://quench.me/author/gurvinderbhatia/\">Gurvinder Bhatia</a>, Editor-in-Chief of Quench magazine</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/IMG_4114.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"269\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: The Rhône in Bloom! by Elizabeth Schneider, Wine For Normal People</em></span></p> <p> </p> <ol> <li><strong>Côtes du Rhône percentages are PLANTINGS</strong>, not blend percentages in Côtes du Rhône wines. So if the requirement is 40% Grenache for a Côtes du Rhône, that is how much Grenache must be <em>planted</em>in a vineyard for Côtes du Rhône, not how much has to be in the blend. Case in point: I had a 99% Syrah that was a Village wine.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li>The producer is a big part of whether you like a wine or not, but you should still learn region before you learn producer. <strong>Producer can make or break your experience.</strong> It’s hard to learn but once you understand what the region has to offer, the next step is finding the producers you like.</li> </ol> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"https://www.sergedoreselections.com/gigondas-vielles-vignes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/669183F6-30E7-4BD2-AA5C-50651CE52A43.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"302\" /></a><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Great producers: Familie Cheron of <a href= \"https://www.sergedoreselections.com/gigondas-vielles-vignes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domaine du Grand Montmirail,</a> Gigondas</em></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <ol start=\"3\"> <li><strong>About white grapes in rosé wine…it’s a-ok!</strong> I mentioned <a href=\"https://www.elizabethgabay.com/\">Elizabeth “Liz” Gabay, MW</a> – goddess of pink wine and her son Ben. Look them up. White wines are allowed to be used in rosé as long as those grapes are fermented with the juice from red grapes. Whites Clairette, Picpoul, and Bouboulenc are used to lighten up one of my absolute favorite rosés, the Rhône cru, Tavel.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"4\"> <li><strong>Roussanne grows really well in the southern Rhône</strong> <strong>and there is more of it than ever before.</strong> The is distinctive when you taste it in a blend and there are more whites from Côtes du Rhône and the Villages planting and growing this awesome grape to make it a bigger part of blends. <a href= \"https://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/webpage/ep-419-the-grape-miniseries-roussanne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out the pod we did on this wonderful grape.</a></li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"5\"> <li><strong>Clairette is another a grape that no one talks about it but is awesome</strong> – acidic, refreshing, can be like Sauvignon Blanc, lighter style Rieslings, zippy, and green fruit notes. It is used in large proportions in Côtes du Rhône blanc from the south.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"6\"> <li><strong>Cairanne, the cru of the southern Rhône, is light on its feet and a completely different wine than the rest of the cru.</strong> Because of the larger proportion of Cinsault, the lighter soils, the Mistral wind, and the terroir, the wines have a lighter touch than many of the other southern Rhône cru. Cairanne makes pretty and elegant wine still with great fruit.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"7\"> <li><strong>An important point from the trip: Please STOP SENDING ME COMMENTS ABOUT MY FRENCH.</strong>Even when I tried to say names of regions and wines, I was not understood by folks in the Rhône or other parts of the south. It often took Google translate to communicate. If I tried to pronounce things in French it would have a terrible effect – neither French speakers nor English speakers would understand me and it would be futile. WFNP is an English language podcast and I need to pronounce things so that English language speakers (most of whom speak no French) understand what wines and regions I am saying so they can seek these wines out. After this trip, I will no longer be answering these comments and if you find that offensive, you can feel free to turn off the show. I’m sorry to see you go, but I’m no longer going to be apologetic for anglicizing French.</li> </ol> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/CB8C932B-2313-49B5-943E-238277086A84.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"302\" /><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Dentelles du Montmirail in Gigondas, by </span></em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Elizabeth Schneider, Wine For Normal People</em></span></p> <p> </p> <ol start=\"8\"> <li><strong>Gigondas is NOT a baby Châteauneuf-du-Pape, in my opinion.</strong> Some is very tannic and harsh, some is just beautiful but it is all about skill and terroir.

Although the wines from farther north are a little softer, I found them to be so harsh in tannin I could barely drink them. The verdict is out on if they will mellow with time, but to drink the young wine was nearly impossible for me. If you love harsh tannin, this is your wine.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"15\"> <li>Châteauneuf-du-Pape is bigger than the entire northern Rhone combined. It is VERY varied in terroir, farming, and quality, so caveat emptor!</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>There are a million other little tidbits woven into this show. If you want to explore Rhône beyond study guides and generalizations, this show will get you far in understanding how different reality is from what may be published in books.</p> <p> </p> <p>I hope you enjoy our “myth-busters, Rhône edition”!</p> <p>___________________________________________________</p> <p>Thanks to our sponsors this week:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.winespies.com/normal\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"> </a></p> <p>Our sponsor: <a href=\"http://www.winespies.com/normal\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wine Spies!</a></p> <p>Wine Spies uncovers incredible wines at unreal prices - on big names or boutique brands from all over the world at up to 75% off!
