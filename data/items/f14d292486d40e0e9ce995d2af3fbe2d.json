  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we have allowed the Democrat Party to get away with an attempted soft coup effort. The same Democrats that supported the Soviet Union are turning America inside out. President Reagan faced similar challenges as the Democrats and the media treated him as a dunce. The democrats and Ted Kennedy conspired with the KGB to try and stop Reagan, these same democrats that claim to be against Russia, did nothing to protect Ukraine when Russia invaded them, yet they claim to be tough on Russia. It's these same Democrats that did, in fact, collude with Russia to push phony information into the FBI and into the media to perpetuate this fraud on the American people. And now since all of that failed, $40 million and 500 pages later, they hatched another plot. Now, the same Donald Trump that they claimed to be a Russian Agent, has provided Russia's closest enemy with lethal weapons, the same Donald Trump that they claim colluded with Russia has provided vital security aid for the past 3 consecutive years. Then, the democrats and the media are a bigger threat to the United States than even Russia is. Adam Schiff hired a former NSC staffer Eric Ciaramella one day after the President's phone call with President Zelensky, to work on his intel committee so they're literally recruiting people who worked inside the White House to obtain information on their political opponent — President Trump. Later, Schiff disclosed in his report today on page 157 that he had obtained the phone records of a journalist, a Congressman, and two of the President’s personal attorneys. Schiff skates dangerously close to the edge when he's gaining access to the private phone logs of John Solomon, Devin Nunes Rudy Giuliani, and Jay Sekulow. as reported by the Epoch Times.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
