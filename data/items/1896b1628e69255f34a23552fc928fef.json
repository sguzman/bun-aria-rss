  "description": "<p>We investigate pattern transformations of periodic hydrogel systems that are\ntriggered by swelling-induced structural instabilities. The types of\nmicrostructures considered in the present work include single-phase and\ntwo-phase voided hydrogel structures as well as reinforced hydrogel thin films.\nWhile the observed transformations of the single-phase structures show good\nagreement with experimental findings, the two-phase materials provide novel\npatterns associated with wrinkling of internal surfaces. Furthermore, an\nextensive parametric study on the reinforced hydrogel thin films reveals new\nopportunities for the design of complex out-of-plane surface modes caused by\nswelling-induced instabilities. Next to the mentioned buckling-type\ninstabilities, we encountered the development of micro-creases at the internal\nsurfaces of periodic media before the loss of strong ellipticity of effective\nmoduli.\n</p>",
