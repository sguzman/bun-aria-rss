  "title": "PMS 2.0 234 - Just A Married Man Bullshitting With The Boys, Jett Passan, And Dan Orlovsky About COVID Changing Life & Sports. Let's Gooo.",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss the recent developments coming from the college football world where reports indicate that the Big Ten and Pac-12 are considering postponing their fall seasons, while the SEC seems to be trying to move full steam ahead. To discuss the situation, 12 year NFL Quarterback, current ESPN analyst, one of the sharpest football minds around, and friend of the show, Dan Orlovsky joins the program. Pat and Dan discuss everything going on with the college football climate and the players asserting that they want to play. They chat about what will happen if certain conferences postpone their fall seasons while some schools still decide they want to play football, why they think this could be a fracturing point for the NCAA and major conferences, what other information would need to come out to firmly cancel football at colleges, why not playing the season would be a major detriment to a lot of players who are forced to go home and lose the daily structure of a football season, and whether or not Dan thinks we'll see a lot of players being poached by schools who are trying to play (16:45-35:40). Also joining the show is friend of the program and ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff \"Jett\" Passan. Pat and Jett discuss how the MLB has been handling their COVID outbreaks and what is being done to make sure that games can still be played, how serious teams are about sending players home if they ignore rules and decide to go out in cities, if teams that have had several games canceled due to positive tests are going to play a full slate, whether or not he thinks the baseball season will finish, and Jett weighs in on everything happening in the NCAA with a great take that may surprise you (37:26-51:13). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you rocking with us day in and day out. Keep your eyes peeled for some big things coming from PMI this fall, and make sure you subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow if you haven't already. Come and laugh with us, cheers</p>\n",
