Thanks to Geologie for sponsoring today's video.\n\nFighting game stories are immensely daft, none moreso than Tekken's—a decades-spanning spiral of Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima throwing each other into volcanoes, and bodyguard bears doting after pandas. But it's the dedication to its wild lore over seven numbered entries, the pace at which you uncover said lore in its amazing ending cutscenes, and the series' consistent willingness to mess with our ideas of canon, that all elevate Tekken's story above most other games in its genre—weaving a tapestry that's equal parts hilarious, campy, heartfelt and mysterious. Time to join the King of Iron Fist Tournament—enter the Tekken.\n\n---\n\nSupport the show on Patreon - http://patreon.com/writingongames\n\nPodcast - http://anchor.fm/writingongamescast\n\nSecond Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1xxfS_HILi09yaELQdmV1A\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:19 - Explaining the Tekken timeline\n2:59 - How Tekken is different\n3:42 - What if Kuma wins the tournament?!\n4:59 - Tekken is a choose-your-own-adventure\n6:20 - The Paul timeline\n7:14 - The tragedy of Wang Jinrei\n8:14 - Tekken is far from perfect\n8:38 - The failure of Tekken 7\n9:29 - The Mishimas are not sympathetic\n10:36 - Conclusion\n\n---\n\nText intro animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames\n\nExtra footage from videogamedunkey, The Gaming Restoration and THE MXG PLAYER.
