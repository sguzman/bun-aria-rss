If you can create value for all sides in a market (\"expand the efficient frontier\"), you really can’t help but be successful.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, Airbnb was able to fundamentally change the nature of the travel market and provide guests with more quality for less money, while also enabling hosts to earn meaningful extra income during a very difficult economic period.

Relying solely direct/organic traffic is both a gift and a curse.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Undeniably, direct/organic customer acquisition is a wonderful goal for any business to strive for. Who wouldn't want to acquire customers without paying for them? However, if you don't also build the muscle for profitable and reliable growth through paid channels, you can be left vulnerable vulnerable when organic growth slows, as it inevitably will.<br /> <br
