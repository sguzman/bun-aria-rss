  "description": "The English Reformation started in the middle of the sixteenth century, and right away there were more zealous reformers who were not satisfied with the changes made in the English church. These \"hotter sort of Protestants\" kept trying to conform English to the pattern of Reformed churches in continental Europe. In a fast-paced introductory volume, Hot Protestants: A History of Puritanism in England and America (Yale UP, 2019), Michael P. Winship covers a century-and-a-half of the Puritan project as it spans across the British Atlantic. By rejecting the standard and artificial periodization that stops the Puritan narrative at 1660, Winship traces a coherent movement all the way to the end of the seventeenth century. This is a must-read for any students who want to study the complicated international religious and political networks in the long English reformation and New England colonies.\nRyan David Shelton (@ryoldfashioned) is a social historian of British and American Protestantism and a PhD researcher at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
