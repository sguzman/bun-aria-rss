ET and the entire ETA squad would like to send our condolences.\n Is the term fake it till you make it still valid ? Should current or future entrepreneurs still live with this mindset ? CJ poses this question as he talks about an encounter with someone he’s been helping out. The gentlemen was making things in his life look better than they were and CJ confronted him about it. The gentlemen then explains that he was doing what he thought the squad had to do to get on and then the lightbulb in CJ’s brain turned on.\n Did they fake it till they made it ? CJ talks about some things they did to make things seem better than they were. Several questions are posed. Were they guilty of doing something that they don’t like others doing ? What are the limits to faking it till you make it ? How long do you fake it till you make it? As you find out the answers to these questions in this episode keep in mind one thing.
