  "description": "<p><br></p><p>The audio equivalent of a fine cigar, Paddy Tipping has one of the most soothing voices in politics. The Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire shares his love of the job and how it compares to his previous life as the MP for Sherwood. He also explains why Nottinghamshire Police received plaudits for their policing of a vigil in the city. Paddy was an anti-war MP and he recalls the pressure he and others felt under at the time of the Iraq vote, caught between his conscience and not wanting to bring down a Labour government. Paddy's warm exterior shouldn't fool you, he's a sharp political brain. Paddy gave Matt his first job in politics and explains why on earth he ever employed him in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Follow Paddy on Twitter: @PaddyTipping</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Visit Paddy's website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paddy4pcc.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://paddy4pcc.co.uk/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Apply to vote by post here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Order Matt's book 'Politically Homeless' here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/2100000262618\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/2100000262618</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>For the latest UK Government advice on coronavirus go to:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
