  "title": "Kissing Sebastian Stan",
  "description": "Here it is, thirst-buckets! Sebastian Stan has easily been one of our most thirsted-for Thirst Objects, (our Tumblr askbox has been FULL of him this season) and we decided to explore. Gather round, thirst-buckets, and let's go on a journey that will traverse the source of Mr. Stan's desirability. Is it his hot douchebag face that somehow delivers pretty, Ken-like blankness just as well as tearful high emotion? Is it the way he gets all up in your space, TalkingRealClose, right before he kisses you? Is it his hair — athlete-short or Bucky-long? Or is it all in that sinful bottom lip, the one that made us look up the recipe for traditional Romanian sarmale? Warning: this week’s drabbles blew up all our measuring equipment. Get your affairs in order.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
