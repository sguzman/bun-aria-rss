Iran's CopyKitten is characterized as unsophisticated but nonetheless effective. Mac users awakened by Fruitfly—the FBI is investigating. Adobe tells us to begin saying our goodbyes to Flash. Jonathan Katz from UMD on recent experiments with quantum cryptography. Stewart Kantor from Full Spectrum on protecting utility companies by using private RF (radio frequency) networks. And some notes from Vegas, because what goes on in Vegas doesn't stay there.",
