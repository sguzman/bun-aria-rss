  "description": "Chris Mayer, former banking analyst and newsletter guru, talks about his new position at Bonner & Partners.  This includes launching a new service tied directly to Agora founder Bill Bonner's personal holdings. \nHe then discusses the risks ahead for banking stocks, the positives of using leverage to grow a business, why the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for much longer than expected, and how to play the recent surge in gold and oil stocks. \nChris also shares his two favorite small-cap stocks that have huge upside potential.  These are under-the-radar names you likely won't find on stock screens - or in any Wall Street research reports.",
