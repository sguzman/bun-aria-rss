  "description": "<p>We present a simple and constructive method to find $N$-soliton solutions of\nthe equation suggested by Davydova and Lashkin to describe the dynamics of\nnonlinear ion-cyclotron waves in a plasma and subsequently known (in a more\ngeneral form and as applied to nonlinear optics) as the Fokas-Lenells equation.\nUsing the classical inverse scattering transform approach, we find bright\n$N$-soliton solutions, rational $N$-soliton solutions, and $N$-soliton\nsolutions in the form of a mixture of exponential and rational functions.\nExplicit breather solutions are presented as examples. Unlike purely algebraic\nconstructions of the Hirota or Darboux type, we also give a general expression\nfor arbitrary initial data decaying at infinity, which contains the\ncontribution of the continuous spectrum (radiation).\n</p>",
