  "description": "<p>This week we have Sam “The King of Swing” Evans. He got that name in his home state of Ohio, where his comedy was known to sway municipal elections. He’s crushed every show in every time zone in this country and now you get him here on the podcast! We talk about all things Midwestern as well as why neither Sam nor Sean are very good at weed (Caitlin on the other hand is the LeBron James of being high on a podcast).
