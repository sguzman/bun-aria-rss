This week, we revisit <em>Secrets</em>, a six-part series from 2018. When released, <em>Secrets</em> offered listeners a compelling mix of autobiography, private admissions ranging from espionage to photography fraud, and storytelling traditions from Sweden and the U.S.. Three years later, producers and hosts Mohamed El Abed and Martin Johnson lift the curtain to share the secrets behind <em>Secrets</em>: how they get people to tell private stories of their lives and what’s happened since Mohamed shared this part of his family’s story. </p>\n\n<p><br>\n<em>Behind the Series</em> is hosted, written, and produced by Mark Pagán. Executive producers are Audrey Mardavich and Julie Shapiro. Music from JD Samson and Blue Dot Sessions.  </p>\n\n<p><br>\n<em>Behind the Series</em> is a production of <em>Showcase</em>, from PRX’s Radiotopia.
