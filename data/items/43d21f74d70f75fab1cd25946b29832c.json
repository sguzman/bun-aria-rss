  "description": "Clifford Olson. British Columbia, Canada. 1980-1981. A career criminal, Clifford Olson escalated his crimes from scams and thefts to rape and murder. From November 1980 through July 1981, he abducted, raped, & murdered kids ranging in age from 9 to 18. He would be arrested in August of 1981. In a controversial move, he was offered a 'cash for bodies' deal that would pay 100k dollars into a trust fund for his wife if he gave up information on 11 murders. The families of the victims were disgusted. Olson wasn't merely content with committing his crimes. He also taunted his victims' families. We discuss how Clifford's life began, how he operated, as well as whether or not the deal the Attorney General authorized was a reasonable one. Olson was a serial killer who preceded Robert Pickton and Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo. The Beast of British Columbia may have murdered many more before finally losing his freedom forever.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
