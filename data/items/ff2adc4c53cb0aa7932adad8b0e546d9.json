  "title": "Ep. 741 - The Hallucinatory World Of The Critical Race Theorist",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, an MSNBC host claims that most American school kids are being taught that slavery is okay. This is the kind of hallucinatory world that critical race theory proponents live in. Also, Five Headlines, including a new report about the rash of suicide attempts by adolescent girls during lockdown. And we have video of a female student “coming out as a guy” to her classmates. Plus, a lobster diver claims he was swallowed by a whale. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the NPR article blasting Tom Hanks for making too many movies about white people doing good things. That’s very problematic, as we’ll see. All of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
