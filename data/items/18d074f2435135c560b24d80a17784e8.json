  "description": "<p>2021 is, of course, primarily the year of the Demi Lovato Froyo Controversy, but that's not all. It is also the year of the incredible film Shiva Baby, which stars the two truly magnifique guests on today's episode: Molly Gordon & Rachel Sennott! The four fools discuss making this lil' indie that could, becoming #sisters during the 16-day shoot, falling in love with a collaborator the way these girls did with writer-director Emma Seligman, the glory that is Dianna Agron and gorgeous Gleek culture, periods of life in which you're going through hell and are reduced to doing poppers on the West Side Highway, seeing R-rated movies as a minor, The Bling Ring and Sofia Coppola's underrated filmography, the ups and downs of peeing in cups for medical reasons, bowel vulnerability, and how there are amazing heroes with their hands up our ass. Watch Shiva Baby in select theaters and on demand right NOW!
