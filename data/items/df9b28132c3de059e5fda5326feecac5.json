  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: Sometimes military acronyms get out of hand… And thus, it's time to talk about S-P-O-R-T-S… The Air Forces hip new gameplan to get you on & off the toilet in 5 minutes. </p><p>Round 2: Master Sergeant Matthew Williams, an active-duty Green Beret, received the Medal of Honor on Wednesday for actions during a 2008 Special Forces raid in Afghanistan that resulted in a 7 hour firefight. The story is incredible, you have to hear it.</p><p>Round 3: The Air Force isnt doing themselves any favors by introducing a new ‘R' device on their awards. We'll breakdown what that means and if it was a good idea</p><p>Round 4: The Marine Corps is overhauling their promotion requirements. Salty Lance Corporals will love it. Fast tracking boot ass SNCOs will hate it. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. </p><p>Round 5: Interview with Guy Snodgrass, Secretary Mattis' speech writer who wrote a book about the behind the scenes action! The book is making waves so we invited Guy on to spill.the.tea.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
