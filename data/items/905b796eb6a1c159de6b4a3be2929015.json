    "media:description": "Scientists believe that at some point during human history, the population had been reduced to just  ̶1̶0̶0̶0̶ 10,000 reproductive adults. In the year 70,000 BC humans almost entirely vanished from the face of the planet itself. According to scientists, near extinction has occurred at least three times over the course of humanity's 100,000 year history. The dilution of mankind to so few humans magnifies the impact of all human actions. In Cixin Liu's Remembrance of Earth’s Past Trilogy humanity is tested many times, but there is no single greater near extinction event than the Singer’s dimension strike.\n\nWe’ve discussed the crisis era, the deterrence era, the post deterrence era, In this video will discuss the broadcast era, the era directly following the crew of gravity and blue space’s decision to activate the universal broadcast system, freeing the human race from Trisolaran suppression, while inadvertently revealing the location of the Earth to the inhabitants of the Dark Forest. And The Bunker Era which followed the Return of Tianming, whose brain had been sent off into the vacuum of space centuries earlier.\n\nGet This book: https://amzn.to/3xFTS6P\n\nCHECK OUT MY NEW COMIC: https://www.quinnhoward.net/theliebehindthestar\n\nArt: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16p4UFeE39XCCSxNuRku9b364-EX1nHaUKByefHAFwoA/edit?usp=sharing \n\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLJVGX3j5tY&t=965s\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
