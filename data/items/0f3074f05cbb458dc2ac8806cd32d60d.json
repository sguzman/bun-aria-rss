  "description": "In today’s podcast we follow developments in nation-state hacking, from Hainan to Tehran. Australia’s online census is taken offline—the Bureau of Statistics cries DDoS, but observers aren’t so sure. A new strain of ransomware under development in the underworld skips encryption and goes straight for deletion. Issues with Oracle’s MICROS point-of-sale systems may be the root cause of recent store and hotel breaches. Google says, thanks Check Point, we appreciate it, but most of QuadRooter has already been mitigated (they’re working on the rest of it). Joe Carrigan from Johns Hopkins University warns us about side-loading Android apps, and Leemon Baird from Swirld describes a new trust-based peer to peer software platform. And we note that yesterday was Patch Tuesday.",
