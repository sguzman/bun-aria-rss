  "description": "Amani Willett: Disquiet by Amani Willett, is published by Damiani Factory (2013), with an afterward by Marvin Heiferman, 128 pages. “Disquiet’s cinematic look suggests the palpable spaces in which Willett pondered both the depth and fragility of social and family relationships. And as we become immersed in the work, we imagine or remember ourselves in similar places and situations. While many photographic projects about parents and children have, in recent years, adopted a decidedly cool stance to keep sentimentality at bay, Willett takes a risk by so openly acknowledging our reflex to love, desire to protect, and the vulnerability we face once we do. This is the core subject or his work, without apology.” – Marvin Heiferman, excerpted from the essay, “Beneath the Surface in Disquiet.”\n\nNew York-based photographer Amani Willett weaves intimate family pictures with broader portrayals of American society and its current economic and political instability in his book, Disquiet. Taken between 2010 and 2012, the portraits, landscapes and still lives is his book record the anxieties of starting a family in a time of social unrest, and with the societal challenges posed by the results of the 2016 election, his work takes on a new dimension. Amani draws on his work as a street photographer and visual storyteller to create the images and to construct the books overarching narrative.\n\nAmani’s work has been featured in the books Street Photography Now (Thames and Hudson) and New York: In Color (Abrams). Willett’s pictures have been exhibited both nationally and internationally, including at the Howard Greenberg gallery and his work has been featured in such publications as American Photography, Newsweek and The New York Times. He has given talks about his work at institutions including the International Center of Photography. Willett received his MFA in Photography, Video and Related Media from the School of Visual Arts. Amani currently lives in Brooklyn with his family.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
