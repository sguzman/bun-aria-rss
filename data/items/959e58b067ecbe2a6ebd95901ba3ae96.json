  "description": "<p>Download my new and improved brain detox app here: https://neurocycle.app</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>SHOW DESCRIPTION:&nbsp;In this podcast I talk about the interconnected mind, as well as the divisions of the mind and what each part does. In learning about how to use our mind to manage our mind, it helps to understand the divisions of the mind and how these relate to the dynamic nature of thoughts. There are basically two ways of managing the mind: reactively, which generally ends up being messy, or proactively, which is how we clean up our mental mess. Developing a lifelong plan that helps you constantly manage thoughts and their impact is part of a proactive and strategic approach. You can even think of this as “preventative” medicine for your brain!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to the full video and audio recording add-free, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read the blog and show notes here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/the-difference-between-the-nonconscious-subconscious-conscious-mind</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Caraway: </strong>Visit <a href=\"http://carawayhome.com/DRLEAF\">Carawayhome.com/DRLEAF</a> to take advantage of this limited-time offer for 10% off your next purchase.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Chime: </strong>Get started at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://chime.com/drleaf\">chime.com/drleaf</a>.&nbsp;Banking services and debit card provided by The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.
