  "description": "In Episode #215, I’m joined by Dr Richard Johnson to discuss obesity, fructose, and metabolic disease.\n\n“Fructose” has become something of a fear word in modern diet culture. It is often positioned as the villain, without the in-depth breakdown of where we are sourcing this fructose and the quantities it is consumed in. Similarly, the relationship between health and obesity is hotly contested. Dr Richard Johnson sits down with me today to clarify the scientific relationship between these factors, getting into what the evidence tells us.\n\nIn this episode, we take a broader view at the history of obesity before honing in on the biology and mechanisms. We discuss the ideology of obesity, whether you can be healthy at any size, and the degree of risk related to where you store fat. We also cover a variety of animal studies, sources of fructose, and how the modern food environment shapes our body weight.\n\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nHistory of Obesity (2:30)\n\nBody Fat & Health Span (10:36)\n\nCauses & Behavioral Patterns (23:55)\n\nFructose vs Excess Calories (38:18)\n\nThe Hazda (1:03:50)\n\nFructose & Fruit (1:11:10)\n\nFruitarians (1:22:25)\n\nNot All Carbs are the Same (1:32:30)\n\nPurines & Uric Acid (1:39:55)\n\nCarnivore Diet (1:42:22)\n\nSummarizing Obesity (1:53:56)\n\nOutro (2:02:46)\n\n\nTo connect with Dr Richard Johnson, you can find him on Instagram and Twitter.
