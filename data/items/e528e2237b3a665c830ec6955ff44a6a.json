  "description": "<p>The pandemic has created a huge mental health crisis. We’re all feeling the strain and many of us are admitting, for the first time, that we need help. It’s ok to not be ok. In the last episode of our season, we look at how this pandemic forces us to examine our own mental health, and helps us erase the stigma around asking for help.</p><p>Host Sonari Glinton hears how COVID-19 exposed how broken our mental healthcare system already was. Dr. Curtis Wittman reflects on the mental health crisis from the health care front line. Ghazal Azarbad explains why this was the year she took therapy seriously. Camesha L. Jones is a therapist who is seeing more first-time patients than ever. And Dr. Kristen R. Choi is a Registered Nurse who teaches at UCLA. She’s thinking through how this crisis creates opportunities for new approaches and technologies for managing our own mental health.</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, the following is a list of some mental health resources<strong>: </strong>In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.A.</a> In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/urgent-support/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UK</a>.
