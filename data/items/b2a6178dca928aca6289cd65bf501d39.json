  "title": "Molly Young - 330",
  "description": "<p>March 24, 2012. Carbondale, Illinois. After 3am, Molly Young, 21, was contacted by her ex-boyfriend, Richie Minton, because he needed help. Apparently, he was very drunk. She went to his apartment to help him, but just hours later she was dead. At 9am, Richie's roommate, Wesley Romack, called 911. During the call, Richie took over and told dispatch that Molly had overdosed. He would call again a little later to say that he found his gun and that Molly had actually been shot. While an investigation into Molly's death should have cleared up the question of whether she took her own life or was murdered, this case proved to be somewhat complicated. There was evidence that Molly was severely depressed at times. But Richie was a 911 dispatcher for the Carbondale police department and his father, mother, and aunt also worked for the police. Did he get special treatment and benefit of the doubt due to his law enforcement connections?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
