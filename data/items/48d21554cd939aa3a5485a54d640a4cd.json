  "description": "<p>One of the first functional robots appeared on TV in 1966. That’s earlier than some of us expect. The Unimate’s televised premiere sparked the world’s imagination. It represented a host of possibilities. Those possibilities, however, also implied a coming competition that would last for decades. <br /><br />Dag Spicer tells the story of the Unimate, the first industrial robot—and how little the American public trusted it. But that distrust wasn’t universal. Tomonori Sanada explains how the Unimate was received very differently in Japan. Joe Campbell describes the dangers of working alongside industrial robots. But he’s working to change that with cobots. And Paul Shoup shares how his company, employees, and customers are benefiting from cobots. </p><p>If you want to read up on some of our research on industrial robots, you can check out all our bonus material over at <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-8/robot-as-maker\" target=\"_blank\">redhat.com/commandlineheroes</a>.
