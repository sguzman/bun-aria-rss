  "description": "Joe Biden spoke to a joint session of Congress and outlined an economic plan that exceeds in scope anything we have seen nearly a century. It was specific, doable, and would be paid for simply by restoring taxes to levels they were at past periods of American prosperity and growth. He framed it as not just urgent from a domestic perspective but critical to \"winning the 21st Century\", to our competition with China. Is it realistic? How will it become law? How will the GOP respond? What are the political consequences? (And what are the consequences of this weeks' raid on Rudy Giuliani's Upper East Side of Manhattan apartment?). We discuss with Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and \"Just Security.\" Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
