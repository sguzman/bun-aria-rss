  "description": "<p>San Antonio is one of my favorite cities not only for its amazing history, but it is full of haunts. One of those haunted places is right next to the Alamo and boasts over thirty ghosts. A young man came to this city with big dreams and started the first brewery in Texas, which makes him a top entrepreneur in my book! This man would turn the boarding house where he stayed upon arriving in town into the Menger Hotel, which would host dignitaries and become a town center. Join me as I share the history and hauntings of the Menger Hotel! The Moment in Oddity features Jack Budlong's death and This Month in History features the death of Martha Mansfield.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/11/hgb-ep-315-menger-hotel.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/11/hgb-ep-315-menger-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>The following music is from <a href= \"https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/\">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/</a>:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)<br /> License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Ghost Ride by 5 Alarm Music on Circus Freaks and Gothic Shrieks Album<br /> The Empire Rag by 5 Alarm Music on the Victorian Edwardian Album<br /> Lurking Shadow by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
