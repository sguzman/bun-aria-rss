  "description": "<p>Tig catches up with comedian and veteran improv performer Ben Schwartz, who talks about his process for voicing the superpowered hedgehog in the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies, what it was like growing up as the son of a social worker and teacher, and the kinds of letters he still writes on his prized collection of vintage typewriters. Ben and Tig advise a listener concerned that his neighbor is overfeeding his cat, and a Finnish immigrant worried that he doesn't know how to \"socialize like an American.\"</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy), Indeed (go to Indeed.com/TIG for a $75 sponsored job credit), Shopify (go to Shopify.com/TIG for a free 14-day trial and full access to Shopify’s suite of features), and Netsuite (go to Netsuite.com/TIG for a one-of-a-kind financing offer).</p>\n<p>Need advice?
