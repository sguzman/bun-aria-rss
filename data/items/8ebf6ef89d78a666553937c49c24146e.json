  "description": "<p>On today's ZBT we've got 5 rounds in the magazine ...\n\nRound 1: Easily one of the best parts about joining the military is the friends you met a long the way which leads us to the obvious question: can you identify a friend simply by tasting their piss?\n\nRound 2: Sound the lunk alarm.  A bodybuilder in Florida is set to do his sets in federal prison after reporting he could only squat 10lbs at the VA and then bragging about his 500lb squats at Planet Fitness. \n\nRound 3: update the safety brief: Kate sat down with some puddle hoppers to talk about what the coast guard really does during this national boat safety week.\n\nRound 4: Russian Maverick comes out of retirement in his 60s to fly again. Spoiler Alert: he gets shot down. \n\nRound 5: With memorial day weekend here, it was a fitting time for the names of the bases named after confederate traitors to be replaced with honorable men and women orâ€¦ concepts. \n\nSupport our sponsors!\n\nWhistlePig Whiskey - Get your bottle at https://barstool.link/WhistlePigBSS or at a local retailer.\n\nBetterhelp - Go to https://barstool.link/BetterHelpZBT for 10% off your first month\n\nRoman- Go to https://barstool.link/RomanZBT to get $10 off when you choose a monthly plan.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
