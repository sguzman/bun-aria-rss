  "description": "<p>The last module of Louise’s Find Your Voice course is all about risk and adventure. Alice has just been on an adventure of her own - one that Louise also could have experienced but chose not to. This week, we discuss how important risk and adventure are in our work and in our lives. Can we have one without the other? Do we tend to take risks in some areas of our lives while avoiding them in others? And what is the payoff when we do venture out of our comfort zone?</p>\n<p>We also discuss the emergence of new things in our work. How do we know when a new direction is meaningful as opposed to being an aberration? How do we choose which ideas to follow and which to let go? Do we actually need to decide anything or can we just let the work develop?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Haramara, Mexico <a href=\"https://haramararetreat.com/\">https://haramararetreat.com/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Barns Courtney <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrV90gXmOpA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrV90gXmOpA</a></p>\n<p>Guilt TV show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009qm2/guilt-series-1-episode-1\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009qm2/guilt-series-1-episode-1</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
