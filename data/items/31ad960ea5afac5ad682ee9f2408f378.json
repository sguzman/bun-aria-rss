    "media:description": "China's National Party Congress is a time when Party leaders get together and decide the new lineup of party leadership, set Party goals, and pat each other on the back for staying in power for another 5 years. This Party Congress, the 20th, Chinese leader Xi Jinping set the table with a speech focusing on the accomplishments of the party, security (read risk management), and \"well rounded development\" (read besides the economy). In this episode of China Unscripted, we talk about Party Congress watch parties happening all over China (grab your popcorn, it's a thriller!), the absence of former leader Jiang Zemin, and the code words Xi used to describe the many challenges China's facing. \n\n Is Xi Jinping the Next Mao Zedong?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8G1Jx7v2hI&ab_channel=ChinaUncensored\n\nIf you don't already have one of our limited-time General Hostility t-shirts, get one now at https://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise\n\nYouTube demonetizes our channels, we need your support!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ChinaUncensored\nhttps://chinauncensored.locals.com\n\nWe also accept bitcoin!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin\n\nBuy our merchandise!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise\n\nMake sure to share this video with your friends!\n______________________________\nSubscribe for updates:\nyoutube.com/ChinaUncensored?sub_confirmation=1\n\n______________________________\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaUncensored\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/ChinaUncensored\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/ChinaUncensored\n\nAnd check out the China Unscripted podcast!\nhttps://youtube.com/chinaunscripted\n\n#China\n______________________________\n© All Rights Reserved.",
