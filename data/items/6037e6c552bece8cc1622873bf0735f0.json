  "description": "<p>To start this episode of ‘The Draymond Green Show’, Dray explains why his first game back for the Warriors after his back injury was “a blur” but why it’s so special to him to be able to share the court again with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson after over 1,000 days. Then he hypes up Michigan State’s chances to make a run in the NCAA Tournament as they’re scheduled to face Steph’s Davidson and potentially Duke in the second round. Then Dray welcomes in Joel Embiid to discuss his big contract extension after three injury-plagued seasons, when the NBA became “easy” for him, why he embraced The Process, his social media trolling, the Ben Simmons situation, the MVP race, and much more. </p><p>Produced by: Jackson Safon</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
