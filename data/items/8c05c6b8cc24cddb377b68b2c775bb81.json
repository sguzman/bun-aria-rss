  "description": "<p>We construct Adams operations on the cohomology theory Tmf of topological\nmodular forms; the first such stable operations on this cohomology theory.\nThese Adams operations are then calculated on the Tmf-cohomology of spheres\nusing a combination of descent spectral sequences, motivic homotopy theory, and\nAnderson duality. Applications of these operations are then given, including\nconstructions of connective height 2 analogues of Adams summands and image of J\nspectra.\n</p>",
