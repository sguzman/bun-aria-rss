  "description": "<p>EPISODE 129 - TOM CROSS - Editor</p> <p>Team Deakins enjoys a great conversation with editor, Tom Cross (FIRST MAN, HOSTILES, NO TIME TO DIE). He shares what he learned from working with different editors when he started out and tells us of the different styles of individual editors. We also talk about the fact that it’s not unusual to have multiple editors on films these days and we learn how the work is divided up. He shares his working experiences with director David O’Russell, Scott Cooper, and Damien Chazelle. We discuss working in different formats, creating the style of the film, inserts as the “unsung heroes of movies” and what good editing actually is. And much, much more! A great insight into the world of editing!</p>",
