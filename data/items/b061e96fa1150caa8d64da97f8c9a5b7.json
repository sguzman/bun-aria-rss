  "description": "<p>In the premiere episode, Erika and Whitney ‘show us the money’, as they travel to the American crossroads of business and slavery, Wall Street. They get personal when they unearth the pain and shame of human bondage, hidden at the site of New York City's notorious African slave market and lost burial ground. The duo makes their argument in Black and White, when they crash a congressional hearing for Reparations Bill HR 40 and introduce the Rosa Parks of the reparations movement - Evanston, IL Alderwoman Robin Rue Simmons. This groundbreaking episode concludes with a reimagining of a post-reparations America, that would allow for new possibilities, new leadership, and a new direction. </p><p>For more info about this episode, please visit <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__reparationsbigpayback.com_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=V2clKVfX3Unv0MQjpEpYQkAwU1qIJFWbTKcBXwpKqTA&m=SbN1isfR8w2IH7j46Q03tf8dsMqu-io5gelMKUv6AFg&s=wclXRY2NBc5uE3XFwu2WtQcF5ygEizZW9aFhD8ZKulA&e=\">https://reparationsbigpayback.com</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
