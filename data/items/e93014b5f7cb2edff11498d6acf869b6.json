  "description": "Monica Lennon shot to international political fame just a few months ago thanks to her Period Poverty Bill. Thanks to that legislation, Scotland is the first country in the world to provide free and universal access to period products. Monica tells Matt how she built a political coalition across the party and constitutional divides in Scotland and how she changed the Scottish Government's mind and got them to support her. It's an inspirational tale and shows the difference that individuals can make - even if their party isn't in power. Talking of which, Monica and Matt also discuss the Scottish Labour Leadership election in which Monica is standing and what it means for the future of Labour in Scotland and the UK. Will Scottish Labour break with tradition and conduct a leadership election in a civil and friendly way..?
