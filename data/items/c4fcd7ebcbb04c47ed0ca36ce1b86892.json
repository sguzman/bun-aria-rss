But this week, the Cantina that invented Barolo as we know it today - <a href=\"https://marchesibarolo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Marchesi di Barolo</a> joins. In the mid- to late- 1800s the Marchesi di Barolo focused on the production of dry, ageworthy, complex Nebbiolo was created from a wine that Thomas Jeffereson described as:<br /> <em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><br /></span></em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“As silky as Madeira, as astringent as Bordeaux and as brisk as Champagne”</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Thankfully for those of us who love Barolo, the Marchesi had a different style in mind and created the wine as we know it today.</p> <p> </p> <p>The current owners, the Abbona family, purchased <a href= \"https://marchesibarolo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Marchesi di Barolo</a> and today the 6th generation is taking over the winery. Valentina Abbona joins the show to talk about the history of Barolo as a wine, and her family’s long history in owning this storied place and making bottles that remain top examples of the wine created here.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the notes:</p> <ul> <li>Valentina tells us about what it was like in Barolo in the late 1700s and early 1800s from a wine and lifestyle perspective – the polyculture that existed, and the simple, country lifestyle people led.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Marchese Carlo Tancredi Falletti and his wife, Juliette, who was of French origin, figured out how to make Barolo a dry wine, consistently. Previously, as it sat in barrels that didn’t have temperature control or were placed outdoors, the fermentation did not complete before the weather got cold. The yeast froze and sugar stayed in the wine. When the juice re-commenced fermentation, carbon dioxide stayed in the wine – thus why Thomas Jefferson compared it to Champagne.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/giulia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"362\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.wimubarolo.it\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Marquesa di Barolo - Giulia di Barolo, photo from the Wine Museum of Barolo</a></em></span></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We learn about how the Marchesa Giulia (who changed her name from Juliette to the Italian version of the name), specifically, found interest in the Nebbiolo vine and how she realized her vision for what Nebbiolo could be/the wines it could make of dry wines (using her knowledge of French wines and connections to people who could help).</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We discuss how the Marchesa used her contacts to the royal courts of Europe (Piedmont was under the Kingdom of Savoy of France at the time) to popularize the wine, even sending hundreds of barrels to the king in Torino to ensure he could drink the wine daily.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We then turn to Valentina’s family, the Abbonas, who have been making esteemed wine in Barolo since the late-1800s as well.
