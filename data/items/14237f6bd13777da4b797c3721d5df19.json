  "description": "<p>“Hi Wes, Love the show I listen every night before bed and while I’m driving. I’ve had multiple weird encounters with things in the woods and paranormal activity. I’m 41 and grew up in Nova Scotia Canada and also lived in South Carolina and North Carolina.</p> <p>Anyway my first encounter was when I was about 14. (1992) It was the beginning summer and a very dark night. My brother and his friends had a campfire in the field past our backyard. There are a ton of deer and coyotes. Anyway they left in a car to go to town and my mom sent me down there to clean up and get the left over food and condiments. Also to make sure the fire was out. I grew up in the woods and I wasn’t scared of anything until that night. I was picking up after my brother and friends and I heard a growling noise from the woods. It was so loud I felt it in my chest and body. I was thinking bear at the time. Which I’ve never seen around our yard or woods. I froze and looked into the woods it was pitch black. I started to run to the house (dropped everything) ran into the field behind my house and I could feel this thing chasing me. It felt big and on two feet running after me like a person. It growled and heavy breath the whole time behind me. I was a fast kid but it could have gotten me if it wanted. It stopped chasing me as soon as I reach the garage light.</p> <p>I ran into the house in a panic and my mom asked what was wrong I said something was out there. She was going to tell my dad I told her no because he would have went out with a gun and I knew he’d be in trouble. My brother and his friends Were all gone. I made sure it wasn’t them playing a trick on me. I didn’t think of a Sasquatch until many years later when I heard there here and I heard other people’s encounters. I didn’t believe In Bigfoot back then. I’ll add I had a nightmare that very night that a lot wolves came into my house and we’re going around looking for me. Woke up in a sweat and panic. The next day my dad said the food was gone and everything Else by the campfire was spread all over the place in a mess. Anyway I’d love to tell you my other encounters if your interested. I’ve kept them to myself for years. If you look up Nova Scotia it’s very paranormal here.”</p> <p>Spoke to witness and he opened up about seeing this werewolf walking on two legs coming out of the cemetery by his home, unfortunately his father was laid to rest there. He said he had never told anyone this before but looking back he said he felt like that creature chased him home a year before. He said he never understood why his nightmares consisted of wolves chasing him and breaking into his home.
