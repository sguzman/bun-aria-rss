  "description": "<p>This is going to be an ongoing article series about various aspects of Machine Learning. In the first post of the series I&#8217;m going to explain why I decided to learn and use R, and why it is probably the best statistical software for Machine Learning at this time. R vs. popular programming languages like Java Implementing Machine Learning algorithms is not an easy task because it requires a deep understanding of the inner workings of the algorithm. Furthermore, it can make a big difference how the function of a Machine Learning algorithm is implemented in detail because the application of advanced…</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://florianhartl.com/thoughts-on-machine-learning-the-statistical-software-r.html\">Thoughts on Machine Learning &#8211; the statistical software R</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://florianhartl.com\">Florian Hartl</a>.</p>\n",
