But for those few off-grid souls who somehow avoided the last five Olympiads, here's but a taste of what this week's guest has accomplished:</p><br><p>* she has competed in the last five consecutive Olympiads;</p><p>* she is a 3-time Olympic Gold Medalist & 1-time Olympic Bronze medalist in beach volleyball (2016);</p><p>* along with teammate Misty May-Treanor, she has been named&nbsp;the greatest beach volleyball team of all time;</p><p>* during their 11-year run together, Walsh Jennings & May-Treanor won 21 consecutive Olympic matches and only lost one set</p><br><p>This is a unique and extraordinary exploration of the habits, practices and mindset behind one of the greatest athletes on the planet.</p><p>It’s a conversation about the mentality required to be the world's best. It's an exchange about the crucial role effective communication plays in both sport and relationships. And it's about the power and responsibility of being a positive role model.</p><p>But ultimately, this is a conversation about pursuing what you love, loving what you pursue, and taking a stand for what you believe in.</p><p>I cannot overstate my respect for Kerri, her athletic achievements, and how this delightful, spirited, beautiful and tenacious human lives her life on a daily basis. I adore this conversation and am thrilled to share it with you today.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange!</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p><br></p><p>Listen & Subscribe on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/app/playmusic?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Ik2a22yi44ypcky7h6vnjvran4e?t%3DThe_Rich_Roll_Podcast\" target=\"_blank\">GooglePlay</a></p><p>Spots are now available for&nbsp;Plantpower Austraila, Feb. 20-27, 2017.
