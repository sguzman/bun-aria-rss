Alongside <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> and <i>Spelunky</i>, it was part of a holy trinity of games that popularized the roguelite genre in the early '10s.</p>\n<p>But before it was a hit, <i>FTL </i>was just a humble idea shared by Matthew Davis and Justin Ma, two developers working at 2K’s Shanghai office. The studio wasn’t a bad place to work, by their accounts, but they just weren’t making the kinds of games they were interested in. So Davis and Ma departed the big-budget firm and started a hobby project to keep them busy while they were looking for new jobs.</p>\n<p>“The original intention, at least from my perspective, was that [<i>FTL</i>] was only intended as a hobby project or a prototype,” Davis tells Ars. “It was something in between jobs to build up a resume that we could use to get a job at a studio working on projects that we were more excited about. But we stumbled into something that became a lot bigger than what we set out to do.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895421#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895421&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"
