On today’s podcast with Phil Dobbie, Steve Keen explains how most miss the dynamic aspects of Phillips’ observations – it’s the speed of change that counts, not a snapshot of employment levels at any particular time. Her also considered the changes in the price of inputs. On that basis, with unemployment rapidly falling and the price of imports rapidly rising, the Phillip’s curve has never been more relevant.
