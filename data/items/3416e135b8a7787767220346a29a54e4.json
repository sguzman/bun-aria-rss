Rooted in the ancient yogic tradition of pranayama and canonized for a modern audience as <a href=\"https://www.wimhofmethod.com/elearning/fundamentals\" target=\"_blank\">The Wim Hof Method,</a>&nbsp;Wim asserts that through such breath techniques he can turn up his internal thermostat and activate his sympathetic nervous system — abilities conventionally believed beyond conscious control.</p><br><p>Understanding the far-fetched nature of his claims, Wim put his contentions to the test. Among his twenty world-record setting feats of otherworldly insanity, Wim has:</p><br><p>* scaled above&nbsp;death zone&nbsp;altitude (22,000 ft) on Mount Everest&nbsp;shirtless adorned in nothing but shorts;</p><p>* completed a full marathon above the polar circle in Finland barefoot&nbsp;and&nbsp;again shirtless and in shorts;</p><p>* summited Kilimanjaro in less than 2 days, again in nothing but shorts;</p><p>* swam a world record 66 meters under a meter of ice above the polar circle;</p><p>* sat in an ice bath for almost two hours straight;</p><p>* ran a full marathon in the Namib Desert without water; and</p><p>* remained asymptomatic after&nbsp;a poisonous E. coli endotoxin injection certain to make any human being very ill</p><br><p>All of this is seemingly insane. But Wim declares his feats not only replicable but entirely teachable — a curriculum that holds the potential to unlock a battery of human superpowers that extend well beyond extreme temperature tolerance to metabolic ‘reptilian brain' functions previously thought beyond conscious manipulation.</p><br><p>Picking up where we left off in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll231\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 231,</a> this conversation focuses less on Wim's feats of incredulity and more on the nature of consciousness and the primacy of its elevation. We discuss our current crisis of awareness. The importance of challenging long-held, status quo beliefs. And the warrior's path required to live fully actualized.</p><p>Wild, calm, powerful and gentle all at the same time, Wim is undoubtedly one of the most compelling and unique people I have ever met — a man who will shock you out of your comfort zone and&nbsp;call into question the countless unnecessary limits we impose upon ourselves daily.</p><p>This journey begins with the breath. It extends to service, compassion, and gratitude. And it culminates in love.</p><p>Disclaimer: Never practice breathing exercises before/during any activities where a loss of consciousness may prove life threatening. The breathing methods discussed may have a profound effect and should be practiced exactly as explained and always in a safe environment. Wim strongly advises you to gradually build up your exposure to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If not practiced responsibly, you risk hypothermia or worse.
