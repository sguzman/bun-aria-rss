  "description": "<div>Just what exactly is the death gift, and is it something one would want or run from?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Here is a preview of the story.<br>\n“Anyway, she passed away from a heart attack and an aneurysm. They did not know which triggered which, the doctors told my family they happened at the same time. They even drug tested her and found nothing. That was not the first death my great grandmother knew about or the last. My mother was 14 when she watches her sister pass before her. I was born a year later. I had nightmares from the time I was born till about 7 or 8 years old just about every night. When I was still a newborn, my family took me to a doctor to see why I would always cry in my sleep. The doctors told them I was fine. Just have nightmares, cause my mom had nightmares the whole time she was pregnant with me. Mom said she had nightmares less after giving birth. I do not know how true or untrue this is. But even grandma would tell me she slept better. The death gift for some reason skipped grandma. Mom did not have it either.”<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>To hear more real ghost stories, become a supporter of our show and get every episode, including our weekly bonus episodes at <a href=\"http://www.ghostpodcast.com\">http://www.ghostpodcast.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories\">http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Follow Tony:<br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski\">HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski</a><br>\nTikToc: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski\">https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski\">https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
