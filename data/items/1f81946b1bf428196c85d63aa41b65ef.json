  "description": "<p>The essence of Queendom joins Las Cultch today and her name is Vanessa Bayer, alright?! Sure, there are others whom possess Queendom, such as Kim K. and Adele, but neither of them canonically f*cked both Ryan Gosling and Kristen Stewart in SNL sketches. The only real star in the world joins Matt and Bowen to talk SNL shop (read: share what kind of bagels she ordered on Sundays after a show), discuss how exactly her mouth works, and confess to listening to \"Suddenly I See\" by KT Tunstall as a pump-up song before auditions. All this, feet, Vanessa's new show I Love This For You coming to Showtime next year, the iconic \"What A Feeling\" sequence from the film Flashdance, sibling culture, and a journey to find a good Meredith Marks impression. More intimacy now! The podcast has received critical acclaim. This ep? Is why.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
