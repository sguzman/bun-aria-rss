  "title": "PMS 2.0 160 - BIG TRUSS, Mark Ingram & Miles Sanders Join Us Live From The Super Bowl... And A Life Perspective Chat",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat gives a deep introspective monologue on whether or not professional athletes at the top of their craft will start retiring more when considering their careers given the tragic death of Kobe Bryant, and why it's important to always remember which things are most important in people's lives. Also joining the show live from Radio Row at the Super Bowl is 2009 National Champion and Heisman Trophy Winner, 3x Pro Bowler, and current Running Back for the Baltimore Ravens, Mark Ingram. Mark gives his thoughts on the Baltimore Ravens' season this year, what that locker room is like, why he expects their offense to have even more success next year despite defense's planning new ways to stop them, how he's managed to find success everywhere he has gone, his thoughts on Drew Brees potentially retiring, and Mark gives his prediction for Super Bowl LIV (5:38-18:09). Pat and the boys also discuss Gronk's recent comments about how he thinks Tom Brady should test the free agency waters, and Boston Connor is left in the lurch trying to deal with the fallout. Pat also explains why he thinks Patrick Mahomes is a lock for Super Bowl MVP if the Chiefs win, and why he's tired of hearing all the Jimmy G slander. Later, newly christened member of the All-Rookie team, and nominee for Rookie of the Year, former Penn State Nittany Lion and current Philadelphia Eagles Running Back, Miles Sanders joins the show from Radio Row. He chats about what it was like expecting to be apart of a running back by committee at Penn State with Saquon Barkley, and whether he'd go back and change things now, what Carson Wentz leadership style is like and what some common misconceptions the public may have about him are, chats about his relationship with his mother, whether or not he prepared a speech if he wins Rookie of the Year, and gives at insight into what offseason plans are now that he has time off for perhaps the first time in his life (29:48-39:08). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
