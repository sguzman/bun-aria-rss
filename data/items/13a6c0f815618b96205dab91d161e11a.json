  "description": "<p>A simple gripper can solve more complex manipulation tasks if it can utilize\nthe external environment such as pushing the object against the table or a\nvertical wall, known as \"Extrinsic Dexterity.\" Previous work in extrinsic\ndexterity usually has careful assumptions about contacts which impose\nrestrictions on robot design, robot motions, and the variations of the physical\nparameters. In this work, we develop a system based on reinforcement learning\n(RL) to address these limitations. We study the task of \"Occluded Grasping\"\nwhich aims to grasp the object in configurations that are initially occluded;\nthe robot needs to move the object into a configuration from which these grasps\ncan be achieved. We present a system with model-free RL that successfully\nachieves this task using a simple gripper with extrinsic dexterity. The policy\nlearns emergent behaviors of pushing the object against the wall to rotate and\nthen grasp it without additional reward terms on extrinsic dexterity. We\ndiscuss important components of the system including the design of the RL\nproblem, multi-grasp training and selection, and policy generalization with\nautomatic curriculum. Most importantly, the policy trained in simulation is\nzero-shot transferred to a physical robot. It demonstrates dynamic and\ncontact-rich motions with a simple gripper that generalizes across objects with\nvarious size, density, surface friction, and shape with a 78% success rate.\nVideos can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/grasp-ungraspable/.\n</p>",
