  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’re exploring a great work of American literature whose plot rides on a most-peculiar, but beloved pastime of rural America – coonhunting. We’re diving deep into the book “Where the Red Fern Grows” written by Woodrow Wilson Rawls. How did this unlikely author, a one-hit wonder some might say, with such a mysterious past make it into the ranks of the American literary giants? We’ll hear from Professor Sean Teuton of the University of Arkansas as we search out the national impact of the book. We’ll talk with Stewart Peterson who starred in the original 1974 movie produced by Walt Disney studios who actually met Wilson Rawls, and we’ll cut some hounds loose on a starry Ozark night with a man who's been devoted to Redbone hounds his whole life, Ronnie Smith of Northwest Arkansas. The ride is guaranteed to be wild as we search out when coonhunting did a 360-slam-dunk on mainstream culture and they loved it.
