  "description": "<p>Since we just put out the \"<a href=\"AlieWard.com/ologies/handsondeck\">All (Washed) Hands on Deck</a>\" episode on Sunday, we figured a happy Springtime encore about fluttery, colorful cuties was in order -- with a few new updates and asides. Because ... Butterflies are gross. Yes they are delightful and beautiful and part of any idyllic picnic-scape but lepidopterologist, TV host and jungle explorer Phil Torres is here to gossip about how shamelessly disgusting our favorite bugs actually are. Learn their secrets, their mating habits, how they turn themselves into goo and then into another creature, what moth is the most goth, what flowers to plant to attract them, the scariest thing about the jungle and what it feels like to help discover new species. Also butterflies get sloppy drunk and we talk all about it.</p>\n<p>For more info, see:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phil-torres.com/\">Phil-Torres.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow Phil on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Phil_Torres\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/Phil_Torres\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@philtorresnature\">TikTok</a></p>\n<p>More info on the COVID-19 volunteer scientist database: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/COVID19SciVolunteers\">https://tinyurl.com/COVID19SciVolunteers</a> </p>\n<p>Sponsor links: <a href=\"hellofresh.com/ologies10\">hellofresh.com/ologies10</a>; <a href=\"linkedin.com/ologies\">linkedin.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p>Donations went to <a href=\"http://www.xerces.org/\">Xerces.org</a> & <a href=\"http://mealsonwheelsamerica.org\">MealsonWheelsAmerica.org</a></p>\n<p>Follow Phil's inspiration, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/AndyBugGuy\">@AndyBugGuy</a>, on Twitter</p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p>\n<p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alieward\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/alieward\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\">alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Sound editing by <a href=\"http://jarrettsleeper.com\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of MindJam Media & <a href=\"http://www.stevenraymorris.com/\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p>\n<p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p>\n<p>More links at <a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/ologies/lepidopterologyencore\">www.alieward.com/ologies/lepidopterologyencore</a></p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
