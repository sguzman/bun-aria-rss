  "title": "Titling, Finishing and Framing - How to Present your Art [95]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we answer listener questions from Maroulla, Caroline, Helen and Jane, who all wanted to know about finishing and presenting work. We start with titles... how important are they? Is it OK to go with 'untitled' or can a creative title enhance the impact of a painting? And how do we come up with titles for our own work? We also share our secrets for sealing and varnishing work, cover a variety of framing options, and finally discuss our approach to packaging (including where we think we can improve). As usual, we also catch up with what we've both been up to (spoiler alert - lots of painting this week!) and enjoy a special letter about creativity written by the author Kurt Vonnegut to a class of schoolchildren.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mortenlassen.com/\"><u>Morten Lassen contemporary painter</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rebeccahossack.com/\"><u>Rebecca Hossack Gallery</u></a></p>\n<p><strong>Join us</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Wait List <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elrf2h/metadata/edit\">https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Art Tribe sign-up page <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elrf2h/metadata/edit\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
