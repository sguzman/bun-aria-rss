It features a South Asian nurse, who is proud to showcase the many ways that nursing has a positive impact every day, on patients and on himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pratap Perseeddoss, a nurse at Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, and now star of the new ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign said: “It’s a very rewarding role. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I enjoy interacting with patients and listening to any concerns or feedback they might have &#8211; this is absolutely crucial to ensuring you can provide the best possible care.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing his nursing degree at London South Bank University, Pratap is now a Nurse Consultant. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-45700\" width=\"726\" height=\"968\" srcset=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22-696x928.jpg 696w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22-315x420.jpg 315w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pratap-Perseeddoss_22.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /><figcaption>Nurse Consultant <em>Pratap Perseeddoss</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates for university nursing courses have access to a support system to guide them step by step through the application process, alongside tailored support. Annual payments of at least £5,000 are also available to help nursing students with their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A career in nursing is one of the most dynamic and rewarding roles the NHS has to offer,” said Pratap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With ongoing training and endless opportunities to progress, I am sure a career in nursing will transform your life, as it has done mine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Being in a workplace that allows you to grow and bring your whole authentic self to work everyday is what enables me to deliver the best possible healthcare.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduating, nursing is the UK’s most employable profession with 94% of graduates gaining employment within the first six months of leaving university. Once qualified, there are many opportunities to further develop through additional training or by focusing on specific areas, such as trauma, orthopaedics or neonatal care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help those who are unsure of what to specialise in, the ‘We Are The NHS’ campaign has also launched a quiz to raise awareness of the plethora of nursing roles available and to help people find out which nursing role they would be best suited to which is available <a href=\"https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/we-are-the-nhs/nursing-careers/quiz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign aims to increase applications for both degree courses and direct entry jobs, seeking to build upon the existing 1.2 million-strong workforce and to shine a light on the incredible work they do in multicultural adverts across TV, cinemas, radio and billboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Navina Evans, recently appointed Chief Workforce Officer at NHSE, said: “I am proud to support this new recruitment campaign. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"847\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-847x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-45701\" srcset=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-847x1024.jpg 847w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-768x928.jpg 768w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-696x841.jpg 696w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22-348x420.jpg 348w, https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dr-Navina-Evans_22.jpg 993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" /><figcaption>Dr Navina Evans says nurses are the backbone of the NHS</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The NHS’s greatest strength is in the diversity of our people.
