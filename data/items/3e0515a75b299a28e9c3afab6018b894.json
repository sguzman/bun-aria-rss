  "description": "Today I will be reviewing The Whistler by John Grisham. Grisham well-renowned for his long line of books in the thriller genre continues this theme with The Whistler. The book follows an investigator Lacy as she tries to uncover widespread corruption in the judicial system. What she finds is a never-ending trail of corruption, deceit, murder and money laundering. As she investigates further she finds the level of corruption to be greater than first anticipated, causing the relationships around her to suffer as a result. The author captured my imagination throughout the story as I constantly tried to predict how the story would unfold. The use of multiple characters and locations kept the narrative exciting, whilst not distracting from the story. That being said, I felt that the story as a whole was a little too predictable, I was waiting for a crescendo moment for the narrative to take a 90 degree turn but I was sadly disappointed. A solid book, but I was expecting a bit more. I rate it three stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
