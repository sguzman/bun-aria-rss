  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Conservatives in Washington D.C. are silent because they are not sticking up for their constituents. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has backtracked and is now offering support for states facing bankruptcy. This disincentivizes opening the economy and will keeping Americans shuttered in their homes so that politicians at the state level can squeeze more and more out of the federal government. For example, states like New York had a $6.1 trillion hole in their budget, well before the pandemic. This is taxation without representation; the federal government is funneling money to bailout select states. Later, social media is considering even more censorship. Also, major TV networks are lobbying each other to stop running live coverage of the White House coronavirus briefings. Afterward, intelligence officials clarify that there was no such intelligence product that existed in November of 2019 related to China's concealment of the cororanvirus outbreak. However, this didn't stop the Washington Post from reporting it without a single named source.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
