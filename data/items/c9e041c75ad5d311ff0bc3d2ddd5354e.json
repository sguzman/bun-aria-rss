  "description": "<p>The incarnation— the event of God becoming fully human in Jesus Christ— is the paradigm-shattering event of human history. In the incarnation, the ideal became real, the absolute became particular, and the invisible became visible. If we can grasp this doctrine, it has enormous implications for our lives. This sermon will cover 1) What the incarnation is; 2) What it does in your life; 3) Why it can do this. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 19, 2010. Series: To Know the Living God – The God Who Can Be Known. Scripture: Hebrews 2:5-18.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
