  "description": "<p>After studying geology and gaining a BS, an MS and nearly a JD, <a href=\"http://yobetts.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Richard Betts</a> discovered a love of wine. He served as the wine director at The Little Nell in Aspen from 2000 to 2008, and while there, in all his spare time, in 2003, Richard was the 9th person to ever pass the Court of Master Sommeliers’ Masters Exam on the first attempt.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Betts.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"302\" /></p> <p>Richard co-founded the wine labels Betts & Scholl in 2003 and Scarpetta in 2006 and founded Sombra Mezcal in 2006.
