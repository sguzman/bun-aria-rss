  "description": "Moms, you deserve space for yourself. If this sounds like a revolutionary concept… that’s because it is! In a too-busy world that constantly questions your good enough-ness, this week’s episode delivers a powerful message: You don’t have to do it all. Dr. Becky talks with Eve Rodsky, best-selling author of Fair Play and Find Your Unicorn Space, about how rebalancing domestic labor can change your relationship to yourself, your family, and society. As they dive deep into the gender gap of chores and childcare, the two unpack so many important topics: from reducing resentment to managing mom guilt to reframing how we spend our time. You’ll end this episode with practical strategies to shift the dynamics in your home and discover what Eve calls your “unicorn space”—time to explore what lights you up outside of your identities as mom, partner, or professional. Let’s reimagine the cultural norms around caregiving, starting in our own homes.<p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
