  "description": "<p>The biblical word for peace, shalom, doesn’t just mean the absence of hostilities; it means the presence of justice. The word justice is closely connected with the word shalom in the Bible, and the book of the prophet Amos is all about that theme, justice. In this sermon, we will see: 1) The meaning of justice; 2) The sign of justice; and 3) The promise of justice.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on December 9, 2007. Series: Jesus of the Prophets. Scripture: Amos 8:4-10; 9:7-15.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
