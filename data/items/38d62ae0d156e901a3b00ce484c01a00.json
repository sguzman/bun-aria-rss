  "description": "Today I will be reviewing 'The Courage to Be Disliked' by Ichiro Kishimi. The courage to take the burden of being disliked is difficult which is why many people refrain from it. This book explores through dialogue between a philosopher and student the trials of discovering your value. They discuss over many conversations the power of perception and interpretation of circumstances based mainly on the philosophy of Alfred Adler or Adlerian psychology. I will admit that this book is different, but I can't define whether good or bad. As it is translated from Japanese the flow of conversation is different, and it impacts the reader. What I like about it is how the book is structured like a conversation, it involves the reader more. However, if you want to know more about Adlerian psychology, it may be best to read a book written by him rather than this commentary. That being said this book is helpful as an introduction to his concepts. An interesting read.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
