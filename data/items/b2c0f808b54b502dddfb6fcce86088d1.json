  "title": "Bonus 25 - Werewolves: Howl at the Moon!",
  "description": "<p>Werewolves! Awhoooooooo! Shape-shifting creatures of the night with unusual speed, otherworldly strength, lightning fast reflexes, and incredibly heightened senses. Monsters who can be a gentle, thoughtful human being one moment and a feral, wild bloodthirsty beast the next. Sometimes a dark creature associated with vampires and witches, and sometimes and innocent victim of a terrible curse doomed to heed the call of the moon and feast on human flesh, the werewolf has taken many forms throughout the years. Where do these tales come from? We dig into werewolf folklore and share some intense tales of werewolf trials and more today, on a monstrous Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by <strong>Leesa! </strong>We love Leesa!<strong> Get $160 off when you go to </strong><a href=\"http://leesa.com/timesuck\"><strong>Leesa.com/timesuck</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
