In today's conversation, we explore not only Humble the Poet's journey from teaching to music, rap, video and spoken word, but also how his experience as the child of immigrants, being raised in the Sikh tradition and, in his words, not seeing anyone else in the music world who looked like him, shaped his lens on possibility, his stories and voice and values.</p><p>In addition to his music, Humble also has a great new book out that distills 101 short and sweet insights for better living called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ytpb0B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UNLEARN</a> (https://amzn.to/2Ytpb0B). And as with all of our Music in May episodes, Humble shares a musical offering at the end, this time in the form of a spoken word piece, so you want to be sure stick around for the whole conversation.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
