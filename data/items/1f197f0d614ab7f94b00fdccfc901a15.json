  "description": "We've missed you during the hiatus, thirst-buckets! Thankfully we had OUR VERY FIRST LIVE SHOW before the withdrawal symptoms began to hit really hard. Recorded on Monday February 12th in New York, we discussed Black Panther, supervillain, um,... prowess, underrated romcoms, K-dramas, and even indulged in some public communal swooning. We had lovely guests – our old pal Krutika Mallikarjuna and new kid on the (thirst) block, E. Alex Jung – and we also had some adult goodies to give away thanks to our German-American pals at Fun Factory. We did something a little bit different with our drabbles in Fanfic Wars, and last but not least, we laughed a lot. So if you didn't make it, grab a glass of something chilled and settle in. AND STAY TUNED because we'll be back in March with regular episodes and so much thirsting *Cardi B. tongue*.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
