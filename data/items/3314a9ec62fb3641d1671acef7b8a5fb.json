  "description": "<p>Love is Always Loving Us (2016-04-20) - This talk draws on Christian mystic Henri Nouwen’s book <em>Return of the Prodigal Son</em>. We explore the primary ways we leave home - leave presence, connection, beingness - and the pathways of deep attention and love that enable our return. The emphasis is on “letting in love” as a key and often missing element in practices that heal and free our hearts. Through the talk there are several reflections that lead to receiving the blessings of love and discovering that we are the source of that loving.</p>",
