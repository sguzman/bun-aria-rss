  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. The highest law in the United States is the Constitution and all who serve in the government must adhere to our laws otherwise they are violating these laws. It's no surprise that the radical leftists in charge of Congress: Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and Maxine Waters come from leftwing metropolitan areas with sanctuary cities that violate federal immigration through nullification. These radicals are abusing their power by impeaching a President without a single eye-witness that can attest to President Trump committing treason, high crimes, or misdemeanors. Then, the media and Washington D.C. are taking a beating from the American people, because they take the public for granted. Now the phony moderate Democrats say they must vote for impeachment. Since the Democrats won control of the house, they've been talking about impeachment. They've destroyed the impeachment process and have routinized it, as it’s now no longer a solemn process. The only way to stop this is to impeach the next Democrat president. We hope you have a very happy new year!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
