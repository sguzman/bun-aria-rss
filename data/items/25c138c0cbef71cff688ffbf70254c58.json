  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We were going to do a deep dive this week, but then we read the book and decided that was a hard pass! So, we do a very shallow dive and then get to the good stuff this week…talking about Royal romances! We talk about the strange fascination the world has with royalty, about the way fake countries hit the spot, and about why it’s so rare to see a gender-swapped Cinderella story. Sarah also offers a peek at her newest research project, preliminarily titled—<em>Alexbastian: Is Name, In Fact Destiny?</em>  It’s better than a deep dive, we promise.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fated Mates Live, in person is happening — if you have tickets to the live show in Alexandria, VA on July 30th — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FatedMates/status/1537110494292676610\">let us know on our Twitter thread</a> (and find friends!).
