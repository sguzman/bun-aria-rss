  "description": "<p>We embark on a tour that takes us through four closely related topics: the\ndual concepts of independence and spanning in finite abelian groups and the\nanalogous dual concepts of designs and distance sets on spheres. We review some\nof the main known results in each area, mention several open questions, and\ndiscuss some connections among these four interesting topics.\n</p>",
