    "media:description": "In a special tribute to pioneering palaeontologist Mary Anning, take a fossil hunting walk with Liv Free, finding ammonites, devil's toenails and icthyosaur remains.\n\nExcerpt from 'Queen Mab' by Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nMary Anning (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847[2]) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and palaeontologist who became known around the world for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.\n\nVisit https://www.maryanningrocks.co.uk/ to support a campaign to build a statue to honour Mary Anning.\n\nThis video, like all Crow’s Eye Productions’ works, is protected by copyright under the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and internationally under the Berne Copyright Convention.
