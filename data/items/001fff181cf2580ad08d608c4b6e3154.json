  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“I'm so grateful to be part of the world of books. And that's what makes me work so hard on them because it's possibly the greatest privilege I've been afforded.” Nick Offerman’s fifth book, <em>Where the Deer and the Antelope Play</em>, is charming, earnest <em>and</em> a little pointed, and, of course, very funny. It opens with Nick gallivanting in Glacier National Park with pals George Saunders and Jeff Tweedy, sees him repairing a stone wall and buying a livestock with his buddy James Rebanks, and roadtripping with his wife, Megan Mullally and her excellent audiobook recommendations. Nick joins us on the show to talk about how the fun’s really an excuse to ask big questions about our place in the wider world, offer some thoughts on where we need to go and some nuanced ideas for how we might get there, and more. Featured titles: Where the Deer and the Antelope Play by Nick Offerman, Sharks in the Time of Saviors by Kawaii Strong Washburn and Leaving Isn’t the Hardest Thing by Lauren Hough. Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span></p>",
