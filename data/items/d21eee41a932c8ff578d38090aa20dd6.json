  "description": "<p>r/Choosingbeggars In today's episode, we've got a parent looking for a nanny to hire. Wait, did I say \"hire?\" What I really &nbsp;mean is \"enslave!\" This choosing beggar expects her nanny to work for free, yet somehow she thinks that this will be a tempting offer because the nanny will get to live in her house. The funny thing is that the choosing beggar still expects her nanny to pay for food and gas, but how on earth is she supposed to buy those things when she's working full-time at a job that pays $0?</p>\n",
