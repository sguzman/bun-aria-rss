  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about online reactions and hacks in response to the Charlottesville rioting and homicide. Operation #LeakTheAnalyst releases another, smaller, set of documents. The ShadowBrokers get some poor customer reviews for their Exploit-of-the-Month Club.

Oxford researchers describe Android library collusion attacks. Robert M. Lee from Dragos on recent incursions into the Irish and UK power grids. And fellow security researchers can't believe Marcus Hutchins would wittingly do what the Feds accuse him of.\n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors.\n If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper.\n Your patient data depends on incident response plans.
