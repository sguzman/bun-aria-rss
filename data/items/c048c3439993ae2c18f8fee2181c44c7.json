  "description": "Godwin isn't gonna stand for Jay making fun of his weight, and he decides to let him know exactly how much he's lost and how well he's doing. Si loves everything about the state of Mississippi, especially the Homes of Hope for Children. He recounts the time a prank was played on him at the Longleaf Plantation ... and how it took him a second to realize it. And why doesn't he like chicken pot pie? Stone knows exactly where Willie learned not to sit still and elaborates on all the customization he's had to do for Si's childproof, Si-proof, Willie-proof deer stand. Si and Jay take turns making fun of Willie for how he acts in the blinds. Jay wonders why people choose parking spots close to the door, and John-David explains the science of why it doesn't matter. \n\nhttps://OmegaXL.com/DUCK — Buy one bottle and get the second bottle FREE!\n\nhttps://tommyjohn.com/duck — Shop Tommy John’s Before Black Friday Sale going on RIGHT NOW and get 25% off EVERYTHING!\n\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.
