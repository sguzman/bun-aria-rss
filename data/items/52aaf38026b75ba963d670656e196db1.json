  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, in breaking news, it's been revealed that the whistleblower had a previous relationship with Joe Biden in the White House and worked with him as Vice president.  The Constitution is clear that solely the House of Representatives has authority over impeachment. The intent here is to avoid a 'mob rule' attack on the President. Moreover, the Constitution does not say that the president must acquiesce to a skeptical impeachment process that prevents the President from his duty to defend the office of the Presidency.  Denying any sitting President to face their accuser, or having the ability to have counsel and call witnesses is a process that is antithetical to justice, and endangers the office. Railroading this President potentially jeopardizes all future presidents and the oath and duty to defend the office of the Presidency and the Constitution rest on the shoulders of the President of the United States.  Then, 'We The People' are entitled to know why a select few people in Congress want to remove the president when there's clearly no quid pro quo and the transcript exonerates Trump — this is a complete set-up by the democrats.  Later, China's communist leaders have put pressure on American companies that have vocally supported Hong Kong. The Chinese have ripped down NBA signage, and have forced companies to discontinue advertising and smartphone apps that were accessible by those in Hong Kong. Afterward, Dr. Sebastian Gorka joins the show to discuss his new book. \"The War For America's Soul: Donald Trump and the Left's Assault on America and How We Take Back Our Country. \"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
