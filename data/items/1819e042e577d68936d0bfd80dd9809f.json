  "description": "Today we’re going to be talking about your forever home, which is kind of the final destination. A lot of the homes we do are people’s forever homes, or what they think it is, and then they have so much fun during the process that they decide to do it again. We love this because it really does just delve into all the options that make life ideal and make your lifestyle really beautiful. We get into all the specifics kind of in each room of what we see and what will make your life easier and more lovely. This gives you the ability to live life in your home and not have to worry as much because it’s put together. It does everything you need it to do so you can concentrate on the things that are really important. <br /><br />The forever home 2:42<br />Proximity to hot tub 6:14<br />Everything you need on the main level 9:04<br />Double vanities 16:41<br />The tub 23:10<br />Closets 25:14<br />Porch pots 31:55<br />Food storage 36:01<br />Elevators 43:12<br /><br />“We had one client, that was her very first request on her forever home. She’s like, ‘when I want to get away from my children, I order dessert from the Olive Garden and I go eat it inside my small closet just to get away from them. Make sure I have a spot to eat my dessert in my closet because that’s my escape.’” 29:30<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
