  "description": "<p>By far one of my favorite topics in philosophy, the absurd. You know that whole \"What's the point? What the f$%k am I doing all this for?\" feeling. I'm sure Camus wouldn't define it that way, but that's absurdity. Matt Fulchiron and I get deep on feelings of the absurd, with some sprinkling of Existentialism. Where does one find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world? Ahhhh the French get deep like no other.</p>\n<p>@christinap</p>\n<p>Find Matt Fulchiron on Twitter: @theFullcharge</p>\n",
