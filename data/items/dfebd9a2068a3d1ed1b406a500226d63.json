  "description": "<p>Do you struggle to let paintings go? This week we're answering a question from Gill Allen, who says \"Why do I find it so hard to part with my work? I know I need to get over this impending feeling of loss but just how do I do that? Why do I feel like I'm losing part of myself even contemplating selling a piece of work?\" We discuss this question from a number of different angles and also share our own experiences. Neither of us has struggled to let work go, but we have sometimes chosen to keep breakthrough paintings for a while. As we discuss Gill's question, we ponder the idea of selling work - maybe some people don't want to do that? We also ask whether there are underlying issues behind a desire to keep everything and we suggest a simple reframe that might be helpful. If you feel your paintings are precious babies to be held on to at all costs, this episode is for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Gill Allen: <a href=\"https://gillallen.co.nz/\">https://gillallen.co.nz/</a></p>\n<p>Arvon Foundation Writers Centers <a href=\"https://www.arvon.org/\">https://www.arvon.org/</a></p>\n<p>Mark Steel's in Hull <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV8-lktieDs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV8-lktieDs</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
