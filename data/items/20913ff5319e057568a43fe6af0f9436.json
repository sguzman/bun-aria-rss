In today’s episode, she talks about community and collaboration—both essential to her practice—in a conversation with her partner and muse, the art consultant Racquel Chevremont, the cultural critic Antwaun Sargent and Charlotte Burns, the host of <em>In Other Words.</em></p> <p>Thomas and Chevremont recently launched “<a href= \"https://deuxfemmesnoires.tumblr.com/\">Deux Femme Noires</a>”, an organization focused on mentoring emerging artists of color. “The more of us that come up, the better,\" Chevremont says \"We want the room to be filled with us.” </p> <p>Thomas was studying to be a lawyer when a chance encounter with the photographs of <a href=\"http://carriemaeweems.net/\">Carrie Mae Weems</a> inspired her to change direction and become an artist herself. <em>“</em>Whatever that power is, or mystery one may feel when they’re excited by or inspired by particular art—I knew that’s what I wanted to do with images,\" Thomas says. \"And I knew I wanted to create that space for others.”</p> <p>Tune in for more from the artist, the muse and the writer in today's episode.</p> <p>Transcript: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-community-collaboration-and-sisterhood-with-mickalene-thomas-racquel-chevremont-and-antwaun-sargent-on-creating-change/\"> http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-community-collaboration-and-sisterhood-with-mickalene-thomas-racquel-chevremont-and-antwaun-sargent-on-creating-change/</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
