  "description": "<p>My guest this week is Carlotta Wood. Carlotta is the first friend I made when I moved to California in 1997 and we've been friends ever since. I actually heard her before I saw her. When I told her I was going to use her voice some day, she looked at me like I was crazy. It took me a while, but 22 years later, she's the voice that introduces every episode of The HoneyDew. She’s not crazy about me using a picture of her with sunglasses but this pic is from a coupla years ago and it’s exactly what she looked like the first time I met her. I knew some of Carlotta's story but there's so much I didn't know. She opens up about everything from childhood trauma, being a teenage mom and dating a pastor that hid in her bushes. Carlotta has some stories! No matter what we talk about, no matter how deep it gets, we always find a way to laugh about it. Carlotta shared a quote I had never heard - \"I'm glad I don't look like what I've been through.\" Man does that resonate!<br /> I hope you enjoy this episode.</p> <p><a href=\"http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>",
