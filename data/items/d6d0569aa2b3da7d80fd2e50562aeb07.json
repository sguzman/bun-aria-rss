  "description": "<p>A major driver of quantum-simulator technology is the prospect of probing\nhigh-energy phenomena in synthetic quantum matter setups at a high level of\ncontrol and tunability, thereby offering a venue complementary to dedicated\nparticle colliders. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible realization of\na large-scale $2+1$D $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge theory with dynamical matter and\ngauge fields in a cold-atom quantum simulator with spinless bosons. We present\nthe full mapping of the corresponding Gauss's law onto the bosonic\ncomputational basis. We then show that the target gauge theory can be\nfaithfully realized and stabilized by an emergent gauge protection term in a\ntwo-dimensional single-species Bose--Hubbard optical Lieb superlattice with two\nspatial periods along either direction, thereby requiring only moderate\nexperimental resources already available in current cold-atom setups. Using\ninfinite matrix product states, we calculate numerical benchmarks for adiabatic\nsweeps and global quench dynamics that further confirm the fidelity of the\nmapping. Our work brings quantum simulators of gauge theories a significant\nstep forward in terms of investigating particle physics in higher spatial\ndimensions, and is readily implementable in existing cold-atom platforms.\n</p>",
