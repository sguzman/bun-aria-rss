  "description": "<p>In the final episode of our series about myths and legends, we’re launching our imaginations into outer space! </p>\n<p>Monster expert Emily Zarka tells us about her favorite alien and why aliens fascinate so many people. In the Hoax Hunters season finale, Marc and Sanden bring us a UFO spoof. Plus, scientists give us the lowdown on the real quest for extraterrestrial life — we haven’t found any... yet. And, planets and moons compete for the title of ‘most likely to have life’. </p>\n<p>A new moment of um keeps us outside the atmosphere: why does space look so dark if the sun is so bright?</p>\n<p>Today’s episode is sponsored by The American Dental Association (ada.org/brains). You can support Brains On at brainson.org/donate and get a bonus Mystery Sound Extravaganza episode in January!</p>\n",
