  "description": "During his first-ever livestreamed event, \"Navigating the New World Order: A Curzio Research Townhall Event,\" Frank answered questions for over an hour... But he couldn't answer them all. So he conducted a bonus Q&A session to discuss what’s going on in the markets today… and what you should really be focused on as an investor. He shared his thoughts on oil and gold... bitcoin and other alternative assets... stocks he currently likes and dislikes... \"the death of the dollar\"... and more. Additionally, Frank discloses his simple strategy he's using right now... one that has netted a select group of Curzio readers gains ranging from 90%-500% since the whole COVID-19 situation began.  -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
