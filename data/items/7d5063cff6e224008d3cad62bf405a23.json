  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, China continues to threaten the United States and now finally the FBI is admitting it. Our borders are open for the Chinese to peddle fentanyl to the Cartels in Mexico, yet Biden and the ruling class in Washington simply turn a blind eye. Americans need to wake up and realize the threat facing America is a global one, and the isolationist approach isn't going to keep Americans safe. We have bases abroad to keep our nation secure, not because of \"forever wars.\" The Chinese are taking over waterways like the Panama Canal, and America must confront that foreign threat and the domestic threat by securing the border at the same time. Then, what message are Senate Republicans running on? They don't have a plan and their current performance is terrible, but Mitch McConnell expects us to carry them over the finish line yet again. At least House Republicans are running on the America First platform.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
