  "title": "Episode 78: Matisse Thybulle",
  "description": "It’s no secret that Matisse Thybulle is a rising star in the NBA, developing into a bonafide defensive stopper in the court. But there’s another part of his game that's pretty damn strong as well - his YouTube game, that is. In this spectacular interview, Matisse shows not only why increasing success in the NBA seems like a forgone conclusion, but also why he will continue to be a winner in life as well. A humble and open individual, he’s very comfortable discussing all aspects of the game, as well as his personal ventures, making it easy to see why he’s well liked and well respected for such a young player. He, JJ and Tommy discuss subjects such as his budding YouTube career, life as a 76’er and dealing with their passionate fans, his draft experience, playing in the bubble, his upbringing, and so much more. Don’t miss this great conversation… all here on the OM3.  \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
