  "title": "PMS 2.0 231 - BIG ASS SHOW. It's My Wedding Week.. Let's Have Convos With Triple H, Jeff Passan, Mark Schlereth, David P. Samson, & Legend, AJ Hawk. Cheers.",
  "description": "<p>Today's show is absolutely LOADED. First, ESPN MLB Insider Jeff Passan joins the show to discuss almost half of the Marlins roster testing positive for covid-19, what that means for the MLB going forward, if they have their farm teams close and ready to add players, what Rob Manfred might do, and how the handling of this will have impacts across the American sports landscape (:42-11:07). Next is another installment of McAfee and Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ welcome former President of the Marlins and host of the Nothing Personal podcast, David P. Samson. Pat, AJ, and David discuss where baseball goes from here, if the Marlins were doing the same practices with social distancing and staying safe as other MLB teams, how he would've handled this situation publicly if he were still Team President, and why he doesn't suspect this hiccup will be the end for the MLB season (15:45-31:45). Pat and AJ also react to the Jamal Adams trade, Pat's sick dangles, and everything else currently going on in the sports world (13:14-1:07:57). Later, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, member of the Denver Broncos 50th Anniversary Team and friend of the program, Mark Schlereth joins the show. Pat and Mark discuss how they think Roger Goodell will take what is happening in the MLB and use it for this upcoming football season, his thoughts on everything that is happening with the Washington football team, a franchise he knows very well, his thoughts on the Jamal Adams trade and the reasons behind it, and how he still has 25\" biceps (1:10:11-1:27:47). Lastly, Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy and Development for the WWE, and founder and senior producer of NXT, Triple H. Pat and Triple H clear the air in the wake of last week's Adam Cole debacle, and how Triple H thinks it was an honest mistake that was blown out of proportion, and extends an offer for Pat and Adam Cole to meet with no cameras present to hash out their differences (1:27:50-1:41:36). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
