Jews had to fend off reformers and government officials that sought to drive Jews out of the liquor trade.\n\nDynner argues that many nobles helped their Jewish tavernkeepers evade fees, bans, and expulsions by installing Christians as fronts for their taverns, revealing a surprising level of Polish-Jewish co-existence that changes the way we think about life in the Kingdom of Poland.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
