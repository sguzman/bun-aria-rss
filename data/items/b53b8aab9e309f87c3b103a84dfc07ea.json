Firmware offers a target that basic security controls can’t access or scan as easily as software, while allowing them to persist and continue leveraging many of their tried and true attack techniques.\nJoining us on this week's Research Saturday is Maggie Jauregui, security researcher at Dell, to discuss this issue. \nThe research can be found here: \nThree firmware blind spots impacting security",
