Walking the line between Hollywood tentpole and cultural meditation, Star Wars is a cinematic phenomenon unlike any other, using archetypes as much as storytelling and special effects to make ontological statements on spirituality, philosophy, and indeed politics as well.\n\nAs a cultural text, the Jedi saga heralds to larger questions relevant to our contemporary political context such as the struggle between tradition and modernity, the overarching role of technology and the rise of nativism and extreme exclusionary politics, which begs us as political scientists to ask two interrelated questions: what are the political inferences that can be drawn from the Star Wars saga? And how can political philosophy aid us achieving a deeper and richer understanding of the mythos of that famed tale from a long time ago in a galaxy far away?\n\nAs the long-awaited final episode of the Star Wars space opera hits theatres this week with the release of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, we discuss the political theory of Star Wars with Jeremy Keats - a PhD student specializing in political theory with the Department of Political Science here at Carleton.\n\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\n\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\n\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
