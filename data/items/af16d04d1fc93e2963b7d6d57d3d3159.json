Chris pulls no punches talking about how he was injured and how difficult those early days of his injury were. As he tried to HEAL both his body and mind, Chris reveals how people close to him, including his parents, nurse, and his wife Emily, helped him get through the tears and the daily demands he placed on himself. I was also struck by how SELFLESS Chris is because he made it his calling was to OVERCOME his pain and his struggles for a greater purpose by INSPIRING others to face their challenges as well. His story reminds us that have so much to be THANKFUL for in our lives, no matter what has happened in our past.
