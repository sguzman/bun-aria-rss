  "description": "<p>Whiskey! Today’s suck is SOAKED in whiskey. Mostly, in Jameson - some Irish whiskey.<br />John Jameson - the founder of Jameson - was originally a lawyer from Alloa in Scotland before he founded a distillery in Dublin in 1780. In 1805, he was joined by his son John Jameson II who took over the family business. For the next 41 years, John Jameson Jr. built up the business before handing over to his son John Jameson the 3rd in 1851. By the turn of the 19th century, Jameson’s distilleries were the second-largest producer in Ireland and one of the largest in the world, producing 1,000,000 gallons annually. The name Jameson was synonymous with Irish whiskey. And then in the late 1880s, a scandal broke out regarding claims that John's great-grandson, James S Jameson, paid to watch a Congolese slave girl killed and eaten. And then the name Jameson was associated with cannibalism almost as much as whiskey. A dark and strange historical scandal. We explore it today, along with a history of alcohol and more, in today's whiskey-based edition of Timesuck.   </p>\n<p>Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions donate $13,300 this month to<strong> The Saint</strong> <strong>Bernard Project.</strong> The SBP will be helping those in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana as they continue to work on their recovery from winter storm Uri.
