  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life podcast, our hosts have a converation about Simone Weil’s essay “<a href= \"http://www.hagiasophiaclassical.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Right-Use-of-School-Studies-Simone-Weil.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1AiVOevcaegPWZKGozEo6DtTc6C5vjWnCDf5J4j4LncHD_xINgdm-iO9M\">Reflections on the Right Use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God</a>“. Angelina Stanford opens this discussion talking about stories as a lens to see other perspectives, rather than our own. Thomas Banks gives some biographical information on Simone Weil. Cindy Rollins highlights the connections she made from this essay to Charlotte Mason and Stratford Caldecott, especially in regards to attention and remembrance.</p> <p>They talk about the problems of being counter-cultural in education, pride versus humility as an end of education, and training of the will. Cindy and Angelina emphasize the importance of the work of education over “making the grade.” Thomas reads a quote from Weil on keeping periods of focused work brief, and Cindy expounds on how this concept was also very important to Charlotte Mason. Angelina talks about her own conviction in reading Weil’s words about learning from those subjects which do not come easily for us. The conversation wraps up with our hosts talking about waiting on God instead of trying to force results, in all areas of our lives. </p> <p>Until next time, check out our <a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/\">Upcoming Events</a> page to view our summer schedule and see what we will be reading together next!
