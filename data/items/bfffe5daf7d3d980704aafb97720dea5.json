Riedel’s long and impressive career speaks for itself. A 30-year veteran of the CIA, a senior advisor on South Asia and the Middle East to the last four presidents of the United States in the staff of the National Security Council, and an expert advisor to the prosecution of underwear bomber Omar Farooq Abdulmutallab, he is also the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2012/deadlyembracerevised\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Deadly Embrace: Pakistan, America, and the Future of the Global Jihad</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2010/thesearchforalqaeda-revised\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Search for Al Qaeda:&nbsp;Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future</em></a>, among much else.</p><p>The discussion ranged from the state of Al Qaeda today, to the posture of the Taliban and other regional terrorist groups that the United States engages by both military and diplomatic means, to targeted killing and the way forward for U.S. counterterrorism policy. They don’t discuss the law—but any lawyer interested in the power to confront the enemy will find Riedel’s discussion of the enemy itself particularly valuable.</p><p>In May 2022,&nbsp;<em>Lawfare</em>&nbsp;and Goat Rodeo will debut their latest podcast,&nbsp;<em>Allies</em>, a series about America’s eyes and ears over 20 years of war in Afghanistan.&nbsp;Thousands of Afghans who worked with the American soldiers as translators, interpreters and partners made it onto U.S. military planes.
