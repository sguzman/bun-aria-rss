  "description": "In this episode, Sharon is joined by Emily Kassie, an Emmy and Peabody nominated investigative journalist and filmmaker, to discuss the highly contentious U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years. During her career, Emily has covered conflict, abuse, and fracture points in the U.S and internationally for PBS Newshour, the New York Times, Netflix, Frontline, Time, the Guardian, and more. In 2021, she traveled to Afghanistan and smuggled into Taliban territory with fellow PBS NewsHour journalist Jane Ferguson to develop a six-part documentary series called “The Longest War,” detailing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Emily answers pressing questions about Taliban peace talks, military equipment left in Afghanistan, targeted killings, the history of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, why Kabul fell so quickly, and what life is like under Taliban rule today.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
