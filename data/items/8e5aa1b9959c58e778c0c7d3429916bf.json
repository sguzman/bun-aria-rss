  "description": "Peter Strzok is one of America's most respected, experienced counterintelligence specialists. His career at the FBI reads like a thriller and as a consequence, so does his new book \"Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump.\" At the center of course, is Strzok's role in the investigation of Trump, the controversy that led to his departure from the FBI and, most importantly, what he and his colleagues uncovered about Trump. In our conversation with Strzok, Ryan Goodman of \"Just Security\" and David Rothkopf, explore the facts of the counterintel case against Trump and what threats loom for the US from Russian interference in this November's election. From Barr's abuses to the failings of Senate and IG investigations, this candid discussion should not be missed.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
