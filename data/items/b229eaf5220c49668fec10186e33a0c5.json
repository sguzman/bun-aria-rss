Sadly Pat, Zito and Connor could not join the boys as they are on their way to Huston for an episode of Smack DAHN. Todays Pod starts off with the boys discussing how their week has been going and catching up on all of the show and movies they have been keeping up with. The boys then jump right into the Pod FOD that’s made up from all of the latest things popping off on the World Wide Web. Today’s FOD covers all things form a home made fart cycle, Bill, Mitt and Foxy debating tornados, fish dropping from the sky and much much more. The episode closes off with a beautiful Australian themed mad-lib.
