  "description": "Since we covered Kristin's case, a month and a half-long preliminary hearing was held to determine whether the case against Paul and Ruben could proceed. The court heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including law enforcement officials, former friends and acquaintances of both Paul and Kristin, cadaver dog handlers, and soil experts. In September 2021, the judge in the case ruled that there is sufficient evidence to move the case forward to trial. Currently, the trial is set to occur on April 25, 2022.\n\nYears passed and the Smart family was no closer to finding answers to what happened to their daughter on May 25, 1996. Once civilians and private detectives stepped in, the family saw some progress. It wasn't until a new sheriff was elected that moves were made. What eventually brought the case close to an end was a breakout podcast that shed new light on the details and unearthed new clues, finally leading to some arrests in the case.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
