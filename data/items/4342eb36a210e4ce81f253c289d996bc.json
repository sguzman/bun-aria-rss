  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a very rural area and experience power outages on a regular basis, especially during the winter months. Over the past 22 years, we've learned how to use a generator during a power outage, plus some great things to consider when using a generator or considering the best way for you to know how to use a generator at home. I’m also sharing some of our tips for keeping food fresh if you don’t have a generator.
