  "description": "<p>The International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC) is a 50-year old summer\ncamp, where participants work independently on astronomy projects. Due to the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 instalments of the IAYC were\ncancelled, a first in the camp's history. An online format was established\ndubbed the eIAYC, consisting of three types of activities: (1) an engagement\nseries with astronomical talks and workshops; (2) small independent research\nprojects; and (3) a non-astronomical program involving a range of social\nactivities. Here we present the experience of adapting an in-person camp into\nan online alternative in order to further the IAYC's mission. We discuss\norganisational challenges, experiences with online engagement, and how the 2020\neIAYC informed plans for this year's eIAYC.\n</p>",
