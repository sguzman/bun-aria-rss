  "description": "On today’s show, Pat is joined by recent Super Bowl Champion, 4x All-Pro, the man who protects Patrick Mahomes, Right Tackle Mitchell Schwartz. Pat and Mitchell talk about the Chiefs returning most of their team, and how he thinks their success last year will help them going into next season with so much unknown. They also cover what it’s like being on that dynamic of an offense, whether or not he actually gets to see what Patrick Mahomes was doing, what kind of guy Andy Reid is to play for, the differences between the Browns, who drafted him, and the Chiefs, and what he’s been doing with his time during the quarantine (3:53-23:17). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ Hawk welcome in new WWE Heavyweight Champion of the World after winning the title at Wrestlemania, Drew McIntyre. They chat about what the experience was like wrestling in front of no one and whether it was tough to perform, his thoughts on the product as a whole, and why being a champion with what is currently going on in the world is so important to him (40:47-58:33). Pat and AJ also discuss the matchup between Tiger/Peyton & Phil/Tom Brady and what whether they think it would be successful, chat about golf pushing all the majors back into the fall and potentially into NFL Sunday’s, among many other things (23:19-1:53:45). To close out the show, last year’s starting Quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, recently acquired by the Washington Redskins, Kyle Allen joins the show via FaceTime. Kyle and Pat chat about what it was like being around Cam Newton that often, what he learned from him, and what he think Cam has left in the tank, why he feels confident going into the year with the Redskins and having the same playbook, getting kicked out of his house in California amid the pandemic and having to figure out where he was going to go, and some of the things he’s been doing to stay in shape during his downtime (1:53:47-2:03:46). Don’t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you’re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and as always, stay safe. We’re all in this together and we appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
