  "description": "Eddie Russell, Master Distiller at Wild Turkey, joins the show to discuss growing up around the distillery, apprenticeship, and what tradition has taught him about the business.\nShow Notes:\n\nTalk about your childhood. What was your upbringing like?\n\nWhat sports did you play?\n\nYou were also going to play college ball at one point\n\nHow did you get roped into this operation?\n\nIn 2015 you were named Master Distiller here at Wild Turkey. Talk about your job now.\n\nDid your formal education prepare you for being a Master Distiller?\n\nWhat are some of the biggest lessons your father taught you?\n\nWhat was life like before the bourbon craze?\n\nDo you and your dad have the same flavor pallet?\n\nYour dad has said time and time again he’s hard-headed and old fashioned. What are some of the traditions here at Wild Turkey you intend on keeping?\n\nDo you feel a sense of pressure?\n\nFrom Erik Hasselgärde on Facebook: Bourbon is rooted in tradition, some from 200 years ago, some from 50. What are they learning about bourbon today, that they hope to pass on to future bourbon producers?\n\nFrom Ryan Oberleitner: Why has their entry proof been raised over the years? What affect do they think that has had?\n\nDo you plan on bring the 13yr age stated export here stateside?\n\nFrom Jack Johnson on Facebook: When they reach 100 years (total together) as Master Distillers (which will occur in less than 18 months), can we expect some outstanding special editions?\n\nFrom- Will T @iamwillt: Can we please get age and warehouse info on private and single barrels? It would give us reason to buy multiples.\n\nWhat’s one thing that annoys you in the bourbon industry?\n\nDo the ladies pay attention to you when Matthew McConaughey is around?\n\nLast year you all came out with Russells Reserve 1998. Talk about that release because I’m mad at myself I didn’t drop the money on it and people are raving it’s one of the best things to come out of Wild Turkey\n\nWhat’s next for Eddie Russell?",
