  "title": "Scott Straus, “Fundamentals of Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention” (US Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2016)",
  "description": "This podcast is the first of a new occasional series of interviews addressing the question of responding to mass atrocities and genocide. Later in the summer I’ll interview Bridget Conley-Zilkic, James Waller and Carrie Booth Walling. First up, however, is today’s interview with Scott Straus.\n\nWhenever I teach classes on genocide or on the Holocaust, students most want to know the answer to a simple question: How can we make sure this doesn’t happen again?\n\nStraus’ new book, Fundamentals of Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2016), surveys the recent research to try and answer this question. In part, it’s a resource for practitioners, summarizing the consensus on best practices. But it’s much more than that. It’s a succinct but subtle conversation with the research–pointing out complexities, interrogating common assumptions and pointing to places where more research is needed. The result is a book that professionals, academics and interested citizens should read.\n\nIt’s a book that has interesting resonances with the other books of this series as well. I hope you’ll listen to the entire series and read the books. I know that doing so has made me think hard about how I teach the subject in my classes.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
