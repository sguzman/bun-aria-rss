The worst of disasters completely destroy a civilization and leave behind so few they take centuries to recover (the Mongolian slaughter of Iran in the 1200s; the smallpox epidemic among Native Americans). <br /><br />Today we look at the tipping points between a society being hurt and a society being mortally wounded.",
