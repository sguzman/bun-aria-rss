  "description": "<p>Well if you aren't my mommy then who are you? Tommy spent the weekend in NYC with his close celebrity friends (no big deal) and shares his love for the great big ol' apple (is that the expression?). We revisit Tom's mom's obsession with everything Wu-Tang. Christina fixates on why she routinely tortures herself with caffeine and toothbrushes, while Tom does the same with his fingers. We discuss our desire for a psychologist to analyze comedic podcasters, play some of our new faves in REAL TALK, and finally introduce you to Christina's father with some primo audio! Be Her!</p>\n",
