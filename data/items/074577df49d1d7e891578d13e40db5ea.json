  "description": "Caterina Pizzigoni’s book The Life Within: Local Indigenous Society in Mexico’s Toluca Valley, 1650-1800 (Stanford University Press, 2012) provides a close examination of indigenous society in central Mexico. Analyzing more than 200 testamentary documents, Pizzigoni chronicles what Nahua homes looked like, who lived within them, and how indigenous households regulated their property and kinship connections. It is a fascinating portrait of daily life in an area that held firmly onto its Nahua traditions, while also incorporating certain aspects of Spanish imperialism. Her work provides vivid and detailed explorations of Nahua household practices in a period often overlooked in the history of Spanish colonization in Mexico.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
