  "description": "<p>A special dual interview episode for you to sink your teeth into today on Off The Podium as we continue the build up to the Tokyo Olympics, as we sit down with Australian wrestlers Jayden Lawrence & Connor Evans to learn more about the sport, as well as their amazing careers! Both Jayden & Connor give us a unique insight into the sport and teach us more about how it works, how to score and just why there isn't a referee coming in to count somebody out to 3. We also find out just how close each of them were to making the Tokyo team and learn just why these Olympic games are breaking an unwanted record for Australia when it comes to the sport of wrestling. Added to this some pretty fun stories around beating and being beaten by certain rivals, this is one interview you definitely won't want to miss!</p>",
