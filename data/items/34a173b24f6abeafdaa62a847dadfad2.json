  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Who is Oscar Lopez-Rivera? He is someone that President Trump did not pardon today. Lopez-Rivera is an F.A.L.N. terrorist that was commuted by President Obama. Lopez-Rivera sought to bring a Marxist government to Puerto Rico and was responsible for the New York City bombing deaths of four Americans. Of course, Bernie Sanders, Bill de Blasio, and other communist-sympathizers lobbied for his commutation and are upset about President Trump's commutation of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Then, Amy Berman-Jackson is a terribly partisan federal judge that should never have been appointed. However, an association of federal judges has taken exception to Trump's exercise of free speech in tweeting his opinion of Roger Stone's excessive prison sentence for an alleged process crime. Attorney General Barr was well within his rights to intervene in this case, just as Trump was. The Department of Justice cannot \"interfere\" in something that is its responsibility. Later, every known anti-Semite in America is endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for President. It's no surprise, most people that hate America, hate Jews too. We see similar anti-Americanism in Israeli politics, and should Benny Ganz become Prime Minister the peace process advanced by the United States will be derailed because it's not in Ganz's self-interest to work with the U.S given his coalition of non-Jew alliances. Afterward, American Oligarch Michael Bloomberg is being accused of running a 54 Billion dollar toxic sexually-charged nightmare. According to Business Insider, the Bloomberg company has been reported as a sexualized predatory environment over the past twenty years by several female workers.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
