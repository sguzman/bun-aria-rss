  "description": "<p>It's pretty clear that we have changed. Only a few generations ago, chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes were seen in only a small percentage of the population. Today, some statistics show that more than three-fourths of the western world are afflicted with one of these major illnesses. The question is...</p> <p>How did this happen?</p> <p>We are so much more advanced in our technology, but, collectively, we are in the Stone Age when it comes to the health and vitality of our bodies. As a matter of fact, our Stone Age ancestors had this dialed in better than we do. Images of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble do not give our origins justice... I'm pretty sure no one has ever eaten a brontosaurus burger, but I've seen plenty of people eat Double Whoppers.</p> <p>In the new movie <a href= \"https://wh159.isrefer.com/go/shawn-origins/shawn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Origins</a>, we get the inside look at how we lost touch with our natural state of well-being. We finally get an explanation of what happened, and how we ended up entrenched in disease. But, more importantly, we get a map on how to get back to our roots, and experience vitality NOW and well into our future.</p> <p>Dr. Pedram Shojai, OMD, has put together a cutting-edge film that's visually stunning, and energizing for your mind, body, and spirit. Whether you are just getting started on your health journey, or you are a health and fitness veteran, this movie is going to add something to your life.
