  "description": "<p>John Maxwell and Mark Cole sit down in this installment of Candid Conversations to reflect on the recent <em>Exchange</em> event in London. Hosted by John, <em>Exchange</em> is an annual, three-day, immersive event that puts attendees face-to-face with leadership experts in top industries and side-by-side with world-class thinkers.</p> <p>This year, <em>Exchange</em> took place in London. John talks about how, this year, he wanted to take the attendees to the historic home of John Wesley, a place John himself visits every time he’s in London. However, after not being granted permission to visit Wesley’s home on this trip, John used the opportunity to talk with the <em>Exchange</em> attendees about what leaders must do when they’re unable to provide what they know is best for their people.</p> <p>John retells that lesson in this episode and shares why, as leaders, it’s important to make the most of “the middle”––that place of tension between the ideal and reality.   </p> <p>For more episodes of The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast, visit <a href= \"http://maxwellpodcast.com/Episodes\">MaxwellPodcast.com/episodes</a>.
