  "description": "<p>Adam Strauss is an actor and comedian who created a play, The Mushroom Cure, about his own struggles with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and his attempts to cure, or at least ameliorate the symptoms, with psychedelics. Critics have described his show as &ldquo;a hilarious ride through OCD,&rdquo; &ldquo;a fabulous, perceptive trip,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hugely intelligent and incredibly engaging.&rdquo; Adam and I discussed his life with OCD, how OCD compares to other addictions and forms of mental illness, how taking psilocybin mushrooms helped and whether other psychedelics might have as well, why he went back to a 12-step program - OC Anonymous - after finding some success with psilocybin, and why calling 911 while under the influence of mushrooms to discuss an existential experience is rarely a good idea.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
