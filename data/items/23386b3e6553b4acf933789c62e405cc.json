  "title": "PMS 2.0 145 - My Pro Bowl Thoughts, Ryan Leaf Tried To Help Josh Gordon, & More",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys go through the Pro Bowl selections and give their thoughts on all the snubs, who made it that maybe shouldn't have, and whether or not players seriously care if they're selected to a Pro Bowl. Pat also breaks down the difference between Pro Bowlers and All-Pro's, and why he thinks after a certain point, most players will see through the facade and realize that for the most part, it's a bunch of malarkey. Later, Heisman Trophy finalist, #2 pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, and friend of the show, Ryan Leaf calls in. He explains how he tried to help out Josh Gordon, but he wasn't in the mindset at the time to actually open up to help. Ryan explains his current situation and chats about the moment where he actually started to realize he needed to change, and gives a quick recap of his life for those who aren't aware of his situation. Pat and Ryan also chat about the Cheez-It Bowl and how they'll get to interact down there, and a challenge is issued for each man. If you are unaware of Ryan Leaf's life story, this is a can't miss conversation (23:48-36:56). Also covered in today's show is Zion Williamson's knee injury and whether or not he'll be the same player when he comes back, Congress cracking down on e-cigs, Charlotte wanting $325 million for a new expansion MLS team and why that seems a little absurd, and Josh Allen getting one of his selfies hung in a museum after beating the Steelers last Sunday night. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
