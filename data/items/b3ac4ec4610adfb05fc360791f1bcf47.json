  "description": "Trigger Warning: This episode discusses sexual assault, specifically the sexual abuse of a child. In this month's episode of The Readheads Book Club we are discussing My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russel. This book was a departure from most of the books we've previously read and we are talking about some of the big questions and quandries this book poses, both on the page and off the page. As always we are sharing our casting choices for a hypothetical movie adaptation of this book and we're sharing the other books we read this month. The next book is Margo's choice and she chose Bright Side by Kim Holden.
