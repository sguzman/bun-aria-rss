  "description": "<p>This week, in Bantam, Connecticut, a horribly brutal & bloody scene reminds everyone of a very similar murder, a couple years earlier, and everyone worries that a serial killer is on the prowl. The newest terrible killing is brutal in its completeness, and has few leads, other than a man, who was helping sell off scrap metal, while drinking beer, from 7 in the morning, to the end of the day. Some people think this it's a terrible mistake, but most think that a disturbed & vicious murderer has been caught. Incompetence in the investigation, heartless brutality, and crazy court proceedings make this a truly insane story!!</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that you can be a falconer, that DNA would have saved us all a lot of trouble in the 1970s, and that just because you breathe through a hole in your throat, doesn't mean you cant be a cold blooded killer!!</p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p> </p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p> </p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on...</p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p> </p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
