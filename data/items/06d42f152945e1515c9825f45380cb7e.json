  "description": "On S&A Investor Radio this week, I interview Braden Copeland. We interviewed hotel and restaurant employees, real estate agents, managers at oil producing firms, train operators and a few roughnecks. We also took some great footage of several well sites owned and operated by some of the biggest oil producers in the Bakken. \n Braden and I discuss what we learned from these interviews. We give you several ways to invest in the Bakken - home to one of the biggest oil shale regions in the world. And we break down why fracking is a game changer for the U.S. economy.  ",
