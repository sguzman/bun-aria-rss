  "description": "<p>Deep in the Bayou, originates the legend of a mysterious creature. There are more than gators, Cottonmouths, snapping turtles and the giant rat-like Nutria in the swamps. Haunting howls in the middle of the night indicate that something large, wild and scary roams about the mangroves. Tales about this creature have been passed down through the generations. Were these stories created just to scare the children and keep them from wandering into the swamp or to get them to behave? Are these tales just simply made up to explain the disappearance of domestic animals? Join us as we delve into the legend of the Rougarou. Moment in Oddity features burial pods and This Day in History features Frederick Douglass' escape from slavery.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-65-legend-of-rougarou.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-65-legend-of-rougarou.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer of the show for only $1 a month.
