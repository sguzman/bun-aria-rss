  "description": "<p>Imagine hopping on a flight to visit your parents on the other side of the world. You don&rsquo;t avoid flying by plane because there&rsquo;s likely going to be some turbulence- a few rough patches are to be expected. You take advantage of the modern marvel of a transatlantic flight and you go and see your family! Similarly, the stock market is the greatest wealth creating machine in history- it&rsquo;s amazing! Investing in the market to achieve millionaire status has become possible for a much wider swath of folks but the path comes with its fair share of corrections and bear markets. To go back to the analogy- what if it's starting to look like air travel is no longer safe? You start to consider that upcoming flight! Sure, we&rsquo;re seeing some market volatility now but future market predictions aren&rsquo;t looking all that rosy either. Is it time to consider pulling out of the market? During this episode we&rsquo;ll discuss why the market saw massive gains over the past 2 years, why we&rsquo;re optimistic about the future of the stock market, what you should be doing if we experience a future of weak returns, and how you should be investing regardless of what&rsquo;s going on with the stock market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed an Escape From Lager Mountain Flying Machine!
