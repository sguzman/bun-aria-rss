  "description": "Today I look under the hood of this earnings season. The results have been solid overall—but the headlines can be misleading...  Federal Reserve members continue to trigger market volatility with their speculative comments. While this drives me crazy, I give credit to the Fed for its plan to fight inflation. Next, I break down why—despite mixed earnings, rising rates, and massive inflation—this environment is actually good for stocks... I explain how to find quality companies that will shine regardless of a recession… and why the metaverse is practically guaranteed to create a windfall for early investors. In this episode:   The Fed’s plan to lower inflation is working [4:25] Why Q2 earnings aren’t as strong as they seem [7:55] Proof this is a stock picker’s market [16:30] How to find quality stocks for any economy [28:25]  The metaverse is practically a guaranteed windfall [34:35]  Enjoyed this episode?
