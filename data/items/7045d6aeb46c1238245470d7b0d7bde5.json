  "description": "<p>The Buxton Inn is the state of Ohio's oldest continuously operating inn that has stayed in the same location and same building. Since 1812 it has offered travelers a comfortable place to stay. Perhaps the inn is too comfortable. Based on the experiences of patrons and employees, it would seem that the inn is so inviting, many spirits have decided to stay here in the afterlife. Staying at the inn is like taking a step back in history. Join us as we step back and investigate the history and hauntings of this grand old inn. The Moment in Oddity features Animal Cults in Ancient Egypt and This Day in History features America's Independence Day.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-54-buxton-inn.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-54-buxton-inn.html</a></p>",
