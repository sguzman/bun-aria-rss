Did Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine? Was Shia Laboeuf fired? Did Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh get in a shouting match on set? Are Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde even still talking? Did Nick Kroll just kiss Harry Styles?! In the midst of all the chaos, it’s been easy to forget that there’s an actual movie surrounding the drama!\n\nDon’t Worry Darling definitely raises some questions. Like what is going on, and will we get any answers for any of it? How does this simulation thing even work? How is Jack’s simulation life any better than his previous life? How does this simulation not have any safeguards against escape? What was the point of the electroshock therapy if it doesn’t even hold for five minutes? Did three cars just crash into each other in an open desert?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Don’t Worry Darling! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Mandalorian Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQeT-vLiwE\n\nMorbius Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5I1WWeFQg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",
