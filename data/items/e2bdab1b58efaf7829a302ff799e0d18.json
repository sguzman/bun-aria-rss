  "description": "Today’s show starts with a look at the recent earnings from Chewy (CHWY), an online marketplace for pet-related goods. Daniel and I discuss the results… what they tell us about consumers’ spending habits… and what to watch out for when investing in retailers.   Despite the ongoing market volatility, I highlight one asset class everyone should be buying right now… and why it’s poised to rip higher on any sign of a slowdown in the Fed’s interest rate hikes. We’ll be taking advantage of the uptrend in my Curzio Venture Opportunities newsletter. (If you’re not a member, join us here… get my picks as soon as they’re released.) Switching gears a bit… The massive amount of money pouring into the metaverse is mind-boggling… especially when you consider it’s happening in the midst of a brutal bear market for the tech sector. Daniel and I discuss some of the criticisms about the metaverse (like the current graphics quality) and explain why the critics are missing the long-term picture. I explain what to focus on when comparing different metaverses… and a project I’m working on with TCG World to give you a sneak peak at the mind-blowing opportunity its virtual land offers.  I also rant about last weekend’s Video Music Awards… and the opportunity it missed to showcase the potential of the metaverse.  And finally, Daniel and I discuss the latest developments in the uranium/nuclear energy space. I break down why I'm more bullish than ever on this sector… and I share a handful of names you can invest in to participate in the uranium bull market.  In this episode   What Chewy’s results tell us about consumers [3:15] An update on the massive money flowing into the metaverse [11:50] Coming soon: A sneak peek at TCG World [18:50] Why owning your own content is such a big deal [20:45]  How the VMAs missed the mark on the metaverse [26:38]  Why you need exposure to uranium right now [30:55]  Enjoyed this episode?
