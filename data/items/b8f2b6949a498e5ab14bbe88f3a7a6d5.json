  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Donald Trump Jr. calls in to discuss his recent subpoena to testify in front of the Senate, technology censorship, his thoughts on Mayor Bill de Blasio and whether he'll run for political office in the future. Bill de Blasio is out on the 2020 campaign trail pushing his communist agenda. Then, Sen Diane Feinstein was on an unsecured iPhone with Iranian Leader Javad Zarif. Why would Feinstein be on the phone with Zarif? Feinstein says that Iran was saying that Iran doesn't want a war. Where's all the talk about the Logan act now? Will someone subpoena her regarding her contact with Iran, and undermining the administration? Of course not; she won't pay any price for this? Don't count on the CNN or MSNBC to report on this either. Later, Sen Richard Blumenthal lied his way through politics and is on TV every day distorting the facts. After, WJNO Radio Host Brian Mudd calls in to update us on the illegal immigration crisis in south Florida. Border Patrol officials are transporting 270 asylum claimants at a time into south Florida. It's unknown if this was a calculated move by immigration officials acting independently from the Trump Administration.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
