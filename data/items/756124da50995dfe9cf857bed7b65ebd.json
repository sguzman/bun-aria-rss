  "description": "<p>After moving from his home state of Georgia to Oklahoma, <strong>Dee Brock</strong> discovered a burning desire to<strong> buy rental properties</strong>. He had bought himself a primary residence and cosigned with his mother on her home, but knew he wanted to accrue units that could be cash flowing. He was then able to <strong>get a </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/rei/glossary/heloc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HELOC</strong></a><strong> (home equity line of credit) on his primary and use it to buy a foreclosure</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything was going well, but Dee wanted more structure, more advice, and more of a game plan. Someone at his church group <strong>suggested going onto a site called BiggerPockets</strong>, which later became a huge resource to Dee (and hopefully to you reading this now)! Now Dee knew how to<strong> vet tenants, get a cash out refinance, and run numbers like the pros.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dee developed a bit of a <strong>formula for how he sends in offers</strong> on houses. He finds a house he likes, <strong>sends it to his agent to get comps</strong> (comparables), averages those comps, multiples it by 80% (cash out refinance amount), then subtracts closing and maintenance. That’s the offer Dee puts in on the house and <strong>gives him the numbers he needs to feel confident about buying it</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>What if a house <strong>doesn’t appraise for the amount needed</strong>? Dee also has a workaround for that! Dee’s local credit union that lends to him allows him to<strong> use their </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/estimate-arv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ARV (after repair value) </strong></a><strong>number OR an appraisal</strong>. This saves Dee tons of time and money if an appraisal isn’t needed!</p><p>Now Dee is setting his sights on a new venture,<strong> self-storage units</strong>. We’ve seen a lot of successful real estate investors transition from residential buildings to self-storage, and for good reason.
