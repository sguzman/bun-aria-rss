  "description": "<p>I've quoted Lombardi on the podcast before: \"chase perfection.\"  Problem is, most people emphasize the second word when the focus is really on the first. Perfection is an impossibility. We're supposed to chase it, not expect it. That's sounds counter-intuitive to a commitment to excellence, but it's not. In fact...perfectionism actually undermines excellence. In this episode, I tell you how & describe a better way of thinking & operating: one that embraces the chaotic process that produces success.</p>",
