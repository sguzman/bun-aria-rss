  "title": "PMS 2.0 191 - The Last Dance Reaction + Mark Schlereth, Tim Hasselbeck, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For Some Great 4/20 Chatter",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the first two episodes of The Last Dance as Pat is finally realizing how ruthless and incredible&nbsp;Michael Jordan was. They chat about the most interesting parts of the first two episodes, what surprised them, and what they're looking forward to. Three incredible guests also join the show. First, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth stops by. Pat and Mark discuss The Last Dance, and whether that killer instinct and the drive to succeed is something all elite athletes possess, Mark gives his thoughts on the upcoming draft and why he thinks it will really showcase who the good GM's in the NFL are, which lineman he thinks will be the most successful in this year's class, and why he thinks the NFLPA should look to outlaw players taking the Wonderlic (12:25-34:44). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk, Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss The Last Dance, and what it would be like to play on a team where players openly mock the GM, and how Jerry Krause is really taking it in the shins. They also look ahead to their draft special on Thursday night, and discuss how they will both be compiling mock drafts for the show in order to show who can accumulate the most points. The guys also cover Leonard Fournette being just about done in Jacksonville, Yannick Ngakoue getting in a twitter war with Tony Khan, the owner of the Jaguars' son, and they react to the news that the NFL Draft technology test did not go well and try to figure out what things will look like on Thursday (36:58-1:58:54). Lastly, ESPN NFL Analyst Tim Hasselbeck joins the show to give his opinions on this years draft, why he doesn't think Tua's Wonderlic score is that big of a cause for concern, why every comparison doesn't need to be with a Hall of Famer, and what it will take for the Bengals to consider Joe Burrow to be a success (1:58:56-2:08:52). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're watching the show for the chance to win some free merch. As always, stay safe out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
