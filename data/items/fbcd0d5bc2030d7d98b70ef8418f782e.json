  "description": "<p>Derren is a mentalist and a really fascinating person. I've been a fan of his work since the early 2000's. Please check him out on Youtube to see that amazing skills he has and the incredible work he has done. He has a new show on Netflix called Sacrifice. I really enjoyed reviewing this episode and can't wait to see Derren get a lot more attention in the U.S.</p>\n <p>Enjoy the review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
