  "description": "In the late '70s, NASA launched Voyagers 1 & 2 to explore the furthest reaches of our solar system and beyond. But something amazing was included on those space probes... a 90-minute time capsule of sounds, language, and music from Earth called The Golden Record. Its intended recipient? Any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might stumble upon it. What did Carl Sagan and his team put on the record to represent all of humanity? How would aliens decode it?\nFor the first time ever, the album will be deconstructed track-by-track. Featuring Tim Ferris and Linda Salzman Sagan, two pioneers behind the record.\nTwenty Thousand Hertz is produced out of the studios of Defacto Sound, and hosted by Dallas Taylor.\nFollow the show on Twitter & Facebook. \nBecome a monthly contributor at 20k.org/donate.\nIf you know what this week's mystery sound is, tell us at mystery.20k.org.\nGet your copy of the Voyager Golden Record at ozmarecords.com.\nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/voyagergoldenrecord \nLearn more about your ad choices.
