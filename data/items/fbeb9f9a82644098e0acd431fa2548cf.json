Adaptability and precision remain essential, while decision complexity is accelerating.</p>\n<p>In response, organizations are changing the way they approach decisioning – leveraging technology in concert with human potential for obtaining the highest value. There are two approaches: the most familiar one is augmented decision making – where humans take analytically driven insights to make a decision, for example in call centers; and the second - automated decision making – where the machine makes the decisions, for high-volume transactional systems like credit origination, next best offers, and logistical routing.</p>\n<p>As these analytically driven approaches are embedded into decisioning operations, the impact on people and companies is far-reaching including the need to ensure fairness and eliminate bias in the process. This need is highlighted by Federal institutions, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who, as recent as May 2022, issued a reminder for creditors of their legal responsibility to provide specific and accurate reasons for adverse actions when using AI technologies in credit decisioning applications. <strong>(See details of the Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-03 <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/circulars/circular-2022-03-adverse-action-notification-requirements-in-connection-with-credit-decisions-based-on-complex-algorithms/#3\">here</a>)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/files/2022/09/Code-of-Federal-Regulations.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13638\" src=\"https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/files/2022/09/Code-of-Federal-Regulations.png\" alt=\"Code of Federal Regulations: Statement of specific reasons.
