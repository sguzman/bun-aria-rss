  "description": "<p>August 13, 2018 / There were a dozen people at Rising Daughter Baptist Church the night the Swains were killed. Many years later, two witnesses would identify Dennis Perry as the shooter, and though one of those witnesses was not certain of her identification, the other had no doubts at all. But why was she so certain? And is there reason to question how reliable her identification really was?</p>\n\n\n<p>Episode scoring music by Blue Dot Sessions, Patrick Cortes, and Chris Zabriskie.</p>\n\n\n<p>Thank you to SimpliSafe for sponsoring today's episode.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.SimpliSafeUNDISCLOSED.com\">www.SimpliSafeUNDISCLOSED.com</a> </p>\n\n\n<p>#undisclosed #dennisperry</p>\n",
