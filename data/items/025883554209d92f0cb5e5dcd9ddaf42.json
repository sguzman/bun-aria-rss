Martin asks the group if the Steelers trio of Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell each swapped teams with Aaron Rodgers, DeAndre Hopkins and Todd Gurley II how much would their NFL careers be different (14:00)? Next, Shek makes fun of Spaghetti for attending awful movies like <em>Dan In Real Life</em> with a large group of his male friends, which poses the question do people actually walk out of movies (35:40)? Then, Spaghetti and EmmaVP explain how they're both very anti playing board games, such as Jenga or Connect Four, at bars (46:15).  Lastly, Martin tells the group he just came back from a vacation in Cabo that he went on alone (54:25).</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
