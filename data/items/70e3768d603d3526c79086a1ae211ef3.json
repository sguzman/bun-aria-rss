  "description": "It's easy to blame the pols.  For the pols its easy to blame one another.  (Or if you are Roy Moore, who used to be a Senate candidate in the U.S., you can blame the sinners.  Or Mitch McConnell.  Or Sassy, the horse.  Take your pick). But when policies don't match the global situation and policy advisors don't have the courage to stand up to their bosses and countries like America end up with the White House heading one way (toward disaster) and the State Department heading another way (sometimes a different disaster), then who are you going to blame.  Is it the nerds?  Have the wonks let down America?  Have we lost the narrative and our spines at the same time? We ask Hisham Melhem, Kori Schake, David Sanger and Ed Luce.
