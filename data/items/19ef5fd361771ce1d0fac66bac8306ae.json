I know the year JUST started but you have to listen to \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YCfpM119gohGGBYBLECfj?si=wJCFfJkYSdS6Ni8X9vKeyQ\">Little Green House</a>\" immediately. To celebrate I had my new friend Grady Allen, the vocalist of the band, on this week. He had a cold when we spoke, so pardon any stuffiness he had. We get into Connecticut hardcore, growing up musically in public and being active in the scene.
