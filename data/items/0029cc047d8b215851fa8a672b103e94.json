  "title": "The Debate About Pablo Escobar's Hippos",
  "description": "Pablo Escobar had a private zoo at his estate in Colombia, with zebras, giraffes, flamingoes - and four hippopotamuses. After Escobar was killed in 1993, most of the animals were relocated except for the so-called \"cocaine hippos.\" Authorities thought they would die but they did not and now, about a hundred roam near the estate. Conservationists are trying to control their population because they worry about the people and the environment. But some locals like the hippos and a few researchers say the animals should be left alone and are filling an ecological void. The controversy reflects growing debate in ecology about what an invasive species actually is.  <br/><br/><em>Contact Short Wave with your animal stories at shortwave@npr.org.</em>",
