In the interview, Shahzia discusses the process behind her painting “The Scroll,” which she created as an undergraduate student in Pakistan. She also talks about her relationship to the concept of “tradition” and her unwillingness to either break or conform to it. \nAfter the interview, Rumaan and co-host Isaac Butler discuss the importance of demystifying artwork. \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, Shahzia grapples with the way her art was received in the 1990s and the tendency to look at her work through the narrow lens of her biography. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675.\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews. \nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
