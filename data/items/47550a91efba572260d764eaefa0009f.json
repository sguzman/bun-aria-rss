  "description": "<p>My friend Megan Carranza joins us today to talk about <em>her</em> podcast, Adventures In Autism. Megan started AiA in 2017 after her son Logan received an autism diagnosis at age 4. At the time, Megan couldn’t find any podcasts that weren’t hosted by doctors or therapists. Those were of course invaluable, but she wanted a community of parents just like her. So she created one herself.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Megan is amazing, and she is also the younger sister of my friend Melissa, who you may remember from IG stories and $2 Thursdays as my brave and wonderful friend who was diagnosed with brain cancer in May 2020. We get an update on her as well!!</p><br><p>And of course, because this IS Gee Thanks and Megan IS an esthetician, she brought skincare recs in the form of an exfoliant and a lash serum that she swears is a game changer.</p><br><p>As Megan mentioned, her podcast is not just for people with autism or people who love people with autism. It’s for everyone, and it’s a great learning tool especially if you are looking to learn more about autism or help your kids learn more about their friends or classmates who have autism or who are autistic (however they identify!). “We can always use more allies,” Megan said.</p><br><p><strong>PRODUCTS MENTIONED:&nbsp;</strong></p><br><p>Listen to Megan’s pod, Adventures in Autism: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/adventures-in-autism/id1436728566\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/adventures-in-autism/id1436728566</a>&nbsp;and follow her on Insta: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adventuresinautismpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/adventuresinautismpod/</a></p><br><p>Peter Thomas Roth exfoliant: <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+v1RioMbsdhwH5JHKM6IvaQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://rstyle.me/+v1RioMbsdhwH5JHKM6IvaQ</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Lash Serum: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gMBlN3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3gMBlN3</a> </p><br><p><strong>Gee Thanks! is powered by subscribers like you!
