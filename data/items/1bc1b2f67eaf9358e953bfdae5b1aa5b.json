  "description": "Sermon On The Mount: Part 3. Light & Heavy. Today we tackle one of the most important sections of the Sermon on the Mount, as what Jesus says helps to frame everything after. What did Jesus mean when he said he came not to abolish, but to fulfill? What was His relationship to the Torah? What is the definition of abolish? What did this mean to the crowd there? What does it mean to us now? What is the difference between light and heavy commands? So much to unpack!\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
