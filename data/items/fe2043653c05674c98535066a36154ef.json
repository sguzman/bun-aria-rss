  "description": "<p>In this episode, podcast maven Jordan Harbinger joins me for a collaborative deep dive on the topic of podcasting. We take a close look at the current state of this technology, including a look at specific numbers: How much money are people making? How many people are making that money? Why is SMARTLESS worth $20 million a year to Amazon? <br/><br/>We then tackle the future of the industry. Will independent audio-only podcasting as we know it today still be around in 5 years, or is this just a step toward a radical new configuration of the media landscape? (I have a theory on this which I run by Jordan for his opinion.)<br/><br/>We get into it all...<br/><br/>For more on Jordan and his massively successful show: https://www.jordanharbinger.com/<br/><br/>Thanks to Jay Kerstens for the intro music and Mark Miles for mastering.</p>",
