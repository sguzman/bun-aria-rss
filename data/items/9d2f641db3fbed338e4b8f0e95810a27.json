  "description": "<p>Meditation: Home to Awake Awareness - This guided practice establishes a kind, friendly attention with the image and felt sense of a smile, and evokes an embodied presence. We open to the awake awareness that is listening to and feeling the changing sounds and sensations; and then the awake awareness that experiences our own heart. We end with a lovingkindness prayer for ourself and the world.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation: \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\" when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
