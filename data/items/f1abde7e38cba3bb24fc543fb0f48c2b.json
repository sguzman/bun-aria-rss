  "description": "Today is Primary Day in New York, Florida and Oklahoma. Pelosi's husband pleads guilty to DUI, two sentenced in FBI Whitmer kidnapping case. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Mar-a-Lago Raid: Federal agencies have been weaponized against people the government doesn’t like. The 2024 GOP ticket should be Trump-DeSantis. Clay says, \"I'm gonna keep beating this drum 'cause I want it to happen -- then you would have an incredible duo that is set to dominate, not just in 2024, but DeSantis would easily take the reins in '28 and I think again in '32 and help restore some normalcy in this country.\" Jared Kushner, senior advisor to President Trump, joins Clay to discuss his new book, Breaking History: A White House Memoir, his reaction to the Mar-a-Lago raid, Trump's Mideast peace successes and a sneak peek into Trump's future 2024 plans.
