  "description": "Everybody’s asking about cool different spaces that we’ve designed such as past projects, so that’s what we want to talk about today. We’re doing a unique home for a Sikh family who have an aromatic kitchen, which is an area containing various potent spices that give off many different smells. The family entertains a lot, so they have the need for many large containers where they can store big amounts of food for guests and events. We did a home where the owner wanted to put a Hobbit home on the property and make it a part of their whole structure, so we created a long tunnel underground and made a unique layout, which turned out to be really fun for them. Closets are often unique spaces that people will want us to design based on their own lifestyles and we did one that felt like a treehouse, using paints and constructing it in such a way that it felt a lot bigger and open than it actually was. <br /><br />Designing a home for a Sikh family 1:28<br />Aromatic kitchen 2:22<br />Shoe storage 6:21<br />Dallas Texas home 10:57<br />Hobbit house 13:05<br />The glam room 14:52<br />Tatami room 17:32<br />Closets 20:38<br />A game room for an NBA player 25:03<br /><br />“People are changing the way that they work, and so she has a huge closet. The builder has told us that women in Dallas never wear the same thing twice, so if you can imagine, you need 365 outfits to house these closets. So they’re as big as kitchens today, and then on the opposite side of her closet is her office. And so she can walk right in there and take a Zoom call, look fabulous, you know? Or sit down there in the evening and she doesn’t have to run down a flight of stairs to sit in a more formal office, so we just combined all of that space right into one.” 16:50<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
