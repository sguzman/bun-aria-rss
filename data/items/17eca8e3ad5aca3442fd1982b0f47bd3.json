  "description": "<p>Like an onion, the Earth has layers. In this episode we’ll see if you can dig through those layers to get to the center of the planet. </p>\n<p>We’ll also hear about the Danish scientist who discovered more about Earth’s core by studying earthquakes. Plus, we investigate the phrase “dig a hole to China.” </p>\n<p>Children’s book author and illustrator Oliver Jeffers stops by to talk about the Earth’s crust. “Here We Are,” his book about our vast and wonderful planet, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M3Q4-zCTHc\" class=\"default\">was just turned into a movie </a>(you can find it on Apple TV+). </p>\n<p>And our Moment of Um answers the question: do fish have tongues? All that and a Mystery Sound in this very layered episode!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by KiwiCo (kiwico.com/brainson) and Skylight Frame (skylightframe.com/brains).
