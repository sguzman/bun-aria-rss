Powered by Google Tensor, Google’s first-ever processor, and shipping with <a href=\"http://blog.google/products/android/android-12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Android 12</a>, both phones are fast, smart, secure and designed to adapt to you.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Pixel 6 is an outstanding all-around phone and it starts at only $799. If you want all the advanced capabilities and upgraded finishes, Pixel 6 Pro is the right phone for you, starting at $1,179.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Powering the new Pixel lineup is <a href=\"http://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Tensor</a>, a mobile system on a chip designed specifically around Google’s industry-leading AI. Google Tensor enables entirely new capabilities for your smartphone, and makes Pixel 6 and 6 Pro more helpful and more personal.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Distinct design&nbsp;</b></div><div> Pixel has a bold new design this year with a cohesive look across the software on the inside and the hardware on the outside. The first thing you’ll notice is the Camera Bar, giving the phone a clean, symmetrical design that puts the camera front-and-center.  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0JbEJ7bygwA/YW75gWvZ3XI/AAAAAAAAEj8/rZ5mVU8LpCASYnmz8e9WQFojTVdFUDfkACNcBGAsYHQ/s512/Image%2B2%2Bpixel.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"301\" data-original-width=\"512\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0JbEJ7bygwA/YW75gWvZ3XI/AAAAAAAAEj8/rZ5mVU8LpCASYnmz8e9WQFojTVdFUDfkACNcBGAsYHQ/s400/Image%2B2%2Bpixel.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div> Pixel 6 has a distinctive graphic and vibrant look.. The matte black metal band complements the expressive, versatile colour options. Pixel 6 Pro was inspired by the finishes you see in luxury jewelry and watches. It’s made with a polished metal unibody and transitions into gorgeous curved glass in colors that complement the metallic frames.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of color, Android 12 brings a full redesign to the OS, with Material You.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Android 12 on Pixel 6</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Android 12 builds on the best features of Android so your phone can really be your phone: It can adapt to you, it’s secure by default and private by design. And Android 12 looks especially stunning on Pixel 6.</div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ksYixhq6ItU/YW75qq9gfGI/AAAAAAAAEkE/lttKIaxq1XIT0hIBy3gafaq5pRFjV3iCACNcBGAsYHQ/s512/Image%2B3%2Bpixel.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"512\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ksYixhq6ItU/YW75qq9gfGI/AAAAAAAAEkE/lttKIaxq1XIT0hIBy3gafaq5pRFjV3iCACNcBGAsYHQ/s400/Image%2B3%2Bpixel.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div> When you choose your wallpaper, your entire UI will update to reflect that choice. Everything will feel more responsive and smoother. At a Glance, which shows up on the home and lock screen, has a fresh new look and some new capabilities. Here, you’ll find what you need, right when you need it —  like your boarding pass the day of your flight or stats from your current workout.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>New Pixel, new camera</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have the most advanced cameras we’ve ever built. The entire camera experience is improved from the hardware to Pixel’s revolutionary computational photography.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Both Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have a new 1/1.3 inch sensor on the back. This primary sensor now captures up to 150% more light (compared to Pixel 5’s camera), meaning you’re going to get photos and videos with even greater detail and richer colour. Both phones also have completely new ultrawide lenses with larger sensors, so photos look great when you want to fit more in your shot.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Pixel 6 Pro also has an amazing telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom and up to 20x zoom with an improved version of Pixel’s Super Res Zoom. There’s also an upgraded ultrawide front camera that records 4K video. You can make use of that wider front camera in Snapchat’s new ultrawide selfie feature. Plus, for instant Snapchat access, the new Quick Tap to Snap feature is coming exclusively to Pixel 6 and 6 Pro later this year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"http://blog.google/products/photos/magic-eraser\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Eraser</a> makes distractions in your photos disappear, just like that. With a few taps in Google Photos, remove strangers and unwanted objects.   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kh1FFu3TvqI/YW759y182aI/AAAAAAAAEkQ/3On6YFxkqN4b8drq2gqepzHH34nABCs3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s512/image%2B4.gif\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"512\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kh1FFu3TvqI/YW759y182aI/AAAAAAAAEkQ/3On6YFxkqN4b8drq2gqepzHH34nABCs3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s400/image%2B4.gif\" width=\"400\" /></a></div> Motion Mode features options like Action Pan and Long Exposure, which bring movement to your shots. You can use Action Pan to take photos of your kids riding their scooter or landing crazy skateboarding tricks against a stylish blurred background. Or create beautiful long exposure shots where your subject is moving, like waterfalls or vibrant city scenes.</div><div><br />&nbsp;<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a14-R3k3SD8/YW76F-5RA8I/AAAAAAAAEkU/TM7RK4jXfoMOUw-uljBNY1ePwe_prGDfQCNcBGAsYHQ/s512/image%2B5.gif\" style=\"clear: left; display: inline; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"384\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a14-R3k3SD8/YW76F-5RA8I/AAAAAAAAEkU/TM7RK4jXfoMOUw-uljBNY1ePwe_prGDfQCNcBGAsYHQ/w150-h200/image%2B5.gif\" width=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-82rFeCr0SkA/YW76LgPzcYI/AAAAAAAAEkY/B91JzTmbKms4RsnMAGL4yQ9M7OzfoKBKgCNcBGAsYHQ/s512/image%2B6.gif\" style=\"display: inline; padding: 1em 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"366\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-82rFeCr0SkA/YW76LgPzcYI/AAAAAAAAEkY/B91JzTmbKms4RsnMAGL4yQ9M7OzfoKBKgCNcBGAsYHQ/w143-h200/image%2B6.gif\" width=\"143\" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYayPSEe1mE/YW76RLJnwII/AAAAAAAAEkg/eqbJxAE2i0AZ7DtVXfvSLoib0dpG7PjWwCNcBGAsYHQ/s512/imAGE%2B7.gif\" style=\"display: inline; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"384\" data-original-width=\"512\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYayPSEe1mE/YW76RLJnwII/AAAAAAAAEkg/eqbJxAE2i0AZ7DtVXfvSLoib0dpG7PjWwCNcBGAsYHQ/w265-h199/imAGE%2B7.gif\" width=\"265\" /></a><div><br /></div> Another significant advancement in photography across Pixel and Google Photos is Real Tone. Going back decades, cameras have been designed to photograph light skin — a bias that’s crept into many of our modern digital imaging products and algorithms. Our teams have been working directly with photographers, cinematographers and colorists who are celebrated for their beautiful and accurate imagery of communities of colour. We asked them to test our cameras and editing tools and provide honest feedback, which helped make our camera and auto enhancement features more equitable.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Smarts and speech</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Pixel 6 and 6 Pro also have improved speech recognition and language understanding models, so it can make everyday tasks easier. For instance, you can now use your voice to quickly type, edit, and send messages with Assistant voice typing in Messages, Gmail and more. Let Google Assistant help with adding punctuation, making corrections, inserting emojis and sending your messages – hands-free.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MXIG0e9LEd8/YW79xF1vkNI/AAAAAAAAEkw/nCi-GxWYOTAlObUXVolEtL0zbZl3l814ACNcBGAsYHQ/s512/IMAGE%2B8.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"512\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MXIG0e9LEd8/YW79xF1vkNI/AAAAAAAAEkw/nCi-GxWYOTAlObUXVolEtL0zbZl3l814ACNcBGAsYHQ/w200-h200/IMAGE%2B8.gif\" width=\"200\" /></a><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8TqMguvZD90/YW791KVfsLI/AAAAAAAAEk0/hmHVFdY4jUkpmsMWA9OGeHu4qfITW9zaACNcBGAsYHQ/s512/image%2B9.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"512\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8TqMguvZD90/YW791KVfsLI/AAAAAAAAEk0/hmHVFdY4jUkpmsMWA9OGeHu4qfITW9zaACNcBGAsYHQ/w200-h200/image%2B9.gif\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, Live Translate enables you to message with people in different languages, including English, French, German, Italian and a beta version in Japanese. It works by detecting whether a message in your chat apps, like WhatsApp or Snap, is different from your language, and if so, automatically offers you a translation. All of this detection and processing happens entirely on-device within Private Compute Core, so no data ever leaves the device, and it works even without network connectivity.  With support for Interpreter mode, you’ll also be able to take turns translating what is said in up to 48 languages. Activate Assistant and say “Be my interpreter.”&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TOwPaDefrFM/YW7-A1xEdQI/AAAAAAAAEk4/unLfBFo1vr4rkF7O5cyhRTq_h4TJtCT9QCNcBGAsYHQ/s512/image%2B10.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"512\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TOwPaDefrFM/YW7-A1xEdQI/AAAAAAAAEk4/unLfBFo1vr4rkF7O5cyhRTq_h4TJtCT9QCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/image%2B10.gif\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div>One more thing: when you get an incoming call, just say “accept” or “decline” without having to use “Hey Google” every time by enabling Quick phrases. You can also “stop” and “snooze” alarms and timers!  Get your hands on the new Pixel  Pre-order Pixel 6 today, which starts at $799 and $1179 for the Pixel 6 Pro. You can preorder at gStore, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/event/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-launch/bltba42a34e9d7360d4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, Rogers, Telus, Glentel, Freedom and Amazon. The phones will be available on store shelves with all major Canadian carriers starting on October 28. We’re also launching a new collection of specially <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-6-accessories/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">designed cases</a> for Pixel 6, so you can protect your phone in style.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>However you buy it, and whichever Pixel 6 you pick, we know you are going to love your new phone.</div><div><br /></div><div>Posted by Brian Rakowski, VP, Product Management</div>",
