  "description": "<p>One day in 1961, the famous physicist Richard Feynman stepped in front of a Caltech lecture hall and posed this question to a group of undergraduate students: “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence was passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?”</p> <p>In today’s episode we apply that same thought experiment to some of the greatest thinkers and saints from our tradition. What one sentence would encapsulate their thought? We look at Moses, Jesus, Paul, Augustine, Aquinas, Merton, and even Bishop Barron’s own “cataclysm sentence”!</p> <p>A listener asks whether God made a mistake in creating humans.</p> <h2><strong>Links</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://wordonfireshow.com/sacraments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch “Sacraments” film</a></li> <li>Radio Lab episode – <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cxPzxF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Cataclysm Sentence”</a></li> </ul> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
