  "description": "<p>When your home&rsquo;s value increases by over $50,000 in 2021 alone- you take notice! The average homeowner has access to well over $150,000 in tappable home equity while still maintaining 20% equity in their homes. But just because you <em>can</em> cash out, does that mean you <em>should?</em> As you&rsquo;ve witnessed your home equity continue to balloon, you might be tempted to do something with those newly discovered funds. You might start getting the itch to finally spend some of that &lsquo;hard earned money&rsquo; on a boat or maybe even a lavish vacation. Or maybe you&rsquo;re more of a money nerd and you just hate seeing that equity sitting there underutilized- doesn&rsquo;t it just feel like a waste with those funds sitting around doing virtually nothing? Either way, you might be facing a money decision with five zeros after it, and we want to help you think about it well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed an Above the Threshold of Hell by Burial!
