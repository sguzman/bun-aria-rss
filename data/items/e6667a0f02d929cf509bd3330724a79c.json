  "description": "At long last, Blue Water Farm is generating revenue! Around 20 acres of our land consists of dense, mature hardwood of oak, maple, and beech, and we were able to contract to sell 65 maple and 25 oak trees to a logging company. I won't be retiring from Akamai any time soon from our logging windfall, but it's nice to see some revenue from our land, and clearing mature trees is a part of good responsible forest management.",
