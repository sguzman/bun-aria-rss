I'm serious. And for you over-achievers, try and think of somebody you haven't spoken to in more than 5 years and give them a call. I want you to comment and let me know who that person is and what happened when you hit them up. You'll thank me later :)</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">The brilliance of this show (#humblebrag) is that when people look back and realize what I've done (and what I'm doing), they'll notice I'm creating the base, the foundation, for all the other pieces of content that I'm able to create.
