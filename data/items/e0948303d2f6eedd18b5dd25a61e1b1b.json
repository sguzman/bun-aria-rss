As humans we’re not the most rational and self-aware beings. We often believe that we’re incredibly objective but it probably depends more on the day of the week, how hungry we are, and who we’re talking with. But we believe that by understanding and naming some different behavioral science and economic terms, that we can better realize our tendency to make irrational gut reactions and think differently about how and why we make decisions in the first place.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Volume Integral by Pontoon Brewing- a big thanks to Miguel for donating this one to the podcast!
