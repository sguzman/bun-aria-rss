  "description": "<p>Malaria, a serious disease caused by the plasmodium pathogen which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, affects some 228 million people worldwide each year and kills more than 600,000—90% of whom live in Africa. On World Malaria Day, <strong>Dr. George Dimopolous</strong> of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute talks with <strong>Stephanie Desmon</strong> about his lab’s research into genetically modifying mosquitoes so they can’t carry plasmodium—a potential game-changer in the fight against malaria. They also talk about other approaches to controlling and ending malaria, and techniques being used in the US to fight dengue and Zika.</p>",
