  "description": "Welcome to The Academic Life! In this episode you’ll hear about:\n\nHow journalist Lisa Selin Davis became interested in tomboys.\n\nThe questions that arise when we say the word “gender.”\n\nThe supposed freedoms and limits of being a tomboy.\n\nWhy manufacturers insist that clothing and toys and décor are “gendered.”\n\nA discussion of the book Tomboy: The Surprising History and Future of Girls Who Dare to be Different.\n\n\nToday’s book is: Tomboy: The Surprising History and Future of Girls Who Dare to be Different, which journalist Lisa Selin Davis was inspired to write when her six-year-old daughter first called herself a \"tomboy.” She favored sweatpants and T-shirts over anything pink or princess-themed, just like the sporty and skinned-kneed girls Davis had played with as a kid. But \"tomboy\" seemed like an outdated word, and why use a word with \"boy\" in it for girls? Where do tomboys fit into our understandings of gender? In Tomboy, Davis highlights the forces behind what we think of as masculine and feminine, delving into everything from clothing to psychology, history to neuroscience, and the connection between tomboyism, gender identity, and sexuality. Davis's deep-dive appreciates those who defy traditional gender boundaries, and the incredible people they become.\n\nOur guest is: journalist Lisa Selin Davis, who wrote the novels Belly, and Lost Stars, and the non-fiction book Tomboy: The Surprising History and Future of Girls* Who Dare to Be Different.
