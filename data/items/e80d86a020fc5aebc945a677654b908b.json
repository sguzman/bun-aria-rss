  "description": "Jack Torano has a long and distinguished career but it starts long before the cigar industry. You see, he use to live in Chicago where he was a jingle writer, and part of the team that created the Real Men of Genius campaign for Budweiser. In 2011, he moved to Miami and reconnected with his roots working alongside family at Torano Cigars before they were sold to General Cigars with pretty much no knowledge to anyone outside of Charlie Torano. Within 3 weeks he began working for one of the best kept secrets in the Cigar industry, Roberto Duran Cigars.
