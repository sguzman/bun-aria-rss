  "description": "In this podcast, we look back at a week of ransomware. The FBI succeeds in unlocking the San Bernardino jihadist's iPhone without Apple's help (and Apple like the rest of us would like very much to know why). Policymakers consider their alternatives in cyber conflict, and they run from lawfare to warfare. Tay's briefly let out of her room, but quickly sent back (and that's no April Fooling).\n\nPlus Backchannel's Steven Levy on repeating the cryptowars, and Ben Yelin on the challenges of establishing legal standing against the NSA.",
