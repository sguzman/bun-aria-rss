  "description": "We’ve had nuclear weapons for more than 70 years.  But we have never had a president quite as deranged as Donald Trump before and the result has made more people pay much closer attention to U.S. nuclear weapons policy than they did in recent years.  We bring together this week a great panel to discuss the Nuclear Posture Review, Trump and how to save the world including Joe Cirincione, Jeffrey Lewis, David Sanger, Kori Schake and Rosa Brooks.  One thought: implant the nuclear code in a kitten and make the president kill the kitten to get it before he can use the nuclear code.  Another: Bury the nuclear code in a 10 page long memo and thus rest assured this president will never find it.
