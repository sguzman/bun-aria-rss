  "description": "Two big events in one day! Trump releases ANOTHER Zelensky phone call, and former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifies before Congress. Republicans can’t ask about Hunter Biden, Burisma, or other “debunked conspiracy theories,” but the Democrats can. Yovanovitch said Lutsenko retracted his “do not prosecute” statement, but we know that’s a LIE! All the focus is on how Trump hurt her feelings. Head researcher and writer Jason Buttrill lays out what Republicans should bring up: How was Shokin corrupt? The head of your Anti-Corruption Bureau meddled in the 2016 election! In other news, “Ford vs. Ferrari” is out and Glenn and Stu are going racing. And a Fox News guest is being called anti-Semitic for bringing up George Soros.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
