  "description": "<p>You and your spouse recently decided to move back to your small hometown after giving the big city a try and deciding it's just not for you. But the problem is: you're going to have to give up the job you love, with benefits and more of a salary than you've ever made elsewhere. On top of that, the company is currently paying for you to finish school, so there may be legal consequences if you ditch them on graduation day. So in this Feedback Friday, we'll try to show you how to quit your dream job gracefully.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
