  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, not a single state has certified any electoral vote yet. President Trump has every right to call for a recounting of votes, but the media is doing everything to prevent him from doing so. The Democrats want earlier and earlier voting along with later and later counting. Not only does the President have every right to do what he's doing, but he has an obligation to do it. Then, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany joins the program to discuss the willingness of the Democrat party to cheat the election. It's common sense that their opposition to the recalling of votes means they have everything to hide. This is about the future of elections in this country, and if we don't fight back we are submitting to the leftist takeover. The Trump campaign is fighting back. The Democrats want to turn the entire country into California. What this party did is corrupt and the leftist media refuses to report on it. Next, Pfizer's Coronavirus vaccine is reportedly 90% effective. The only reason we have a vaccine ready so quickly is because of Trump and his Operation Warp Speed. Nonetheless, Joe Biden is trying to slap his name on it and take all the credit. Finally, Sean Parnell calls in to discuss his House run for Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
