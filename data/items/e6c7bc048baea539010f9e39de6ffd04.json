  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Pelosi's announcement om impeachment inquiry changes nothing. The Democrats have been using their Congressional committees to try and cast a patina of impropriety on the President with respect to impeachment. However, it is the responsibility of all members of Congress to vote on whether to pursue impeachment or not. Her focus on the hearsay of someone that claims to have heard from a 'whistleblower' who in fact had no first-hand knowledge of anything, therefore, this is in effect, no 'whistleblower' complaint. This serves the purpose of smearing the president to hurt his poll numbers and weaken him a year before his reelection. This public relations campaign effort must-see for what it really is — an attempt to distract the public from Joe Biden and the Obama Administration's improper actions with the corrupt Ukrainian government. Then, our founders thought-out the impeachment process more than today's Congress understands. George Mason initially requested that maladministration be grounds for impeachment and James Madison fought it because it was too vague and opted for the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors because the President doesn't serve at the will of Congress but at the will of the people. Later, the media is working hand-in-glove with the Democrats to push Biden and Pelosi's pseudo-event. Afterward, Donald Trump Jr. joins the program and reacts to Pelosi's pseudo-event, Hunter Biden's transgressions, and the slew of 2020 candidates. His new book will be out November 5, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
