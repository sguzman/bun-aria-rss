Dating back to the days of Orange Juice and New Order, through The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, it was Guitar Pop that moved you, that you could dance to. But after the death of Britpop there was little to groove to. You can sway and sob to Coldplay, you can do a hyperactive pogo to The Libertines but you can’t dance. In 2004 Franz Ferdinand reignited this shimmying fire by again colliding jangle and funk. And they did so with the best love as a battlefield metaphor this side of Pat Benatar. This is New British Canon and this is the story of “Take Me Out.”\n\n#FranzFerdinand #IndieMusic #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Prologue\n01:53 Franz Ferdinand: An Introduction\n07:10 \"So If You're Lonely...\": Creating Take Me Out\n13:05 \"You Say You Don't Know\": The New Rock Revolution\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
