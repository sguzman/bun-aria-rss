  "description": "Om Sweet Om is the inspiring story of how a stressed-out corporate junkie found her way to a yoga mat--and eventually, back to herself.\nAfter fifteen years of working in the land of cubicles, unreasonable deadlines, and unhealthy habits, Nicole Lovald realized there had to be a better way to live. She had lost sight of how to take care of herself, and her body was letting her know that something had to give. Om Sweet Om: A Corporate Junkie’s Search for Enlightenment (Wise Ink, 2018) takes you through her transformation, as well as the practical tools she used on her mind-body-spirit path.\nIn this book you will find hope, humor, raw emotion, vulnerability, and endless wisdom. The practical exercises sprinkled throughout make for a life-changing experience and will appeal to anyone who has found themselves searching. No matter what it is you seek, Om Sweet Om shares how to quiet the inner mind's chatter and unnecessary striving so that you can become whole again.\nNicole is a former corporate addict turned yoga teacher, life coach, and self-care advocate. She helps people reconnect with their bodies, calm their minds, and live the lives they have imagined for themselves. She is the owner of Spirit of the Lake Yoga and Wellness Center in Excelsior, Minnesota. Nicole is also a trained counselor who has spent much of her career helping veterans, at-risk children, and victims of violence and abuse. A life full of joy, ease, and well-being is her ultimate hope for everyone.\nElizabeth Cronin, Psy.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and mindfulness meditation teacher with offices in Brookline and Norwood, MA. You can follow her on Instagram or visit her website at https://drelizabethcronin.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
