  "description": "<p>This week on Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie has another delightful excuse to talk to Stanley Tucci, this time about his memoir, “Taste: My Life Through Food.” They dive into the deep impact food has had on Stanley’s life and the bitter irony of his recent cancer diagnosis that very nearly killed his ability to eat. The conversation also gets very personal as the pair talk about their shared experience of losing their partners and co-parents to cancer and the loneliness of caring for a loved one who is dying. “If you give up what happens,” Stanley says. “What happens to the kids? What happens to the person who’s sick? You can’t. You have to keep trying.” But don’t worry, they end on a high note. Stanley reads a passage from his book and shares some of his culinary how-tos that will help you in the kitchen and at the dinner table. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Going-There-Katie-Couric/dp/0316535869?&linkCode=sl1&tag=katiecouric07-20&linkId=56eae1af0296e6a316322528f3a84170&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Pre-order Katie Couric’s memoir, “Going There</a>” now to learn more about the most impactful news stories she covered as well as the making of her life and career.
