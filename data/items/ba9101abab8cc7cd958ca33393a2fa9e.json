  "title": "From The Silo: Twitter's Dynamic Duo: My funny, profanity laced, insightful conversation with Rick Wilson and Molly Jong-Fast",
  "description": "Originally Aired: February 15, 2019\nThey're twitter's dynamic duo: he's the peanut butter to her jelly, the Mickey to her Minnie, the Batman to...you get the point. These two guests are hilarious and when you bring them together on this podcast, THEY ARE FIRE. You'd think that leading GOP strategist Rick Wilson and liberal writer Molly Jong-Fast would have nothing in common, but you're wrong. They have two very important things in common; they hate Trump and they love our country. In this podcast we talked about twitter trolls (Molly LOVES them) the best nickname ever given to a shady Governor (thank you Rick) and guesses for 2020, along with a ton of other politichitchat.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
