  "description": "<p>What if you could study for your psychology test in 24 second sound bytes on your iPhone? Now you can.  I recently contacted Parviv - the founder of an app called Clammr. Typically, people use Clammr to stay on top of the news, listen to podcasts or \"top tweets\" and other humorous audio clips. I thought it would make a great test prep tool. So check it out: download Clammr on your iPhone and search for Psych Fest Prep. You can choose from 7 major psychology topics and start studying!</p>\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<p>Put your email address in the Settings>Edit Profile page. When you tap the thumbs up icon on important terms you'll get an email with links to those terms you can listen to again.</p>\n<p>Set \"Skip Heard Clammrs\" to OFF (under Settings>Preferences.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps for your next test. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!</p>",
