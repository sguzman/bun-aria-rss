  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane does something on the show he's never done before. Steve shares more clips of S.E. from the Russian TV archive. Blind Mike thanks the community for reaching out following yesterday's tearjerker. A new sycophant has reached out to Kirk in a scary way and we're uncomfortable. Cynthia Dill has Jim Braude on her bizarre podcast and then calls into the show. Rich Kelleher and Kirk's Painter join us in studio to make the case that Kelleher should be allowed to attend the prayer vigil. By the way, see you in Sherborn, MA at 12:00pm tomorrow. Park at the Town Hall.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
