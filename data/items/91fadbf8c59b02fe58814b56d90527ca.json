  "description": "Painter, shop owner, decorator, and author Sean Scherer joins us this week. We talk about creating authentic interiors that tell a story, and Sean shares the inspiration behind his new book, Kabinett & Kammer. We also talk with Sean about using scale and composition to keep balance and flow within a room, using small objects and bright colors to create a large impact, and why it’s okay to just go ahead and purchase that piece you’ve been eyeing up.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs on some expensive roman shades, rewiring a lamp, a broken chair, tree talk, and exciting new house plans!\n\nIn Sean’s new book, Kabinett & Kammer, he celebrates practical yet beautiful interiors in an honest and humble way. It’s all about taking the things we already have and love and displaying them in a new way to get a striking effect.\n\nSean’s mother was a collector, and by watching her reorganize and repurpose, he fell in love with the process.\n\nIn Sean’s new book, Anderson Cooper wrote the foreword and appreciated the aspect of how we can create a unique and authentic sanctuary for ourselves in our home.\n\nWe can play with scale to make smaller objects more noticeable, and also use smaller objects as a way to experiment with bright colors.\n\nHow Sean shops for the Kabinett & Kammer storefront, and uses the shop as another form of artistic output.\n\nIf you really love something, buy it! It’s all part of building a conversation in our home that shows what we love and who we are.\n\nWays we can take an object and successfully use it out of context, like a great taxidermy piece.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n\nKaren's roller shades\n\nKabinett & Kammer\n\nKabinett & Kammer Book\n\n@kabinettandkammer\n\n\n﻿Find all of the Show Notes at Ballarddesigns.com/podcast",
