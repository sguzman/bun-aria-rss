  "description": "<p>In holography, the IR behavior of a quantum system at nonzero density is\ndescribed by the near horizon geometry of an extremal charged black hole. It is\ncommonly believed that for systems on $S^3$, this near horizon geometry is\n$AdS_2\\times S^3 $. We show that this is not the case: generic static,\nnonspherical perturbations of $AdS_2\\times S^3 $ blow up at the horizon,\nshowing that it is not a stable IR fixed point. We then construct a new near\nhorizon geometry which is invariant under only $SO(3)$ (and not $SO(4)$)\nsymmetry and show that it is stable to $SO(3)$-preserving perturbations (but\nnot in general). We also show that an open set of nonextremal,\n$SO(3)$-invariant charged black holes develop this new near horizon geometry in\nthe limit $T \\to 0$. Our new IR geometry still has $AdS_2$ symmetry, but it is\nwarped over a deformed sphere. We also construct many other near horizon\ngeometries, including some with no rotational symmetries, but expect them all\nto be unstable IR fixed points.\n</p>",
