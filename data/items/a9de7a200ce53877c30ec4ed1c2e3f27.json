  "description": "This episode is a little different since I included an extra bit of conversation that we had been having with the audio off. It concerns economy and man. After that, we move on to the actual episode. It concerns the three modes of persuasion. If you ever hope to convince someone to do something, and do it with commitment, you're going to have to use these. Ethos concerns the trustworthiness of the speaker. Logos concerns the use of logic and avoidance of fallacy, and pathos concerns the emotions. ",
