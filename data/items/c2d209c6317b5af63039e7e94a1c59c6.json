A surrogate worries she may have to settle for a guy who’s not quite right. And a 25-year-old virgin wonders how and when she should… lose it. </p><p>*</p><p>Executive Producer Nick Stumpf</p><p>Produced by Catherine Law</p><p>Edited & Engineered by Brandon Dickert</p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>*</em></p><p><em>The views and opinions expressed are solely those of the Podcast author, or individuals participating in the Podcast, and do not represent the opinions of iHeartMedia or its employees.  This Podcast should not be used as medical advice, mental health advice, mental health counseling or therapy, or as imparting any health care recommendations at all.  Individuals are advised to seek independent medical, counseling advice and/or therapy from a competent health care professional with respect to any medical condition, mental health issues, health inquiry or matter, including matters discussed on this Podcast.
