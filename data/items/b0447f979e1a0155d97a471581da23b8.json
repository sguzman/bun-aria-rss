  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the Best of Mark Levin. Judge Emmett Sullivan did not conduct himself as a jurist today, he was out of control. Sullivan accused a 3-star General, a hero, of treason. Retired Lt General Michael Flynn has a legal gun to his head and hasn't done anything that Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and James Comey haven't done. His conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, and the substance of his conversation were not illegal. Yet the FBI interviewed him twice and advised him to waive his right to counsel, even though the protocol calls for it. Yet this Judge has the gall to call this General treasonous because he knows that he can say whatever he wants because of his black robe and lifetime appointment. This might be a shocker, but the vast majority of unregistered foreign agents lobbying abroad have not been prosecuted. Later, the increasing federal deficit is robbing our children and grandchildren - how dare they allow this to happen? When will the Republicans and White House start fighting back? The massive influx of foreigners into our country and our debt are out of control. The laws of economics trump the laws of politics, and it takes true leaders to cut spending. Afterwards, open-ended immigration takes a toll on younger workers and college kids who often compete with immigrants. Simply put, immigration without assimilation undercuts Americanization.
