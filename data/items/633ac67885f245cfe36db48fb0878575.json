You&#8217;re probably used to this if you&#8217;ve been taking the course I&#8217;ve released in the past few years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially however, I derived everything by hand (using a digital pen). This has several advantages, such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being slower so that you can take your time following along</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing you to &#8220;feel&#8221; where the equations come from &#8211; it&#8217;s like making a painting!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are also disadvantages. For example, handwriting is messy and some people have trouble reading it. As many students requested typeset equations, I began using those instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, that has disadvantages too:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Being too fast, because the equation just shows up instantly. There&#8217;s not much to &#8220;say&#8221; to make it stay on the screen longer, and we can&#8217;t just sit there in silence.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">If you&#8217;re not the type of student that writes things down (despite my recommendations!) you won&#8217;t get the &#8220;feel&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So with my Bayesian Linear Regression course, as I was &#8220;proofwatching&#8221; the lectures, I noticed that things seemed to go by pretty fast, even for me (the person who made the lectures!). Although do note that I watch at 2x speed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, what I wanted to try was reintroducing handwritten derivations. This might be &#8220;new&#8221; for you if you&#8217;ve only taken my newest courses, but those who&#8217;ve been around since the beginning know that this is how it all started!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOW CAN YOU HELP?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m giving you free access to the first few videos of the course.</span></p>\n<p>LaTeX Lecture 1: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ef2f_MUdJ3Y\">https://youtu.be/ef2f_MUdJ3Y</a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ef2f_MUdJ3Y\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>LaTeX Lecture 2: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zS6KpzrV6Xc\">https://youtu.be/zS6KpzrV6Xc</a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zS6KpzrV6Xc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>Handwritten Lecture: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W_PgOv9XsWw\">https://youtu.be/W_PgOv9XsWw</a></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_PgOv9XsWw\" width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The handwritten lecture goes over the same material as the first 2 LaTeX lectures, so you can compare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much you understood with just the LaTeX lectures</li>\n<li>What, if any, improvement you had in your understanding after watching the handwritten lecture</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After watching the videos, please fill out the following survey to let me know your thoughts (it&#8217;s really just one question).</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/4cWGmw5YmNyup66J9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://forms.gle/4cWGmw5YmNyup66J9</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By letting me know what you prefer, you can help guide the creation of future courses and ensure they are presented in a manner that suits you best.
