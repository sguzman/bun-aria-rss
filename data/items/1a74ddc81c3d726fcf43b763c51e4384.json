They need to be cared for like any broken bone.<br />\nIf we continue to ignore our heartbreaks, that pain will never heal. It will carry with us for years, or even decades.<br />\nOn this episode of The School of Greatness I'm joined again by the amazing psychologist, Guy Winch, to discuss emotional pain -- whether it's from a break up, the loss of a loved one, or any other negative feelings that may be holding you back in life.<br />\nDr. Guy Winch, is a licensed psychologist, author, and in-demand keynote speaker whose books have been translated into twenty-four languages.<br />\nDr. Winch's viral TED Talk, Why We All Need to Practice Emotional First Aid, has been viewed over 5 million times and is rated among the top 5 most inspiring talks of all time on TED.com.<br />\nHis upcoming book, How to Fix a Broken Heart, just came out and that's what we dove into in this episode.<br />\nPreviously on the show (way back in year 1), we talked about the idea of \"emotional first aid\" and how important it is for us to learn how to heal our emotional injuries just like we do our physical ones.<br />\nHowever, as Guy pointed out, heartbreak is a special kind of emotional pain and there are certain behaviors that support us in healing from this (and many that don't.)<br />\nLearn how to understand yourself and your friends in heartbreak, and heal the healthy way, on Episode 601.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do we communicate with someone who has a broken heart?
