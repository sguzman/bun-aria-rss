It's found two days later, parked in an apartment complex over a mile from her home and wiped clean. Jennifer Kesse has not been seen since  2006. </p>\n<p>Now her uncle, Bill Gilmour, describes the restless nights since then and his emotional journey to find peace, in a new book  \"Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey and Other Stories of Hope.\" </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bill Gilmour - Jennifer's Uncle, Author: \"Aftermath of Jennifer Kesse’s Abduction: An Uncle’s Inspiring Journey & Other Stories of Hope\" InspiringHopeDaily.com, Facebook.com/bgilmour1, Twitter: @InspireHopeBill</li>\n<li>Matthew Mangino - Attorney, Former District Attorney (Lawrence County), Former Parole Board Member, Author: \"The Executioner's Toll: The Crimes, Arrests, Trials, Appeals, Last Meals, Final Words and Executions of 46 Persons in the United States\", MattMangino.com, Twitter: @MatthewTMangino </li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, CarynStark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\"</li>\n<li>Joseph Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\"</li>\n<li>Ray Caputo - Investigative Reporter (Orlando, FL), Professor, Bethune-Cookman University  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>TIPLINE</strong>: <strong> Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (866) 838-1153 </p>\n<p><strong>Kesse Family Tip Line </strong>(941) 201-4009 </p>\n<p><strong>JenniferKesse.com</strong><strong>GoFundme.com/help-us-find-jennifer-kesse </strong></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
