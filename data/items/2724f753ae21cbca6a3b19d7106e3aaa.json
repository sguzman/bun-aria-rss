  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Patriots and the Rams and make a couple of gambling predictions, and why a Jared Goff live bet could be the play based on some recent trends. Also joining the program to chat about everything going on in the NFL is friend of the program, Insider for the NFL Network, Tom Pelissero. Pat and Tom chat about the Dez Bryant situation in Baltimore and if players are getting tested in pregame warmups, Christian McCaffrey's injury status, who we should keep an eye on in the coaching carousel, and what's next for Carson Wentz (22:50-48:15). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 9x Pro Bowler, 7x All-Pro, NFL 2000's All-Decade team, eventual first ballot Hall of Famer, DeMarcus Ware joins the program to chat about his new virtual trainer app D2W, what he thinks the problem with the Cowboys is, watching Peyton Manning run a team, and who the toughest QB to sack during his career was (50:31-1:15:49). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about tonight's Thursday Night Football game, Ohio State getting into the Big Ten Championship, and everything else going on in the sports world (1:37:42-1:58:47).
