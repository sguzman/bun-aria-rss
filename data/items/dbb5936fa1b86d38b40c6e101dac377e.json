  "description": "We’ve had a lot of questions lately about people with floor plans that are hard for them to know what to do when trying to pull their house together in a beautiful, cohesive way. With a split level open area, you can give both areas their own interpretations to give them separate personalities instead of giving the two similar designs. We give our thoughts one what to do if you have a room with two focal points, such as a TV on one side and a fireplace on the other. In this situation, we suggest splitting the room so that you can have an area facing the fireplace with maybe a chess table, and then a couch facing the other way to focus on the TV. For traffic flow, try pulling things away from the wall when possible, to help in letting people travel around through the room. Rugs are great for creating multiple groupings of furniture and other elements to pull everything in that small area together when you may not have a wall to do so. <br /><br />Our awesome website 1:18<br />Split level open area 2:09<br />What to do with more than one focal point 5:57<br />An open concept floor plan and decorating a two story room’s final layer 10:01<br />Traffic flow 14:44<br />The rug 17:30<br /><br />“We don’t live in a big house, but I do love when I turn to go down this hallway where our bedrooms are at and it’s just art, but the biggest piece of art, and the most dynamic piece of art and the glossiest piece of art is at the very end and I flip on the lights and I’m like ‘Ah, there you are!’ Vantage points are so critical.” 16:55<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
