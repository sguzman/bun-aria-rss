  "description": "<p>We could share the best money tips out there with you every single episode, but it would never really matter if you haven’t identified proper money goals for your life. What good is it to know the best ways to earn more, spend less, and invest your money if you don’t even know <em>why</em> it is that you’re doing those things? And unfortunately if you haven’t identified your money goals and the ‘why’ behind your money, then it’s easy for money itself to become the end goal. Gaining more wealth can become the default metric that you <em>think</em> will make you happy, but in reality that happiness is fleeting. So this episode is all about discovering our passions, figuring out what we want to spend our money on, and thinking through how we want to spend our days. And then we talk through the SMARTER approach to goal setting to ensure that we are taking the steps to get us where we want to be.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Alpha Abstraction IPA Vol 13 by Wild Leap! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
