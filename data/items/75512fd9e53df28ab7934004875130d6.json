  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron chats with Ido Levanon, the chief executive officer and director of Dragontail Systems, to explore how artificial intelligence and autonomous delivery systems are transforming the foodservice industry.<br /><br />Three Key Points:<br /><br />The Algo Platform and QT system use a patented algorithm and artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way restaurants operate. The QT system autonomously monitors prep and cooking processes in the kitchen, ensuring a seamless back-of-house experience.<br /><br />The Algo Dispatching system sits on top of a restaurant’s own infrastructure to ensure that food always arrives hot, fresh, and a perfect match to what the customer ordered. Algo simultaneously automates kitchen flow as well as the driver dispatch process.<br /><br />The goal for Dragontail is to eliminate as many manual operations as possible so as to ensure orders are delivered quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Third party systems are fully integrated into the platform.<br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />“[The QT system] is like putting a super manager in the store, making the most optimized decisions.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />“We are the only company that managed to develop a camera that can watch what’s going on with the kitchen, connect to the point of sale, recognize what belongs to what, and guide the kitchen staff to the point where they make no mistakes.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />“The ultimate [delivery] solution for any QSR where at least 20 percent of the business comes from delivery is to use a combination. Use your own drivers, but during peak times, use third-party drivers.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business insights to the next level. The restaurant industry isn't just the business of food. It's a cross-functioning, multivariate entity that touches almost every industry — after all, everyone needs to eat. So, why not learn from the greats from all businesses? Connect the dots, read between the lines, build innovative strategies, become a thought leader, get the inside scoop on trends and open your eyes to the full vision of restaurant and hospitality with The Barron Report.<br /><br />To keep listening to The Barron Report, check out the podcast on iTunes Now!",
