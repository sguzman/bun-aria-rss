  "description": "When<em> Soul Train </em>was first nationally syndicated in October 1971, there was nothing else like it on TV. It became an iconic Black music and dance show — a party every weekend that anyone could join from their living room. In the first episode of a three-part series exploring crossover in pop music, we break down the lasting influence of <em>Soul Train </em>on our culture with Hanif Abdurraqib, author of <em>A Little Devil in America</em>. We ask: Why has there never been another show like <em>Soul Train </em>since it went off the air? <em>You can follow us on Twitter @NPRItsBeenAMin and email us at samsanders@npr.org.</em>",
