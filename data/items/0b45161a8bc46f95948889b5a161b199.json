  "description": "Patrick O'Flynn is an MEP for the East of England and recently defected from UKIP to the SDP. Yes, the SDP are still going and they're Eurosceptic. Paddy takes us inside UKIP, his experience of being a 'centrist' member of it and shines a light on some of the disputes within the party in the last few years, including the final one with Gerrard Batten and why he could no longer stay in the party. He and Matt also discuss what a No Deal Brexit would mean. This one really could have lasted ten hours.
