  "description": "<p><p>America's most compelling on-air personality is back. In his debut at Barstool Sports, Kirk Minihane settles some scores with old enemies, telling the truth about his battles with politically correct social justice warriors, the Boston Red Sox and the Boston Globe. Minihane's enemies may have successfully deplatformed him from dying terrestrial radio, but he will have the last laugh. Speaking of laughs... How is Minihane adjusting to his new life as a nomadic podcaster? What kind of porn is he into these days? How long will his new producer endure the abuse? All this and more as Kirk Minihane begins the new saga in his quest to confront everything and captivate everyone.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
