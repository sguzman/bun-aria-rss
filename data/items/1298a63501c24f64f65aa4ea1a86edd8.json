We delved into the high-speed world of the American heiress Lucy Schell, a motorsport obsessive and the top American driver in the Monte Carlo Rally.

She brought Delahaye automobiles back from the brink of bankruptcy to take on Hitler’s Silver Arrow Grand Prix racers. We also discussed how motoring was integral to Hitler's grand plans for a militarised Germany, and how the success of individuals like Schell and Dreyfus was such a thorn in the side of Nazi doctrine.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Subscribe to History Hit and you'll get access to hundreds of history documentaries, as well as every single episode of this podcast from the beginning (400 extra episodes).
