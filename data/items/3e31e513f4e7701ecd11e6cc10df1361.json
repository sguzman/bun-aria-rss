  "description": "All this impeachment nonsense has Glenn feeling downright nauseated. Mitch McConnell addresses the Senate and lays out everything wrong with what Democrats have done. If the Senate takes up the impeachment, it will forever lower the bar to impeach a U.S. president, and the parties will never stop impeaching. Tulsi Gabbard simply voted \"present\" on the articles of impeachment. Even the press understands how partisan the impeachment is. Rep. Karen Bass and her \"uncontestable\" facts on impeachment turn out to be quite contestable. Chuck Todd, of all people, thinks Donald Trump doesn't revere the Constitution. Remember when Democrats warned against a partisan impeachment? What a difference 20 years makes.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
