  "description": "Glenn sits down with Bob Goff, a former attorney of 25 years and New York Times Best-Selling author of the book, \"Love Does.\" He is also recognized as a diplomat by the U.S. Department of State as well as an Honorary Consul for the Republic of Uganda. Their conversation involves Bob's philosophy and how one gets to that point of faith and contentment when it comes to loving those around you and who you've given control of your life. They also talk about the world as we know it and to ultimately realize that we don't know everything that goes on around us and to take a genuine interest in the people around us. During the conversation, they also discuss God's love in each of their lives and how people who don't believe in God replace that level of power that Christians have available to them through salvation. Ultimately, when we share God with other people, Bob Goff says that we should always do it with love because, at the end of the day, \"it isn't flesh or blood that reveals Him, but the spirit itself.\" (Matthew 16:17) \nLearn more about your ad choices.
