And beating ourselves up, thinking ourselves worthless, do not move us towards that goal.” [11:40]<br /> <br />“If you're doing that - working really hard to get exceptional at something that matters, that the world cares about and that you love, and then you contribute in a way that elevates you and other people - that's the game of fulfillment.” [18:26]<br /> <br />“If you're doing that - working really hard to get exceptional at something that matters, that the world cares about and that you love, and then you contribute in a way that elevates you and other people - that's the game of fulfillment.” [18:26]<br /> <br />“The whole idea is as you lower that stress and anxiety, you get into a calm and creative space where you can problem solve.
