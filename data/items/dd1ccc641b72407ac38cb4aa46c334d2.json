  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, It’s in the media’s best interest to keep hyping the coronavirus. We get a mix of politics and President Trump-hating and we can’t get a straight story from this shameless reporting. You need perspective when reporting on stories like this, and these Democrat hacks dressed as journalists have none. How come Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer aren't asked what they were doing during the beginning of breakout? As a result of the democrat's phony impeachment, Congress was paralyzed. Also, the Democrat establishment has rallied around Joe Biden, about whom there are legitimate and serious questions respecting his mental fitness to serve as president. So now, with the aggressive help of the media, we’re being told and warned that we mustn’t raise this issue. This is how the Democrat Party press hopes to control the debate. In the meantime, anything goes when trashing Trump. Finally, Bob Woodson slams the New York Times' diabolical 1619 Project on Life, Liberty & Levin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
