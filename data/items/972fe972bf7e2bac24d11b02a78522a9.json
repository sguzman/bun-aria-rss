  "description": "<p>You're going to be shocked to find out how much your liver function impacts your body's fat loss (or lack thereof). Your liver is often referred to as the \"second brain\" of your body, and for good reason.</p> <p>Your liver has responsibilities in regulating hormone function, assimilating nutrients, and handling insulin, just to name a few.
