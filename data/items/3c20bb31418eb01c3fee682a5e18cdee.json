  "description": "<p>On this episode of The Psychology Podcast, we interview bestselling author Ryan Holiday about the timeless life-advice he gleaned from researching his latest book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015NTIXWE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\">Ego Is The Enemy</a>. Ryan shares insights from great individuals that eschewed the spotlight to put their higher goals above their desires for recognition.<strong> </strong>We talk about the importance of talking less and doing more. Our conversation covers the human drive to live a meaningful life and the dramatic shifts in worldview that takes place when astronauts view earth from outer space. We discuss the well-being benefits of integrating behavior with personal values and we commiserate over feeling existentially compelled to squeeze every last drop of productivity from each moment. It’s an interesting look at the foibles of egoism; anyone interested in contemplating what it means to live a good life would do well to give this episode a listen.
