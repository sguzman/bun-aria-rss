  "title": "878 How to Build Life Changing Habits and Break Addiction with Dr. Jud Brewer",
  "description": "<p>YOUR EGO NEEDS FEEDING. We all have addictions. Some of us know exactly what habits we need to break. Others don’t even realize we’re addicted to unhealthy patterns. Whether it’s smoking, relationships, or simply being addicted to ourselves, we could all benefit from mapping out our habits to begin to understand them. It’s important to foster our curiosity. If we can learn to investigate our minds the way we investigated our environment as children, we can begin to understand ourselves.  Sometimes it’s our ego that we continue to feed. Other times it’s a false sense of reward we think we’re receiving from an old habit. Through mindfulness, we can learn to experience our habits as they are and not as we remember them. When we do this, we can begin breaking even our most challenging addictions. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, we discuss optimizing habits, breaking addictions, and transforming your life with one of the kindest addiction psychiatrists and mindfulness experts that I have ever met: Dr. Jud Brewer. Dr. Jud Brewer is the Director of Research and Innovation at the Mindfulness Center and associate professor in psychiatry at the School of Medicine at Brown University, as well as a research affiliate at MIT. As an addiction psychiatrist and internationally known expert in mindfulness training for treating addictions, Dr. Jud has developed and tested novel mindfulness programs for habit change, including both in-person and app-based treatments for smoking, and emotional eating and anxiety. So get ready to learn how mindfulness can free you from addiction on Episode 878.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat was the hardest addiction for you to overcome? (11:05)<br />\nWhat is the first thing people can do to self-assess themselves? (21:45)<br />\nWhat are the 5 or 6 common addictions that most people have? (22:30)<br />\nAre meditation and mindfulness the solution to everything? (36:00)<br />\nAre there any addictions that you have not been able to overcome? (46:55)<br />\nWhat’s the difference between a habit and an addiction? (50:00)<br />\nIs mental illness something that can be cured? (54:30)<br />\nWhat is the difference between mindfulness and overthinking? (57:50)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout the ego and how many people are addicted to themselves (13:25) <br />\nHow mapping out your habit loops can help you understand the truth about your experiences. (21:00)<br />\nThe power of curiosity (20:00) <br />\nAbout reward-based learning (26:30) <br />\nThe science behind reward-based learning and how it helps us understand changing behavior (31:30) <br />\nHow to hack cravings with curiosity (34:30) <br />\nHow Dr. Jud’s apps help you map out your habits and start your habit-breaking journey (42:00)<br />\nAbout positive habits and when they become problematic (45:00) <br />\nAbout the two types of curiosity (52:00) <br />\nWhy we continue to struggle so much when the answers are often right in front of us (59:00) <br />\nThe science behind the effect of true generosity, kindness, and connection on our habits (1:07:00)<br />\nPlus much more...<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/878 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
