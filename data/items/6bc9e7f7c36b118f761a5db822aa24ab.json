  "description": "The Greenbrier Ghost. Greenbrier County, West Virginia. 1897. Mary Heaster did what she could to vet the men that were interested in seeing her daughter. She didn't have much success. Her daughter would become pregnant just before one man left. She would also marry a man just a few weeks after meeting him. A drifter named Erasmus Trout Shue. When the young woman dies unexpectedly, her husband seems to be overcome with grief. So much so that he will not leave her side until after the funeral. The investigation is closed as no foul play is suspected. When Zona's mother asks the prosecutor re-open the case, she has an unlikely source for the information she has implicating her son-in-law in the crime. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
