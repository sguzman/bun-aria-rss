  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doubt creeps in, it can feel suffocating: sometimes it’s in the middle of a mundane chore, other times it consumes our thoughts when we finally get a moment to ourselves. Is there hope when we doubt God? In this episode, Emily reads a collection of verses to meditate on as we navigate doubt in the throes of motherhood. As we reflect on the truths God reveals through his Word, we can cast our cares on him and trust his faithfulness. Because of Christ, we don’t have to hide our fears and questions—we pray these verses remind you that the Lord sustains and provides for his children in every season.</span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: We understand that spiritual doubts can arise from a wide variety of factors and causes.</span></em> <strong><em>Please keep in mind that some instances of doubt may require professional counseling or pastoral care.</em></strong> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself in a situation that feels much larger than the topics we cover in this series, we encourage you to seek help from professionals who are trained to care for you best in this struggle.</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scripture quotations are from the ESV® Bible (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version®), Copyright © 2001 by Crossway, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.
