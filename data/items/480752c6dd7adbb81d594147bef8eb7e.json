In this Vintage story from 2011, Comic Book Writer and Educator Jason McNamara desperately wants out of his live-in relationship, but this self-professed coward can’t seem to confront his partner Elise. So while his girlfriend leaves town to ponder their problems, Jason’s coworker Bridget shows up at his door in fishnets and a catholic school girl skirt, and suddenly his love life, home life, face and employment are changed forever. Will this cautionary tale change how you think about Non-Monogamy? #CaughtInTheAct #Redhead #Cheating #Lawyer</strong></p> <div>Wanna watch the Vintage video?
