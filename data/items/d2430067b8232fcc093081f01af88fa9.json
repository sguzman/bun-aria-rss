I also wanted to learn LaTeX properly so writing my thesis will be less painful (as if that’s possible).</p>\n\n<p>So, I did both, and wrote a 70-something page long document from my notes of the <a href=\"http://www.ulaff.net/\">Linear Algebra Foundations and Frontiers</a> course by The University of Texas at Austin. It still isn’t completely finished and I’m sure there are tons of typos in it but here it is:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/assets/laff_notes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn--primary btn--block\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-alt\" style=\"padding-right:20px\"></i>LAFF notes</a></p>\n\n<p>It helped me a lot to write things down and understand linalg concepts more in depth, hope it helps you too as quick reference or learning aid.</p>",
