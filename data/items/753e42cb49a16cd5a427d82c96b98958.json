  "title": "Episode 73: Brook and Robin Lopez (featuring Mina Kimes and Shea Serrano)",
  "description": "Ok, we here at the Old Man and the Three don't usually toot our own horn, but we feel each OM3 interview is pretty damn entertaining. However, with that being said, JJ and Tommy reach some rarified air with this episode as they welcome in the Lopez brothers (Brook and Robin) to discuss everything from childhood fights, being teammates in the NBA, beating up NBA mascots, not being able to room together because their cats don't get along, and so much more. Honestly, it almost seems as though JJ and Tommy might have been able to sit this one out and just let Brook and Robin hash everything out for themselves. I mean, after all, Robin did punch Brook in the face when they were sleeping in bunk beds as kids. So, to say it was an entertaining interview is quite the understatement. Now, you would think that would be enough for one episode, but there's more. Joining the show for the OM3 Top 5/Draft is the lovely and talented Mina Kimes... and the equally lovely and talented Shea Serrano. Both add their incredible wit and humor to the draft, which focuses on \"the top 5 fictional schools you would like to have attended\".
