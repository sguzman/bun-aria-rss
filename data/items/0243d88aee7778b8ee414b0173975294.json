But hope knows that people change on a timeline that&nbsp;we can't predict. We can never know the power that a word of kindness and or an&nbsp;act of forgiveness will have on the person who needs it most.”</p><p>Shaka Senghor</p><br><p><br></p><p>Imagine yourself growing up around the wrong people. Because it's easy, you fall into the wrong crowd. Blink, and you’re in. Deep. A victim of&nbsp;impossible circumstances, it’s not long before you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the reflexive moment — impulsively and without thought&nbsp;– you do the wrong thing. A thing so terrible, it forever alters the trajectory of your life. A thing so unimaginably horrible, you dedicate the rest of your life in service to atonement.</p><p>This is the story of Shaka Senghor.&nbsp;At the age of 19, Shaka shot and killed a man. Convicted of second-degree murder, Shaka would spend the next 19 years in different prisons, seven of which were spent in solitary confinement.</p><p>While inside, Shaka made a decision. A decision to fully own his circumstances. A decision to transcend victimhood, understand his past, free his mind and expand his thinking. When he wasn't voraciously reading, he wrote. And it was through this relentless commitment to knowledge, self-understanding and compassion that he ultimately pulled himself out of the anger that led to his incarceration and prevented him from reaching his full potential.</p><p>Released in 2010, Shaka did not return to a life of violence. Instead, he committed himself to one singular idea: that our worst deeds don’t define who we are, nor do they prohibit our contribution to a better world.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Fidelity to this ideal transformed Shaka's utterly broken life into one of meaning, purpose and advocacy. Now a leading voice in prison reform, he is a powerful public speaker, a Senior Fellow with the Dream Corps, a 2014 TED Prize finalist, a former <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ssenghor/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab Director’s Fellow,</a> a former University of Michigan lecturer, a current Fellow in the inaugural class of the W.K.
