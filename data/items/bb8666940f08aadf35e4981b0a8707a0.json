  "description": "<p>In early 1992, young married couple Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka seemed to have a lot going for them. They'd just gotten married, Paul was making good money, and they were living in a nice house in scenic Port  Dalhousie, Ontario. But they were harboring some real, real dark secrets. Paul was the Scarborough rapist - authorities had been looking for the man that raped over a dozen women going back at least five years. And together, the pair had now raped and killed at least two women. And their first truly horrific crime together involved Karla's fifteen-year-old sister Tammy. How did they get to such a disturbing place? Find out on this week's true crime episode of Timesuck!  <br /><br />The 2021 Bad Magic (Virtual) Gathering.
