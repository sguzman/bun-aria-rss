  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In the past, the transition from childhood to adulthood was just a few awkward years. New research says the transition is now much, much longer. According to Kara Powell and Steve Argue from the Fuller Youth Institute, childhood is ending earlier with 14-year-olds encountering very adult issues, while many 28-year-olds continue to live like teenagers. How do we respond as parents and faith communities to this prolonged adolescence? Powell and Argue are here to discuss their new book, “Growing With,” and their insightful research on the topic. Also this week: Professional female athletes in the UK are accused of bigotry for objecting to transgender women in sports, and Phil gets excited about glitter-farting trolls.</p>",
