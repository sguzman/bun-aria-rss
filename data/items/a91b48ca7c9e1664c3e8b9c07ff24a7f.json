  "description": "Hey Trumpcast listeners! Your host Virginia has some big news. Her next podcast—After Trump—is a guidebook alongside legal scholars Jack Goldsmith and Bob Bauer—both former Trumpcast guests—to reforming our laws, norms, and ethical codes so we never get in that fix again. After Trump is coming soon to a podcast app near you. To learn more, go to AfterTrumpPod.com. But first, Virginia is here to introduce an episode of a show she hopes you'll check out: What Next, a daily news podcast from Slate.\n\nLast week, The New York Times reported that Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz was under investigation by the Justice Department over his relationships with women recruited online for sex, and whether he had sex with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz gained national attention for his trollish, Trumpian antics and fiery loyalty to the then-president. What happens if the Trump playbook doesn’t work for the 38-year-old congressman? In this episode, host Mary Harris discusses all this and more with Jeff Weiner, Criminal Justice and Public Safety Editor for the Orlando Sentinel. \n\nIf you like what you hear, subscribe to What Next.
