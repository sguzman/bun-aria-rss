  "description": "<p>In this 96th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss society, and how to have a functional one. Beginning with a discussion of 9/11, Bret then reads an excerpt from an essay he wrote after the November 2015 Paris attacks. We then share an excerpt from the final chapter of our forthcoming book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, in which we discuss historical frontiers—geographic, technological, and transfer-of-resource. We call for a fourth kind of frontier, and discuss austerity and value, progress and discovery. We compare narrative with analysis, and how most people are not in fact stupid. We discuss the Maya, and what we can learn from them. We also discuss our new nemesis, the very hungry caterpillar.<br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
