  "description": "<p>This show exists to make sure that you know the best ways to earn, save, and invest your money so that ultimately you’re in a great financial position down the road. And a part of that journey towards financial independence includes making sure that you have the right attitudes towards money and that you’re not only looking to your own desires, but that you’re looking to the needs of others as well. This is why giving away money is such an important practice to begin implementing ASAP. It’s not a principle or stage of enlightenment that you might reach someday. Rather it’s like working out- the earlier in life you get started, the better off you’re going to be in the long run. Listen to the different reasons we should be giving away our money, how to vet charities, and how to actually go about implementing giving into our personal finance.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Party Cup by North Park Beer Co - thanks to Craig for donating this one to the show!
