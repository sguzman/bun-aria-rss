  "title": "242: A Buddhist Approach to Money Worries | Ethan Nichtern",
  "description": "No matter what your economic situation is, you have likely experienced some money worries during this pandemic. I know I have- and I say that as someone who is in an extremely fortunate position. So many people have lost businesses, lost jobs, had salaries cut- or we are worried about one of these things happening to us. Given the massive insecurity and uncertainty abroad in the land, we wanted to explore a Buddhist approach to financial concerns. It's not like the Buddha never said anything on this matter. He wasn't expecting all meditators to live in caves with shaved heads. There's a ton of useful stuff in Buddhism on the issue of money, and there are a lot of meditative techniques for handling our financial anxieties. So we brought on a great Buddhist teacher by the name of Ethan Nichtern. He's been on the show before. He has written a few books, including one called The Road Home. He also hosts a podcast by the same name. We had a great chat, and I'm excited to bring it to you.\nFree App access for Health Care Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nWhere to find Ethan Nichtern online:\nWebsite: https://www.ethannichtern.com/\nSocial Media:\nTwitter: Ethan Nichtern (@ethannichtern) / https://twitter.com/ethannichtern\nFacebook: Ethan Nichtern / https://www.facebook.com/EthanNichtern/\nBook Mentioned: The Dharma of the Princess Bride, by Ethan Nichtern / https://www.amazon.com/Dharma-Princess-Bride-Buddhism-Relationships/dp/0865477760\nOther Resources Mentioned:\nSharon Salzberg / https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/\nBodhisattva / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva\nThe Eight Worldly Winds / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Buddhism#Eight_Worldly_Conditions\nJoseph Goldstein / https://10percenthappier.app.link/TEXKruciQ5\nBuddha’s Brain, by Rick Hanson / https://www.rickhanson.net/books/buddhas-brain/\nThe Road Home podcast / https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-road-home-with-ethan-nichtern/id1392813061\nWhy Buddhism is True by Robert Wright / https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195455\nGive and Take: Why Helping Others Drives by Adam Grant / https://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986\nInvisible Hands / https://www.invisiblehandsdeliver.com/\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/ethan-nichtern-242\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
