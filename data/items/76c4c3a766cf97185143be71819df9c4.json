The kid immediately rushes over to the dog and tries to enter OP's house, but OP stops the child because the dog can be a little aggressive. Naturally, the mother flips out and threatens to call the cops on OP for having an aggressive dog if he doesn't let her child pet it. Later, OP finds the child trying to harass the dog in his own backyard.</p>\n",
