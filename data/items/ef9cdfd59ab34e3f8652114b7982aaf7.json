  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Francisco Ferreira, Professor Ricardo Hausmann, Professor Adnan Khan, Professor Lucinda Platt | \nJoin us to discuss a special issue of LSE's Public Policy Review, a brand new public policy journal. The special LSEPPR issue on COVID 19 is now available LSE's Public Policy Review.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents an extraordinary health and economic global challenge as well as an opportunity to re-evaluate many aspects of modern economy, society, and government. The crisis has mobilised scientific efforts at an unprecedented scale, with an impressive emerging body of research spanning across disciplines. This special issue invites scholars from across the School to explore a range of key questions the pandemic has raised - from the factors shaping government responses and collective behaviour, to the relationship between policy-making and scientific evidence; from the impact of the pandemic on economic policy and employment, to how it intersected with inequalities related, for instance, to gender or ethnicity. Through their different disciplinary lenses the papers in this issue offer a rich and comprehensive insight into some of the key questions emerging from the current crisis.\nMeet our speakers and chair\nFrancisco Ferreira (@fhgferreira) is Amartya Sen Professor of Inequality Studies and Director of the International Inequalities Institute at LSE.\nRicardo Hausmann (@ricardo_hausman) is Rafik Hariri Professor of the Practice of International Political Economy and the Director of the Growth Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School.\nAdnan Khan (@adnanqk) is Professor in Practice at LSE's School of Public Policy.\nLucinda Platt (@PlattLucinda) is Professor of Social Policy and Sociology and Head of Department of Social Policy at LSE.\nTania Burchardt is Associate Director of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) and Deputy Director of STICERD.\nMore about this event\nThe School of Public Policy (@LSEPublicPolicy) equips you with the skills and ideas to transform people and societies. It is an international community where ideas and practice meet.
