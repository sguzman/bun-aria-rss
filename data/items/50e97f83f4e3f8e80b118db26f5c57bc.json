  "description": "Douglas Clark’s new Gunboat Justice: British and American Law Courts in China and Japan (1842-1943) (Earnshaw Books Limited, 2016) is a three-volume study of extraterritoriality and its transnational histories as it shaped modern China and Japan. Clark is both historian and master storyteller in this work, crafting a study moves readers chronologically through a story of extraterritoriality from the middle of the nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth, while introducing some amazing figures and characters along the way. (Keep a lookout, readers, for the “man’s man” who meets a ghost and asks it if it’s drunk.) Clark pays special attention to analyzing the very different results of the impact of extraterritoriality in Japan and China.
