  "description": "<p><strong>Agatha Kulaga</strong> and <strong>Erin Patinkin</strong> are the co­-founders of Ovenly, an award-­winning bakery based in New York City known for inventive flavor combinations that thoughtfully meld sweet and savory with a touch of spice. They are authors of the best­-selling cookbook Ovenly: Sweet and Salty Recipes from New York's Most Creative Bakery. Inspired by the Eastern European flavors of their youths, they create recipes that are complex but not complicated, and that play on tradition (think currant­ rosemary scones and pistachio ­cardamom quick bread) in creative and unique ways.</p>\n<p>With backgrounds in social justice (Erin) and social work (Agatha), the two are not only focused on building a national brand, but also in developing ethical business practices with a focus on job development and environmental sustainability. They aspire to be the first bakery to scale profits and social impact while maintaining quality and craftsmanship. Ovenly has a flagship bakeshop located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with a second shop in Urbanspace Vanderbilt, and is also one of the leading wholesalers of artisanal baked goods in NYC.</p>\n<p><strong>Olivia Kim</strong> joined Nordstrom in February 2013, and currently serves as the Vice President of Creative Projects. In her role, Kim focuses on creating energy, excitement, and inspiration throughout the retailer’s locations through curated partnerships, the Pop­In@Nordstrom series of pop-­up shops and a new in­-store boutique SPACE. Kim and the Creative Projects team aims to create new, interesting and unique experiences for customers and introduce them to the best up ­and­ coming brands and new talent. A prominent figure in the fashion industry, prior to joining Nordstrom Olivia was a founding member of and Vice President of Creative at Opening Ceremony where she was responsible for the retailer’s leadership in merchandising and store planning, art direction, and collaborative projects.
