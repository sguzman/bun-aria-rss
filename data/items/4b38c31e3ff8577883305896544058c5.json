  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news that Ryan Fitzpatrick was shocked by the news that Tua would be starting in Miami, and everything else that came out from Fitzmagic's press conference today. Later, starting Running Back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a man who currently has three one hundred yard rushing games in a row, Ronald Jones II joins the program. Pat and Ronald chat about how things are different now in Tampa compared to years past with Tom Brady coming in, what having a guy like that in the locker room is like, what he does to workout in the offseason, why he feeds off fans in the stadium, his relationship with AQ Shipley, and much more (31:07-47:01). Also joining the show is Pro Football Hall of Famer, 2x Super Bowl Champion, one as player and coach, and current analyst of Football Night in America, Tony Dungy. Pat and Coach Dungy chat about the situation in Dallas with anonymous sources leaking information to the media, whether he thinks things can get turned around, and his thoughts on the NFL season thus far and how they've handled everything with Covid-19 (50:35-1:03:12). Closing out the show is another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about the Dallas locker room situation, what things are like in Miami with the Fitzmagic news, and they look ahead to Thursday night's big tilt between the Eagles and Giants (1:03:14-1:25:58).
