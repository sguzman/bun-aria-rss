  "description": "<p>We first brought you Zachary Kennedy's story in January of 2018. Zachary disappeared from Long Beach, California, on October 22, 2017. He was at the home of an acquaintance, Scott Leo, when his phone activity suddenly stopped, and the phone powered down. Scott Leo later stated that Zachary left on foot that night, but he was never seen or heard from again. Six months after he had vanished, police made a gruesome discovery. We all thought that justice would be swift, but we were wrong. It would be two more years before charges were filed against Leo. Join us for an update with Jeff Kennedy and the family attorney, Karen Gold.</p><p>UPDATE: In March of 2022, Scott Leo was found guilty of drug charges in relation to Zachary’s death and sentenced to a maximum of 6 years and 8 months in state prison.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://Headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://Headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a> for a free one-month trial with access to Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation.</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
