  "description": "Today I welcome back a 40-year market veteran... and one of my favorite bears: Rich Suttmeier. Rich is an incredible analyst. He’s also founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants, with great insight on a variety of topics. He breaks down Turkey’s financial crisis… why it’s significant to individual investors… and how it could be the catalyst that pops a $270 trillion debt bubble. While Rich tends to land on the bearish side, he’s been bullish on FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) for quite some time. He explains why he’s now changing his tune on these tech giants. We also cover the banking sector. Rich highlights several measures banks are using right now to stick it to Main Street. He and I have passionate debates about this sector… so you’re in for some fantastic entertainment and a solid education. Then I break down earnings season in my educational segment [42:35]. On the surface, earnings and sales growth may look positive… but there are significant risks most investors and analysts are overlooking—risks that could push stocks significantly lower over the next six months. As always, I share all the details and numbers to back up this claim… and explain the steps you can take to protect yourself.",
