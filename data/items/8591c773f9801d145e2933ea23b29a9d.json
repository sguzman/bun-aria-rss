But the truth is that we have a lot of control over our genetic activity. Yes, some genes we cannot do much about, but the vast majority of our DNA listens to us: our thoughts, choices and behavior. In this podcast I speak with Harvard professor, neuroscientist and researcher Dr. Rudolph E. Tanzi, one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people and founder of the field of neurogenetics, about the influence we have over our genetic activity, how our lifestyle impacts our wellbeing on the level of our DNA, how to keep our brains and bodies young and healthy, the relationship between spirituality and science, the power of mindful thinking, and so much more! &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read the blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-your-thoughts-to-influence-your-gene-expression-for-now-and-future-generations-the-five-most-widespread-myths-about-the-brain-that-may-be-limiting-your-potential-with-dr-rudolph-tanzi</p>\n<p>For more info on Dr. Tanzi and to get his books visit: https://www.madrc.org/members/10924 &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>***Special offers from our sponsors*** &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Ritual (my favorite multivitamin!
