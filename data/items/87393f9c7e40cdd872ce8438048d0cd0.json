When the scrapers fail to fetch the links due to any reason, Kodi displays the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are probable reasons for this kind of error:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The content you seek is unavailable on the internet.</li><li>Your Brazuca Play addon is incompatible with the Kodi version.</li><li>Buildup of cache.</li><li>Poor internet connection.</li><li>The available links come from restricted sites.</li><li>Some Kodi providers are disabled.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Probable solutions to this error include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clear cache</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Streaming content on Kodi for a long time without clearing browser cache and data history can slow down the application. When the app slows down, it affects the addon&#8217;s performance, resulting in the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear the cache to refresh the app and the addon. You can do this from the Settings menu on the addon, denoted as Configuracoes in Portuguese.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to the Clear Cache option and press OK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use Kodi maintenance tools to clear cache across all your Kodi-connected devices. Some examples of such tools include Open Wizard, Aliunde Maintenance Wizard, and SG wizard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Use a VPN&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A VPN allows you to bypass geo-restrictions and firewalls to access content from certain sites. If you suspect your Internet Service Provider has created firewalls to block access to certain sites, connect to a premium VPN to circumvent these restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fix Faulty Internet Connection</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A broken internet connection causes several errors when streaming content on Brazuca Play. Among them is the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error when the connection between Kodi servers and internet servers is lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to resolve a faulty internet connection:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Turn off the router for a few minutes, then restart.&nbsp;</li><li>Force close your modem, remove the service card, reinsert it, and then turn the modem back on.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Update the Addon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also encounter the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error due to incompatibility between the Brazuca Play version and the Kodi version. Update the addon to the latest version and check if that fixes the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Enable All Providers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most related addons use common providers to pull streaming links from the internet. For instance, addons located in the same repository will share some of the providers. If any of the shared providers are disabled, you may receive the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps to enable all providers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Disable all providers.</li><li>Restart Kodi app.</li><li>Enable all the providers afresh.</li><li>Restart the addon.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the above solutions do not resolve the error, then the content you are searching for may be unavailable on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brazuca Play Addon Fails To Launch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why the Brazuca Play addon might fail to launch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Accumulation of Cache</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A buildup of cache can slow down the Brazuca Play addon. Too much cache can also make the addon fail to launch or launch then stops unexpectedly. For best results, clear your cache and see if that fixes the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Incorrect Proxy Settings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brazuca Kodi addon works seamlessly when the Kodi device&#8217;s proxy settings match those of the network. These settings include the <strong>port number and proxy servers</strong>. One of the causes of deviation of these credentials is signing in to Kodi with a new device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a different internet connection, such as a friend&#8217;s or hotel&#8217;s Wi-Fi, can also cause a mismatch of these proxy settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve the proxy deviation problem, check to confirm your device&#8217;s port number and proxy server matches your network&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brazuca Play Addon Shows the &#8216;Check the Log for More Information&#8217; Error</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you notice the &#8216;Check the Log for More Information&#8217; error, it may derive from the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Brazuca Play addon is out of date.</li><li>Buildup of cache.</li><li>Faulty internet connection.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, to fix this issue,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clear all cache.</li><li>Troubleshoot your network.</li><li>Update the Brazuca Play addon to the latest version</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brazuca Play Addon Fails To Play Links or Requires Authorization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to play links is one of the common issues reported by Brazuca Play users. This error may emanate from the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Playback Settings Set To Autoplay</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you set your playback settings to auto-play, the streaming links play in chronological order. In case the top link is broken or invalid, it won&#8217;t play.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The source select playback settings, on the other hand, let you choose only the best links. The latter reduces the instances of links failing to play by allowing you to hand-pick valid links.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Faulty URLResolver</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The URL resolver checks the most suitable links from the many links found on the internet when you search for content on Kodi. If this feature is broken, you may receive invalid links which won&#8217;t play.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>You Have Signed In to Kodi on a New Device</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you synchronize your Kodi-connected devices, hoster sites automatically pair with the devices. Logging in to Kodi with a new device may result in the &#8216;To Play This Video, Authorization Is Required&#8217; error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve the above issue, try the following options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Troubleshoot your URLResolver.</li><li>Switch your playback settings to source select.</li><li>Use a static IP address. This type of IP allows the automatic pairing of your devices to hoster sites, eliminating the need for authorization.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brazuca Play Addon Shows &#8216;The Dependencies Could Not Be Satisfied&#8217; Error</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may encounter the ‘Dependencies Could Not Be Satisfied’ error when installing the Brazuca Play addon. When this happens, it&#8217;s usually due to a python code incompatibility between the addon version and the Kodi version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that developers are constantly updating their addons to match the requirements of the latest Kodi version, incompatibility issues may arise if you use a newer addon version with an older Kodi version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To resolve this problem, uninstall the old Kodi version and install the latest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions Brazuca Play Kodi Addon&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Brazuca Play Kodi Addon Legal?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Brazuca Kodi provides legal content that is readily available in the public domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Brazuca Play Kodi Addon Free?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the Brazuca Play addon provides free streaming links.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I Need a VPN With the Brazuca Play Kodi Addon?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though not mandatory, using a VPN lets you browse content privately, access geo-restricted sites, and reduce bandwidth by 50%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does the Brazuca Play Kodi Addon Still Work in 2021?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum up, Brazuca Play is a video addon popular for providing movies, TV shows, animations, sports, and soap operas in the Portuguese language.
