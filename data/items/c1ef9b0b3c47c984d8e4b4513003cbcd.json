  "title": "Deep Dive: Two Moms With Different Parenting Styles Raising a Strong-Willed Child",
  "description": "Raising a strong-willed child can feel like you're constantly locked in a power struggle. The same goes for parenting when your partner differs in approach. But here's something to consider in any relationship: When we prioritize connection over being right, we can begin to work together against a problem... instead of seeing each other as the problem. In this Deep Dive episode, mothers Jessica and Joanna come to Dr. Becky for advice on raising their opinionated daughter Jada differently from how they were raised, while navigating their own clashing parenting styles. As the three explore what's behind their tough moments with Jada, they discuss breaking intergenerational cycles, infusing difficult moments with playfulness, and switching up their rigid roles as parents. As always, Dr. Becky provides actionable takeaways for tricky situations—modeling scripts and strategies along the way. \n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
