  "description": "Tonight, my special guest is author Troy McLachlan who's here to discuss his research into the mythology of Saturn and how it's believed to be tied to a sinister agenda. His book Saturn Death Cult is available on Amazon right now. \n\nDo you enjoy paranormal episodes? Follow our new podcast 'Paranormal Fears' on any podcast app or Apple Podcasts.\n\nFully Revised and Expanded -The Saturn Death Cult is an investigation into ancient planetary upheavals that heralded the birth and destruction of a fabled Golden Age. It attempts to trace how, following the demise of this Golden Age, mankind then degenerated into the obsessive pursuit of wealth and power through the perverted horrors of slavery, child sacrifice and mass-murder rituals.\n\nThis 2nd edition is pack full of new information, graphics and images. A better placement and explanation for the last great Ice Age is offered and more detailed graphical analysis on the Saturn system of planets is provided. Occult Saturnian symbolism is delved into more deeply and new evidence for the existence of a Saturn cult within the Italian Renaissance elite is discussed.\n\nThe author poses a solution for why the planet Saturn is portrayed in mythology as our original sun where it was said to be fixed in the heavens at Earth’s celestial north and from where it watched over the ancients like the All-seeing Eye of god.\n\nAn explanation is then forwarded explaining why today’s frightening sex-murder cults and secret societies are nothing more than a twisted, yet deadly legacy of a time when people yearned for the rebirth of the planet Saturn as our original sun and source of life and light. This is linked to the ancient practice of money lending and the consequences of this practice for today’s international financial crisis.\n\nThe conclusion is reached that there is a disturbing occult connection to the planet Saturn and its influence over a perceived worldwide collective march towards fulfilling a terrifying elitist agenda of ‘justifiable’ global genocide.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
