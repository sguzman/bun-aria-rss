  "description": "<p>Have you ever been in a situation that caused you to get EXTREMELY anxious, trying to do everything possible under your power to try to fix it? You can’t even think about anything other than this issue and it’s getting in the way of you thinking clearly, sleeping or enjoying life.</p> <p>Or maybe you’ve been in a situation where you just shut down. You don’t even know what to do and feel complete apathy. It feels so far out of your control, you give up. You may even find yourself disassociating and not even knowing who you are and why you’re here.</p> <p>These are two different states of the nervous system - sympathetic and dorsal.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit down with Polyvagal trained Somatic Practitioner Sarah Baldwin to really dive into the states of our nervous systems and recognizing where our imbalances occur and why. This is a powerful episode to truly understand your body’s response in a deeper way, which brings about a great deal of compassion for WHY you feel the way that you do.</p> <p>I truly believe somatics + nervous system healing are the missing links of our mental health system and this episode is a must-listen to anyone who is ready to step into deeper levels of healing - both for themselves and for the planet.</p> <p>Connect with Sarah at http://www.sarahbaldwincoaching.com</p> <p>Connect with your body’s wisdom with my free Goddess Embodiment Practice free at http://www.rosegoldgoddesses.com/embodiment</p> <p>Ready to integrate your full multidimensional self into a thriving career as a Soul Purpose + Spiritual Life Coach?
