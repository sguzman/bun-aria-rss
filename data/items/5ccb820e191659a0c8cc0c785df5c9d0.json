  "title": "Working With Weed: How Does a Dispensary Manager Work?",
  "description": "What’s it really like to grow and sell legal weed for a living? In the new season of Working, we’re finding out by visiting Colorado to talk with people employed in the state’s cannabis industry. On the first episode of the series, Jordan talks with Lazarus White, an assistant manager at Terrapin Cares Station in Boulder, about the day-to-day of running a dispensary. Turns out it’s a great job if you like long, heart-felt conversations with customers—but not so much if you like to wake and bake. \nIn this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode, we get different perspective on dispensary life from Britney Pittel—who tells us what it’s like when unhappy customers try to return bud, and how there’s still a surprising amount of stigma against the industry.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
