They discuss high-tech tools like brain stimulation and neurofeedback-guided meditation that purport to enrich our spiritual lives, what possible risks they may pose to our psyches, and the ethical implications of technology-induced shortcuts to transformative meditative states. They also talk about whether such spiritual experiences are authentic rather than simulated, and whether brain-based spirit tech might help humans evolve as a species.\nHost: Sigal Samuel (@SigalSamuel), Senior Reporter, Vox\nGuests: Wesley Wildman (@WesleyWildman) and Kate Stockly (@KateJStockly), authors and researchers\nReferences: \n\n\nSpirit Tech: The Brave New World of Consciousness Hacking and Enlightenment Engineering by Wesley Wildman and Kate Stockly (Macmillan; 2021)\n\n\nSEMA (Sonication Enhanced Mindful Awareness) Lab, University of Arizona Center for Consciousness Studies (Dr. Jay Sanguinetti & Shinzen Young, co-directors)\n\n\nVR Church; Bishop D.J.
