  "title": "NFL Divisional Round Saturday Recap: Bills beat Ravens, Packers top Rams to advance to championship weekend (Football 1/16)",
  "description": "The Bills will be playing in the conference championship for the first time since 1993 and the Packers will be playing in the conference championship at home for the first time since 2007. Two streaks snapped on Saturday as the Pick Six Superfriends gather to recap the Divisional Round action. Buffalo topped Baltimore to advance as Lamar Jackson was outplayed by Josh Allen before leaving late, entering concussion protocol (2:30). But did the Ravens deserve at least a shot to win the game? Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech break down Sean McDermott's brilliance, JK Dobbins' blunders, kicking woes and much more including Buffalo's chances vs. either the Chiefs or Browns next week. Next, the guys tackle the Packers fairly comfortable victory over the Rams (26:00). Aaron Rodgers made it look easy on Saturday while Jared Goff surprisingly held his own too. However, it was the deadly Rams defense that wasn't able to hold up. The guys also dish out winners and losers before saying goodnight. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
