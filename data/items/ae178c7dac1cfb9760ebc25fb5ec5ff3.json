  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. Two-time Attorney General William Barr has given his resignation letter to President Trump. He fought for the law, and the president and was no Jeff Sessions. Barr was prevented by rule 6.e which prevents the Attorney General from releasing information about ongoing grand jury investigations, which included Hunter Biden. Barr was an excellent Attorney General, a real class-act and this program salutes him. Then, on January 6th, 2021 the Archivist of the United States will transfer the electoral votes to a joint session of the US Congress. In 1960 Hawaii challenged the electoral votes in the race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. The fraud was evident but Nixon chose not to rock the boat, per se. Finding the 2020 election fraud is like a game to the media and Democrats akin to hide-and-seek. Also, Americans cannot become pollyannas. The Democrat Party and the US media are defending China. America is beginning a decline and the greater the power amassed by the left within the Democrat Party, the faster the decline. America is fighting a two-front war; internationally and internally. China is ascending and the United States is descending. The hate on for America's economic system is reaching a fever pitch. The system that has created the greatest amount of wealth for the greatest amount of people, more than any other economic system ever has. The American free-market reflects human nature, allowing for fewer and fewer people to make decisions. Later, Marxism is an abstraction built on poverty which teaches its adherents that they must go broke, to take handouts, or get crushed. Sadly American children are not taught to love capitalism, they are taught to hate it. This has brought us to a time of systemic lawlessness where liberty is destroyed in the name of liberty. The franchise of the American citizen is being destroyed in the name of suffrage and Democrat bureaucrats are happy to use the name of the constitution to destroy the actual constitution. Afterward, the Pennsylvania legal matter based on constitutionality may be taken up by the US Supreme Court. SCOTUS should rule that Pennsylvania violated the Electoral College, violated the Pennsylvania State Constitution, and unconstitutionally contravened the process of choosing electors outlined in Article II.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
