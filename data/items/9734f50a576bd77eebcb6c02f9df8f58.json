  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys recap everything from a CRAZY NFL Wildcard weekend. In the wake of the Vikings/Saints game, Pat unveils his plan for new NFL overtime rules that set the internet on fire yesterday. They also do a deep dive into the game and chat about why they think the Vikings are going to be a very tough out, and why Kirk Cousins getting the monkey off his back could spell trouble for the rest of the NFC. They also cover the Titans/Pats tilt and discuss whether or not it is in fact the end of the Patriots dynasty with resident Masshole, Boston Connor. Pat also breaks down what he thinks will happen after the season with Brady, will all signs seemingly pointing to him signing with the LA Chargers. They discuss whether the Jadeveon Clowney hit on Carson Wentz was dirty, and whether or not the Seahawks are a team to be feared moving forward, look ahead to the AFC Divisional round matchups, and share some thoughts about Deshaun Watson and Josh Allen. Later, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, chili connoisseur and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth joins the program. He and Pat discuss the Cowboys culture and whether a coaching change will help fix that, and Pat and Stink dive into all the big moments of this past weekends games and look ahead to some of the key matchups in the games next week (36:17-49:46). Digs also calls into the show to discuss the Jason Garrett drama and the Mike McCarthy hire, and how his earlier predictions of Garrett crying in Jerry Jones’ office may not have been too far off. Today’s show is a loaded one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
