  "description": "<p>Gravitational-wave observations of neutron star mergers can probe the nuclear\nequation of state by measuring the imprint of the neutron star's tidal\ndeformability on the signal. We investigate the ability of future\ngravitational-wave observations to produce a precise measurement of the\nequation of state from binary neutron star inspirals. Since measurability of\nthe tidal effect depends on the equation of state, we explore several equations\nof state that span current observational constraints. We generate a population\nof binary neutron stars as seen by a simulated Advanced LIGO-Virgo network, as\nwell as by a planned Cosmic Explorer observatory. We perform Bayesian inference\nto measure the parameters of each signal, and we combine measurements across\neach population to determine $R_{1.4}$, the radius of a $1.4M_{\\odot}$ neutron\nstar. We find that with 321 signals the LIGO-Virgo network is able to measure\n$R_{1.4}$ to better than 2% precision for all equations of state we consider,\nhowever we find that achieving this precision could take decades of\nobservation, depending on the equation of state and the merger rate. On the\nother hand we find that with one year of observation, Cosmic Explorer will\nmeasure $R_{1.4}$ to better than 0.6% precision. In both cases we find that\nsystematic biases, such as from an incorrect mass prior, can significantly\nimpact measurement accuracy and efforts will be required to mitigate these\neffects.\n</p>",
