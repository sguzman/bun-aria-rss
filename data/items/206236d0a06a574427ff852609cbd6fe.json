  "description": "I recently finished reading the book In Defense of Food: An Eater&rsquo;s Manifesto by Michael Pollan. The book criticises nutritionism â€“ the idea that one should eat according to the sum of measured nutrients while ignoring the food that contains these nutrients. The key argument of the book is that since the knowledge derived using food science is still very limited, completely relying on the partial findings and tools provided by this science is likely to lead to health issues."
