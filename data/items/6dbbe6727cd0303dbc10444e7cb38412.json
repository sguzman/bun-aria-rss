  "description": "The world is watching as Russia continues it's threat of invasion with troops at the border of Ukraine. But close to that border, in the Donbas region, people look at you a little funny if you ask whether they're worried about war with Russia, because they are already living through it. <br/><br/>Areas of Eastern Ukraine have been at war since 2014 when Russia-backed separatists moved in and declared breakaway republics. And that's where NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been, talking with residents about what this new threat might mean for them.  <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
