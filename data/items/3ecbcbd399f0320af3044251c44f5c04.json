  "description": "<p>Ever wondered what happened July 5, 1776? The Founders of America followed through with their plans and, 244 years later...here we are. You might have listened to part 1 but now it’s time to cue up the sequel, listen to the end of the conversation, and carry on the fight for the soul of the USA. Andy and the crew finish strong in this one, and make one thing clear: if we keep fighting over the mistakes of the past and don’t find common ground in the present, our country has no hope for the future.</p>",
