  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the New York Times continues their propagandistic pseudo-events to smear Attorney General Barr and the Mueller Report. This pseudo-news has fueled rumors and attempts to investigate and jail the president and his family. Indeed, society has become accustomed to hoaxes and illusions. Later, the Democrats keep the rhetoric going to abolish the electoral college—the failsafe that the founders put into our Construction to protect the integrity of our presidential elections. Also, Senator Bernie Sanders claims that President Trump is a racist and homophobe amongst other things, but it's him that represents one of the most homogeneous white states in the nations. Sanders should look towards Venezuela for equality, where they are now dying equally, starving equally, and losing their homes equally. How’s that for equality? Finally, author Peter J. Wallison calls in to discuss his new book, \"Judicial Fortitude: The Last Chance to Rein In the Administrative State.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
