  "description": "We know, we know. This is no time for complacency. This is no time to minimize the challenges we face. This is no time to assume anything about the election or its aftermath. We must work hard and be on guard against abuses. But...what if things turn out as the polls suggest they might? What if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and a Democratic Senate and Congress win? Might government, dare we say it, become boring again? Might competency make us turn away from it all out of indifference? And might the experience of the Trump years and resistance to the threat he and the Trumpists have posed to democracy in America have positive consequences, have reminded us what we value in government and our leaders? Might it all have brought some of us closer together? We dare to discuss our guarded optimism in this moment with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Joe Cirincione of the Quincy Institute. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
