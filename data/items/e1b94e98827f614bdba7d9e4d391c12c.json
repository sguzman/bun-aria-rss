  "description": "<p>Poor in friends, ladies and money....The isolation of cars and social media.  How the hell do people date in this era of dating apps? How do Millennials make friends? Update from my Next Door App - what are my neighbors concerned with this week? Has to do with a homeless man and his \"undercarriage\" living behind the bank. My history with seeing homeless men's penises in public. The heartbreak of a broken iPhone screen and the horrors of the Apple store. A young gentleman writes in asking why he gets \"friend zoned\" with the ladies. Also, \"why do people love free stuff so much?\" asks another guy. Poverty consciousness and getting over that shit so you can have a great life. </p>\n",
