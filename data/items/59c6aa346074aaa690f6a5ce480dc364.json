  "description": "<p class=\"\">This one is a RIDE, you guys! We wanted to do something really fun this week—something that would lighten the mood for us and for you. So, strap in, because we’re talking about our favorite Old School Category romances today! We’ve got something for everyone — wolves and dragons and marine biologists and single moms and more wolves!   A word of caution this week — we didn’t reread these books before we recorded, and they’re all published in the 80s and 90s, so tread lightly if you decide to read them…and let us know just how wrong we got the plots! (Just kidding, we’re for sure rereading all of them now). </p><p class=\"\">Next week was supposed to be the deep dive of Lorraine Heath, but Sarah has a book due, so we’re putting it on hold—but stay tuned, because we’ve definitely got something coming!

She was an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-i-got-there-sandra-br_b_10109864\">80s powerhouse</a> who still writes romantic suspense. The book Sarah mentioned was <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/958649.Honor_Bound?from_search=true&qid=HEB823vXwX&rank=2\">Honor Bound</a>, but Jen was thinking of a similar book called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30369.Hawk_O_Toole_s_Hostage?from_search=true&qid=my1QhPQrDq&rank=1\">Hawk O'Toole's Hostage</a>. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4E4AQkvl1KU\">Ope</a>.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Jen reread and reviewed several of <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2017/11/throwback-thursday-double-review-very.html\">her first category romances</a> for the Book Queen. The one about <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2017/11/throwback-review-pink-satin.html\">Pink Satin</a> compares the book to the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36xNNJi\">Harvey Weinstein case</a>. It's honestly shocking how little has changed for women in the workplace.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/307201.White_Satin\">White Satin</a> was an early Iris Johansen about figure skating, but that author is also for being the book that inspired the <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2018/01/who-did-it-better-on-horse.html\">\"Who Did it Better on a Horse\"</a> post. And at the end of the episode, Sarah mentions that <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/author-iris-johansen-million-mansion-headed-auction/Oepj8rtYUCjMn6cz6wlcoM/\">she had a house for sale</a> if you're on the market, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A MANSION.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/4062700/hollywood-gender-gap/\">Brad Pitt is old and still working</a> because of the patriarchy.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Tracks\">Deep Tracks</a> is the name of an XM radio station that plays B sides and less popular songs, which is very on brand for the books in this episode.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Maybe you'd like to read those goodreads reviews for <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/635856.Regan_Forest\">The Lady and the Dragon</a>.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Jen loved <a href=\"https://www.fictiondb.com/author/barbara-boswell~723.htm\">Barbara Boswell</a>. She was a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/72602-ramsey-brady\">Brady/Ramsey series</a> where a bunch of sisters married a bunch of brothers. And then this one that is <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=brady%20bunch\">Brady Bunch fanfic</a>. <a href=\"https://rare.us/entertainment-and-culture/whatever-happened-to-the-eight-is-enough-cast/\">Eight is enough</a>, I swear!

All you need to know is that these 80s covers celebrated the <a href=\"https://beardoholic.com/tom-selleck-mustache/\">Tom Selleck mustache</a> in a big way.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Warrior was last in the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/67366-mackenzie-blackthorn\">McKenzie-Blackthorn series</a> by Elizabeth Lowell. Light a candle for Utah, who never got his book. Ao3 needs to get on it! #JusticeForUtah</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Virginity is a construct! Also, here's where <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/sex/virginity\">the hymen </a>is in case you need to know.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Sarah's on deadline, so who knows what's going to happen next week. Buy some <a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/shop\">stickers, buttons</a>, or <a href=\"https://jordandene.com/collections/romance-sarah-maclean\">t-shirts</a> to tide yourself over while we figure it out.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;Please check out the photo array below for books we referenced. You may remember that we recorded an entire episode on category romances with Andie Christopher, but Jen screwed up the recording. By then, <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/13/s026-cinnamon-roll-romance-heroes-interstitial-with-andie-christopher\">we moved on with Andie to cinnamon rolls</a>. But Andie recommended <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GsUUYV\">Driven by Fate by Tessa Bailey</a>, and Jen talked about <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2O5KPp1\">Every Road to You by Phyllis Bourne</a>. Sarah proably talked about Hot Touch, but Jen can't really remember...we'll just think of that episode as the one that got away.</p>",
