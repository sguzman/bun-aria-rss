    "media:description": "October 14, 2022\nAlex 'Sandy' Pentland of MIT Media Lab\n\nThere is an immense literature about human group decision making and computer tools to help, but much of it is limited or even contradictory. In contrast, there are powerful mathematical results concerning combining evidence to achieve optimal, minimum regret decision making. The minimum-regret mathematical framework can be extended to closely approximate human group decision making, and so may provide a good framework for better human-AI group decision making.\n\n\nAbout the speaker: \nProfessor Alex 'Sandy' Pentland directs MIT Connection Science, an MIT-wide initiative, and previously helped create and direct the MIT Media Lab and the Media Lab Asia in India. A member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, advisor to the UN Secretary Generals' office and the OECD, and serial entrepreneur, with an h-index of 147. He has received numerous awards and prizes such as the McKinsey Award from Harvard Business Review, the 40th Anniversary of the Internet from DARPA, and the Brandeis Award for work in privacy.",
