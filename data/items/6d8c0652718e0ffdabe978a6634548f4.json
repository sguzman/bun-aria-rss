  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, government officials are justifying their draconian lockdowns by saying “life is precious” and it’s all worth it “just to save one life.” But many of these officials are Democrats and therefore pro-abortion. There seems to be a disconnect here. Also, Five Headlines, including the official jobless numbers from last week. They are historically bad, and that’s an understatement. Plus our Daily Cancellation and an email from someone who wants to tell me why I’m wrong about the arguments I presented on my show yesterday.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
