  "description": "David Lewis was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, who few outside of academia know much about. By the time of his death in 2001, he was the greatest systematic thinker in metaphysics since the Enlightenment. In Part 1 of a four-part series, we follow his journey from sick little boy in Oberlin, Ohio to teenager learning about free will from Iris Murdoch. We accompany the story of his early life with his theory of time, time travel, and the self. Guest voices include R. Jay Wallace, Mark Schroeder, Steffi Lewis, Donald Lewis, Ellen Lewis, Alan Hajek, John Bigelow, and Meghan Sullivan.\nTo support Hi-Phi Nation, please sign up for Slate Plus at www.slate.com/hiphiplus.
