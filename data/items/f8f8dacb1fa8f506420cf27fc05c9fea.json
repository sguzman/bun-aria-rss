  "description": "<p>Welcome to Chapter 6 of our Anatomy of a Pandemic series exploring the world of COVID-19. If you have made it this far in the series, you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed by all of the information we’re throwing your way. You’re not alone. We were feeling a bit too deep down the rabbit hole as well. So we reached out to Rosemary Walker and Peter Rosencrans, two psychology doctoral students at the University of Washington to talk to us about the mental health impacts this pandemic has had and walk us through some coping strategies (interview recorded March 20, 2020). Hang in there, everyone. To help you get a better idea of the topics covered in this episode, we have listed the questions below:</p><ol><li>You are both in Seattle, which has been impacted longer than much of the US, so, how are you? (05:55)</li><li>This is a brand new situation for all of us that's affecting so much more than our physical health.So what are we seeing in terms of some of the mental health outcomes? (09:21)</li><li>What are some of the challenges that you, as mental health professionals, have faced so far and that you expect to appear in the future related to COVID-19? (15:59)</li><li>What are some coping strategies that we could use to deal with some of these issues? (19:15)</li><li>What are some resources for people who normally see a therapist, but who cannot now because of COVID-19? (31:43)</li><li>How can we as individuals be good neighbors, community members, in this stressful time while still protecting our mental health? (36:50)</li><li>Do you have any specific resources that our listeners could seek out? (41:09)</li></ol><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
