  "description": "For many children the holiday season is about twinkling lights, hanging their stockings by the fire with care, and leaving cookies and milk out for good ol' Saint Nick. But for those that find themselves on the naughty list Christmas can be a season of pure terror. Krampus is coming to town and he's armed with a bundle of ruten for swatting little legs and a big ol' sack for kidnapping kids and taking them straight to hell.
