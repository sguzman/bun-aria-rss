  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Jack who had an encounter when he was young. Jack says \"I lived in a rural area in Pennsylvania. I remember going down this road and I had this bike and the chain would always come off. I looked down at my chain and had a feeling I was being watched I looked up and saw this thing watching me. We will also be speaking to Will who is from Canada and he had a recent encounter. Will says \"I thought it was a basketball player with a hoodie on. It had a small tree or branch in its hand and when it dropped what it had in its hand I noticed the deltoid muscle was the size of a basketball. It reminded me of a primitive man.\"</p>",
