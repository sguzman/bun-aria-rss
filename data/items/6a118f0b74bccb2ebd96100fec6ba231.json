Adam quickly brings in some stories from his family members whom he argues would tell you they have high character despite Adam having witnessed behavior that is at odds with that stance. The guys then turn to Love Boat talk as they discuss the very strange themes from the era and the bizarre way women were treated. They then turn to the phones and speak with callers about covid, ivermectin & how long the insanity may last. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nPaintYourLife.com, text ADS to 64000\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM\n",
