  "description": "This episode was never intended to be a two-parter. Once I sat down with our guest, I couldn't bring myself to hit the stop button because I wanted to keep hearing the stories she had to tell. Kathleen DiBenedetto is the Sr. Director, Premium Seed Brands but has had a near 30 year career span at Beam Suntory. And one of her first jobs was working alongside Booker Noe. She traveled the country with Booker and learned what it took to market and find audiences for this premium uncut and unfiltered small batch whiskey. She helped the brands of Booker's, Knob Creek, and Bakers grow from its infant stage, this is before Booker's even had a box, to what we all see today. Kathleen shares her fondest memories of working with Booker and the Noe family and how that set her down a path to be inducted into the Bourbon Hall of Fame and also have her own Booker's Batch named after her.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nAbove the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about the current whiskey shortage.\n\nYou've spent 30 years at Beam. What did you do when you first came into the company?\n\nHow did the interview process go with Booker Noe?\n\nHow did you build on-site tastings with consumers?\n\nBooker didn't like fancy packaging but do you find it weird now that Basil Hayden is upscale packaging?\n\nDo you remember what time the Booker's box was introduced?\n\nWhere was Baker's fitting into the portfolio at this time?\n\nCan you recall the price points and how you competed with clear spirits?\n\nWhat was Booker's first impression of Blanton's?\n\nWere you there when Booker's began introducing different batch numbers?\n\n@jimbeamofficial @knobcreek @knobcreekbourbon\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon",
