  "description": "<p>At this time in human history, we’re more stressed than ever. We know that chronic stress leads to a myriad of health problems, including a lowered immune system and increased susceptibility to infections. So how do we break out of this negative cycle and create real change that will lead to longer, healthier lives?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>It starts with taking control over our minds. When we’re driven by fear and anxiety, the capacity and strength of our immune system becomes undermined. But when we recognize our innate ability to create our reality, we become stronger, healthier, and more empowered. There’s no one better suited to speak on the topic of the mind-body connection than Dr. Bruce Lipton.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Dr. Lipton is a stem cell biologist, bestselling author, and an internationally recognized thought leader. On today’s show, he’s sharing the powerful science behind how your beliefs inform the expression of your genetics, how to optimize your immune function, and the pertinent steps you need to take in order to change your health outcomes.
