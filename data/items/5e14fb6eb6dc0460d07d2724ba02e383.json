  "description": "<p>Steve Hassan, world-renowned mental health professional and cult & undue influence expert, breaks down classic cult tactics and how those techniques have evolved into the digital age. He details his own indoctrination into the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, his subsequent moment of realization that he was a cult member, and his intense deprogramming experience. Mayim and Steve discuss 21st century sects like Scientology, NXIVM, and QAnon, and how cult ideologies may have led to the Capitol insurrection in January of 2021. They explore ways to identify cults and abusers through their authoritarian features and methods they use, such as disorientation, \"love bombing\", social-psychological compliance, covert hypnotism, neuro-linguistic programming, and deep fakes. Hassan emphasizes media literacy in order to avoid these organizations and provides tips on how to engage with a loved one involved in a cult.
