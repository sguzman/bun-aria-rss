  "description": "<p>Brad and Todd Barnes came to my apartment to do a podcast about working as a team to make movies. They brought with them the film crew that eventually led to my landlord evicting me. Despite that, it was a fun podcast. We talked about making films, about working together, and about the half documentary/half movie that we made together over the summer with Rannazzisi, Cort, and Simeone.</p>",
