  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, President Biden chose to run for president but would never release his medications list. Despite his many cognitive failures the media continues covering for his obvious decline. Using the guise of a COVID health emergency Biden's senior staff has no problem telling Facebook what social media posts they want to be censored. The fact is there isn't a single case of death related to anyone's Facebook post about the coronavirus. Now, Jen Psaki says if an individual is banned from one social media platform they should be banned from all. What's next, banning talk radio hosts or conservative commentary on cable news? Will dissent or disagreement be labeled as misinformation that kills people too? Then, Karl Marx was viewed as a prolific writer and fancied himself a journalist for the New York Tribune, this is why the Marxists in the media are a disaster and are indeed the enemy of the people. The American media have become special pleaders for the Americanized Marxist movement in various areas of our once open and free society. The silencing of opposition (repression) is their main tactic as they claim ideological purity. Later, Michelle Lette, a member of the Fairfax, VA Parent Teacher Association, called for the critics of critical race theory to be allowed to die. Even some parent groups have been compromised by the teacher unions. Afterward, Candidate for Governor of California, Larry Elder, joins the show to discuss his run for Governor of California.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
