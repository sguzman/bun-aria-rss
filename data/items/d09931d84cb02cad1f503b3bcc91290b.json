  "description": "<p>Sharon Stone is known for portraying a certain type of brash, cunning villain, like Catharine Tramell in “Basic Instinct,” Lori Quad in “Total Recall,” or, more recently, Lenore Osgood in the Netflix series “Ratched.” In reality though, Sharon Stone is shy and introverted and, despite her fame, has led a very private life. But now, the actor is in the midst of a very public and personal re-examination of that life in her memoir, “The Beauty of Living Twice.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Sharon talk about the trauma she has endured, from being molested as a child, to the sexual harassment in Hollywood, to the stroke that nearly killed her in 2001 (and the interview Katie did with Sharon nearly 20 years ago). They also talk about the memoir writing process, life under the glare of the spotlight, and finding a new sisterhood — and inspiration — in the movie industry, post #MeToo.
