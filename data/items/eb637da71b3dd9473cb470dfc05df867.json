  "description": "<p>It&rsquo;s an understatement to say that the political discourse in our country is a mess! And the problem isn&rsquo;t that you just disagree- that you think someone on the other side of the political aisle has the wrong opinion. That&rsquo;s certainly a part of it, but the major political issues of the day that Americans are rightly discussing require patience and a nuanced understanding of different ideas to make progress. Instead, we have anonymous accounts on social media, partisan media, divisive rhetoric from leaders, and the pandemic which further polarized the political divide. All are factors that have contributed to politics being a hot button topic. Similarly, it&rsquo;s not <em>just </em>inflation that&rsquo;s causing everything to feel like it&rsquo;s costing us more money- that our dollars aren&rsquo;t getting us through to the end of the month. Inflation is a major culprit and we&rsquo;ll definitely talk more about that today. But there are some other factors as well and we think by zooming out and looking at the entire picture, that we&rsquo;ll be able to better understand the many different reasons that everything seems to cost us more than it used to. And then we&rsquo;ll share what steps we can begin to immediately implement in order to start defying these higher prices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Breakfast Stout by Founders Brewing!
