Former pro cornerback and friend of the podcast, Bryant McFadden, joins Will Brinson to break down his Top 10 cornerback and safety lists. The guys start at CB (4:30) and discuss tough snubs, a potential breakout in Philly for Darius Slay, and Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphrey teaming up in the Ravens secondary. BMac and and Brinson also answer who they'd rather have: Tre'Davious White or Jalen Ramsey? Then, they transition to safety (30:00), examining some super solid players before hitting the consensus top 4 of Jamal Adams, Tyrann Mathieu, Derwin James and Minkah Fitzpatrick. What order do they fall in?
