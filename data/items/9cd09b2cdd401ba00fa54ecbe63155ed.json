  "title": "47: Bull Run, Trent Affair, the Merrimack, & Fort Donelson: The Early Days of the Civil War",
  "description": "“There is Jackson standing like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!”\nThis is the story of violence on land and sea. Of violence unlike anything America has ever known.\nTens of thousands of Union and Confederate forces clash near Virginia’s Bull Run River and Manassas railroad junction. Naive, young soldiers quickly learn their romantic notions of war are a farce, Thomas Jackson defends “like a stone wall,” and Yankees hear a horrific sound: “the rebel yell.”\nThings are calmer on the sea. Lincoln wants a blockade to hem in Confederate ships. The result is one international, diplomatic nightmare (the Trent Affair), and the most devastating attack in US naval history. The carnage and destruction wrought on the US Navy by the CSS Virginia (the Merrimack) won’t be matched or exceeded until 1941.\nLincoln’s despondent. He has setbacks, on the field, turnover from General-in-Chief Winfield Scott to George B. McClellan, and a dying son. It seems nothing can go right. There is one exception though. Welcome back to the story young Ulysses S. Grant.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
