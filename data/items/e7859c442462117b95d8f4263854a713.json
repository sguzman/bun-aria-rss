  "description": "In this episode, Sharon and guest Kelli France talk about the not-so-stellar history of the construction of Mt. Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. A sacred place to the Lakota, <em>Tunkasila Sakpe Paha</em>, or Six Grandfathers Mountain, was transformed in the 1920s and 30s into what we know as Mt. Rushmore. The mountain’s complicated history includes broken treaties, a white supremacist sculptor, 14 years of construction, scads of dynamite, and the 60-foot tall faces of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln. Join Sharon and Kelli to hear facts about the iconic national memorial, and find out what’s in store for its future.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
