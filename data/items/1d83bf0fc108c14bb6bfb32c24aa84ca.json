  "description": "<p>Subscribe, Rate, and leave a review!\n\nWe kick off the show reminding people that the beginning of summer is the worst season of all time. Is there a worse season? We talk about the ridiculous acne medication we used to take as teenagers that caused depression. While recording, Elon Musk had to delay his rocket launch \"because of inclement weather\", once again reminding everyone he's a fraud. AITA Thursday returns with a fiancee's family trying to enforce a marriage sex ritual, a guy trying to convince his buddy to upgrade his wife, and more. Voicemails include one hit wonders, ideal length of sex, slidin in Seal's dm's, and people still named adolf.\n\n(01:28:10) Jensen Karp joins the show. We discuss his influence in hip hop, how Kanye West owes him $300, his elaborate prank on Shia LaBeouf, how he met his wife Danielle Fishel, and much more. Make sure to check out his podcast \"The No-Sports Report\".</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
