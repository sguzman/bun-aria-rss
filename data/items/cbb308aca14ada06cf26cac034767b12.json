  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Kurds have fought side by side with American Marines and Army and they have been our allies for decades. President Trump pulling troops out of the Northern part of Syria is not about endless war, it's about not abandoning the Kurds now that ISIS has been defeated in Syria. This exposes this loyal group of Muslims, that have aligned themselves with the United States, to the threat that Erdogan in Turkey poses to the Kurds. What's next, pulling our Navy out of foreign waters, ending the Monroe Doctrine, or pulling out of NATO? We must stick by our allies! Then, the second whistleblower is as insignificant as the first, since we know what was said from the transcript memo. This is simply the Democrats trying to create the appearance of a scandal. The media should focus on the comments of the actual parties to the call. Later, Democrats are attempting to mask the identity of the whistleblower from their Republican counterparts. The American people deserve to have their president face his accuser if they're legitimately planning impeachment. So far, they are absconding his identity to protect him from scrutiny so they can bamboozle as many citizens as they can get away with. Afterward, from a legal perspective, this case would never stand up in court. This whole thing is a phony cover-up being accepted, on its face, without scrutiny from the media.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
