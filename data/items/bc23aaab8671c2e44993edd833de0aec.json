  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Supernatural News/Parashare: It Ain't What You Think It Is Edition with Mallie Fox!!</p>\n\n<p>We welcome Supernatural News correspondent Mallie Fox back into the fold this week to explore the strange and unusual as eyewitnesses claim that the Chupacabra may not be the goat sucking canine you think it is, The Loch Ness Monster may not be the creature you think it is, and a 2600 year old gorgeous Mummy may not have the dental plan you think she might have had! </p>\n\n<p>PLUS! Tim starts off the show addressing the Darkness Radio audience about questions that have hit his inbox and some of the rumors on social media about the show. </p>\n",
