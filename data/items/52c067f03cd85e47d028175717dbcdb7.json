  "description": "<p>The doctrine of the Trinity is that God is one being who eternally exists in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In this passage of Jesus’s “high priestly prayer”—his prayer for his disciples the night before he died—Jesus gives us insights into the inner life of the Trinity.</p>\n<p>In this sermon, we will see how the doctrine of the Trinity helps us understand true glory. There are three things about God that we learn from the passage: 1) The ancient love; 2) The ultimate hour; 3) The welcoming glory.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 19, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: John 17:1-6, 20-26.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
