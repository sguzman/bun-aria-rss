A victorious Frank the Tank joins the show for a post-game interview and offers his favorite food-soda pairings (0:12:30). Kirk opens the phone lines to Steve Haters Only, and we're joined for the first time in along time by former President Donald Trump. Plus, Dr. Jill Biden is in Russia and she's got a real dilemma on her hands. Kirk made a phone call this morning that really killed him.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
