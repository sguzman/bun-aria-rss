  "description": "<p>EPISODE 30 - Alex Webb - Stills Photographer</p> <p>Team Deakins does something different with this episode. We took the opportunity to talk to an extraordinary visual talent who is NOT a part of movie production. He is a well known still photographer and someone we are great admirers of. It was great to talk with him about his work, what he thinks is important in photographer, how he approaches his work, the importance of color in his work, what pictures can mean and the role of serendipity in great photographs. It’s an immersive dive into creating visuals.</p>",
