  "description": "<h2>Burying Green: Eco-Friendly Death Care On The Rise</h2>\n<p>Dying, it turns out, isn’t carbon neutral. Like many of the choices we make in our lifetimes, the choice to cremate or preserve our bodies after death comes with tradeoffs as well. With preservation and burial, there’s the carbon cost of cemetery space, the materials to make a coffin, and the chemicals required to prevent decay. With cremation, the body’s carbon is <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/eco-friendly-death-care/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">released into the atmosphere</a> through the burning of natural gas.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why companies are starting to offer more eco-friendly options, such as water-assisted cremation. Composting human bodies is another option, allowing our carbon to be sequestered in the soil, and providing nutrients for ecosystems or gardens. But in the United States, these lower-carbon funereal options are often against the law.</p>\n<p>Now, that’s slowly changing, with pressure from people who wish to use those options for themselves when the time comes.
