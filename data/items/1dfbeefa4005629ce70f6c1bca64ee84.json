  "description": "The story of Faust and his infamous deal is one that has survived for hundreds of years. Beginning as whispers in Germany in the 1500s, it grew to plays and, most famously, a play by the German writer Goethe, largely considered to be one of the greatest works of German literature. The story has been done and redone, and the phase Faustian bargain is still in use to this day. In today's episode, we're getting back to the very beginning - to the legends behind the masterpieces, and the story of a doctor who just wanted every question answered and desire granted. Was that too much to ask? If you don't mind trading your soul, apparently it's not too much to ask. The creature this week is the onocentaur...a sad donkey centaur that needs to put down whatever he's carrying in order to run like a weird little bug. -- Sponsors: Test prep for standardized tests doesn't have to be stressful, boring, or expensive.
