  "description": "<p>My guest today Nate Bargatze and I are talking about Hollywood, and its pontifical actors who can’t seem to stop gabbing. They give us their opinions constantly, all day long, and most of the time without doing any research or taking the time to educate themselves beforehand. Or it's the self-important cause that they’re shoving in your face. But a lot of people are struggling, and Hollywood just keeps talking down to you. It’s infuriating, and we can’t stand it or them.</p> <p>Us comics, on the other hand, like to stay in our lane. We try to tell jokes, make you laugh. Not telling you how to live or what the deal is with this or that. And Nate does just that. His output & the level that he’s hitting on stage is amazing. He crushes it every time.  An interesting thing about his stand-up, which has nothing to do with his success — is that he’s incredibly clean. But you wouldn’t necessarily notice it unless it’s pointed out. You can’t go wrong with his stuff. You will go wrong with my stuff. You don’t have to pause his specials when your dad walks in. That's 3 specials you can watch with your family, including his new one that is available now! </p> <p>His brand new special \"The Greatest Average American\" is available and streaming on Netflix today. He literally is the greatest average American. You won’t hear any thoughts on social justice, how to live your life, who to vote for, or what church to go to. You will, however, laugh the entire time.  Watch 'The Greatest Average American' on Netflix is a Joke TODAY!</p> <p>▸ Watch the trailer for Nate's new special!
