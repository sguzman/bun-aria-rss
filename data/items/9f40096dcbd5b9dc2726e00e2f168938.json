On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Julia Wall, Mary Challman of the \"Monster Movie Happy Hour\" Podcast, and Patrick McGuire & Matt Borders of \"The History Things Podcast\" to discuss perhaps the most popular military engagement in all of fantasy: The Battle of Helm's Deep, as seen in \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\". The gang discusses the tactical pros and cons of both the Rohan defenders under King Theoden and the Uruk Hai hordes of the White Wizard Saruman. Things get super nerdy and they hype for this episode among the host and co-hosts is very real. This may very well be the beginning of the Fantasy battle crew on Battles & Banter. Enjoy!</p>",
