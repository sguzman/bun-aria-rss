    "media:description": "The countries and people of the Middle East/West Asia and North Africa are very often group together from a cultural, genetic, linguistic and religious point of view, but are Middle Easterners and North Africans the same race? There are many different interesting people groups and cultures originating from Southwest Eurasia and they have influenced and been influenced by almost every region on Earth, despite what many may think.\n\nIn today's video we're going to be looking at the history and pre-history of the Greater Middle Eastern region and see where they line up from a genetic standpoint and how religion, language and different historical events have shaped the modern people groups across this mega-region. Thanks for watching!",
