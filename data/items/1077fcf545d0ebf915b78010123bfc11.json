  "description": "Putting the Corona virus aside for a moment, on this week’s Debunking Economics podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Steve Keen about our use of energy. He raises the dilemma of energy prices – if they are too low, usage goes up, expanding our ecological footprint. If you try to counter that by artificially inflating prices, it’s the poor who suffer – as evidenced by the riots in Paris. So, how do we limit our appetite for energy, and can we do it without destroying the world economy? And, importantly, can we do it when power creation and distribution is largely in the hands of private companies?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
