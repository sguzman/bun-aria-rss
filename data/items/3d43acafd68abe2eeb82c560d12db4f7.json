That'd be pretty cool, right?</p><p>We call this the Good Life Bucket \"Trifecta,\" because, in one fell swoop, you fill all three Good Life Buckets: Vitality, Connection and Contribution (for more on the buckets, just download the intro to How to Live a Good Life. <a href=\"http://www.goodlifeproject.com/book/\" target=\"_blank\">It's free here</a>).</p><p>The more you can seek out or create these opportunities, the better your life becomes. In today's riff, we're sharing a great example of a Good Life Bucket Trifecta (hint: it involves a whole lotta snow) and how you might explore integrating this concept into your quest to live a good life.</p><p><strong>Good Life Science:</strong>&nbsp;In our Good Life Science segment, we're diving into some fascinating new research on anti-aging, mushrooms, how they affect your health, fight aging and potentially even protect against dementia. Oh, and by the way, we're not talking about \"those\" mushrooms (ya know, \"magic\" ones).
