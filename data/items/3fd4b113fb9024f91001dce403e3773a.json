  "description": "<p>If you've read my book Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda, taken my quiz on iamsahararose.com, read my blog, follow me on Instagram or listen to my podcasts, you already know about the Ayurvedic Doshas (mind-body types). But what fewer people in the US know about are the KOSHAS, the layers OUTSIDE our bodies, which are just as important. In this episode, I discuss all about the Koshas and how we are essentially human radios, picking up on subtle frequencies that provide us with more information than our minds ever can.</p> <p>I recommend listening to this episode with chapter 20 of my book Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda open because I explain it all in great depth in the book!</p> <p>Be part of a community that supports you discovering your dharma in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood collective with community, content, creativity and so much more — learn more about rosegoldgoddesses.com.</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Discover your Dharma with my free quiz at https://iamsahararose.com/</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at: Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books Eat Feel Fresh + Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda: https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
