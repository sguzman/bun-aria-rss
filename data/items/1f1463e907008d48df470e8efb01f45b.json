  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">I was a guest on the \"So Now What\" podcast by Lana Mankowski.</p> <p>She helps women who have a history of infertility and couldn't have a child.</p> <p>Why did she want to talk to me? She's a member of my No BS Weightloss program and joined to lose weight gained while going through IVF.</p> <p>She knew that the two of us could have a powerful conversation about the struggles these women feel with their weight, their body, and what's next for them.</p> <p>You know I have a child, but I understand what it's like to feel as if you're broken. I talk about the years of shame and guilt I had around Logan having autism. (And bring the tissues if you cry when I cry. I cried a lot.)</p> <p>We talk about how to think about the future when one dream ends and a new dream needs to be created.</p> <p>We discuss body image and dealing with feeling broken or like your body has failed you.</p> <p>I think every woman can benefit from this conversation. If you've ever felt less than, like your body isn't \"normal\", or lost as to how to move forward in life when you're dealt with a dream crushing blow, this podcast will help you.</p> <p>Listen to Episode 271: I'm Broken (IVF x Weightloss).</p> <p>And <a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-so-now-what-podcast/id1584920374\"> CLICK HERE</a> to subscribe to Lana's podcast, too, because she was kind enough to let me share it with all of you.
