  "description": "Humorist David Sedaris talks about his new collection of personal essays, called <em>Happy-Go-Lucky</em>. This book has some pretty serious writing about his late father, who died a year ago at the age of 98. Throughout Sedaris' life, his father bullied him, and belittled him and his accomplishments. \"My father was not a good person, but he was a great character,\" he says.<br/><br/><em>Ken Tucker reviews Kendrick Lamar's new album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers. <br/><br/></em>Also, we'll speak with<em> New York Times </em>religion correspondent Ruth Graham about how the issues dividing the Republican party are creating tensions within white evangelical churches across the country. Graham says many pastors are being pressured to resist vaccines and mask mandates, embrace Trump's claims about election fraud and adopt QAnon-based conspiracy theories.",
