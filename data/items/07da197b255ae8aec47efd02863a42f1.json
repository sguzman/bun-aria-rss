  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast, Colin is back on the show and we’re just about a week away from releasing our latest movie with our friends at Yes Theory. Make sure to head to yestheory.com/documentary to get early access to the film - it comes out on August 11th and we’d love for all of you to check it out\nAnother thing that is happening this week is that i’m turning 30. Colin and I love to talk about big milestones and i think that’s probably because we’ve gone through some pretty pivotal moments together over that past 7 years. Turning 30 feels like one of those big moments. On this episode we talk about my expectations and feelings going into the next decade of life and the concept of balancing time while trying to achieve creative and financial goals.",
