  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’re headed back to 2007 this week, to talk about Mary Balogh’s <em>A Matter of Class</em>, which Sarah’s editor gave her as assigned reading when she was writing <em>A Rogue By Any Other Name</em>. We’re leaving plot and character aside here and really digging into structure, so expect conversations about timelines, about language and yes…about tense. Because, Jen.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Whether you're new to Fated Mates this month or have been with us for all three seasons, we adore you, and we're so grateful to have you.&nbsp;We hope you’re reading the best books this week.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, it’s a morality chain romance interstitial! After that comes our next read along, which is still in discussion—stay tuned! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For what it’s worth, this is our 119th episode, so time to clarify the pronunciation of MacLean.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pEOVNmSR7_c\">Say it like the last name of famous movie badass, John McClane from&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em></a>. Jen is now very mad at herself and thinking of renaming herself Jennifer Diesel in honor of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Toretto\">Vin Diesel and the Fast & Furious movie franchise</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you liked&nbsp;<em>A Matter of Class</em>, check out Balogh’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lpGzQk\">Bedwyn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cFtUVB\">Westcott series</a>. PS, Jen thinks she deserves a lot of credit for not cracking up at “A quiet, stiff hero.”</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah’s editor at Avon is Carrie Feron.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://talltalestogo.wordpress.com/2017/05/24/my-top-tips-for-writing-a-time-slip-novel-by-kim-fleet/\">Time slip</a>&nbsp;is a narrative structure where stories are not told in chronological order.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.exactlywhatistime.com/other-aspects-of-time/time-in-literature/\">Here is an entire website about time</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Although Jen couldn’t find the article for “I write what I can’t draw, I draw what I can’t write,” a few people on the internet also give credit to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/v9onZpQix_w\">Marjane Satrapi</a>, author of the amazing graphic novel&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ox0Ac3\">Persepolis.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah’s friend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.carrieryan.com/\">Carrie Ryan writes YA</a>, and she’s the one who talked about the difficulties of secrets in first person narration.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Q3RQdA\"><em>Butterfly in Frost</em>&nbsp;by Sylvia Day</a>&nbsp;is a book in first person that didn’t work for Jen. It seemed like the narrator was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Dissociative-Disorders\">dissociating</a>, which is different than keeping a secret. Although she never mentioned&nbsp;<em>Butterfly in Frost</em>&nbsp;in the piece, the book inspired Jen to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/can-romance-fiction-have-unreliable-narrators/\">write about the problems with unreliable narrators in romance for Kirkus.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)\"><em>The Crown</em>&nbsp;is a Netflix series</a>&nbsp;that is well-regarded, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a34823816/the-crown-season-4-controversy/\">difficulties of portraying the modern years of the monarchy</a>&nbsp;has been well-documented.

They also routinely referred to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22320355/meghan-markle-oprah-prince-harry-archie-cbs-royal-british-monarchy-queen-firm-institution-explainer\">“the Institution” and “The Firm”</a>&nbsp;to distinguish the monarchy from individuals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A few weeks ago,<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/2/24/s0327-retellings-in-romance-novels-with-kate-clayborn\">&nbsp;Kate Clayborn joined us to talk about retellings</a>.&nbsp;<em>A Matter of Class</em>&nbsp;gave Jen some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed#:~:text=%22Star%2Dcrossed%22%20or%20%22,are%20working%20against%20the%20relationship.\">Romeo & Juliet feelings</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah's dual timeline books are&nbsp;<em>The Day of the Duchess</em>&nbsp;and \"The Duke of Christmas Present,\" which is in the&nbsp;<em>How the Dukes Stole Christmas</em>&nbsp;anthology. Sherry Thomas's&nbsp;<em>Private Arrangements</em>&nbsp;is a fabulous example of it, as well.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6QWZy7vo4Dw9eS733PJj1U?si=oQWUglgYSiGIbrjNRkcTqw\"><strong>Music</strong></a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Alice Cooper -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/79574389\">School's Out</a>, Nine Inch Nails -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1418211133\">I Do Not Want This</a>, Steve Miller Band -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1440832763\">Fly Like An Eagle</a></p>",
