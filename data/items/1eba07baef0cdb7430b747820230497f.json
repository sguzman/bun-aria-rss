  "description": "In Episode 100 I sit down with Drew Harrisberg to talk about the first 100 episodes of this show and broadly speaking some of the most important learnings that I have taken away, particularly on human and planetary health. We also delve into the current circumstances that we all find ourselves in and reflect on our personal experiences and learnings thus far. While this free-flowing chat between two mates is exactly as I imagined and the perfect summary for the first 100 episodes, the unplanned nature of it means we do jump around a little bit. But for those willing to look past that I think there is some thought provoking material inside for everyone.\n\nThanks for all your support. I really do appreciate all of you and look forward to bringing you another 100 episodes.\n\nIf you haven't already, please leave a review on the Apple Podcast App:\nIf you are enjoying the show and can take a minute or so to leave a review on the Apple podcast app it would be much appreciated.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
