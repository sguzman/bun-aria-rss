The common denominator between all of these things is food, or more specifically, our food system. The way our food is grown, transported, processed, and consumed is making us sick and driving health disparities related to income and race, especially among marginalized groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Marcia Chatelain, Dr. Rupa Marya, Raj Patel, and Karen Washington about creating a society that cultivates health, how our existing social structures predispose us to illness, and how we can make great changes to our food system through grassroots efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Marcia Chatelain is a professor of history and African American studies at Georgetown University. The author of <em>South Side Girls: Growing up in the Great Migration</em>, she teaches about women’s and girls’ history, as well as black capitalism. Her latest book, <em>Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America</em>, examines the intricate relationship among African American politicians, civil rights organizations, communities, and the fast food industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Rupa Marya is an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, where she practices and teaches Internal Medicine. Her research examines the health impacts of social systems, from agriculture to policing. She is a cofounder of the Do No Harm Coalition, a collective of health workers committed to addressing disease through structural change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raj Patel is a research professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs, a professor in the university’s department of nutrition, and a research associate at Rhodes University, South Africa.

She is the co-owner and farmer at Rise & Root Farm in Chester, New York. Karen cofounded Black Urban Growers (BUGS), an organization supporting growers in both urban and rural settings. In 2012, <em>Ebony</em> magazine voted her one of the 100 most influential African Americans in the country, and in 2014 Karen was the recipient of the James Beard Leadership Award.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and Rupa Health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/hyman</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests.
