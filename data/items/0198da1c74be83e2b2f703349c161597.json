  "description": "The Bank of England, like many central banks, has used Quantitative Easing as a tool to try and engender growth in the economy. It’s a tool they had to resort to when sustained low interest rates failed to achieve the desired outcome.

In fact, the UK’s Treasury Committee is running an inquiry into the Effectiveness and Impact of post-2008 UK Monetary Policy and we discuss Steve’s submission in the podcast.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
