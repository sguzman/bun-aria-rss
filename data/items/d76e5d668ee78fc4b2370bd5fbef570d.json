  "description": "<p>A friend of ours writes a daily newsletter, and he recently featured a 74 year old named Paul who has lived inside of an iron lung since he was six years old. Paul was completely paralyzed due to polio from the neck down, and his disability means a life that most of us could barely imagine. But that didn’t stop Paul from achieving many goals over his lifetime- he taught himself to write with a pen in his mouth, he earned a college degree, and even went on to become a lawyer! We share this to highlight that there are a number of factors outside our control, and we should instead focus our energy on the things that we do have control over. There’s little that we can do when it comes to the economy, recessions, and inflation. But we do have a say over our personal finances- the financial foundation we build for ourselves, the money we spend, the money we invest, and the ways that we ensure a healthy and steady income. Listen as we cover all of that and more during this episode!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a 2022 Mexican Cake by Westbrook Brewing!
