  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, there is no legal reason to protect the identity of the whistleblower! The Constitution trumps any statute and the whistleblower statute doesn't apply to the president or matters of foreign policy within the White House. Democrats are defying the Constitution and are not upholding the law. Similarly, the statute does not apply to this whistleblower because he was not a direct employee of the President nor does the statute guarantee any protections for anonymity. Sen. Richard Burr has come out from hibernation and erroneously agreed with Democrats that the whistleblower should remain anonymous, this is a disservice to the American people. It’s unconscionable that the Democrats, the media and many others doing their best to support this impeachment process without ever knowing who started it. Then, John Solomon reports that internal government memos obtained by a FOIA request show that there were documented concerns about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma while VP Joe Biden was in office. This is a massive cover-up! Hunter Biden must be questioned as a witness during these impeachment proceedings. Finally, Donald Trump Jr calls in to discuss his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
