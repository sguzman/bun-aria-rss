  "description": "In all modern logic, Tim Pool and Glenn Beck should not get along. But after Trump’s election, this anarchist, avid environmentalist, and former Bernie-supporter saw the Democrat Party shift radically before his eyes. Now the left calls him a conservative, just for holding on to American values, reality, and individual rights. In this interview, Tim joins Glenn to show how two people can disagree on politics, yet still hold the same principles, including free speech, nonviolence, and hearing people out. With this common ground, they dive in to everything from socialism, open borders, and the alt-right to Elon Musk’s NeuraLink, Facebook’s Libra, and the frightening future of AI algorithms.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
