  "description": "Jenn and Alex explain how months-long protests to oust a brutal dictator in Sudan, once so hopeful, have fallen victim to a bloody repression campaign. After initial peaceful talks, a government-linked paramilitary group decided to attack demonstrators, killing as many as 100 people and dumping bodies in the Nile River. The worry now is that Sudan is turning into another Arab Spring-like horror story, meaning that another repressive regime may ultimately survive despite the will of the people. Jenn shows off her Middle East expertise, Alex hosts Worldly for the first time, and both hope the Sudanese protesters get justice.\nReferences:\nThis piece from Vox’s Jen Kirby outlines how the military coup that ousted Bashir happened and why protesters still weren’t satisfied. \nAnd this piece from former Vox intern Salwa Sadek takes a look at the women who have been at the forefront of the protest movement in Sudan. \nHere’s more on what we know about the death toll so far and the reports of sexual assault against protesters.\n\nThis is a great article about how the Rabaa Massacre in Egypt ended the Arab Spring.\nFor a good primer on the Arab Spring more generally, check out The Arab Uprisings: What Everyone Needs to Know.\n\nJenn also mentioned that this week was the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in China.
