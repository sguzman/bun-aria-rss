  "description": "<p>Deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser pulses with tuneable wavelength and very short\nduration are a key enabling technology for next-generation technology and\nultrafast science. Their generation has been the subject of extensive\nexperimental effort, but no technique demonstrated thus far has been able to\nmeet all requirements in one light source. Here we demonstrate a bright,\nefficient, and compact source of tuneable deep ultraviolet ultrafast laser\npulses based on resonant dispersive wave emission in hollow capillary fibre. In\na total footprint of only 120 $\\times$ 75 cm, including the Yb-based drive\nlaser, we generate pulses between 208 and 363 nm at 50 kHz repetition rate with\na total efficiency of up to 3.6%. Down-scaling of the DUV generation reduces\nthe required energy sufficiently to enable the generation of two-colour\nfew-femtosecond DUV pulses.\n</p>",
