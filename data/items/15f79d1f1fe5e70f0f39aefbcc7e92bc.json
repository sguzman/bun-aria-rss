  "description": "<p><p>Kawhi Leonard is a Clipper and we're back after a week off. All the fall out from the Kawhi News. Lebron doesn't run the league, everyone runs from Russ, Ballmer and Kawhi are a hilarious duo, everyone's sources were wrong and the NBA offseason is the best (2:28 - 25:28). We won another World Cup not to brag (25:28 - 28:55). Who's back of the week including Peter King eating the trash (28:55- 40:56). NL MVP Christian Yelich joins the show to talk about his VERY unfortunate back injury that keeps him out of Monday's Home Run Derby, if he'll play Tuesday night, and a new bet for the All Star Game to make good on missing Monday's derby (40:56 - 55:14). Segments include the Mt Rushmore of easy thrills, connect the dots what the fuck was up with the Bleacher Report picture, way to stay relevant baseball the Reds wore awesome uniforms Sunday. And a special Monday Reading for our friend Jared LorenzenÂ </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
