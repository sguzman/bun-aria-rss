  "description": "<p>We’re all trying to make sense of the new world order. And while my wife and I stay at home and navigate these unusual times, we find routine and practice to be the core of our wellbeing. We’re meditating every morning, going for walks in the woods, and taking afternoon work breaks to check-in and find time to connect. These seemingly simple actions have become the parts of our day that keep us grounded and optimistic, so we actually even schedule them into our calendars.&nbsp;</p><br><p>One of my favorite people to talk to about the benefits of spiritual and wellness practices is Gabrielle Bernstein. I was so happy to connect with her over a video-call for this week’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>. Gabby is the #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>The Universe Has Your Back</em> and has written six additional bestsellers, including <em>Super Attractor</em> which launched in September 2019. She was featured on Oprah’s <em>Super Soul Sunday</em> as a “next-generation thought leader” and The Oprah Winfrey Network chose Gabrielle to be part of the “Super Soul 100,” a dynamic group of 100 trailblazers whose vision and life’s work are bringing a higher level of consciousness to the world. Gabby provides a calm perspective to the crazy situation we find ourselves in.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Joovv and Four Sigmatic.</p><br><p>I recently discovered Joovv, a red light therapy device. Red light therapy is a super gentle non-invasive treatment where a device with medical-grade LEDs delivers concentrated light to your skin. It actually helps your cells produce collagen so it improves skin tone and complexion, diminishes signs of aging like wrinkles, and speeds the healing of wounds and scars.
