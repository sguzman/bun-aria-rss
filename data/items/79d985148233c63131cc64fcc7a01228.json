Surprise, you bought a haunted object. The world’s most famous collection of haunted objects resides in a small building in New England, on a property once owned by Ed And Lorraine Warren. The famed Annabelle doll, and many other relics of real-life horror, all trapped behind its walls and the binding prayers that are said there. Today we take a deep dive into some of those objects and some of the places they came from, as we have a conversation with Eric Vitale of the New England Society for Paranormal Research.<br>\nFor tickets to The Warrens Seekers of The Supernatural Para-con Oct 29 at Mohican Sun Hotel in Connecticut visit <a href=\"http://Nesper.com\">Nesper.com</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong>PART 2 - AVAILABLE TO GRAVE KEEPERS ONLY - LISTEN HERE</strong></a> <strong>In part two of our interview, </strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong>available only to Grave Keepers</strong></a><strong>, we discuss:<br>\n</strong><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Are there more undiagnosed cases of possession in today’s world than there was in the past?<br>\nAre spirits often present for their own funeral? <br>\nWhat happened to Eric and his life at a haunted B & B with a cemetery in the back yard? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>As a Grave Keeper, for $5 per month you will get:</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Access to every </strong><a href=\"http://www.thegravetalks.com/category/podcast-episodes/\"><strong>episode</strong></a><strong> of our show, AD-FREE – MONTHS BEFORE THEY GO PUBLIC.</strong>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Access to every EXCLUSIVE PART 2 episode of our show for Grave Keeper Only!</strong></div>\n<div><strong>Access to submit questions to upcoming guests of our show.</strong></div>\n<div><strong>The “good feeling” knowing that you are keeping this show alive (It really does feel good!)</strong></div>\n<div>Listen to part two of this interview and get exclusive access to HUNDREDS of bonus episodes at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\">http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks</a></strong></a>\n</div>\n",
