  "description": "This is a masterclass on the art of the interview from one the best political interviewers alive. Nick Robinson explains his approach, not just to interviewing, but to politics, broadcasting and people. Mixing sharp insights about populism and the role of the media with great anecdotes about how to control a 'Leaders Debate' and the tricks that both politicians and journalists use to gain an upper hand. Oh and why Wayne Rooney might be the scariest person he's ever interviewed...
