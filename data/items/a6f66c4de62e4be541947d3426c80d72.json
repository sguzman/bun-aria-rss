  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that TempTick and Turla are interested in the US-North Korean summit. That summit might not take up many cybersecurity issues. Where did North Korea get all that digital rope they want to hang the West with? It seems we competed to sell it to them, more-or-less unwittingly.

Microsoft outbid Google for GitHub—what will Redmond do with all that code? Facebook may have a complicated relationship with Shanghai. Johannes Ullrich from the ICS Stormcast podcast on deserialization. Guest is Ameesh Divatia from Baffle on GDPR and cloud data privacy.",
