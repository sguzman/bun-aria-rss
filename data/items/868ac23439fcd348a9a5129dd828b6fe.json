Mahomes, 24, the reigning NFL Most Valuable Player, was named MVP of the Super Bowl as well. One advertising executive said he stands to rake in up to $7 million more in annual endorsement income. Also discussed was one particular prop bet that had fans waiting until the very end of the game. It had to do with how many rushing yards Mahomes would total. His kneel downs at the very end pushed the total to the under. And also discussed is whether the NFL players would agree to a 17-game season as part of talks aimed at reaching a new collective bargaining agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p><br></p><p>Producer: Tim Herro</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
