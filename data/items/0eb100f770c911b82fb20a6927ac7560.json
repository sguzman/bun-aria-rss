  "description": "<p>How many times each week should you train a muscle? In the bodybuilding world there is a belief that intensity and recovery are key. This has led to the body part split where you blast a muscle group and then take days off from training that group to allow the muscle to recover. Studies are now confirming what Sal, Adam & Justin have been saying since the inception of Mind Pump, that more frequent stimulation of the muscle builds more muscle. In this episode they reveal why and what you need to know to successfully incorporate frequency into your workout regimen to increase your muscle growth. Please subscribe, rate and review this show! Each week the best reviewers are announced on the show and sent Mind Pump T-shirts! Learn more about Mind Pump at www.mindpumpmedia.com.</p>",
