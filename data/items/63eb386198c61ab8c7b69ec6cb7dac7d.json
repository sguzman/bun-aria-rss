  "description": "<div>The details of this case are extremely difficult to hear. Extreme child abuse and child murder are involved. This episode won't be for everybody. There is far more courtroom audio than narration. It is a one-off for this episode. It is not something that will be a regular feature in the future. The courtroom confession is detailed and horrific. Listener discretion is advised.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-20-stoni-blair-and-stephen-berry/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-20-stoni-blair-and-stephen-berry\">casefilepodcast.com/case-20-stoni-blair-and-stephen-berry</a><br>\n</strong></a><br>\n\n</div>\n",
