You may also recognize Hinkle from her long-running role as Judith on Two and a Half Men, and so many other contributions in theater, TV, and film. We’re huge fans of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385792/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marin</a>, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and the entire ensemble cast. As we sat down with her in the studio, we discovered not just an incredible actor, but also someone who radiates kindness, warmth, and generosity of spirit, someone who is beautifully open, someone who left us feeling like we’d just spent time with an old friend.&nbsp;</p><p>In today's conversation, we explored Hinkle's time growing up outside Boston, her love of the ocean and devotion to ballet in the early days that, after an injury, created the space for acting to emerge while at Brown and take center stage. We talk about the people who’ve touched down and served as teachers and mentors and explore candidly the tough decisions that came along the way as she stepped into the business of acting, the many learnings and how family began to take more of the spotlight over time. Marin also shares her very human experience with pain and how her time on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel became not just a job for her, but also a source of awakening and discovery, peace and ease.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
