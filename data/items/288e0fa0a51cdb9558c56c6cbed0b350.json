  "itunes:summary": "Traditionally the fall is a time of transition, not only in terms of weather, but for students it means the beginning of a new year. To enter a new classroom. To be part of a whole new environment.\n\nHowever, amidst the continued fear and threat of COVID-19, the Fall of 2020 is a beginning to a new school year unlike any other.\n\nFor students and teaching staff at Carleton, and universities across the country, this has meant engaging in a pedagogical shift unlike any time in history and moving instruction almost entirely online. This continental shift has come with its fair share of challenges, challenges that professors, teaching assistants, staff and students themselves are trying to find solutions to with each passing day.\n\nHow can one create a meaningful educational experience for students online? How do we foster community in socially distant environments? And are there actually opportunities for innovation hidden deep within education at a distance â€“ opportunities which may pave the way for more progressive and enlightened pedagogy?\n\nTo discuss these questions and more we spoke to Professor Jonathan Malloy. A pillar of the community at Carleton University, Professor Malloy has been with the Department of Political Science for over two decades, taking on the role of department chair from 2012 to 2018. A renowned expert in Canadian politics, as well as in the mentorship and career development of graduate students, Professor Malloy is the current Bell Chair in Canadian Parliamentary Democracy and will chair the Canadian Political Science Associationâ€™s annual conference next year at Congress 2021.\n\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
