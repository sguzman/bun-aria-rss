  "title": "ZBT #179: July 4th Safety Brief + Stanley Rubin",
  "description": "<p><p>This special Independence Day edition of ZBT has two parts:</p><p>1) We school our pal Feitelberg on what it's like to be deployed, with a musical twist.</p><p>2) Back in March of 2017, we interviewed then 92-year-old Stanley Rubin, an Iwo Jima veteran. The podcast was still brand new when it originally aired, so you might have missed it. Stanley tells his story of landing in Iwo Jima, and more about his military career. It's Chaps' favorite interview he's ever done. </p><p>Thanks for listening and have a safe holiday!!!</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
