  "description": "<p>In this episode Kevin and Justin take a long, hard look at abortion in America. With the new law in Texas making news, and a potential challenge to <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, they help us get back to basics with practical resources for changing hearts and minds regarding abortion. They also ask where the primary threat to the American church is coming from. Is it secularism from outside, or corruption and sin inside? And in a moment of light disagreement, they discuss the pro and cons of depicting Jesus in media like The Chosen. Plus, the book recommendations that are not at the top of everyone’s mind. </p>\n<p><strong>Life and Books and Everything</strong> is sponsored by Crossway, publisher of <em>The Death of Porn</em>, by Ray Ortlund. </p>\n<p>In <em>The Death of Porn</em>, Ray Ortlund writes six personal letters, as from a father to his son.
