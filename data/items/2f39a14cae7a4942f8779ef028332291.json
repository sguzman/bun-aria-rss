  "description": "If you ask fitness’s most preeminent leaders what the future of the industry holds, they’ll probably use the word omnichannel. But is omnichannel fitness—a cohesive blend of physical and digital offerings—really possible?\nIf Covid-19 taught us anything, it’s that the answer remains largely unknown. But that doesn’t mean more traditional fitness businesses aren’t going to try catching up to the Pelotons of the world.\nToday on Business Casual, Harvey Spevak, executive chairman and managing partner of Equinox Group, the company behind Equinox gyms, SoulCycle, and more, weighs in. He’ll explain how a company rooted in bricks and mortar can compete with digital upstarts, how personality-driven fitness reigns supreme, and, finally, how adaptability makes it all happen.\nAnd trust me—these lessons are applicable for far more than just the fitness industry.",
