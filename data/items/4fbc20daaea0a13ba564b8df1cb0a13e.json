  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats assisted the so-called whistleblower to file his or her complaint, as was initially pointed out on this program that Adam Schiff was behind this whole 'leak and coup campaign.\" It’s been confirmed today that Schiff already knew about the forthcoming complaint and his staff had been in touch with the so-called whistleblower. This is yet another lie of omission and deceit from Schiff and the left. In the same way, this report from the New York Times explains why Speaker Pelosi didn't wait to see the actual transcript because they were basing this whole thing on the lawyer-written complaint of the so-called whistleblower who is reported to be a CIA employee. According to the New York Times, Schiff's staff was coordinating with the whistleblower despite Schiff's denials of any collusion. What the New York Times fails to mention is why the whistleblower bypassed the traditional route of a complaint and disclosed it to Schiff's Intel Committee staff. Then, Attorney General Barr is under attack and Pelosi is in a hurry to get this impeachment over with before everyone figures out what the Democrats are doing. This entire impeachment charade is to burn down the Trump presidency and reverse the 2016 election. This type of interference is exactly what the Stalin-era of the Soviet Union was like. Later, the Democrats have taken the approach of the French Revolution — using a political guillotine on all of their rivals. Finally, Alex Marlow calls in to discuss the LAPD not allowing recruiting ads on Breitbart’s website because it creates a “negative juxtaposition to our core values.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
