Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is the world’s leading expert in Muscle-Centric Medicine, a revolutionary approach to improving muscular health through a protein-rich diet, exercise, and lifestyle shifts. Her protocol teaches muscle optimization for body composition, vitality, and overall long-term health.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode contains mind-blowing conversations on the power of dietary protein, and why it’s been demonized in our culture.
