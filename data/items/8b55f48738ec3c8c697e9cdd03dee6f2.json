This week, the Senate is planning to vote on legislation that would codify abortion rights into a federal law, but it's likely to fail given the 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans. That means abortion access will be left up to states — and some already have restrictive abortion laws. <br/><br/>Reproductive justice advocates are concerned about the disproportionate impact those laws will have on Black and Brown communities if <em>Roe </em>is overturned.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/984821709/sandhya-dirks\">NPR's Sandhya Dirks</a> spoke to some advocates about how women of color are situated in this abortion access debate.
