  "description": "<p>Bobby Lee invited me over to his house to do this podcast about the second generation of Comedy Store door guys. We recorded this at Tiger Belly studios, which is just his living room, I guess. Bobby was a door guy at the Store before I got there. He worked way closer with Mitzi and I'm in the middle of a 4 part series on the door guys at the Comedy Store. I already had done #3. #1 will come at some point down the road and then #4. It's a crazy job and I want to hear about how it's changed through the years.</p>",
