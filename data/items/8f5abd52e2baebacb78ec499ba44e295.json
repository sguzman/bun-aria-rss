  "description": "<p>In what could be described as the scariest year yet (for some of us anyway), the Battles and Banter family still tries to celebrate Halloween 2020 right! On this year's special, Avery is joined by horror movie expert Mary Challman of the \"Monster Movie Happy Hour Podcast\" to talk about a movie that used to scare the living daylights out of him as a child: <em>DOG SOLIDERS</em> (2002). Written and directed by Neil Marshall (<em>The Descent</em>, <em>Hellboy</em>), this film tells the story about a squad of British Army soldiers who do battle with a pack of werewolves in the Scottish Highlands. Avery and Mary dive into a SPOILER-heavy review of the film, as well as the events of the battle that would take place in Uath's Glen, named for the family that lived there...and who just happened to be the ones indulging in certain <em>lunar</em> activities. It's a heck of a good time so strap in for BnB's 2020 Halloween Special on a movie that truly is a horror-war hybrid. Enjoy and Happy Halloween!</p>",
