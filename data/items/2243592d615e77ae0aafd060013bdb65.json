This is the 7th time the event is happening in Pakistan.

National competitiveness will be increased through developing ICT talent in Pakistan. Upgrades of teaching methods and connectivity with the industrial development will be focused upon. This will direct the students to perceive employer’s perspective by developing their ICT knowledge.

These include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and most importantly 5G broadband—seen as a crucial digital-service enabler. The competition is a unique opportunity for students to test their abilities in these cutting-edge fields, and helps colleges and universities to better understand the talent requirements of today’s top businesses and government leaders.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Roadshows and awareness sessions are in full swing and have already been conducted at 80+ colleges and universities all around Pakistan, both onsite and online.
