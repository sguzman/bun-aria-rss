  "description": "As you've probably come to expect, the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, perhaps the second most famous story from One Thousand and One Nights, is much more violent than modern adaptations would have us believe. Medieval Persia was a dangerous place, and you needed to have your wits, a lot of luck, and apparently an extremely loyal, wily slave girl to survive. The creature this week is the Nix, and it will give you yet another reason to shout at strangers in the grocery store. Wanting an easy way to build a website?
