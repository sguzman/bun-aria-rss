  "description": "<p>Parenting isn't easy, and Rachel Jankovic's \"Sir Badalot and the Cranky Danky Dragon\" gives parents the tools to talk with their fat-faced toddlers about emotional self-control. Most parents do that by resorting to the poor parenting tactics of 1) emotional distraction, and 2) emotional reaction. Turns out, your child's response to a \"fussy dragon\" should include actually pretending to kill it! But the self-control vitamins are not why Sir Badalot is a good book -- that's just an added benefit. The SASF guys host Rachel Jankovic to talk through this parenting advice and how her fun new book, illustrated by Hello Ninja's own Forrest Dickision, is really just a fresh chocolate cookie for a hungry child. (Oh, and you'll also get a nice long stretch of Nate's dark take on relying on real-life vs fictional friends.)</p>\n<p>#SirBadalot #CanonballBooks #SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #RachelJankovic #ForrestDickision #HelloNinja #FussyDragon</p>",
