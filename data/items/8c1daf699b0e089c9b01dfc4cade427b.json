  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are finally live from the recently completed new studio. Joining the show is 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and member of the Denver Broncos’ 50th anniversary, Mark Schlereth. Pat and Stink cover the Antonio Brown situation and whether or not people are misinterpreting the whole ordeal, his thoughts on the ways the NFL is changing, and what the NFL should do about the overtime rule as he called the Cardinals/Lions game on Sunday. Mark also sticks around for some questions from the boys as they discuss his acting career, what it was like meeting The Rock, how the chili business is, and who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl this year. You’re not going to want to miss this one (2:34-57:45). Also, one of the most electric humans on the face of the earth, one of the main men responsible for the new studio, Technical Operations Director of DAZN and England’s finest, Petro Mnych, joins the show. They discuss how he thinks the relationship between PMI and DAZN will go, what some of the most challenging aspects of building the studio were, what is going on in England right now with the Queen and the Royal family, and Petro busts Zeet’s balls as they chat about their growing friendly rivalry. Today’s show is a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
