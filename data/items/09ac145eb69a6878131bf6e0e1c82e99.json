  "description": "<p>Baniff and Southwest battled in court for domination over the skies. Southwest came out on top for a little while, but Baniff pushed back with prices Southwest just couldn't beat. The only way Southwest could fight back was to give the mostly male, mostly businessmen clientele something they couldn't refuse: free booze. For the first time ever, Southwest is in the black. With Baniff tamed, there's more turbulence. This time, it's a national airline. American Airlines is here to play.</p><p><em>Please note, this episode originally aired in 2018. </em></p><p>Listen to new episodes 1 week early and to all episodes ad free with Wondery+.
