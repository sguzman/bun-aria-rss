  "description": "<p>What does it mean that humans are created in the image of God? In this episode, the guys discuss the biblical theme of the image of God and its implications for Jesus followers. As humans, we bear the image of God, but what is the purpose of this for us––what is the purpose for God? Creating images of gods was a fairly familiar concept in the ancient world, but representing the image of God, not through a statue or idol but through your very being, has profound significance.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode (01:31-13:58), the guys talk about Genesis 1. This passage tells us that humans were created in God’s image and then given the task to rule over creation. Compared to the Babylonian creation myth, the biblical story of creation gives a worldview and social order that is pretty unique.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode (14:14-26:10), Tim and Jon talk about the purpose behind God creating humans in his image. After God creates Adam and Eve, he tasks them with subduing creation? What does this mean? How should we be “subduing” God’s creation?</p>\n<p>In the final part of the episode (26:26-44:50), the guys talk about the ancient context of creating images of gods. What were images of gods in the ancient world? Statues or idols were viewed as a special connection to the god they represented. This is true of humans too. Humans are the realization of God’s presence––his temple on earth. God’s rule here on earth is not through elite kings, it is through humans multiplying, gardening, and making neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Video:<br />\nThis episode is designed to accompany our video called, \"Image of God.\" You can view it on our youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbipxLDtY8c&t=2s</p>\n<p>References:<br />\nThe Babylonian Creation Story (Enuma elish) from Grand Valley State University<br />\nhttp://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/Enuma_Elish.html</p>\n<p>The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis by Lynn White, Jr.<br />\nhttps://www.uvm.edu/~gflomenh/ENV-NGO-PA395/articles/Lynn-White.pdf</p>\n<p>Scripture References:<br />\nGenesis 1-2</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music<br />\nBlue Skies by Unwritten Stories<br />\nFlooded Meadows by Unwritten Stories</p>\n",
