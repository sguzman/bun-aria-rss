  "description": "With a short holiday week, we’re changing up the format a bit… so no monologue today. But I have an exciting—and controversial—interview for you tomorrow (hint: It’s one of our most downloaded guests of all time). [0:35] I love this time of year… It means I get to look forward to the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held in Las Vegas in January. Here’s how I’m preparing… [3:05] Following another great quarter from Dick’s Sporting Goods, Daniel and I debate whether now is a good time to buy the stock. [3:55] Best Buy also reported solid earnings… yet it’s trading over 10% lower. I share why, despite strong results, many retailers are in a tough position compared to this time last year. [6:35] Keeping with retail, Daniel explains why he’s more bullish than ever on Amazon, Target, and Walmart… and why last week’s selloff in the latter two names isn’t anything to worry about. [12:20] Markets are near all-time highs and many growth companies are sporting huge valuations (electric truck maker Rivian comes to mind)... But when it comes to growth stocks, you can’t just focus on valuation—I learned this lesson myself with Netflix and Tesla. [20:40] Big news came out of the oil sector this week: The U.S. announced it would be releasing 50 million barrels of oil from its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to help fight higher prices. Prepare for a rant: The Biden Administration is making a huge mistake in terms of national security… and it could lead to the destruction of the U.S. economy. [26:35] That said, as we know… there’s a way to profit in any market. And Daniel shares two names set to benefit on the news. [34:50] And finally, if you haven’t heard yet, Luke Downey’s Big Money Trader has officially launched. Here’s how Luke’s options strategy can help you make the most of the market’s sudden moves.
