Then this is the episode for you. Today, I’m talking about how you can navigate feeling undervalued, unappreciated, and unseen - at work or in your love life. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We frequently take setbacks and assume they mean something about ourselves, but what if a little shift in energy could really change the way that you feel AND how you show up for your work? It’s possible, and I want to help you get there and ensure that you are questioning whether you’re doing things out of obligation or desire.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s what I talk about in this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Is It About Obligation or Desire?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the Right Work Environment</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Acting from a Place of Unworthiness</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The Right Relationship Environment </span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been in the place of feeling unworthy, lacking confidence, and completely numbing myself to the day-to-day of my job just to tolerate it.
