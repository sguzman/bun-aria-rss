  "description": "<p><span>On this week's podcast extra we present episode 1 of a new series from our colleague, Nancy Solomon. <span>She’s our New Jersey specialist at WNYC and she’s got quite the tale to tell. It’s about a murder on a Jersey cul de sac that was never solved. And it involves some of the most powerful people in the state. It’s even got a waterfront land deal. It’s sort of like Chinatown meets American Hustle. It’s a seven episode podcast, and we think you’ll like it. Listen and subscribe here: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"c-link\" data-stringify-link=\"https://link.chtbl.com/M_a20dat?sid=otmwebsite\" delay=\"150\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/M_a20dat?sid=otmwebsite\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">https://link.chtbl.com/M_a20dat?sid=otmwebsite</a></span></span></p>",
