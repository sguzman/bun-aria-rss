All the things that government industries don't do because it is not in their best interest. The people that can't innovate and can't win in a competitive landscape default to having terrible careless services. </p>\n<p>I don't want to be a hardcore capitalist on this issue, though. But I really don't know. If you don't incentivize humans somehow to do the right thing, you can't win. AND...more and more, in a digital world, it's become easier to do that. There is no excuse any more. There are alternatives. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/1083565.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
