  "description": "DJ and Bucky are back with a special episode, which focuses on multi-sport athletes and specifically, the guys look at the crossover between football and basketball. To start, the pair talk to University of Georgia's head basketball coach Tom Crean about what he saw from Dwyane Wade when he coached him at Marquette and also about the similarities between basketball and football players (2:38). Next, the duo speak with Tony Romo's high school basketball coach Steven Berezowitz, as he discusses how talented Romo was as a basketball player (19:28). Then, Colorado's head football coach Mel Tucker tells the guys about the best high school football player he's ever seen (33:09). After, DJ and Bucky interview LeBron James' high school football coach Jim Meyer from St. Vincent-St. Mary high school about James' NFL comparison and if James could have played in the NFL (35:11). Later, the guys look back at a conversation they had with Baylor's head football coach Matt Rhule about why he likes multi-sport athletes (47:06). To wrap up, DJ and Bucky each give names of some of the best multi-sport athletes they've ever seen (50:45).<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
