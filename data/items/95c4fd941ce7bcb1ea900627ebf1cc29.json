  "description": "<p>Why do empty places sometimes lend themselves to reflection or contemplation? In this poem, a poet — describing herself as a nonbeliever — goes into a chapel to sit. In the corner there are some girls talking, there are stained glass windows, and the poet is at once at home in herself and far from the woman she loves. The high emptiness of the church seems to give a resting place for the emptiness she’s feeling. While there’s no resolution, the larger empty space offers a holding place for the poet.</p><p>Donika Kelly is the author of <i>The Renunciations</i> and <i>Bestiary</i>, the winner of the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, a Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Poetry, and the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. A Cave Canem graduate fellow and member of the collective Poets at the End of the World, Donika has also received a Lannan Residency Fellowship, and a summer workshop fellowship from the Fine Arts Work Center. Her poems have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i> online, <i>The Paris Review</i>, and <i>Foglifter</i>. She currently lives in Iowa City and is an Assistant Professor at the University of Iowa, where she teaches creative writing.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/donika-kelly-in-the-chapel-of-st-marys/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
