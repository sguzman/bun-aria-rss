He picked up the sport, later than most kids, with a natural talent that made him not have to plan his attacks like most players. He was also a HUGE jerk. Refusing autographs for kids, abusing the media, other players, line judges, legal judges, people in bars, his wife, and even his coaches. He seemed to relish being hated, but this had consequences on his life, his career, and even his underwear!
