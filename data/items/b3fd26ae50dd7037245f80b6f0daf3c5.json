  "description": "<p>Many people are aware of the Salem Witch Trials in America. And while these trials and these alledged witches get most of the attention, these were not the only people accused of witchcraft. It is generally understood that these people were not really practicing witchcraft, but that does not mean that there were not really witches in America. Witchcraft has long been practiced in America and Wicca is an accepted religious practice in our modern era. On this episode, we are going to explore other witch hunts and discuss some possible real witches, including the Bell Witch of Tennessee and Pat Fitzhugh joins us to discuss that entity. Join us as we explore witches in America. The Moment in Oddity features a suggestion from listener Zoe Zimmerman about a crewless blimp falling from the sky and This Day in History features Japanese Kamikazes being used for first time. Our topic was suggested by listener Molly Farquhar and we had research help from Kristen Calderon.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-158-witches-in-america.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-158-witches-in-america.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Most Notorious Podcast featuring Diane: <a href= \"https://audioboom.com/posts/5189546-top-10-most-notorious-historical-ghosts-w-diane-student-a-true-crime-history-podcast\"> https://audioboom.com/posts/5189546-top-10-most-notorious-historical-ghosts-w-diane-student-a-true-crime-history-podcast</a></p> <p> </p>",
