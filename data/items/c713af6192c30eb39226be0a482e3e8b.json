  "description": "After a crime occurs, or when someone dies, the police aren’t responsible for cleaning up. That’s not their job. The coroner takes the body, the police conduct their investigation, and then everyone leaves. But the blood, and the rubber gloves, and the uneaten food in the refrigerator are all left behind. Sandra Pankhurst didn’t like imagining that. So she decided to clean it up. She became a crime scene cleaner.\nTo learn more about Sandra’s story, you can read The Trauma Cleaner, by Sarah Krasnostein.\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
