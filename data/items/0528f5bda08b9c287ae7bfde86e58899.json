  "description": "<p>Mike and I sat down to record the podcast for next Monday but couldn’t escape the news today. What’s not lost on us, first of all, is that we are two white, middle aged men adding our voices to the conversation. So we attempt to do so humbly. This is very raw and in the moment. As we all try to navigate the spiritual, social and moral implications of today’s decision, we invite everyone to take a moment with us to listen and make room for lament and grief. How do we strive and really seek to love our neighbors in all areas of our lives? What does it really mean to emulate a God who serves and invests in the long term aspects of human daily life?</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
