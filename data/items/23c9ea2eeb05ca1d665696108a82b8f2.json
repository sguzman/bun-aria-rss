Then, Felicia was seen arguing with someone in the parking lot of a local hair salon. The people at the salon knew Felicia and were concerned enough to call 911. When the police got there, Felicia was gone, and she was never seen or heard from again. Hours later, a passerby found Felicia's car burning on a rural road in Talladega County, Alabama. Felicia's family felt like they knew who was responsible for her disappearance.
