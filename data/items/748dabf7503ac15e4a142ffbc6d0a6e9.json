  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is back in Boston. After debriefing the trip to Barstool HQ in New York City, the boys decide they don't need to go back anytime soon. Ronan Farrow's new book publicizes never-before reported rape allegations against Matt Lauer -- and Lauer's response is stunning. Bill Simmons talks about the NBA, Hong Kong, Chinese censorship, Steve Kerr, and Gregg Popovich. Spoiler alert: Simmons is afraid to talk about China's mass violations of human rights. Minihane questions Blind Mike's loyalty over a comedy show. Dave Cullinane shows up at the end. Plus: Bad radio.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
