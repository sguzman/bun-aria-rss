  "description": "<p>Andrés Cerpa recollects how his father’s early dementia was an increasing influence on his early years. As he grew, his father diminished. The burden of this was heavy on him — he stayed awake listening for information, and fell asleep at school. Older now, he looks at his younger self with tenderness and sadness. This poem gives attention to the experience of the growing presence of absence, and the ways that affects memory, family, and perspective.</p><p>Andrés Cerpa is the author of <i>Bicycle in a Ransacked City: An Elegy</i>, and <i>The Vault</i> from Alice James Books. A recipient of fellowships from McDowell and Canto Mundo, his work has appeared in Ploughshares, Poem-a-Day, The Kenyon Review, The Rumpus, <i>Puerto Rico en mi Corazón</i>, <i>The Breakbeat Poets Vol 4: LatiNext</i>,  The Nation, and elsewhere. He holds degrees from the University of Delaware and Rutgers University Newark.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/andres-cerpa-seasonal-without-spring-autumn/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
