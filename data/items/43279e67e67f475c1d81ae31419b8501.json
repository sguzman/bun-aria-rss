  "description": "Back on episode 128, we had Jacob Call on to talk about OZ Tyler. Back then, it was all about TerrePURE and making overnight bourbon. Jacob joins the show again to talk about overcoming the perception that OZ Tyler left behind since it's now been rebranded back to the original name of the site, Green River Distilling. Jacob and the team at Green River have been doing traditional barrel aging since the very beginning and we feel they are producing some of the best bourbon at a young age, to the point where we are seeing contract brands such as Bradshaw Bourbon emerge. \nShow Partners:\n\nCatoctin Creek has been honoring that tradition of small craft rye whisky since 2009.
