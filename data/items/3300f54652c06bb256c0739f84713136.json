  "description": "It is possible that you did not know that you need a comprehensive labor market analysis of the New York City Parks Department, but John Krinsky and Maud Simonet, in their new book, Who Cleans the Park? Public Works and Urban Governance in New York City (University of Chicago Press, 2017), show that you do. Join us as we talk with Krinsky about what this wildly segmented labor force tells us about work, workers, and workplaces today (not to mention race, sexual harassment, and real estate). The answer to “Who Cleans the Park?” is, in fact, much more complicated — and much more important — than you might think.\n\n\n\nStephen Pimpare is Senior Lecturer in the Politics and Society Program and Faculty Fellow at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire. He is the author of The New Victorians (New Press, 2004), A People’s History of Poverty in America (New Press, 2008), winner of the Michael Harrington Award, and Ghettos, Tramps and Welfare Queens: Down and Out on the Silver Screen (Oxford University Press, 2017).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
