  "description": "What is sourced whiskey? It can mean a lot of different things and many of us bourbon geeks feel some do it better than others. There is contract distillation and there is outright buying barrels, but it’s what you are doing with the bourbon that makes the story. We evaluate some of the most iconic brands that built their legacy off of sourcing and then look at today’s market to see who is doing something special versus simply slapping a label on a bottle.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about barrel finishes.\n\nHow do you know when something is sourced?\n\nHow do you source whiskey?\n\nWhat brands are sourced?\n\nWhat about pricing sourced whiskey?\n\nWhat kind of influence has sourced whiskey had on the industry?\n\nWhat is more respectable, starting a brand sourced and then transitioning to your own distillate or starting with your own distillate?\n\nWhat about contract distilling?\n\nWhat are the primary places to source from?\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
