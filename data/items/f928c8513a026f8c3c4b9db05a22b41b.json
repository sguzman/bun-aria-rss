  "description": "<p>A lot of good questions and good answers are had between Nikki and her guests Chris Convy and Anya Marina. Communication between men, how Hillary Duff was an ally to the gay community and staying away from toxic positivity are on top of mind. Anya brings her dad's energy to a discussion about being better around people you care about and how to handle Nikki's rollercoaster of emotions. They play Never Have I Ever... a game that one of them has already played once today. </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Watch this episode on our Youtube Channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv56vKUY_59gXVFe0bRL8og\">The Nikki Glaser Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow the pod on Instagram for bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaserpod/\">@NikkiGlaserPod</a></p>\n<p>Leave us your voicemail: <a href=\"https://www.speakpipe.com/thenikkiglaserpodcast\">Click Here To Record</a></p>\n<p>Get Pod Merch: <a href=\"https://podshop.nikkiglaser.com/\">Podshop.NikkiGlaser.com</a></p>\n<p>Nikki's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/tour\">www.nikkiglaser.com/tour</a></p>\n<p>Andrew's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.andrewcollincomedy.com/\">www.andrewcollincomedy.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More Nikki: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaser/\">IG</a></p>\n<p>More Andrew:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewtcollin/\"> IG </a></p>\n<p>More producer Noa: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noainjection\">IG</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
