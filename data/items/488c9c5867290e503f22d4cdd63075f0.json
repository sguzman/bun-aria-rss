  "title": "#496: What Plato's Republic Has to Say About Being a Man",
  "description": "<p>Plato’s <em>Republic</em> is a seminal treatise in Western political philosophy and thought. It hits on ideas that we’re still grappling with in our own time, including the nature of justice and what the ideal political system looks like. But my guest today argues that <em>The Republic</em> also has a lot to say about manliness, character development, and education in our current climate of safe spaces and trigger warnings. </p><p>His name is Jacob Howland. He’s a professor of philosophy at the University of Tulsa and the author of the recent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1589881346/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1589881346&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Glaucon’s Fate: History, Myth, and Character in Plato’s Republic</em></a>. We begin our conversation with an outline of Plato’s <em>Republic</em> and how it combines literature and philosophy. Jacob then makes the case that in<em> The Republic</em>, Socrates was attempting to save the soul of Plato’s politically ambitious brother, Glaucon, and why he thinks Socrates failed. Along the way we discuss what Socrates’ attempt to save Glaucon can teach us about <em>andreia</em> or manliness and what it means to seek the Good in life. We end our conversation discussing the way <em>The Republic</em> teaches us of the need to possess not only physical courage, but the courage to think for oneself and stand up for one's beliefs -- a courage that is tested in a time like our own, where it can feel difficult to ask hard questions and wrestle with thorny issues. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/republic\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/republic</a>.</p>\n",
