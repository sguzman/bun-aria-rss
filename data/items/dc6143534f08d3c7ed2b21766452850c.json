  "description": "<p>We demonstrate the adaption of three established methods to the field of\nsurrogate machine learning model development. These methods are data\naugmentation, custom loss functions and transfer learning. Each of these\nmethods have seen widespread use in the field of machine learning, however,\nhere we apply them specifically to surrogate machine learning model\ndevelopment. The machine learning model that forms the basis behind this work\nwas intended to surrogate a traditional engineering model used in the UK\nnuclear industry. Previous performance of this model has been hampered by poor\nperformance due to limited training data. Here, we demonstrate that through a\ncombination of additional techniques, model performance can be significantly\nimproved. We show that each of the aforementioned techniques have utility in\ntheir own right and in combination with one another. However, we see them best\napplied as part of a transfer learning operation. Five pre-trained surrogate\nmodels produced prior to this research were further trained with an augmented\ndataset and with our custom loss function. Through the combination of all three\ntechniques, we see an improvement of at least $38\\%$ in performance across the\nfive models.\n</p>",
