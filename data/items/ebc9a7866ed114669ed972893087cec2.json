  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing the emotional gravity of not having meaning and focus and things to do and accomplish. Adam also recounts the strong push about two decades back to bring music back to schools and points out that even then he was pushing to bring back shop classes. They also review recent remarks made by Vice President Kamala Harris as they carefully examine the language she uses during the remarks. Adam also questions the timing of those remarks as he points out that given the current geopolitical landscape we might be wise to take more of a wartime posture. As the show wraps up they explore some language from the CDC website as well as an NPR article from a few months ago.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nSubscribe to The Jordan Harbinger Show\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
