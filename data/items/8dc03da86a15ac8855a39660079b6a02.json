  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Whole Foods has been breached—if you've been to the taproom, look to your credit cards. An illusion gap could help bypass Windows Defender, says Cyber Ark. Microsoft says don't sweat the small stuff. A Mac firmware issue may be giving users a false sense of security. Equifax is offering a lifetime of free credit freezing, but observers are dubious. A study suggests there are still a lot of improperly secured clouds out there. ISIS and the Taliban resume their inspiration operations online. David DuFour from Webroot on the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Guest is R.P. Eddy, coauthor with Richard Clarke of the book Warnings: Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes. And alleged NSA leaker Reality Winner remains in custody, at least for now. \n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors.\n Recorded Future's user conference RFUN 2017 comes to Washington, D.C. , October 4th and 5th, 2017, bringing together the people who put the act in actionable intelligence.\n If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper\n If you want to execute at machine speed, doesn’t make sense to see what the algorithms a good machine runs on can do for you?
