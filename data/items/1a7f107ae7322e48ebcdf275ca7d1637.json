  "description": "There are new investments made into multi-million dollar distilleries every week it seems. There are more brands and product extensions popping up everyday. Yet, there's a shortage of barrels that are putting a strain on existing production. But when all this evens out and everything gets produced as planned, are we going to see an overproduction and what could be the result? Russell's Reserve is coming out with their new limited edition Single Rickhouse line extension. Sure, it features barrels that are selected from the former Camp Nelson C, but does it warrant a price tag of $250? Lastly, we look at the announcement of Angel's Envy hiring Owen Martin to be their next Master Distiller. Angel's Envy hasn't had a Master Distiller since the passing of Lincoln Henderson in 2013 who co-founded the brand.
