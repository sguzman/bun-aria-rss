  "description": "Ever looked at your post-orgasm face in the reflection of the screen after you just came from yet ANOTHER shitty porn video? It’s okay, we’ve all been there. \nWELCOME BACK SLOOTY PEBBLES! Another week of debauchery and motherly advice from our Queen Sloot am I right? This week Sofia takes us on a rollercoaster of topics that will REALLY have you reconsidering some things. Before we get into that, it’s worth noting that there MAY be Sloot Media baby sitting applications going out soon…just tune in and you’ll understand. BTW, no prior experience necessary! Sofia then indulges in the hot topic of PORN…not in the way you think though. She recently received a VERY interesting perspective that seems to be plaguing more men than not. Finally, with a very important word from Ms. Greedy herself, we get some MUCH needed inspo to get off our asses and be the bo$$ a$$ $loots that we were born to be. The life you want to live is RIGHT in front of you girlfriend, go grab it. \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nEpisode promo codes:\nZola: http://www.zola.com/SOFIA promo code: SAVE50 \nBright Cellars: http://www.brightcellars.com/SOFIA50 for 50% off your first SIX (6) bottle box of wine!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
