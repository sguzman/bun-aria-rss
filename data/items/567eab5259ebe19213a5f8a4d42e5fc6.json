  "description": "<p>Parts of the Old Testament depict God commanding the Israelites to massacre entire populations—every man, woman, child, and animal. How should Christians make sense of these passages? They seem to present God as angry, vindictive, and genocidal, contradicting the New Testament presentation of God as loving and merciful. That’s what Bishop Barron and Brandon Vogt discuss in today’s episode.</p> <p>A listener asks, what are your thoughts on Carl Jung? What do you agree with and disagree with?</p> <h2><strong>LINKS</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://wordonfire.org/vatican2\"><em>Word on Fire Vatican II Collection</em></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordonfire.org/rosary\">The Rosary with Bishop Robert Barron</a></li> </ul> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
