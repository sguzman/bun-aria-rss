  "description": "Missy thinks her boyfriend is great but something weird happened recently that has her questioning things.  Her dog got sick and the doctor found hair ties in his stomach but she's had short hair for years and doesn't use hair ties so she has no idea where the dog would have gotten them from.  Is it just a weird coincidence or did her boyfriend bring the dog around another girl?",
