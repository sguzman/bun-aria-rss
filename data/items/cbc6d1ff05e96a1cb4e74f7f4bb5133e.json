  "description": "<p>Reliable measurement of dependence between variables is essential in many\napplications of statistics and machine learning. Current approaches for\ndependence estimation, especially density-based approaches, lack in precision,\nrobustness and/or interpretability (in terms of the type of dependence being\nestimated). We propose a two-step approach for dependence quantification\nbetween random variables: 1) We first decompose the probability density\nfunctions (PDF) of the variables involved in terms of multiple local moments of\nuncertainty that systematically and precisely identify the different regions of\nthe PDF (with special emphasis on the tail-regions). 2) We then compute an\noptimal transport map to measure the geometric similarity between the\ncorresponding sets of decomposed local uncertainty moments of the variables.\nDependence is then determined by the degree of one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the respective uncertainty moments of the variables in the optimal\ntransport map. We utilize a recently introduced Gaussian reproducing kernel\nHilbert space (RKHS) based framework for multi-moment uncertainty decomposition\nof the variables. Being based on the Gaussian RKHS, our approach is robust\ntowards outliers and monotone transformations of data, while the multiple\nmoments of uncertainty provide high resolution and interpretability of the type\nof dependence being quantified. We support these claims through some\npreliminary results using simulated data.\n</p>",
