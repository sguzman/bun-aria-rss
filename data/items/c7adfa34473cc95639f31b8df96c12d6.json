  "description": "<p>Why is it so hard to say sentences like: <em>she sells sea shells at the sea shore</em>? This episode cracks the code of tongue twisters. Check out the role mouth shapes and vocal folds play in tongue twisters. Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel will share her research into tongue twisters and how she came up with some of the hardest sentences for people to say. We also have a report on “the late eight,” a group of sounds that can be tough to say — and quite confounding when combined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, be sure to check out our listener-submitted tongue twisters — some you may have heard before, others are brand new to the world! Stick around for a stumper of a Mystery Sound too!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Insect Lore (<a href=\"https://insectlore.com\" class=\"default\">insectlore.com)</a></p>\n<p>Shopify (<a href=\"https://shopify.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">shopify.com/brainson</a> for a free 14 day trial)</p>\n<p>Galileo Camps (<a href=\"https://galileo-camps.com\" class=\"default\">galileo-camps.com</a> promo code: FUNSUMMER2022 for $100 off camp)</p>\n<p>Pinna (<a href=\"https://pinna.fm/brainson\" class=\"default\">pinna.fm/brainson</a> promo code: BRAINSON for 50% off your first full-access payment)</p>\n",
