  "description": "<p>This week, we head to the playground to check out a guy that you just want to root for, until he messes up. Again, and again. He was a street ball legend that transitioned his on court game to the pros, but never transitioned his off court game. From some stupid mistakes, and questionable arrests, to some real violence, and scary actions. His fighting spirit served him much better, while playing, than at a strip club at two o'clock in the morning. It's a mess!! It's Rafer \"Skip To My Lou\" Alston!!<br>Shoot dice as well as you shoot baskets, beat all the odds, and make sure to always be out in the middle of the night with Rafer \"Skip To My Lou\" Alston!!<br>Check us out, every Tuesday.
