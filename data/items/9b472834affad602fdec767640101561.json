  "description": "<p>Bonnie Willow is a super interesting woman I met in a hostel in the Andes. She is a Reiki Master and Inter-Faith Minister. Bonnie also runs a school, The School of Peace. I don’t even know how to describe it. It's about spirituality. And about energy healing, cleaning your insides. We sat in the setting sun and talked about meditation, consciousness, and a lot of other really heady stuff that I, standup comedian <a class=\"mention-chip ytcp-mention-input\" spellcheck=\"false\" href= \"https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCkqNTF2SegipHCkwkBrq6hw\"> @Ari Shaffir</a>, have tons of trouble wrapping my head around.</p> <p>I know a lot of this is going to sound like hocus pocus to much of my audience. But for those of you who get a spark out of what we were talking about, I encourage you to reach out to Bonnie to ask her whatever you want or just to tell her you enjoyed the conversation.</p> <p>It was a fascinating talk and I’m lucky that my travels put me in contact with such unique people.</p> <p>Learn more about Bonnie Willow here: <a href= \"http://bonniewillow.com/\">http://bonniewillow.com/</a></p> <p>Buy Bonnie's book \"Love, Light & Business: Business Anatomy For Holistic Healers\" here: <a href= \"https://amzn.to/37YqMCJ\">https://amzn.to/37YqMCJ</a></p> <p>Join Ari's Patreon! <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/skeptictank\">https://www.patreon.com/skeptictank</a></p> <p>To stay up to date with Ari, exclusive merch, and more: <a href= \"https://linktr.ee/RIPAriShaffir\">https://linktr.ee/RIPAriShaffir</a></p> <p><strong>The Music:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Govinda Jaya Jaya - Kula Shaker</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KRS One - Ocean Within</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duke Ellington - Lost In Meditation</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter Wagoner - Moments of Meditation</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lost In My Mind - The Head and the Heart</span></p> <p><strong>Thanks to our Artists</strong>:</p> <p>Becky Rodriguez - @humanplac3s - Production</p> <p>Patrick Holbert - @theholbertreport - Editing</p> <p>Marisa Pellegrino - @marisa_pellegrino - Editing</p> <p>#arishaffir #skeptictankpodcast #comedy #bonniewillow #schoolofpeace #energyhealer #reiki #christaspiritualhealing </p>",
