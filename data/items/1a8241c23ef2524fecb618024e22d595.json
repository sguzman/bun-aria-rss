  "description": "Death happens in your family and when you try to call off your boss tells you that you still must come to work – what do you do?\nOne of our listeners is a 21-year-old college student who recently quit her job at Starbucks after being told she couldn’t call out of work without penalty, even though she just lost her best friend.\nHer family adopted Gandy when he was just a small puppy. The family finds out that Gandy had cancer, but because of Gandy’s age, there was nothing that could be done to help him.\nWhen Gandy dies, the Bert Show listener sends a text to her boss letting him know that she is scheduled to work on the day they will be putting Gandy down, and as a result, she will be looking for someone to cover her shift and won’t be coming to work that day.\nHer manager texts her back asking for her to put her dog down on a night she is not scheduled to work the next day. Her boss also tells her that if she calls out it won’t be approved because it is so short notice.\nShortly after that, she sends a text back including her two weeks notice that she will no longer be working for Starbucks.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
