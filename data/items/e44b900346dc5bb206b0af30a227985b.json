  "description": "<p>Mr. Eric teams up with Rhea Pechter of <a href=\"http://www.littlestoriestinypeople.com/\"><u>Little Stories for Tiny People</u></a> this week. Fair Elise and Pixacato are fed up with work and school, respectively. Good thing it’s Freaky Friday! Can Fair Elise survive a day in ballet school? Can Pixacato solve the mystery of the missing robot brains? Did Alabaster Zero also get Freaky Friday’d, or does the grizzled cop just really love ballet?</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons include:</strong> both work and school take a special kind of endurance, we should respect each other’s efforts; parents will always look out for you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look out for them, too!</p>\n<p><em>This episode originally aired May 5th, 2018.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/whatifworld\"><strong>Join our Patreon</strong></a> for Ad-Free stories, a Shout-Out on the show, bonus audio, a better chance of having your question answered, and more! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/whatifworld\"><u><strong>patreon.com/whatifworld</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/whatifworld\"><u>Subscribe</u></a> to What If World wherever you listen: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/whatifworld\"><u>link.chtbl.com/whatifworld</u></a>.
