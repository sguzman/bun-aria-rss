  "title": "Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell",
  "description": "This book is an academic reflection on what it takes to be successful. The author looks at the comparisons between race, income and education to determine what makes a person more likely to succeed. What emerges is interesting. For instance, in the book Gladwell analyses the impact that timing and luck have on the success of not only an individual but a generation as a whole. A decade between two people can mean that one more intelligent person can be less successful than a less intelligent person born in another decade due to the opportunities available. I enjoyed reading this book as it incorporates elements of psychology, sociology and anthropology to assess a commonly debated topic. What emerges is that there is not one thing that separates a successful person from another less successful person, there is a mix of different factors that are mostly external to the individual.\n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
