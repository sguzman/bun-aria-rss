  "description": "<p>Just 40 miles/65 km north of Cape Town lies a large area that makes the most exciting, sought after wines in South Africa. Swartland (Dutch for 'black land') is full of young, passionate winemakers making wines that respect the hot, dry land from which they derive and are able to create wines of such depth, flavor, and nuance that it’s hard to believe so few know about them. In this show, we tell you about the Syrah, Rhône and Mediterranean varietals, the Chenin Blanc and other stunning white blends coming from this area and why you need to seek it out ASAP!</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Overview of the region…</strong></p> <ul> <li>Swartland was oncea rural backwater, better known for wheat fields than vineyards<strong><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/swartland_map.jpg\" width=\"204\" height=\"175\" /></strong></li> <li>Vineyards traditionally grew where wheat couldn’t -- on the northern side of Paardeberge Mountains in the south, the plains of Piketberg in the north, and the smaller Ward of Riebeekberg and Kasteelberg Mountains in the east</li> <li>Lots of old vines on slopes where nothing else grows, hand harvested</li> <li>The climate ishot and dry with very low summer rainfall but with consistent afternoon and evening breezes off the Atlantic Ocean.
