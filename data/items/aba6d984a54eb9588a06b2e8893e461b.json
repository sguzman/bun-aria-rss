  "description": "<p>J.P. Dinnell is a Navy SEAL, business consultant, and Jocko Willink's partner at Echelon Front. In one of the best podcasts we've ever done, he and I talk about his SEAL training, his experience fighting in the battle of Ramadi, and lessons he's learned in war that very much apply to achieving success in business and real life. This is a special podcast. If you don't come away amazed by the insight and motivated by the stories, there's something wrong with you.</p>",
