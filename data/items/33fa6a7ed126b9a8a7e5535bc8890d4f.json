  "description": "Minnie Driver's experience with fame has been what she calls \"surreal.\" She's faced the paradox of fame: she wants to be seen, but not that much. In her new memoir <em>Managing Expectations</em>, the British-American actress opens up about the complicated relationships in her life, her childhood, her unexpected path to acting, and her experience as a single mother. In an interview with All Things Considered, Driver told Ailsa Chang that writing this book was an interesting inner-exploration and that it helped her understand many aspects of her own life – and her mother's.
