  "description": "<p>We feel honored to have nostalgia expert, SNL cast member, and our good friend Kyle Mooney on the pod this week! Of course, we discuss eighties cartoons and how Kyle embodies that aesthetic so flawlessly on his hilarious new Netflix show, Saturday Morning All-Star Hits! We also get deep into the short-lived primetime series Saved By The Bell: The College Years. Was it weird that the Bayside Crew had an ex-football player as their dorm's RA? Absolutely. Along the way we also discuss Kyle's childhood toy collection, the TV phenomenon known as Rescue 9-1-1 and we wonder why picture-in-picture technology seems to have disappeared. Finally, Jonah brings back our popular CEO Takedown segment unknowingly burning the same CEO two weeks in a row as we debate if General Mills legacy will ultimately be Nerf balls, sugar-coated cereals or simply... flour.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
