Today on the show Chris and I discuss tactics gleaned from both his experience as a Jesuit seminarian and as a business leader that can help you live each day with more meaning. Chris explains how to keep your most important values at the forefront of your mind, how to approach each day with bravery and heart, and how looking for little ways to do good deeds, express gratitude, and lead others in a positive way will all add up to a life that matters. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/maketodaymatter\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/maketodaymatter</a>.</p>\n",
