  "description": "<p>All the so-called \"experts\" tell us to ignore our weaknesses and focus on our strengths. There's truth in that, but not across the board. The reality is, we need to determine whether our weaknesses are just inconvenient annoyances, or whether they are something that will destroy our business or life, if we don't do something about it. There's a process to dealing with our weaknesses, and there's a way that a good leader helps others deal with theirs. That's what this episode is about.</p>",
