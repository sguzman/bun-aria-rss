  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, this program offers a big thank you to all veterans of the US Armed Services. Then, the New York Times says that they've contacted election officials nationwide and find no election fraud. Yet these same election officials are defendants in multiple legal matters right now. The fraud is in the fundamental transformation of election laws. The fraud is in the courts that make decisions they don't have the power to make. President Trump's challenge is a process that is both Constitutional and statutory, unlike the litigation that eliminated the liberty and franchise of citizens wishing to vote lawfully. Ballots and machines have to be inspected. Yet, the left within the media continues misleading the public into thinking that Joe Biden is the President-Elect despite the pending disputes, recounts, and litigation. Later, Richard Hopkins, a USPS worker, has come forward as a whistleblower and the Washington Times is trying to discredit him instead of interviewing him and verifying his claim. Hopkins has stated that he's overheard superiors discussing illegalities with respect to ballots. Afterward, Andrew Yang, Thomas Freidman, and the Democrats are urging people to move to Georgia just to vote. Democrat courts are removing the safeguards to protect our votes. The Democrat party never embraced the Declaration of Independence, they never embraced the constitution, and they've never embraced Americanism. Finally, the Democrat Party works in cycles whether it is pro-slavery, for the confederacy or its promotion of the Ku Klux Klan. Somehow, today they claim to be the party of the people but they're against free speech, especially in Big Tech and the other media that they run. They don't care about winning elections fair and square, nor do they care about due process or the Constitution.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
