    "media:description": "Restrictive covenants are sometimes used to specify what a piece of land can be used for, so that the value and enjoyment of adjoining land will be preserved. However in the not-so-distant history, these clauses were used to define what race of people were permitted to purchase - or even visit - a certain piece of land. \n\nIn Canada, these kind of covenants were challenged when a Jewish businessman from London, Ontario, wanted to purchase a property in Beach O' Pines, a private gated community of holiday homes in Ontario. This case eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, and it was a major catalyst towards removing racist covenants and zoning in Canada.\n\nNoble v Alley Wikipedia summary\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_v_Alley\n\nNoble and Wolf vs Alley National Historic Event of Canada, London, Ontario\nhttps://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/wm11X3Q_Noble_and_Wolf_vs_Alley_National_Historic_Event_of_Canada_London_Ontario\n\nBeach O'Pines - Google Maps\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/U1WeAQnZx8yvP4Pz5",
