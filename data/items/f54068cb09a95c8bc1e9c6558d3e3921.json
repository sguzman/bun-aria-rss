  "description": "<p>We had an opportunity to speak with DJ Verrett AKA \"Ghost\". On February 6, 1990 Ghost was arrested on drug charges at the age of 19, and was sentenced to 19 ½ years of imprisonment. After serving 16 years 10 months and 3 days in some of America’s most notorious federal prisons DJ Verrett was released on November 1, 2006. The day he was released DJ Verrett made the decision to change everything about him. He immediately began to give back to the community by volunteering his time with an organization called “GETTING OUT BY GOING IN” (G.O.G.I) and through this program; he began to work with “At-Risk Youth and Adults” to encourage and influence them not to make the same poor life choices he had made.
