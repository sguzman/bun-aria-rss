  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off by sharing his thoughts on Urban Meyer's controversial hire of Chris Doyle as the Jacksonville Jaguars new director of sport performance. Doyle left the Iowa Hawkeyes program last year under a cloud of allegations involving racism and bullying of black college football players. On the surface the hire seems like a bad one, but dig a little deeper and it's clear that Meyer made the hire for one key reason: Relationships matter. If there was ever going to be a guy willing to vouch for the disgraced coach and give him another shot at redemption, it was going to be someone with a lot of sway and who feels like they can vouch for him. Enter, Urban Meyer. In sports, just as in life, it's always about who you know. Later, Jason does a deep dive into LeBron James and his sudden uptick in minutes played that seems to have Los Angeles Lakers so worried. Yes, LeBron is clearly looking to bolster his MVP candidacy after the voters foolishly gave the award to Giannis last season; And yes, a 5th MVP would tie him with Michael Jordan and add to his GOAT resume. But the biggest reason why LeBron is playing so many minutes is because Anthony Davis is hurt and the Lakers can't afford to let games slip away in the crowded Western Conference playoff race. It looks like fans will be in the stands when the NBA Playoffs roll around, and LeBron is doing everything he can to make sure the Lake Show has home court advantage.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
