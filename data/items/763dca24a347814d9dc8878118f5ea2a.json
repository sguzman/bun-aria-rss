  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it’s been just a week since an anti-white racist massacred six people and injured dozens more at a Christmas parade. The media has already forgotten the attack. But we should not. Also, the robbery and looting epidemic continues to grip our cities. There is a mostly unexplored similarity between all of these incidents that we’ll talk about today. And the dreaded Omicron variant has everyone in a panic. Or at least we are told that we should panic over it. Is that reaction warranted? We’ll discuss. Plus, another white woman is caught pretending to be a minority. And a GOP congresswoman makes an edgy joke about Ilhan Omar and then commits her real sin by apologizing. \nSign The Petition To Keep Matt Walsh on Saint Louis University Campus: https://bit.ly/3Dzeu1f\nAndrew Klavan's latest novel When Christmas Comes is now available on Amazon.
