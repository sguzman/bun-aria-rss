  "description": "Steve Guerra is joining forces with History Unplugged. We are pleased to announce that his show History of the Papacy is a part of our new podcast network.<br /><br />Steve has been on History Unplugged many times before. We discussed the myth of Pope Joan, whom legend claims reigned as pope, 855-857 A.D., by disguising herself as a man. The story is widely thought to be fiction, but almost everyone took it as fact in the Middle Ages, up to the point that the Siena Cathedral featured a bust of Joan among other pontiffs.<br /><br />We also did a mini-series called Hollywood Hates History and looked at some of the most historically inaccurate movies ever made. Offenders include \"The Scarlet Letter,\" the 1995 Demi Moore atrocity; \"The Conqueror,\" a Genghis Khan biopic starring John Wayne; and \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" in which Legolas the Elf successfully creates universal religious harmony in the 12th century Middle East.<br />His show History of the Papacy will detail the biographies and interesting facts of the Papacy of Rome. It will start in the beginning, but will not go straight through. There will be many side tracks and detours along the way. <br />To celebrate him joining forces with us, we are doing a giveaway where the first five entrants win a 3-month subscription to the Great Courses. <br />The Great Courses Plus is a streaming service brings the world’s greatest professors to millions who want to go deeper on the subjects that interest them most.
