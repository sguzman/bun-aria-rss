  "description": "<p>This week, Maria speaks with Atoosa Rubenstein.</p><p>Atoosa Rubenstein is the author of Atoosa Unedited, an at-times confronting, at-times healing weekly letter on Substack where she models authenticity, self-love and acceptance for her readers. The former Editor-in-Chief of Seventeen Magazine and Founder/Editor-in-Chief of CosmoGIRL! In 1998, Rubenstein created a prototype for CosmoGIRL! within 48 hours and was offered the job on the spot making her, at 26,&nbsp; the youngest Editor in Chief in the over 100 year history of Hearst Magazines. After a successful run at CosmoGIRL!, Hearst acquired Seventeen and tapped Rubenstein to turn the venerable title around. After just one year at the title, Rubenstein reversed a five year decline in Seventeen's newsstand sales and delivered a total newsstand growth of 23% within two years. She also conceived and was an Executive Producer on MTV's Miss Seventeen a series that debuted in the fall of 2005. The following year, Rubenstein left the industry altogether to undergo a grueling 13-year personal excavation and discovery mission that led to three of her own daughters and now, a twice-a-week love letter Atoosa Unedited, written for her beloved readers, now adults in their own right. Columbia University has honored her as one of the top 250 alumni through the ages. She has also been recognized by the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York as a Woman of Distinction. Rubenstein has been featured in Crain's New York Business’ \"40 Under 40\" and Folio's \"30 Under 30.\" She lives in Manhattan with her three daughters.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Follow Atoosa’s substack at <a href=\"http://atoosa.substack.com\">atoosa.substack.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Attosa on Instagram at <a href=\"http://instagram.com/atoosarubenstein\">http://instagram.com/atoosarubenstein</a> &nbsp;</p><p>Follow Attosa’s TikTok at <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@atoosarubenstein \">http://tiktok.com/@atoosarubenstein&nbsp;</a></p><p>Share your name and email and you will be notified first when details for the Agape Intensive Retreat - April 29- May 1, 2022 - are released! <a href=\"https://agapematch.wufoo.com/forms/z14chqhd03yfh04/\">https://agapematch.wufoo.com/forms/z14chqhd03yfh04/</a></p><p></p><p>Follow Maria on Instagram to find out when the Matchmaker Hotline will be open to talk! <a href=\"http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria\">http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Agape Match on Instagram at <a href=\"http://instagram.com/agapematch\">http://instagram.com/agapematch</a></p><p></p><p>Follow the podcast on Instagram at <a href=\"http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker\">http://instagram.com/askamatchmaker</a></p>",
