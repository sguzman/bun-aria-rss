  "description": "In 1979, a group of labor organizers protested outside a Ku Klux Klan screening of the 1915 white supremacist film, The Birth of a Nation. Nelson Johnson and Signe Waller-Foxworth remember shouting at armed Klansmen and burning a confederate flag, until eventually police forced the KKK inside and the standoff ended without violence. The labor organizers felt they'd won a small victory, and planned a much bigger anti-Klan demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina. They advertised with the slogan: “Death to the Klan\" and set the date for November 3rd, 1979.\nAs protestors assembled, a caravan of nine cars appeared, and a man in a pick-up truck yelled: \"You asked for the Klan! Now you've got 'em!\" Thirty-nine shots were fired in eighty-eight seconds, and five protestors were killed. The city of Greensboro is still grappling with the complicated legacy of that day.\nThe Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s full report is available online.\nToday, Reverend Nelson Johnson is a pastor with Faith Community Church and serves as the Executive Director for the  Beloved Community Center of Greensboro, which advocates for social and economic justice.\nSigne Waller-Foxworth is the author of Love and Revolution: A Political Memoir.\nEric Ginsburg is the associate editor at the Triad City Beat.\nFor this story, we also interviewed Elizabeth Wheaton, author of Codename Greenkill.\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
