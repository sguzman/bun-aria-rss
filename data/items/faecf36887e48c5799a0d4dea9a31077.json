  "description": "<p><b><span>Introducing the Band</span><br /><br />\n</b>Your hosts Scot Bertram (@ScotBertram) and Jeff Blehar (@EsotericCD), with guest Tim Miller, former Jeb! Bush 2016 communications director, co-founder of @AmericaRising, Partner at Definers Public Affairs, cheerful practitioner of the political dark arts. Follow him on Twitter at @Timodc.<b><span>Tim’s Musical Pick: </span></b><strong><u>Arcade Fire</u></strong></p>\n<p>How did he get into them? Tim and Jeff relive their musical young adulthoods. Tim talks about finding Arcade Fire after his Widespread Panic phase, plunging into ’00s indie-rock scene. Jeff recounts his quasi-LCD Soundsystem “Losing My Edge” tale of watching them bomb HARD in Washington, DC as an unknown opening act in the pre-<i>Funeral </i>era.</p>\n<p>KEY TRACKS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKNIMRGUQBA\">Wake Up</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004)</p>\n<p><strong><span><i>Funeral</i><i>:</i> a Debut Album That still Ranks with the Greatest of All Time</span></strong></p>\n<p>The gang discusses why this is a hip indie album that still resonates: songwriting, thematics, instrumentation — a record made by young, inexperienced men and women that somehow sounds like the culmination of a long career, not the beginning of one. The purity of Win Butler & Regine Chassagne’s lyrical conceits, the maturity of the band’s song constructions, arrangements, and production . . . an album that seemingly landed on earth as if from another, better universe.</p>\n<p>KEY TRACKS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcU-zHIDQJ0\">Rebellion (Lies)</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg7XMMAuCJo\">Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGxy5qSZOJM\">Crown Of Love</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBRxAaXCU-E\">Neighborhood #2 (Laika)</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsmEMk2QOnM\">In The Backseat</a>” (<i>Funeral</i>, 2004)</p>\n<p><strong><span><i>Neon Bible</i></span><span><i>:</i> </span><span>the Sophomore Act</span></strong><b><br />\n</b>Jeff, pre-show, was a veritable seven nation army in converting Tim to the underrated greatness and variety of Arcade Fire’s followup to <i>Funeral. </i>Scot singles out “Intervention” as a truly fantastic song, Tim cites to “The Well And The Lighthouse,” Jeff loves it all but particularly insists that the entire planet recognize the low-key tension of “Neon Bible” (the title track) and sweeping grandeur of “No Cars Go.”</p>\n<p>KEY TRACKS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7UtxUlpEP0\">Intervention</a>” (<i>Neon Bible</i>, 2007); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzsx0pc2dSg\">The Well And The Lighthouse</a>” (<i>Neon Bible</i>, 2007); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw58GWqKWNM\">Neon Bible</a>” (<i>Neon Bible</i>, 2007); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvN-9iDIV68\">Black Wave/Bad Vibrations</a>” (<i>Neon Bible, </i>2007); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaIRsqjzsKo\">No Cars Go</a>” (<i>Neon Bible</i>, 2007); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OFEYqmsxDc\">Windowsill</a>” (<i>Neon Bible</i>, 2007)</p>\n<p><strong><span><i>The Suburbs:</i> </span><span>Where Subtext Becomes Explicit Text</span></strong><b><br />\n</b>Scot. Tim and Jeff violently disagree about the merits of Arcade Fire’s “Album Of The Year” Grammy-winning 2010 record. Scot and Tim rank it among their favorites. Jeff thinks a full third of it should have been pruned away and labels at least one song “pure garbage.” All agree, however, that one song in particular pointed the way towards a bright future for the band.</p>\n<p>KEY TRACKS: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHLISaLe44\">The Suburbs</a>” (<i>The Suburbs</i>, 2010); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBxFxEdKEe0\">Ready To Start</a>” (<i>The Suburbs</i>, 2010); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az_2oiccZNo\">Rococo</a>” (<i>The Suburbs,</i> 2010); “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-tUXFIyKAHI?t=4s\">Modern Man</a>” (<i>The Suburbs</i>, 2010); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgfOSV06nZ8\">Half Light II (No Celebration)</a>” (<i>The Suburbs</i>, 2010); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PMI0bm2y6w\">We Used To Wait</a>” (<i>The Suburbs, </i>2010); “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH_7_XRfTMs\">Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)</a>” (<i>The Suburbs</i>, 2010)</p>\n<p><strong><span>Arcade Fire Throws a Curveball: <i>Reflektor</i> and the Move Toward Dance</span></strong><b><br />\n</b>Jeff thinks it’s overstuffed like <i>Suburbs</i>, but agrees with Tim nevertheless that it marked a profoundly exciting move by AF, sidestepping a potential rut by moving into a fearless groove-oriented future. Scot talks about how the title track is a relentless earworm. Tim speculates on the influence of LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy as a producer. Scot and Tim think “Porno” should have been cut from the record but they are oh-so-tragically wrong in Jeff’s opinion. Everyone loves “Afterlife” while Jeff discourses on the esoteric philosophical discourse underpinning the title track and the immensely moving Eurydice/Orpheus suite.
