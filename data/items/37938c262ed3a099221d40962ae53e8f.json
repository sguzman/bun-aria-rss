Why is that okay during a pandemic, but you still can’t visit your grandparents for Christmas? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel a school board that voted to remove Thomas Jefferson’s name from their elementary school. The reasons they give are truly, deeply insane. \nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
