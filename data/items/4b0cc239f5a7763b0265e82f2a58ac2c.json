  "description": "Our audiobook this week is JUSTICE FOR CORA by L.B. Dunbar!\n\nNarrated by Sophie James\n\nCorabelle Conrad has lived a pampered life until the upheaval of divorce and an empty nest makes her reckless one night. After an unfulfilling marriage, she’s out to get what she hasn’t had in years—an orgasm or three. The night held no promises after those twelve hours, but it’s been difficult to let go of the connection she had with a man so unlike her. A man who shows up on her doorstep a year later.\n\nJustice lives by a code of brotherhood. Bikes first. Babes second. When a classy lady enters the Devil’s Den, she’s in the wrong place looking for the right thing and he wants to be the one to give it to her. He can’t explain it. She’s everything opposite him, but after a year separation, he’s wondering if she’ll open the door for him again.\n\nSECOND CHANCE BY L.B.
