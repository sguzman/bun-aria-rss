  "description": "<p>Asking for a raise. Disagreeing with your boss. Telling your neighbor that their dog's barking is bothering you. Talking about money with your spouse. Debating politics with a friend. These are all difficult conversations fraught with anxiety, anger, and awkwardness. Many people just avoid them, but my guest says that with the right framework, you can handle even the most pitfall-laden exchanges. Her name is <a href=\"http://triadlearning.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sheila Heen</a>, she's spent twenty years developing negotiation theory and practice as part of the Harvard Negotiation Project, and she's one of the co-authors of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CR6ALA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004CR6ALA&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most</em>.</a> Sheila starts things off by sharing the most common difficult conversations people encounter professionally and personally and the most common unhelpful ways people deal with them. She then explains how every difficult conversation actually has three hidden conversations going on, how people confuse the impact of what others say and do with their intentions, how you can acknowledge your contribution to a problem without assuming the blame, how to share your emotions without being emotional, and how to generally move a conversation from being about combative confrontation, to being about exploring each other's stories. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/difficultconversations\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/difficultconversations</a>.</p>\n",
