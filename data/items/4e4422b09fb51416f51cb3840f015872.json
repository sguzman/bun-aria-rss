  "description": "<p>Most people believe that success is an event or a destination, or that it simply means being in the right place at the right time. Some people even believe that success is way out of their reach. However, as John Maxwell points out in this episode, success is for anyone who <em>knows</em> their purpose in life, <em>grows</em> to the maximum potential, and <em>sows</em> seeds that benefit others. In this lesson, John will teach you exactly how to do these three things so you can begin or continue your success journey with confidence.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow join to discuss why leaders must be able to answer these questions for themselves and lead others to do the same. When we “know, grow, and sow” we allow ourselves to create powerful, positive change in our organizations and in our world.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “Success is for Everyone Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
