  "description": "<p>It’s a packed house for another star-studded episode of <em>Radio Cherry Bombe</em>. Host Julia Turshen is chatting with three incredibly talented chefs – Katy Sparks, Executive Chef at Tavern on the Green as well as Elise Kornack and Anna Hieronimus of Take Root. First – we hear from Katy, who’s background includes cooking at NYC institutions like The Quilted Giraffe and Mesa Grill. Find out what it’s like cooking at a restaurant that seats 700(!!) and comes with a storied reputation that rivals any other dining establishment in the country. Later – Julia chats with the team at Take Root, a celebrated Brooklyn restaurant featuring a tasting menu in a very unique setting. They discuss operating a business as a couple and the debate surrounding tasting menus in modern dining.
