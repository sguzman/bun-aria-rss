  "description": "<p>Today is a good day but it is CRAZY to say the least.  Disney Dreamer's Academy took place over the weekend and Uncle Steve almost cussed in front of the kids.  Church Complaints had some people on edge because a member of the congregation just got out of jail.  Sand and Soul is rapidly approaching and it will sell out.  It will be extra special because Mrs. H and Miss Carla will be celebrating their birthdays as well.  The Powerball is up to $750 million and the payout will be $465 million and Steve asks everyone what they would do it they won.  Aretha Franklin would have been 77 years old today and Steve shares memories and facts of his dear friend, The Queen of Soul.  The Mueller Report shows no collusion, however, may not spell exoneration.  A Dallas man was caught on camera beating a woman down and the video has gone viral.  Cam Newton will become vegan and give up sex as he is transitioning.  Closing Remarks today has a special message for males and more.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
