  "description": "<p>Scientists collaborate through intricate networks, which impact the quality\nand scope of their research. At the same time, funding and institutional\narrangements, as well as scientific and political cultures, affect the\nstructure of collaboration networks. Since such arrangements and cultures\ndiffer across regions in the world in systematic ways, we surmise that\ncollaboration networks and impact should also differ systematically across\nregions. To test this, we compare the structure of collaboration networks among\nprominent researchers in North America and Europe. We find that prominent\nresearchers in Europe establish denser collaboration networks, whereas those in\nNorth-America establish more decentralized networks. We also find that the\nimpact of the publications of prominent researchers in North America is\nsignificantly higher than for those in Europe, both when they collaborate with\nother prominent researchers and when they do not. Although Europeans\ncollaborate with other prominent researchers more often, which increases their\nimpact, we also find that repeated collaboration among prominent researchers\ndecreases the synergistic effect of collaborating.\n</p>",
