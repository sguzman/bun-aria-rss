  "title": "What is immigration for?",
  "description": "In his first speech to the British parliament as Prime Minister, Boris Johnson promised a “radical” overhaul of the British immigration system modelled on  an Australian-style points-based system where applicants are judged on the contribution they could make to the economy. Concerns about immigration are said to be one of the main driving factors behind Brexit - with many voters unhappy with the rapid pace of change in their communities. So, what will be the shape of a future British immigration system? Is a points based system the best way to decide who comes to a country - and should the economy take priority over historic links and family ties? Why is the Australian model so often cited? And what does locking out low skilled immigrants do for a society’s ability to function? Join Chris Morris and guests as they tackle these questions.",
