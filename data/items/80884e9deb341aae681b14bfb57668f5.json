  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, upon this program's review of federal laws on the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was determined that the Chairman has no command function over the United States military. None. Although, the Chairman can oversee a combat command function if asked to do so on behalf of the Secretary of Defense. General Mark Milley seized power in contravention of the federal statute. There’s leaking to news outlets to spin the Milley story and minimize its negative fallout. Later, Attorney Michael Sussman from Perkins Coie, the firm that represented Hillary Clinton, has been indicted in John Durham's investigation. He's being charged with making false statements to the FBI when he lied about representing Hillary Clinton in 2016 while lying about Donald Trump. This is the same law firm that laundered the money for the phony dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democrat National Committee. Clinton's lawyer, Marc Elias, has raised $715 million through a web of dark money front groups that are prepared to sue their way around existing laws - this must be stopped. Meanwhile, Julie Kelly, Sr. Contributor at American Greatness, joins the show to take on Phillip Bump from the Washington Post who is now attacking this program for the January 6th riot at the US Capitol. Kelly added that two federal judges have raised questions as to the constitutionality of some of these felonies that are being levied against some protesters that didn't even enter the Capitol Building. Afterward, President Biden wants to destroy jobs, the currency, and the American way of life by using Marxism. No company in America has more money and employees than the US federal government and they have the power to make laws. And the Democrat Party wants to be the permanent singular party that dominates all control of the state and its bureaucracy. Finally, Larry Kudlow, former Director of the National Economic Council during the Trump Administration, calls in to discuss how Biden's use of class warfare and welfare programs will further rig the playing field instead of leveling it for all Americans. The Trump Tax cuts did that and the Biden Tax increases will kill those gains.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
