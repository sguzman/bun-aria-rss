  "description": "Each of us are walking a unique path towards our individual goals and dreams. It may not seem clear now, but ultimately with enough drive, confidence, and intention, you will reach the finish line. Still, there will be many dark valleys and periods of adversity along the way. Who should you be leaning on to find strength and support during these times, how do you push through them, and where do you find the confidence to keep going as they repeatedly happen? Former Fifth Harmony member and now solo-artist and author, Ally Brooke, joins Tom Bilyeu on this episode of Impact Theory to discuss such matters and more as they explore Ally’s journey into the music industry, how she pushed through times of adversity, and why you should hold onto a mustard seed of faith and never give up. They discuss Ally’s early roots, the drive she had when breaking into the industry, how she held onto her self-identity through it all, the importance of owning your own confidence, being intentional, and why giving up is never an option.   Purchase Ally’s book, “Finding Your Harmony”:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Your-Harmony-Achieve-Imagine/dp/006289577X\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Your-Harmony-Achieve-Imagine/dp/006289577X</a> This episode is brought to you by: Check out Mind Pump: Raw Fitness Truth on your favorite Podcast listening platform below:  iTunes: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2GIxaDT\" rel=\"noopener\">https://apple.co/2GIxaDT</a> Spotify: <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/3dmOdag\" rel=\"noopener\">https://spoti.fi/3dmOdag</a> YouTube: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3iTpFXx\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3iTpFXx</a>  Blinkist: Go to <a href=\"https://blinkist.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blinkist.com</a>/impact Try it FREE for 7 days and save 25% off your new subscription.
