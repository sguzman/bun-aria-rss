  "description": "<p>This week, NASA postponed a highly anticipated rocket launch after discovering an issue with one of the engines. It delayed a key stage of the space agency&#8217;s Artemis missions, which aim to eventually establish a long-term human presence on the moon&#8217;s surface and begin building a lunar economy. Part of that is extracting precious metals and minerals to bring back to Earth. NASA hopes to get the Artemis 1 rocket off the ground in the coming days, and speed is of the essence. The U.S. and China are in a new space race to get humans to the moon. &#8220;Marketplace&#8217;s&#8221; Kimberly Adams speaks with Peter Garretson, a senior fellow in defense studies at the American Foreign Policy Council.</p>\n",
