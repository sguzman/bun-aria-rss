  "description": "About a year ago, I participated in the Yandex search personalisation Kaggle competition. I started off as a solo competitor, and then added a few Kaggle newbies to the team as part of a program I was running for the Sydney Data Science Meetup. My team hasn&rsquo;t done too badly, finishing 9th out of 194 teams. As is usually the case with Kaggle competitions, the most valuable part was the lessons learned from the experience."
