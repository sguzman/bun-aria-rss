  "description": "<p>Adoption should matter to every believer, because every believer is adopted. In this episode, Laura shares a bit about her family's journey to adopt two children from Bulgaria and why they were motivated by the beautiful picture it paints of the gospel. Even if you don't personally plan to adopt, this episode is for you too! All believers need to love orphans, supporting those on the front lines of this calling. We hope this episode plants seeds, waters seeds that God has already planted, and reminds you of the great love God displays for us through adoption!</p> <p>Like what you hear?
