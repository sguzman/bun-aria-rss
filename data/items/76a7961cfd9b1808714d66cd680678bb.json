After hearing the details, perhaps you will come up with your own theory. Was it the Devil? Did aliens pay a visit? Could these be the tracks of a ghost? The Moment in Oddity features the disappearing island of Lomea and This Day in History features the Stars and Stripes becoming America's official flag.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-50-legend-of-devils.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/06/hgb-podcast-ep-50-legend-of-devils.html</a></p>",
