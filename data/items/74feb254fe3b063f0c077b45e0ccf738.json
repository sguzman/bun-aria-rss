  "description": "The months of September, October, November, and December take their names from Latin words meaning \"seven,\" \"eight,\" \"nine,\" and \"ten.\" So why don't their names correspond to where they fall in the year? The answer lies in an earlier version of the Roman calendar. The sweltering period called the \"dog days\" takes its name from the movements of a certain star.
