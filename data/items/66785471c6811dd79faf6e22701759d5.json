  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys are joined by former NBA referee and member of one of the biggest betting scandals in recent sports history, Tim Donaghy. They discuss his role in the betting scandal that rocked the NBA and all of professional sports which eventually resulted in the FBI getting involved, what the process was like in terms of his job and what he was doing, the new film “Inside Man,” which is about the whole ordeal and what kind of involvement he had in the film, whether he thinks games are being fixed in other major sports leagues, where he thinks the next major betting scandal will come from, and what his time in prison was like. It’s an absolute roller coaster of an interview (3:05-26:24). Also included are Pat’s thoughts on the John Elway/Emmanuel Sanders situation, and who is in the right and what he thinks the atmosphere inside that locker room is currently like. Pat also gives his take on LeBron James and why he is becoming more and more unlikeable off the court. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
