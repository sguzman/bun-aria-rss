  "description": "<p>Do you feel bloated and like you aren’t digesting anything? Maybe you are gassy or constipated, or the food is going right through you? I recently shared my own digestive issues on my IG stories and was floored by 95% of people following me also experiencing them! I knew something bigger is up. In this episode, I sit down with Mind-Body Connection expert Nate Ortiz to discuss how our digestive and hormonal issues are linked to deeper spiritual causes and suppressed trauma, which we are especially sensitive to as empaths. Nate shares his incredible story from growing up around drugs, gang violence and poverty and even experiencing homelessness throughout his childhood, to overcoming adversities, healing his trauma and helping others heal theirs through his psychosomatic approach. This episode blew me away and is one you will want to listen to again because it is JAM-PACKED with wisdom. I’m also glad to say since being coached by Nate, I have noticed enormous differences in my digestion and body and learned SO much about myself.
