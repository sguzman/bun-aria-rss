  "description": "<p>Bobby Mackey's Music World is northern Kentucky's longest running live music nightclub. For nearly forty years, this honky-tonk has hosted singing, dancing and drinking. But before the bar was opened up on this spot, a slaughterhouse was run here. A pit in the basement leads to the nearby Licking River and the blood and other waste from the slaughterhouse was dumped down this pit into the river. The building has been connected to murders, occult rituals and hauntings for years. Some claim that the pit itself leads straight to Hell. Join us and the hosts of Hillbilly Horror Stories Podcast, Jerry and Tracy Paulley, as we explore the history and hauntings of Bobby Mackey's Music World.
