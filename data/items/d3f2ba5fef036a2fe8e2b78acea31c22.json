  "description": "Daniel Altschuler and Javier Corrales are the authors of The Promise of Participation: Experiments in Participatory Governance in Honduras and Guatemala (Palgrave-MacMillan, 2014). Altschuler is a visiting scholar at the New School for Public Engagement, while Corrales is professor of political science at Amherst College.\n\nParticipatory governance has long drawn the interest of scholars in political science. The promise of increasing civic engagement through institutions that allow citizens to participate has been studied extensively, but often in urban environments. Altschuler and Corrales build on this literature, but shift to rural parts of Honduras and Guatemala. The book focuses on Community Managed Schools and the participation of parents in school administration. They find that there were positive impacts on organizational learning and civic engagement for participating parents.\n\nYou can view a short video from the book here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
