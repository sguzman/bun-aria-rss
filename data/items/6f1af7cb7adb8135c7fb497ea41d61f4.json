  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, the treatment of the Trump family is un-American and it’s like nothing we've ever seen in America before. TBS’s Samantha Bee is representive of what the democrat party and media have become. She said vile things about Ivanka Trump and should be banned from TV, yet she’s still on the air. Roseanne Barr is out but Bee, Joy Reid and Al Sharpton hang on. If you’re a leftist, you can be a bigot, a homophobe or a misogynist and you can be celebrated as heroes. Also, James Comey in 2017, said that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign. But now they are changing their tune saying they aren’t investigating the Trump campaign, they are investigating the Russians only. Everytime we get closer to these police state tactics to spy on the Trump campaign they change their language and arguments. Later, the White House will add a 25% import tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum. These tariffs are a disgrace and will drive up the cost of our cars, trucks and homes. This is not a make Ameica first issue when you are driving up costs for American families. Finally, Steve Lonegan calls in to discuss his primary this Tuesday for NJ’s 5th Congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
