  "description": "<p>Episode 241 - We survived the inauguration and are back for another week of insightful conversation with people involved in independent music. This week we have my old friend, Val Loper on the show. He plays in a rock band called Bear Hands (and a killer solo project called Rubbing Alcohol) and once upon a time, played in a melodic hardcore band called In Pieces. We talk the strange experience of playing radio festivals, playing in the indie rock world and drinking. It’s a frank and honest discussion of all things being in a band and I loved it. Have fun!
