    "media:description": "In the previous episodes, I've shown my on-site preparations which were necessary for beginning the main summer project of making a wooden waterwheel and a waterwheel-powered mill. \nI have already made a topsy-turvy workbench, fixed the cabin's door broken by an intruder, made a new wooden mallet, as well as installed and tested a DIY cloggers knife. \nEverything is going according to my plans and I will soon be able to start building the waterwheel but first, it is important to prepare all of the necessary tools and organize a comfortable workspace.\n--------------------------------\nTwo Chainsaw Secrets | Turning a Tree into Perfect Boards: https://youtu.be/8qz64ELkxdA\n--------------------------------\nMY LOG CABIN CAMP development videos (All Seasons):\n01 episode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeAG68azOBk (1 season)  2014\n02 episode  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaDvr5U3rm4 (1 season)  2014\n03 episode  - https://youtu.be/d2rk4cpaUwg (1 season)  2014 (not translated)\n1 episode  - https://youtu.be/z6HNfMBgnZ0 (2 season)  2015 \n2 episode  - https://youtu.be/Cot3y87cvvk (2 season) 2015 \n3 episode  -https://youtu.be/7DOCsMBA5lo (3 season) 2016\n4 episode  -https://youtu.be/fQSpQH9t_mM (3 season) 2016\n5 episode  - https://youtu.be/yjvRVLR5gLg (4 season) 2017  \n6 episode  -  https://youtu.be/arnAD8I7msQ (4 season) 2017   \n7 episode  - https://youtu.be/xRSUxRUZb0I (5 season) 2018     \n8 episode  - https://youtu.be/_RM5SD_FZ_0 (6 season) 2019 \n9 episode  - https://youtu.be/q41ES-OXL_k (6 season) 2019\n10 episode- https://youtu.be/YiHRYyBQyrw (6 season) 2019\n--------------------------------\nMy Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/advoko\n\n#logcabin #bushcraft #survival #diy",
