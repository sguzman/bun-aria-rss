  "description": "<p>Jessa speaks with Justin Ward about the disappearance of the working class journalist. With local, small, and alternative newspapers folding, there are fewer avenues for people who want to be journalists to learn the trade except for in expensive, exclusive, and elitist university systems. How has that changed media coverage of politics and the economy? Why does the New York Times only know four Trump voters? How do we go about reforming a journalism culture that is cozy with power and devoted to the status quo?</p> <p>Support this podcast: http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</p>",
