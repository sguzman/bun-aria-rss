  "description": "<p>We are joined by Amanda Diaz and we go through a show that is the mother of all technical difficulties. We start off with Josh back at his parent's in Canada and Bri getting a bunch of tattoos. We talk with Amanda about coming to America from Cuba, getting into makeup and YouTube as a kid, her relationship with Kio Cyr, and end with a guys vs girls product battle.\n\nWe go through headlines with Sevryn's response to Dave saying him going to Jaden's concert was a shot at Mads Lewis, Tana Mongeau's response to Dave roasting her for the whole internet to see, the D'Amelios' taking the KCA by storm and JoJo Siwa missing out on an invite despite being nominated.  \n\nWe end the show with an update on Bri's boyfriend swap, Dave thinking he can out-model Versace's Cole Sprouse, and a very interesting FMK that has Josh choosing between Ellie Zeiler, Mads Lewis, and Loren Gray.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
