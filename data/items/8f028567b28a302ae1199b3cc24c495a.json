  "description": "Big news in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and I’m not talking about Beto O’Rourke’s dropping out because nobody ever actually cared about Beto O’Rourke except for the mainstream media, and they’re wrong about everything. No, I’m talking about actually consequential presidential campaign news: Elizabeth Warren has released the details of her healthcare plan, which costs roughly $50 bazillion dollars. We’ll get into the economics of it, and examine the broader strategy of the Warren campaign: she thinks you’re all a bunch of idiots. Then, a Democratic state rep says something horrifying about unborn babies, President Trump moves to Florida, and so much more. Date: 11-04-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices.
