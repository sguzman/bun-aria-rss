  "description": "<p>Craig Campbell returns to the Skeptic Tank to talk about snowboarding. He's a crazy back country snowboarder on top of being a comic.

We did this in Scotland at the Edinburgh Fringe and I saved it till now because it's mother Fing ski season, you guys! Fresh pow in all your futures!</p>",
