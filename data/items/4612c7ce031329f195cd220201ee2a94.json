  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’re on part two in our Holt Collier series and looking into the second section of his life, from the age of 20 to his mid-60s, which were defined by gunfights, cowboying and bear hunting. Holt was a former slave turned confederate soldier, he was acquitted of the murder of a white man after the civil war, and he made a lot of money as a market bear hunter in the primeval swamps of Mississippi. Holt was buddies with presidents, governors and outlaws – he became an accomplished cowboy in Texas while running from the vigilante justice of those that wanted him hung. Holt was married three times, was a deputy sheriff, his best bear dog was named Mandy, and he had a baseball team named after him. And, he guided President Teddy Roosevelt on the hunt that created the global icon of the “Teddy Bear” (we’ll talk about that on episode three). We’ve interviewed author, Minor Ferris Buchannan who’s written the only book about Holt Collier, Hank Burdine who acts as a guardian of Holt’s legacy, and Jonathan Wilkins – an African American outfitter in the Delta. You wouldn’t believe Holt’s story if it wasn’t the truth, he’s surrounded by controversy and irony, but one thing is for certain – he was an extraordinary and brilliant man and his legacy deserves to sit with the kings of American culture. We’re in search of learning who this man Holt Collier was and I really doubt you’re going to want to miss this. </p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
