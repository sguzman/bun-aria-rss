The CLO has advice for someone who had an experience at Dairy Queen. Yesterday marked three full weeks of protesting sparked by the killing of George Floyd. The crew give their opinions on what has taken place and are not pulling their punches when they are talking about Trump. Georgia was one of the five states that had voting and Shirley shares her experience. Steve also tells us about his sons voting experience, plus more. Phoenix Karen gets slapped and Trump made a tasteless tweet about Martin Gugino. There is some movement in the State of New York. Today in Closing Remarks, Steve wants to encourage all to take the same energy from the protesting to the polls in November, plus more.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
