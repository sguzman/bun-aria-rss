  "description": "<p>Multiple times a day, even multiple times an hour, we’re hearing new information about COVID-19. Some of the most common questions I’ve received have to do with testing. We had our first case of novel coronavirus the same day South Korea had its first case. Yet they are much further ahead of us when it comes to testing, something that has helped them quickly control the virus in a way we haven’t been able to do in the US. They also rapidly took on measures like quarantining and tracing the transmission of the virus.</p><br><p>Of course, there are so many different components that go into successful testing and quelling a pandemic of this size. Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I hope to shed some light on those with my guest Dr. Steven Kleiboeker. Throughout our conversation, we cover who should be tested, when, and how, and what kinds of tests are currently available or soon will be. He is the Vice President of Research and Development for Viracor, and is responsible for the scientific direction and oversight of the company's research and development programs as well as the BioPharma and Clinical Trial Biomarker Services research services. Dr. Kleiboeker is board certified as a high-complexity laboratory director, technical supervisor, and clinical consultant by the American Board of Bioanalysis.
