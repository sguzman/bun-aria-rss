  "description": "<p>You recently had a revelation that your spouse has zero respect for you. On a daily basis, you're reminded how to do basic tasks and criticized for every minor mistake you make. You've also noticed that they never value your advice, and if they have a question about something — no matter how confident your answer is — they'll always ask someone else afterward as if they don't value or believe your answer. You work hard, have a good job that supports your family on your income alone, you help out around the house probably more than most in your position, and you're going to school to further your education and job opportunities even more. The big question is: If they really do have zero respect for you, how can you win back your spouse's respect? We'll try to answer this and much more on the latest Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
