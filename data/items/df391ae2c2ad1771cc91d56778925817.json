  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, former U.S Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch may have lied under oath during her testimony during the Adam Schiff impeachment inquiry. It was regarded her private personal emails where she backchanneled the State Department to discuss the whistleblower complaint two weeks before it was publically filed. This indicates that she did, in fact, collude with Congressional staff and then indicated that she did not respond to the said email in her testimony under oath. In other words, she lied, just like Schiff himself lied about not colluding with the whistleblower prior to the complaint being filed when in fact his staff was in contact with the leaker referred to as the so-called whistleblower. Also, there's a huge push from the NY Times and Washington Post to push a new book by the anonymous author of the anonymous op-ed criticizing President Trump. While the media goes to all lengths to protect the Washington leaker they've labeled the so-called whistleblower, President Trump has every right to let the American people know who he is. Then, Trump praised the scholarship of this program in today's exchange with the White House press corps. What the Democrats are doing to the Presidency is outrageous. Schiff's attacks don't end, so now they've attacked the previous calls Trump has had with President Zelensky; Trump has indicated that he is open to releasing those call transcript(s) as well. While the media is so taken with Lt. Col. Vindman anti-Trump and anti-American comments of which he was confronted on, by Lt Col. Jim Hickman. So now the Democrats will go after Hickman for his challenge to their star-witness (Vindman). The so-called whistleblower may have been a leaker before, in fact, Eric Ciaramalla was cited in the Mueller Report linking his summaries of calls with other world leaders and the contents of those calls as leaked to, and published by, the New York Times. Afterward, former Sen. Jim DeMint joins the show to discuss his new book, \" Conservative: Knowing What To Keep\".\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
