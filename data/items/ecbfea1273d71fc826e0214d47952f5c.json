  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is Forbidden by Lauren Smith!\n\nKat Roberts has a plan. Love doesn’t fit into it.\n\nMove to England.\n\nStudy at Cambridge.\n\nBecome a history professor.\n\nSee? No room for dating or love. Life is going exactly according to plan….until she met him one snowy night in an English pub. Tristan Kingsley, the future Earl of Pembroke. He’s as gorgeous as a god, funny, sweet, and oh-my-god that accent… With a chiseled jaw, bewitching eyes, and a voice as smooth as a glass of brandy…he’s every woman’s dream. He tempts Kat to leave her carefully laid plans behind as she falls head over tea kettle for this British playboy.\n\nTristan Kingsley went into the bar that night to avoid the duties of his future as a titled lord. When a gorgeous American girl kisses him on a dare from her friends, that kiss turns his world upside down. Oh, he’s used to having exactly what he wants: women, money, notoriety. But now he wants Kat. In his arms, in his bed—and the more time he spends with her, the more he wants her in his life. Tired of shallow, social climbing English debutantes, Tristan can’t get enough of his brilliant, sweet Yank.\n\nBut not everyone is happy with the situation. His father, the Earl of Pembroke, has other plans for Tristan, and getting rid of Kat is number one on the list. If you thought this was a fairytale of a girl finding her Prince—er, Earl, and living happily-ever-after…then prepare yourself for one heck of an American Revolution.\n\nNarrated by Carolyn Morris\nForbidden by Lauren Smith\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2J2jm7T\nAudio: https://amzn.to/35YZf3A\niBooks: https://apple.co/35XVMCi\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3nT9cp9\nNook: https://bit.ly/3m7gbKM\n\nMentioned Books\nGrigori by Lauren Smith: https://amzn.to/33f1aiq\nMaker by Frankie Love: https://amzn.to/3l18O6o\nMission by Laurann Dohner: https://amzn.to/2UW27I2\nThe Earl of Christmas Past by Kerrigan Byrne: https://amzn.to/3kYUFGB\nLast Gift (Hitman #1.5) by Jessica Clare & Jen Frederick: https://bit.ly/2UYv4TL\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nADS\nLessons from a One-Night Stand by Piper Rayne\neBook: https://amzn.to/3fzqiWb\nAudio: https://amzn.to/3nLhlvY\n\nBlushing Brides by MINK: https://amzn.to/3fthGk5\n\nHis Forever Girl by Lucy Darling: https://amzn.to/2KDN7Na\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
