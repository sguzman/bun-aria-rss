  "description": "<p>This week, we ask a couple of simple questions\" What do you want?\" and \"what are you willing to do to get it?\" This week, we're digging into these questions and sharing real-world examples of the kinds of decisions artists face when growing a business ... should you invest in that new website? Should you start a Youtube channel? Should you give that speech at the local art society?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While neither of us is perfect (by any means!), we have both done some work on our long-term visions, both for our art and our lives. We use this knowledge of our desires to guide decisions about what we are willing to spend, or sacrifice, or work towards. Perhaps you have done the same or perhaps you find yourself torn about these kinds of issues, unsure of the right move. If so, we hope this episode will help you develop your own clear sense of where you're going ... and what you are willing to do to get there.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Art2Life workshop: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/art2life22artjuice\" target=\"_blank\">https://bit.ly/art2life22artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Will Gompertz \"What Are You Looking at: 150 Years of Modern Art\" <a href=\"\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Are-You-Looking-At/dp/B00N3KGPMQ/</a></p>\n<p>Happy Scale App <a href=\"\">https://happyscale.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><em>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
