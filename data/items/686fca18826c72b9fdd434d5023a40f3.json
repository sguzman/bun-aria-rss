Just be sure that you’re investing somewhere, in something, and it’s so important that you invest in what you know! In this episode we cover some alternative ways to invest your money, as a way to get you thinking creatively and strategically when it comes to investing so that you can earn over 10% while feeling more fulfilled at the same time. Listen to the full episode to get inspired! However, if you find that you don’t currently have the time or ability to take on these alternative methods, at the very least you can start with traditional investing which you can easily learn all about in Episode 9: Retirement Investing is Simpler than You Think.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we each enjoyed a Plank’d by Avery Brewing Company which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
