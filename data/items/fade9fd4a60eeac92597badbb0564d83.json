  "description": "In today's podcast we hear that the Government of India is working on Aadhaar security, suspending many officials' access. Fancy Bear doxes the IOC. WhatsApp snooping proof-of-concept revealed. Spectre and Meltdown patching continues. The US House voted to reauthorize Section 702 surveillance (the Senate is considering its own version). On the FBI's unwanted list: jerks and evil geniuses (and they're scowling in the direction of Cupertino). Rick Howard from Palo Alto Networks on AI and ML in cyber security. Guest is Shelley Westman from EY, with the results from their Global Information Security Survey. Conflating Bitcoin with Bitcoin cash could have been an e-commerce issue.",
