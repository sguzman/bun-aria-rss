    "media:description": "Hello everyone! We worked very hard to make another great timelapse for you! This pumpkin is not as big and beautiful as last years pumpkin, but we love it anyway!  \n\nThe seed was planted on 10 april 2022 and pumpkin was harvest on 17 september 2022. \n\nThe sheet is placed on top of the pumpkin to block out sunlight. So the pumpkin does not ripen and can grow for a longer period of time. \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is so amazing to see how fast a pumpkin plant can grow, plants are amazing right?!  \n\n \n\n#sizematters #timelapse #pumpkins #giantpumpkins #fall #autumn #timelapses #watchthegrowth #herfst #pompoenen #pompoeneriewezep #harvest #harvestseason #reuzenpompoen #pumpkin #growing  \n\n \n\nSwipe and subscribe!
