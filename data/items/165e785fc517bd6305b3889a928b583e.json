  "description": "<p>As moms, we love practical help. Tips, checklists, and \"how-to\" articles seem to promise that we're finally going to get something right. But when we bypass dependence on God and decide to just model our lives after the mom down the street, we've missed the point. We weren't created to reflect each other, but to reflect Christ in ways that are unique to the skills, abilities and life circumstances he's given us. In this episode, Emily and Laura encourage moms to understand how the gospel frees us from adopting one style of \"perfect\" mothering. God wants our whole lives to be a living sacrifice, so we can be free to glorify him in all we do (even when that looks different from our friends).</p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
