  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about the return of the the Lazarus Group (or maybe it never really left). A Dun & Bradstreet database is compromised—more than thirty-three million are said to be affected. British travel association ABTA suffers a breach. Notes on identity theft. Netherlands voter information sites hit with DDoS—Turkish hacktivists (or government operators) suspected. The University of Maryland's Center for Health and Homeland Security's Markus Rauschecker describes the increasingly important role of cyber lawyers in M&A activity. Digital Guardian's Tim Bandos has methods for protecting against state sponsored actors and hacktivists. The US indicts four in the Yahoo! breach—two of them have FSB connections.",
