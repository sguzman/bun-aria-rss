  "description": "<p>EPISODE 102 - DYLAN GOSS - Aerial Cameraman</p> <p>Team Deakins talks with aerial cameraman, Dylan Goss (DUNE, BLADE RUNNER 2049, SICARIO). We have the opportunity to look closely at this very specialized area. We look at the technical aspects and how they have changed. And we talk about when he is brought in, how he figures out what is needed, and the importance of his understanding of the script. We discuss the work he did with us on the films Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, including the array rig we had to develop to meet the needs of VFX in Blade Runner 2049. He also shares his experiences on the TV show Devs and we talk about the differences between drone work and helicopter work. It’s a great look at the complex world of aerial photography!</p>",
