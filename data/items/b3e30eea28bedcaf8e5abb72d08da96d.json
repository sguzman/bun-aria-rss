Dry bulk overall has been in a broad bear market since 2011 and there are many signs of green shoots as worldwide demand improves while the supply via new orders remains near record lows.\nAlthough GRIN is a smaller company, this interview contains relevant insights for investors in all other dry bulk companies, including: Diana Shipping (DSX), Eagle Bulk (EGLE), Genco Shipping (GNK), Golden Ocean (GOGL), Navios Partners (NMM), Safe Bulkers (SB), and Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK).\nTopics Covered\n\n(<:1:20) Introductions\n\n\n(1:20) What is your core focus in the market now?\n\n\n(4:15) What factors are driving rates in the smaller and midsized rates?\n\n\n(9:30) Any environmental regulation impacts incoming to this sector?\n\n\n(12:40) Future fleet profile?
