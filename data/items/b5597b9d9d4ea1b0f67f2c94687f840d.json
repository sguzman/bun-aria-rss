  "description": "<p>Lyceums were part of an educational movement in the New England area during the Victorian era. These were places that hosted some of the greatest orators of the time and one in particular was the scene of Alexander Graham Bell making the first successful long distance phone call. This would be the Salem Lyceum Hall. Today it is Turner's Seafood Grill and Market. This sits on land once owned by Bridget Bishop who was the first to die during the Salem Witch Trials. Is this land cursed? Is that why there are ghost stories connected to this property? Join us as we explore the history and haunts of the Lyceum Hall. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Gail Frederick and features an abandoned town of Disneyesque castles and This Month in History features The Niagara Movement forming.</p> <p>This episode is brought to you by I Know What Scares You Podcast.
