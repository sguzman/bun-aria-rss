  "description": "This week, the gals wade through some grimy waterway crimes. Topics include New York's extensive (and often biohazardous) canal system, the dangers of peeing into bodies of water, and some slime so toxic that it required a visit to the emergency room. Crack open a bottle of Oxford Landing Estates Sauvignon Blanc, secure your Playstation, hose yourself off, and tune in for Canal Crimes.",
