  "description": "<p>Bobbi Brown is the founder and chief creative officer of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics. Bobbi first arrived on the beauty scene in 1991 with the launch of Bobbi Brown Essentials, and changed the face of makeup with 10 brown­-based lipstick shades created to fill a void in the market of simple and flattering makeup. Bobbi’s philosophy was simple: “Women want to look and feel like themselves, only prettier and more confident.” Today, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics is a global color cosmetics, fragrance and skincare brand with a presence in more than 65 countries and 50 free-standing stores. She is also editor­-in-­chief of Yahoo Beauty and beauty & lifestyle editor of Elvis Duran and The Morning Show, a nationally syndicated radio show. A New York Times best-selling author, Bobbi has written eight beauty and lifestyle books. Her impact extends well beyond the beauty and fashion industries. In 2008, she received an honorary doctorate from Montclair State University. In 2010, Bobbi was appointed by President Obama to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation. As the brand continues to grow globally, Bobbi’s message remains the same today as when she launched in 1991: “The secret to beauty is simple—be who you are.” Bobbi is also a serious foodie interested in the link between wellness and diet. She truly believes that beauty starts from within.</p>\n<p>Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley are sisters, home cooks, and food lovers with a passion for wellness and delicious, nutrient­-dense cooking. They started Hemsley + Hemsley six years ago as a bespoke service aimed at helping people with their digestion and relationship with food. Since then, they’ve become authors of the international bestselling cookbook The Art of Eating Well and contributors to Vogue.co.uk and The Guardian. They are currently working on a second book, Good + Simple, which will be released in February 2016.</p>\n<p>This program was brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/\">American Express OPEN</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>var array = eval('[{\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"href\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/podcast\\/beauty-from-within-bobbi-brown-and-the-hemsley-sisters\\/2052-01r-bb-rgb-bobbi-blazer_300\\/\",\"src\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/2052-01R-BB-RGB-BOBBI-BLAZER_300.jpg\",\"title\":\"2052-01R BB RGB BOBBI BLAZER_300\",\"0\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/2052-01R-BB-RGB-BOBBI-BLAZER_300-900x1202.jpg\",\"1\":640,\"2\":855,\"3\":true},{\"alt\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"href\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/podcast\\/beauty-from-within-bobbi-brown-and-the-hemsley-sisters\\/hemsleyhemsley_-1470\\/\",\"src\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/HEMSLEYHEMSLEY_-1470.jpg\",\"title\":\"HEMSLEYHEMSLEY_-1470\",\"0\":\"http:\\/\\/heritageradionetwork.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/HEMSLEYHEMSLEY_-1470-900x900.jpg\",\"1\":640,\"2\":640,\"3\":true}]');\ngalleryArrays.push(array);\ndocument.write(\"\");\n\n> #### “I grew up in the 70’s where it was all about diet food and space food.” [33:00]\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>“It’s not about being on a diet, it’s really healthy eating that helps you feel good and as a beauty expert it’s about what makes you look good.” [35:00]</h4>\n<h4>–Bobbi Brown on Radio Cherry Bombe</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n",
