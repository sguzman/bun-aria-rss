  "description": "AOC claims that older generations NEVER stood up to the government as much as the new one, but may we mention Restoring Honor, the 912 march, and Restoring Unity, all with anniversaries this week?

But capitalism is crumbling before our eyes, while all the popular examples of “European socialism” are coming to us for help! Jack Fairweather, author of “The Volunteer,” joins to discuss the amazing untold story of a man who volunteered to go to Auschwitz in order to tell the world all the horrors he saw.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
