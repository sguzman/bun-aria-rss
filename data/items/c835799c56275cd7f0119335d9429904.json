  "description": "In today's podcast we talk about Android malware loose in the wild, crimeware-as-a-service (both ransomware and banking Trojans). We hear about the growing consensus that Russian intelligence services were responsible for the DNC hack, and we note the latest report: those services also seem to have pwned the Clinton Foundation. Critical infrastructure jitters persist. Analysts look at cyber insurance markets, bellwether security stocks, and a new VC investment. Dr. Charles Clancy from the Hume Center at Virginia Tech discusses the cyber challenges faces the transportation industry, and Ayse Kaya Firat from Cloudlock shares key points from their recent report on the dangers of third party apps.",
