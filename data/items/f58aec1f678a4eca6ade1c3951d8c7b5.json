Then, we touch on the other Western Conference series that’s still going—Spurs vs. Nuggets—and what a potential loss could mean for Michael Malone, Nikola Jokic, and the rest of the Nuggets franchise (15:30). Finally, we close with—predictably—some Russell Westbrook talk and a preview of the upcoming round of the playoffs (28:00).\n\nHosts: Justin Verrier, Chris Ryan\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
