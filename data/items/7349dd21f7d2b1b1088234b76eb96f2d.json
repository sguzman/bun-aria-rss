  "description": "In this episode I play audio from one of my favorite philosophers named Alan Watts. He puts our lives into perspective and talks about why we should follow the money, but follow our passions. Then at the end I wrap it up with my thoughts on this issue. I made this episode in hopes that you will listen to it over and over again.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
