  "description": "Interviews and conversations are unique. Some flow rather easily and others are a bit tough to get through. This particular discussion however, is a different animal altogether - and for all the right reasons. Joining JJ and Tommy this week is fellow ThreeFourTwo family member (and NBA sharpshooter) Duncan Robinson, and Hasan Minhaj - a comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actor, and television host, just to name a few. The four of them join together for a conversation that covers just about everything and absolutely nothing is out of bounds. The topics range from lighter subjects like JJ and Duncan’s hair and their caffeine intake, to deep dives into the social media landscape, performance anxiety, and controlling the power of a celebrity’s public voice. Plus mixed into all of this is another spectacular EAT PRAY DUNK segment. It is an absolute can’t miss interview. \nRUNDOWN \n•\tJJ starts the show off by immediately throwing Hasan under the bus for not knowing he was traded to the Mavs after seeing him shortly after the trade deadline\n•\tDuncan touches on whether he has gotten hit with any courtside heckling\n•\tOn the protocols of talking to people sitting courtside\n•\tHasan dishes on the jealousy of and competition of courside seating\n•\tHow do Woj and Shams get their info? Who is leaking it and how does it get out so quickly?\n•\tWould stories leak in the entertainment world if there was the same kind of passion as there is in sports\n•\tIs Julius Randle first team all-NBA this year\n•\tBreaking down the Knicks superb play of late \n•\tWhat’s the bigger story (for NY’ers), the Nets winning a chip or the Knicks winning a playoff series \n•\tOn the passion of Knicks fans\n•\tHasan describes what it’s like being a Kings fan\n•\tHasan tells a special Bobby Hurley story and his connection with him\n•\tWhat’s the purpose of having the same teams on national TV all the time\n•\tDid Miami flip that script last year with their run to the finals\n•\tHow Duncan’s experience of having his own podcast has been going thus far\n•\tHow the insanity of the NBA schedule this year has contributed to the difficulty of nailing down guests\nEAT PRAY DUNK\n•\tDo NBA players concentrate more on basketball now - even with all the side distractions - as compared to when they were young\n•\tHow the narrative has completely changed within the mindset of players coming into the league compared to years ago\n•\tHasan sees a new crop of NBA owners coming out of this era of athletes\n•\tThe issues and pitfalls of social media \n•\tOn the differences in player relationships in today’s era\n•\tComparing an athlete's performance anxiety to an entertainer’s\n•\tHow to juggle the responsibility of speaking for so many people that look to you for answers/opinions\n•\tDoes anxiety change with expectations\n•\tBeing able to lean on friends for help is a key element to staying grounded\n•\tSports has stats and wins/losses… How is success measured in entertainment \n•\tHasan grills JJ and Duncan on their haircuts and techniques\n•\tDuncan discusses the time where he was called Jimmy Neutron throughout a game\n•\tThe guys break down their caffeine intake\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
