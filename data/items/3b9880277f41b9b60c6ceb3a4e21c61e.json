  "description": "Many beginning Python users are wondering with which version of Python they should start. My answer to this question is usually something along the lines 'just go with the version your favorite tutorial was written in, and check out the differences later on.'\\ But what if you are starting a new project and have the choice to pick? I would say there is currently no 'right' or 'wrong' as long as both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x support the libraries that you are planning to use. However, it is worthwhile to have a look at the major differences between those two most popular versions of Python to avoid common pitfalls when writing the code for either one of them, or if you are planning to port your project.",
