  "description": "<p>We present a novel approach for solving articulated inverse kinematic\nproblems (e.g., character structures) by means of an iterative dual-quaternion\nand exponentialmapping approach. As dual-quaternions are a break from the norm\nand offer a straightforward and computationally efficient technique for\nrepresenting kinematic transforms (i.e., position and translation).\nDual-quaternions are capable of represent both translation and rotation in a\nunified state space variable with its own set of algebraic equations for\nconcatenation and manipulation. Hence, an articulated structure can be\nrepresented by a set of dual-quaternion transforms, which we can manipulate\nusing inverse kinematics (IK) to accomplish specific goals (e.g., moving\nend-effectors towards targets). We use the projected Gauss-Seidel iterative\nmethod to solve the IK problem with joint limits. Our approach is flexible and\nrobust enough for use in interactive applications, such as games. We use\nnumerical examples to demonstrate our approach, which performed successfully in\nall our test cases and produced pleasing visual results.\n</p>",
