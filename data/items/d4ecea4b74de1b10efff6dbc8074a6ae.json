  "description": "<p>We start the show with what everyone has been waiting for us to talk about: Nessa Barrett and Jaden Hossler breaking up. We talk about the rumors and theories involving Landon Barker and Josie Canseco, Josh’s friends refollowing Jaden, and whether or not Nessa would ever be welcome back on BFFs.\n\nWe continue headlines with the Met Gala, Charli D’Amelio standing up for herself against Zoe Laverne, Zack Bia with his next girl in Olivia Rordrigo, Tinx’s cancellation over old tweets, and Tayler Holder’s (next) exclusive about the allegations against him where he doesn’t really say anything once again. \n\nWe finish headlines with the BFFs corner where we talk Ellie Zeiler potentially taking offense to Josh’s FMK, getting flirty with Mads Lewis in the IG comments, and his new girl that may be the “one to change him” he talked about from last week. \n\nWe finish the episode with Chloe Cherry who plays Faye in Euphoria and talk about her transition from the adult film industry to the number 1 show on TV. We end with a game of FMK in which she has to choose between her cast members on Euphoria. \n\nSupport our sponsors!\n\nRaising Canes: Order online at www.raisingcanes.com\n\nGametime:Download the Gametime app at https://barstool.link/GametimeApp and redeem code BFF for $20 off your first purchase (terms apply).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
