  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Larry O’Connor of WMAL fills in for Mark. The media is lying about children dying while in Border Patrol custody by omitting information. What we’ve heard is that an 8 year old died, but not that he was given medical treatment immediately or that his dad refused further treatment. The tragedy isn’t lessened by knowing all of the facts, but it gives perspective into how the media is using a tragedy to shape our immigration policy. The media outrage over President Trump’s visit to troops in Iraq for Christmas is another example of how the media lies by omission. The media reported that Trump didn’t visit with troops for Christmas, and after it came out that he did, they doubled down by saying it wasn’t technically on Christmas. The reporters and journalist that say they support our troops are the first people to attack the person leading them; the Commander in Chief. Any time the media can attack a Republican president, they will and with reckless abandon.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
