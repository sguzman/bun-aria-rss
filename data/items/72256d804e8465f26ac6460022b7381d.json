  "description": "Things get weird this week. The knights continue their quests through the Country of Strange Adventure, and the side-quests becomes the main quest as the knights get involved with:   Bad breakups  Vengeance  Dragons eating dogs eating stags  Death choirs  Elderly women looking for a good time  Church decorations  Way too much more   Also, were you wondering what happened to Arthur's incestuous offspring, Mordred? Neither was anyone else! But he's back just in time for something horrible to happen.    The creature this time is the cuero, a nice looking blanket to keep sand off you on the beach and also maybe your skin as well.     Sponsors: I actually just finished a Blue Apron meal.
