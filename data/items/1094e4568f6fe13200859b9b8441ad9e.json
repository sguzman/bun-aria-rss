  "description": "<p>This is one of the best conversations I've ever had. Shannan Martin is the author of Start with Hello, a beautiful book about being a neighbor. She is a true Lazy Genius in this area and offers so many ways to start small in our relationships, for example with saying hello. This book transcends neighborhoods, lifestyles, and family structures. We also share places we've been awkward as neighbors and how one interaction, even if it's the last one, has a significant impact. You will eat this up, you guys.
