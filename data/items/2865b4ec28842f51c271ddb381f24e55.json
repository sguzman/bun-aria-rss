  "description": "<p>Drew Lang, founding principal of LANG Studio in New York, shares the challenges of being an architect developer and how many of those challenges were solved with a unique approach to the award-winning development in the Catskills, Hudson Woods.</p> <p>Drew is an active advocate for positive collaboration in community and getting more readily to a place of joy in our work within the industry. With this philosophy in mind, Drew launched the newly reimagined social-media platform Brick & Wonder in 2020, to provide an online community where real estate and design professionals can go to connect, support, and network.</p> <p>As an architect, Drew has been tapped to bring his design sensibility to even more new homes in the works in upstate New York. He can speak to trends in the housing market, as well as to the power of design and community-building in this new pandemic-shaped era.</p> <p>To see more about Drew, visit his website at: <a href= \"https://langarchitecture.com/\">https://langarchitecture.com/</a></p> <p>LinkedIn: <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-lang-0655b16\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-lang-0655b16</a></p> <p>Instagram: <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/langarchitecture/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/langarchitecture/?hl=en</a></p> <p>► Feedback?
