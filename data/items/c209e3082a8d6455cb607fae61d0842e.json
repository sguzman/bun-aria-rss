  "description": "In April 2008, a 22-year-old girl in North Carolina woke up feeling incredibly sick, so she was in and out of the emergency room throughout the day. But as day turned to night, she spoke on the phone with a friend and explained that she was going to the hospital yet again, and her ride was almost there. After she hung up the phone, she was never seen again- and a peculiar scene was left at her apartment. This is the disappearance of Jamie Fraley.\n\nPATREON BONUS EPISODES: http://patreon.com/goingwestpodcast\n\nCASE SOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/ricky-simonds-obituary?pid=111379289\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/c0tao4/first_my_fiancée_goes_missing_then_my_dad_climbs/\n\nhttps://medium.com/@horsfall/where-is-jamie-fraley-1a5f60bc1d31\n\nhttp://charleyproject.org/case/jamie-michelle-fraley\n\nhttps://medium.com/@horsfall/where-is-jamie-fraley-1a5f60bc1d31\n\nhttps://talkmurder.com/jamie-fraley/ Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
