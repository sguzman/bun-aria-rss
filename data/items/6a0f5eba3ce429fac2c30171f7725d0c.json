  "description": "Trump is a wannabe authoritarian who has consistently abused the power of his office and sought to place himself above the law. Trump is also a president who, when faced with a crisis, failed to use the resources of the U.S. government to help the American people. As it turns out, both things are true...but the question is, as we enter the next phase of this crisis and the run up to the election, which Trump will show up? The aspiring tyrant or the quivering mouse? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem and Stephen Walt of Harvard's Kennedy School, with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and with Kori Schake of AEI. Don't miss it.\nConsider supporting our work by becoming a member.
