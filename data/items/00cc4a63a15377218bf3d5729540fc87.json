  "title": "Bucs-Giants MNF Recap: Questionable call ends game, New York has a QB problem (Football 11/3)",
  "description": "The Bucs escaped New York with a 25-23 victory over the Giants on Monday night, following a controversial officiating call (or non-call) that effectively ended things. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down that 2-point conversion attempt and a whole lot more. If the Giants end up with the #2 pick in the draft, do they have to seriously consider selecting Justin Fields to supplant Daniel Jones. Jones wasn't very good again on Monday and there might not be much hope that he ever turns into a decent quarterback. Is there cause for concern for how Tampa played or was this a clear trap game for them?
