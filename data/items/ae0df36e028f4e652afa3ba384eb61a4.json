  "description": "Humorist Roy Blount Jr. sits down with Grant for a conversation about the controversy over writers' rights and the Amazon Kindle 2.  As president of the Authors Guild, Blount has argued that writers whose work is featured on the Kindle 2 should earn extra royalties because its text-to-speech feature essentially turns written works into audiobooks.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/opinion/25blount.html  Blount also discusses his own recent book, Alphabet Juice, talks about 'sonicky' words and noodling for catfish, and clears up the mystery of whether the cancan dancers at George Plimpton's memorial really did honor the late writer's request that they perform without panties.  Read the first chapter of Alphabet Juice here.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/books/chapters/chapter-alphabet-juice.html   Find out more about Blount and his work here.  http://www.royblountjr.com/  --  Get your language question answered on the air!
