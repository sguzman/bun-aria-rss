The first step when you're looking for great customer service is to be sure to do business with a reputable company. After that, there are plenty of additional elements to consider to not only save you money, but allow you to walk away from a transaction completely satisfied and raving about how great of an experience you had when you needed assistance. Listen as we help you to make the best use of your time when advocating for great customer service.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Atrial Rubicite by Jester King.
