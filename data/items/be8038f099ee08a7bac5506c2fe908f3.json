Kirk Minihane recaps Mike's performance yesterday while his white whale -- Mike Francesa -- roams free. The crew reacts to Feitelberg's take on the Des Moines Register trying to ruin some normal guy's life. KFC and Carrabis say Minihane is the grandfather of Barstool Sports. Plus, Kirk Minihane wants to know what you're doing. Literally. We called everyone.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
