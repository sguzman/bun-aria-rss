  "description": "<p>Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, award-winning writer and author of the book&nbsp;ON REPENTANCE AND REPAIR: Making Amends in an Unapologetic World,&nbsp;joins Jillian to talk about the life changing power of making amends. She discusses taking responsibility, learning from mistakes, and repairing relationships in all aspects of our lives. Being able to focus on the person you upset allows you both to heal, grow closer, and develop personally. The Rabbi takes us through the&nbsp;5-step process of&nbsp;1) Confession: fully owning what you did, without judgment. 2) Starting to change: figuring out why you did it and what you need to do about it. 3) Amends:&nbsp;asking the person you harmed&nbsp;what you can do to make it right.&nbsp;4) Apology: truly understanding how hurt the other person is. 5) Making different choices moving forward.</p><p><strong>Guest Links:</strong></p><p>Website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danyaruttenberg.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://danyaruttenberg.net/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://streaklinks.com/BLIN54Eu7ssW5qHp5Q-ZxKnS/https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTheRaDR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@TheRaDR</a></p><p>Instagram:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://streaklinks.com/BLIN54Q3d3V9PsFY3AX58-SL/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frabbidanyaruttenberg%2F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rabbidanyaruttenberg</a></p><p><br></p><p>For 25% off The Fitness App by Jillian Michaels, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thefitenssapp.com/podcastdeal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.thefitnessapp.com/podcastdeal</a></p><p>Follow us on Instagram @JillianMichaels and @MartiniCindy</p><p>Jillian Michaels Community:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1880466198675549\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1880466198675549</a></p><p>Email your questions to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:JillianPodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JillianPodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
