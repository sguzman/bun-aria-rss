    "media:description": "In this video we perform an analysis of an object that rolls while slipping against the ground, like when a cue ball is hit with English in the game of pool.  Surprisingly, the final velocity of the object is independent of the coefficient of friction, which means it will have the same final velocity whether sliding on a wooden table or on ice!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Gingerbread Man in Carlisle, for giving us access to their pool room after hours.  Thanks also to Jonathan Barrick, for making the disk, to my son Adam for helping record the pool scenes, and to Noah Lape for helping record the intro/outro clips.\n\nMusic for the pool scene:\nThat Science Ambient by ComaStudio, downloaded from https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=99521.\n\nBackground music for the rest of the video:\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nMusic for ending scene (attempts at sliding the wheel to a stop):\nBy REDproductions, downloaded from https://pixabay.com/music/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=16391.",
