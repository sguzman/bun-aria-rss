  "description": "In the final installment of The Picture of Leadership series, John Maxwell, Mark Cole and Richard Chancy discuss the final two C’s of great leadership: Convince and Cause. As a leader, you can’t do either if you lack belief in your product or are unable to gauge your organization’s momentum. <p>Richard and Mark talk about believing in what you’re selling and how to gauge momentum in order to determine if your team is fully engaged with its mission and growth. This lesson is a reminder to challenge yourself to identify a place in which to grow so that you can lead your team towards success.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Picture of Leadership Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
