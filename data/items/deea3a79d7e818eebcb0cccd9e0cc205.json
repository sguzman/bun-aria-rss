  "description": "Back in August, Myriam J.A. Chancy was preparing for the release of her novel <em>What Storm, What Thunder</em> when the news broke: a magnitude 7.2 earthquake had hit Haiti. It was a \"chilling and bittersweet\" moment, she says; her soon-to-be-published book revolved around the 2010 earthquake that devastated the country, and its aftermath. In this episode, she talks to NPR's Scott Simon about the eerie similarities between the two quakes, how her characters speak to how international relief efforts have historically failed Haiti, and what the world can learn from the country's rebuilding efforts.
