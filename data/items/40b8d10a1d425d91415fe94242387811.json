  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Poltergeist Parallels & Contagion with Darren W. Ritson<br>\n<br>\nDave & Tim welcome UK researcher and paranormal investigator, Darren W. Ritson an authority on Poltergeist Phenomena and unexplained anomalies.<br>\n<br>\nMore than fifteen years after the famous South Shields Poltergeist case of 2006, Mr. Ritson opens up about this fascinating enigma and shares with us research from other equally bewildering cases - and the fact that a number of serious thought-provoking hypotheses regarding the aspect of the poltergeist called 'contagion' have now been raised. </p>\n\n<p>Poltergeist contagion has been seldom discussed or studied by psychical researchers, despite many well documented historic cases making mention of it - that is, until now. During the South Shields case and its subsequent years, Darren W. Ritson and his co-investigator Michael J. Hallowell were also subjected to acts of poltergeist 'contagion'. </p>\n\n<p>Get the book here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/3BOJskE&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2S22WrwEbmzr6-xv-_A5J-\">https://amzn.to/3BOJskE</a></p>\n",
