  "description": "A LITTLE MORE OBSESSION by Gemma Weir\n\nObsessed – to be preoccupied or fill the mind with someone continually and to a troubling extent.\n\nAs soon as I realized she existed, I lost the ability to look away. She was always destined to be mine.\n\nI’m Sebastian Lockwood; a king among men. And kings get to take what they want.\n\nMy little bird disagreed. She fought me, disobeyed me even though we both know she belongs to me.\n\nSo I broke her, bent her to my will.\n\nI pushed too hard, loved too much and she ran from me.\n\nBut letting her go was impossible. So I chased; hiding in the shadows, silently pulling the strings that would bind her to me.\n\nTwo years have passed, I’ve waited long enough. It’s time to reclaim my queen; to take what’s mine.\n\nThe trap is set, a gilded cage worthy of royalty and only I have the key.\n\nI’ll make her pay for leaving me. I’ll make her love me, want me as much as I do her.\n\nI couldn’t stop if I tried.\n\nShe’s my obsession.\n\nGemma Weir: https://amzn.to/3sCOKNP\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/3sCOwpX \nObsession: https://amzn.to/3feCQ9O\nProperty Of The Mountain Man: https://amzn.to/3WlYsSu\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nOther Mentions\nSouthern Sun Designs: https://bit.ly/3W8F4bj\nIt’s All About The RE (II): Journaling by Alquadira Cox: https://amzn.to/3gPePXs\nThe Moonlight Duet by Jamie Schlosser: https://amzn.to/3ffuVZK\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
