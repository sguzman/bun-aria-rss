  "description": "<p>In this episode, Nate explains why some Christian readers are the worst: they love to demand that he sell chicken sandwiches with a side of Gideon Bible in the french-fry box. But Nate's trying to sell the best chicken sandwich & fries he can... he gives away Bibles elsewhere, including in this podcast. This episode is about when / why you might choose to have your characters in fiction pray -- and when you might not. You'll also get some key insights into rhetoric: who are you, who are you writing for, and where do you want to get them. And also some really interesting thoughts comparing Nate's characters to those in the Christian movie \"The War Room\" (about prayer).</p>\n<p><br />#SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #BrianKohl #AmWriting #ChristianFiction #WarRoom</p>",
