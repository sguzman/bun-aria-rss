  "description": "<p>Quantum machine learning algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits\nare promising candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Although these\nalgorithms are compatible with the current generation of quantum processors,\ndevice noise limits their performance, for example by inducing an exponential\nflattening of loss landscapes. Error suppression schemes such as dynamical\ndecoupling and Pauli twirling alleviate this issue by reducing noise at the\nhardware level. A recent addition to this toolbox of techniques is\npulse-efficient transpilation, which reduces circuit schedule duration by\nexploiting hardware-native cross-resonance interaction. In this work, we\ninvestigate the impact of pulse-efficient circuits on near-term algorithms for\nquantum machine learning. We report results for two standard experiments:\nbinary classification on a synthetic dataset with quantum neural networks and\nhandwritten digit recognition with quantum kernel estimation. In both cases, we\nfind that pulse-efficient transpilation vastly reduces average circuit\ndurations and, as a result, significantly improves classification accuracy. We\nconclude by applying pulse-efficient transpilation to the Hamiltonian\nVariational Ansatz and show that it delays the onset of noise-induced barren\nplateaus.\n</p>",
