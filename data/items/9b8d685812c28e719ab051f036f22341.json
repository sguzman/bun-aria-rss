Coming up on the anniversary of the battle (fought from Dec. 11-13, 1862), the gents conduct a compelling analysis of the fight, it's vast political and social consequences, and try to encourage others to change the way they think about Fredericksburg...all through hilarious banter and holiday cheer. Strap in for one of the biggest episodes yet! </p>",
