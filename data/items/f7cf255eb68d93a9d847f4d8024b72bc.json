  "description": "<p>David Sinclair (biologist, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and author of <i>Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don’t Have To</i>) discusses ways we can extend our lifespan and the work he’s doing to slow and reverse aging brain cells. He details the best lifestyle changes and emerging technologies available now to prevent most diseases until our 80’s, increase longevity, and even reverse the effects of aging. David opens up about his mental health struggles stemming from his own insecurities and frustrations with the planet, how his mother’s passing changed his outlook on life, and the dream he had that influenced his research and became a turning point in his career. After debating about intermittent fasting, Mayim and David examine the thread between solving problems in medicine, economics, and sociology, the effects of stress on the aging process, and mental health components tied to the aging brain. Mayim considers the amount of resources needed if humans lived longer, and the impact western culture’s attitude about aging might have on an increased lifespan.</p><p>David Sinclair's Book: <a href=\"https://lifespanbook.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linktress&utm_campaign=get%20the%20book<clid=\">https://lifespanbook.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linktress&utm_campaign=get%20the%20book<clid=</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul><p> </p>\n",
