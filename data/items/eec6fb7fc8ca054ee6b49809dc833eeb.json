  "title": "Ep 259 | Jase's Circumcision Question, It's Hard to Love Judgmental People, and an R-Rated Verse",
  "description": "Mia is headed back to school less than a month after major surgery. Phil, Jase, and Al love how unifying it was to hold the Masters in Georgia amid all the controversy and boycotts — even if Phil does find golf stressful and embarrassing. In another chapter of \"Jase's Grocery Store Chronicles,\" someone grills Jase about how Jesus could be a plan. Jase has been in plenty of men's rooms, and there's something in the Bible he just can't figure out about circumcision. And the guys talk about why it's much harder to show grace to people who are legalistic, the R-rated verse you don't hear in many sermons, and how changed lives become evidence of God's grace.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
