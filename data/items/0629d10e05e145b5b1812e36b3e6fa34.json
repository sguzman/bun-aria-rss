  "description": "Filmmaker Duncan Jones put his philosophy degree to good use when he started making science fiction films. Now on his fourth one, Duncan tells Marc how he tries to crack life's big questions through sci-fi stories, including Moon and his new movie Mute, which he likens more to Robert Altman's MASH than to Blade Runner. Duncan also talks to Marc about the burdens of having a famous parent - his being David Bowie - when you're trying to carve your own path. Plus, comedian and metal guy Brendon Small returns to the garage to talk about his new Galaktikon project.
