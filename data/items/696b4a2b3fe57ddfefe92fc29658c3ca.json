Exploring demon conjurings (spoiler...they can be kinda cute!) and the beef between the Temple of Satan and the Church of Satan. Meeting three different types of Satanists- atheistic, theistic and satanic witches- we mostly learn that the devil is our friend. Plus, we dive into the meaning of The Devil card with Hannah Graves, creator of Cult Mother Tarot, learning how to work with its dark and disciplinary energy.  <br>\n<br>\nYour Magic is a podcast hosted by author Michelle Tea. Every episode explores contemporary spirituality and magic with lots of humor and heart. Usually, they read their guests tarot – including people like Kathryn Hahn, Japanese Breakfast, Phoebe Bridgers, and so many other amazing people and then offer a DIY spell or ritual that anyone can do. But, in this episode – the host Michelle Tea dives deep into Satanism, the Satanic Church and the Satanic Temple and explores what it actually looks like to worship Satan.\n<br>\nIf you like the episode, you can find the podcast only on Spotify or support them at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/thisisyourmagic\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/thisisyourmagic</a>.
