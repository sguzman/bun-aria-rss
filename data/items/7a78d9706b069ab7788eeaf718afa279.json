  "description": "He was a man of the people. A man who wanted one thing and one thing only: true independence for his country. But if the U.S. government had its way? He’d be shot dead before his 36th birthday. In a conversation led by sociopolitical scholar Dr. Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, we discuss the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. This is an episode we need right now - one that calls out the Western powers that be for state-sanctioned violence and exposes the gross lengths they'll go to control Black lives.
