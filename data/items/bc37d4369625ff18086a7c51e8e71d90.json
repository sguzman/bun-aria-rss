  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP's sister gets pregnant at a very young age and decides to give her baby away. OP can't have children of her own, so she happily adopts the child, and then OP's sister goes no-contact for nearly a decade. Then, completely out of the blue, OP's sister calls OP on the phone and says that she wants her kid back, whom she hasn't even seen in nearly a decade. OP can't believe what she's hearing and turns her town, which leads to her wondering if maybe she's the butthole in this situation.</p>\n",
