  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the America First Legal Foundation sent a letter to Inspector General Horowitz requesting an investigation into Attorney General Merrick Garland. The letter questions whether Garland's memo may be preventing parents from practicing their constitutional right to protect their children and protest their government. The AFL letter also cites that Garland met with several John and Jane Doe's in the White House to plan a pretext to minimize the effect of parental mobilization, and the political impact such motivated parents could have on the upcoming midterm elections by using federal action against parents. The AFL letter also cites key dates in September 2021 where the Biden Administration concocted a plan -- an inside job -- to deter such a grassroots movement by parents by involving a third party's concocted complaint so that the Patriot Act could be used as a 'solution' to the pseudo-problem that they'd just created to advance their political agenda and stifle the speech of American citizens. Then, Americans' trust in the government and the media has dwindled. Perhaps it's because Sen Mitch McConnell agreed to the disastrous debt limit debacle. There would be no default on the U.S debt service yet frauds in the media are still reporting the exact opposite. Later, Biden's administration is made up of Marxists, and some unabashed bureaucrats even praise the former USSR and Marxian policies. Afterward, Rep. Brian Mast joins the show to discuss the ISIS-K suicide bomber, who killed 13 service members, was released from prison from Bagram Air Base on August 15.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
