  "description": "<p>We're on to part two of our series on the incredible life of the American backwoodsman, Daniel Boone. We’re going to dive deep into a topographic feature in the Appalachian Mountains that was a major player in the identity of Daniel Boone and America – we’re talking about the Cumberland Gap. We’ll interview two New York Times best-selling authors and Boone experts - Steven Rinella and Robert Morgan, we’ll nerd out with a geologist, we’ll talk about the potential of historical revision of Boone, and lastly, we’ll talk with a member of the Cherokee Nation, Professor Taylor Keen, and hear his perspective on the Ol’ Gap. The path is rough, and American identity is at stake.</p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
