  "description": "<p>The Brothers Grimm! German folklorists Jacob and Wilhem Grimm collected a lot of strange, old, primarily Germanic tales back in the mid-19th century. Tales like Cinderella, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel and so many more. More than 200 stories that inspired countless future authors and artists. Stories that companies like Disney cleaned up and turned into highly profitable family-friendly movies. But the original stories, NOT that family friendly. Not by today's standards. Turns out we meatsacks have enjoyed a dark, violent, and just plain odd story for a lot longer than Timesuck has been around. Enjoy! </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
