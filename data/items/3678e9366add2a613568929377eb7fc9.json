  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is still out of the office, but calls into the show to chat with AJ and the boys about Scott Zolak's comments on Cam Newton allegedly dancing too much at practice, and if that's a cause for him not performing up to expectations, the news that Jameis is more than likely going to be the starting Quarterback for the Saints this year, and what that means for Taysom Hill moving forward, and all the different preseason action that we have this weekend as we lead into a dead week before the start of the NFL season. Joining the show is former NFL offensive lineman, host of The Ross Tucker Football Podcast, and color commentator for Philadelphia Eagles preseason games, Ross Tucker, to chat about what he's seen from the Eagles so far and what he thinks a realistic expectation for them is, his thoughts on Nick Sirianni, Jalen Hurts' development, and his thoughts on Jadeveon Clowney saying that guards aren't athletic and he wants to line up inside more (23:12-42:31). Later, Mike Wright of the Fantasy Footballers podcast joins the show to chat about sleepers, breakout players, who he thinks the best rookie will be, who he's picking #1, and everything else you need to know if you're going into a fantasy football draft in the next week or so (1:25:59-1:44:07).
