  "description": "<p>John Colapinto is a journalist, author and a staff writer at <em><a title=\"The New Yorker\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker\">The New Yorker</a></em>. In 2000, he wrote the <em><a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"New York Times\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times\">New York Times</a></em> bestseller <em>As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl</em>, which exposed the details of the <a title=\"David Reimer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer\">David Reimer</a> case, a boy who had undergone a sex change in infancy—a medical experiment long heralded as a success, but which was, in fact, a failure. In 2007, <em>The New Yorker</em> published John's <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/16/the-interpreter-2\">fantastic story</a> of his time in the Amazon with the Pirahã people and linguist Daniel Everett.
