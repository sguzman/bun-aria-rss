  "description": "Unlike many of the other early Christian texts, the Gospel of John emphasizes the name of the Father alongside the name of Jesus—why? One reason, says Joshua Coutts, is because of the significance of God’s name in the Old Testament book of Isaiah. Join us as we talk with Joshua Coutts about his recent publication, The Divine Name in the Gospel of John (Mohr Siebeck, 2017).\n\nJoshua Coutts is Assistant Professor of New Testament at Providence in Otterburne, Manitoba, Canada. He completed his PhD at the University of Edinburgh in 2016. Along with The Divine Name in the Gospel of John, he has published a number of articles in academic journals including Currents in Biblical Research and Scottish Bulletin of Evangelical Theology. Joshua has also taught at Regent College in Vancouver, Edinburgh Theological Seminary, Cornhill Training School in Glasgow, Prairie College in Alberta, and Evangelical Bible College in Zambia.\n\n\n\nMichael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
