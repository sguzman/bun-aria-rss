  "description": "This week, Glenn talks with Former CIA operative Félix Rodríguez, who participated in the historic manhunt to capture Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. Rodríguez who is a Cuban-American Vietnam veteran who fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion was recruited to train and lead a team to track down Guevara due to the fact that he had been instrumental in Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution. In this podcast, Felix gives a first-hand account of the capture and execution of the man whose image is still being appropriated as a counterculture fashion statement. He also provides great detail into the type of sick criminal that Guevara was as he not only killed many during his lifetime, but he greatly enjoyed it. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
