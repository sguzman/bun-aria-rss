  "description": "<p>When I was 7 years old, my cousins thought it would be funny to show me Nightmare on Elm Street, the horror film with Freddy Kreuger. I was afraid of the dark and being alone for many years after, with constant nightmare of someone coming to get me. To be honest, these types of fears haunted me for years and were perpetuated by other scary movies I felt pressured to watch in the media.</p> <p>In this episode, I discuss why I don’t watch scary, horror or psychologically disturbing films. I discuss how our minds don’t know the difference between what we are watching vs what we are in (hence why the porn industry is so big), how our thoughts become our beliefs which become our actions which become our realities and why the scenes from these movies/ shows will last in your subconscious for a lifetime.</p> <p>If you’ve been realizing that you just feel off after watching these movies/ shows and you haven’t been able to quite put it into words, this episode is for you. Share with anyone else who may benefit from ending the addiction to disturbing movies/ shows.</p> <p>Doors are opening back up for Dharma Coaching Institute to become a Certified Soul Purpose/ Spiritual Life Coach this Fall!
