  "description": "In the first week of our new series, The Paradox of Purpose we were posed with the question; “What is my purpose?” Pastor Charles spoke so powerfully about the difference between Purpose and Calling. If you have ever asked questions like, “Why am I here,” “What’s next,” and “What is my purpose,” this message is for you. Remember, God doesn’t want you to do things for Him, He just wants you to BE with Him. <br /><br />Join us for service online every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST). <br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
