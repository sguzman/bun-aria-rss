By ten, he was a torch bearer during the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. By twelve, he was officially employed in professional sports as a ballboy for the Cleveland Browns. And by 24 he would not only own his first professional sports organization — the Los Angeles Avengers Arena League football team — he was named Chairman of the entire league.</p><br><p>I've known Casey very casually for a couple years. What impresses me most isn't the success and accolades. Instead, it's how he consistently comports himself — with grounded self-awareness, honest humility, and a very present sense of what is most important in life.</p><p>This is a great exchange about Casey's remarkable life. It's a conversation about business, entrepreneurship and risk. It's about the indelible power of mentorship. It's about creating a legacy. But most of all, it's a conversation about that which is required to&nbsp;pursue a life of purpose and meaning.</p><p>I have tremendous respect for this amazing man. I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/app/playmusic?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Ik2a22yi44ypcky7h6vnjvran4e?t%3DThe_Rich_Roll_Podcast\" target=\"_blank\">GooglePlay</a></p><p>Check out Julie’s podcast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/divine-throughline/id1069738551?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">divine throughline</a></p><p>Thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p><p>Boll & Branch: The first honest and transparent bedding company that only uses sustainable and responsible methods of sourcing and manufacturing.
