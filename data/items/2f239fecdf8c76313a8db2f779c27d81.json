  "description": "A Slack vulnerability is disclosed and fixed. And this is not as seen on TV: a real NCIS investigation is likely to occupy real JAGs for some time to come, with implications for military and civilian cyber law. The US is moving rapidly on Huawei and its associated companies: it’s now much harder for US companies to do business with them, and there’s likely to be fallout in other countries as well. An exposed database affords an instructive case of responsible disclosure.  Joe Carrigan from JHU ISI on USB device encryption and best practices. Guest is Mike Kijewski from MedCrypt on security for new and legacy medical devices.\n For links to all of today's stories check our our CyberWire daily news brief:\n  https://thecyberwire.com/issues/issues2019/May/CyberWire_2019_05_17.html \n Support our show",
