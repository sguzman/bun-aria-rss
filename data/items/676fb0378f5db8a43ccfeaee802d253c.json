  "description": "<p>In this article, we introduce and discuss the notion of topological left\namenability in the general setting of semihypergroups. We acquire several\ncharacterizations of the same in terms of certain stationary, ergodic and\noperator algebraic properties of the associated measure algebra. Finally, we\ndiscuss and characterize topological amenability of its sub-semihypergroups in\nterms of (topological) invariance properties attained on the corresponding\nmeasure algebras of the parent semihypergroup.\n</p>",
