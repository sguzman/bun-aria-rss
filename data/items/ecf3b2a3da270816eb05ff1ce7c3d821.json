  "description": "According to our Kori Schake of IISS, a military term for a strategy document is a \"pony blanket.\" On this episode we do the unthinkable and discuss our \"strategies\" (and we use the term loosely) in the Americas at the moment--in Venezuela, on our border, with the countries of Central America and with some new regional leaders who are, let's face it, pretty awful. (You know who you are Jair and AMLO.). Join us as we spend a caliente episode south of the border with Kori, David Sanger of the New York Times and Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
