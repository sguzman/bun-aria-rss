  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents: A Tear In The Sky: Aliens Among Us with filmmaker Caroline Cory! </p>\n\n<p>\"A Tear in the Sky\" is a new documentary film which focuses on the UFO / UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). A team of military personnel, scientists and William Shatner attempt to re-capture, in real time, the US Navy “TicTac” UFOs and other space anomalies, using state-of-the-art, military-grade equipment and technology. What they find instead are thought-provoking clues into the true nature of the UFO phenomenon and the very fabric of our spacetime reality. </p>\n\n<p>The film has already won multiple awards and official selections for “Best Documentary” including The Malibu Film Festival, the London SciFi Film Festival, The Los Angeles Film Festival, The New York Film Awards and The New Media Film Festival. </p>\n\n<p>Watch the film here!  <a href=\"https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0014uCBuFnOi7qcYqqm_9INuZ3Ubqui-iOtcKhwkeUhMlClgbRsGd63EQ9beC6YFE730UZK7eHJnDGKXHCJYf5L7bT88b-AO2av__fALLtYmIZ3Q4nGRXsdrpgdIpdPInmuAKAswOk_0t92ZQJRsirAHA==&c=zrbSj2Q9SP-r23WHVXnD_fylqHiihw5zgSWx2M-TX4EhqCu2GZznUQ==&ch=bLOeVJoGc-tcI7ovRZ6WGdH-7f8RobAsrYthugjfXHUWB9b74t4Vaw==\">https://www.atearinthesky.com</a> </p>\n\n<p>Darkness Radio has partnered with the UFO Disclosure Symposium in late May!
