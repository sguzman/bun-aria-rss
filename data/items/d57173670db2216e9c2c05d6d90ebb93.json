But this is a lie, and a very nefarious one, and I’ll explain why. Also, the Supreme Court killed the vaccine mandate but some companies are enforcing them anyway. How should we respond? And a clip of Biden says that George Floyd’s death had a greater impact on the world than Martin Luther King’s death. He’s right, but not for the reason he thinks. Plus, a woman drives her car into a river by accident and then takes a selfie while the vehicle sinks below the surface. It is an image that perfectly encapsulates modern western culture. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
