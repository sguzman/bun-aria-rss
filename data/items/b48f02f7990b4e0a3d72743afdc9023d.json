  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DOJ has announced that the officer who shot Ashli Babbit will not be charged with a crime. In fact they won’t even tell us his name, or give us any other information. Today we are going to look closely at this case and try to figure out what happened, and why the woman died, and whether it was justified or not. Also Five Headlines including the Biden Administration has its feet held to the fire during the White House Press briefing over its abortion policies. That doesn’t happen every day. And CNN brings a trans athlete on the air to explain why men actually don’t have an advantage over women in sports. Plus, Biden’s UN Ambassador hates America.
