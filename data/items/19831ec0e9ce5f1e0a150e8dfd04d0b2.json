  "description": "<p><p>Week 17 Fastest 2 minutes. We recap every game starting with the instant classic in Seattle. Jameis makes history in the perfect fashion. The dolphins shocked the patriots and Phil Rivers made us cry. Our theory that Aaron Rodgers is strapped for cash and that's why he's so moody, Freddie Kitchens got fired and we already miss him. The Bears season ended, whatever. Christian McCaffrey appreciation. Jerry Jones is going to change some things but not himself, the Eagles win the NFC East and Carson Wentz fans can be proud. Will Doug Marrone get fired? Big Ben will be back and Derrick Henry is a beast. Recapping the college football semi-final and a quick rundown of all the weird bowl games. Who's back of the week.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
