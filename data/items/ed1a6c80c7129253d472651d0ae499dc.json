  "description": "Everyone thinks they know what happened at the Lincoln assassination… but do they? After 150 years, a multitude of unsolved mysteries and urban legends still surround the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Today's guest is Robert Hutchinson, author of the book \"What Really Happened: The Lincoln Assassination.\" He takes a new look at the case and explores what really happened at Ford’s Theatre on the night of April 14, 1865. In those final weeks of the Civil War, Washington was boiling over with animosity and recriminations.<br /><br />Among the questions Hutchinson explores are:<br />• Did the Confederacy have a hand in the assassination plot?<br />• Who were John Wilkes Booth’s secret accomplices, and why did he change the<br />plan from kidnapping to assassination?<br />• Why was it so easy for Booth to enter the president’s box at Ford’s Theatre?",
