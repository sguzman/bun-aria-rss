Embraced by 1960's counterculture for its ecological properties and spiritual sensibility, the brand soon found it's way into most natural foods markets across the United States.</p><p>David and his brother Michael eventually took stewardship of the family business, shepherding their grandfather's brand from counterculture cult status to mainstream embrace by growing revenues from&nbsp;$4 million in 1998 to over $111 million in 2017.</p><p>Along the way, David went to great lengths to respect, protect and ultimately deepen Emanuel's vision, cultivating a thriving and truly conscious capitalistic enterprise making socially & environmentally responsible products while successfully pursuing its broader mission to&nbsp;create a better world for ourselves and future generations.</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p>Environmental activist.
