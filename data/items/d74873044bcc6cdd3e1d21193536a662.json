  "description": "In the movie <em>Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul.,</em> a Southern Baptist megachurch has been rocked by a lurid scandal. The always delightful Regina Hall and Sterling K. Brown star as the first lady and pastor of the church, who must reopen their doors and woo back their former congregants.
