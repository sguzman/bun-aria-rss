  "title": "192 - Russian Hitman Alexander \"Superkiller\" Solonik",
  "description": "<p>Alexander Solonik, aka Alexander the Great aka Sasha the Macedonian aka The Superkiller was a legendary and mysterious Russian hitman in the 1980s and 90s who carried out contract killings primarily for the Orekhovskaya Russian Mafia group. <br /><br />His targets were generally the leaders of other criminal organizations, the hardest men to kill. Men other contract killers had tried and failed to kill. <br /><br />Today we talk about a man said to have fulfilled AT LEAST 43 murder contracts, including the assassinations of roughly thirty high-level mob bosses. He's the most infamous Russian mafia hitman ever. <br /><br />Get ready to meet the Russian real-life Chuck Norris, Steven Segal, and John Wick all rolled-in-one hitman - Alexander Solonik aka Alexander the Great aka Sacha the Macedonian aka the Superkiller. A Russian gangster who escaped from prisons and courtrooms multiple times in the 80s and 90s, killed scores of other gangsters in a variety of inventive hits, and even fought a dozen tough guys at once and beat them all down with a shovel in an epic prison brawl. We'll also learn a lot about Russia's \"wild 90s\" when the transition from communism to capitalism resulted in a massive influx of crime including the contract killings that made Solonik infamous. It's another action-packed true crime and Russian history episode, today, on Timesuck. <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>New standup special and album,</strong> <strong>Get Outta Here; Devil! out on Amazon, AppleTV, cable-on-demand, Spotify, iTunes, Pandora, and more. <br /><br /></strong>Check out Mo Mandel's new Discovery Channel show<strong> Small Town Throw Down!</strong></p>\n<p>We've <strong>donated $5,400</strong> this month to <strong>Penfed</strong>!
