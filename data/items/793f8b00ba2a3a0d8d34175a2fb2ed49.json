  "description": "<div>Happy Pride Month, Everyone! Now let's talk about a gay club kid who was super mean to people, became addicted to drugs, and murdered AND DISMEMBERED a fellow club-goer, shall we? Did I mention that he stuffed the body in a box LIVED WITH IT IN HIS APARTMENT FOR A WEEK, and then threw it into the Hudson River? No? Ugh, we'll get to it.Â <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Glory Daze follows the rise and fall of club kid Michael Alig. From his humble beginnings as busboy in 1984 to his eventual reign as King of New York City nightlife, to his (sweet deal of a) prison sentence for murder. And as if that wasn't enough, get ready for some bonkers cameos from Patricia Field, Michael Musto, and Amanda Lepore (In A Limo! For No Apparent Reason!)<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Looking for more TCO? </strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\"><strong>We're on Patreon</strong></a><strong>!
