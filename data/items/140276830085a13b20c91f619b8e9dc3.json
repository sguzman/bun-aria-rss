  "description": "Let's talk about the good, the bad, and the method of Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake, with his pretty cow eyes, that chameleon face of his, that breath control perfect for the stage... and elsewhere. From bleakly funny Donnie Darko to the heartbreaking tenderness of Brokeback Mountain to the intense Southpaw (and yes, even the atrocious Prince of Persia), Jake has always been one to watch. This week's Fanfic Wars may have broken one of us, so prepare yourselves, thirst buckets.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
