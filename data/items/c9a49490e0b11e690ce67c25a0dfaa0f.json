  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough to recap 3 compelling games from Saturday's Week 16 slate. The guys start by dissecting the 49ers last-second victory over the Rams (3:45) while taking a look at what has caused Los Angeles' Super Bowl hangover and if San Francisco is a real contender with the way they've been playing recently. Next, the Pick Six Superfriends analyze the Patriots division-clinching victory over the Bills (27:00) with a focus on Josh Allen and Buffalo's potential as well as the most complete performance from Tom Brady and New England this season. Finally, reaction to the Texans winning the AFC South by beating the Bucs (51:30) and why Jameis Winston continues to be the weirdest player to watch in the NFL.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
