You start to get rave reviews. You sell out your first printing. Then suddenly, all the momentum evaporates. You talk to the clerk at a bookstore and he tells you the publisher has just stopped resupplying them. Within months, what should have been a beloved bestseller, slips into obscurity. </p><p>Why? Well, according to your editor it’s because they’ve been sued by <em>Hitler</em> over the rights to Mein Kampf...and a US Federal Court sided with the Nazis.

It’s a good lesson for the rest of us: We can work really really hard on something. We can do everything right and more. And we can still get royally screwed.
