If that feels familiar, listen in for the steps to get out of self-sabotage and lean into success.</p> <p>Sabotage lives in many areas of life: dating, weight loss, relationships, and finances just to name a few.  But where does this come from?  Judy outlines 4 general drivers and factors that create self-sabotage. Listen in to learn which one you veer towards most and how to break free.</p> <p>One of the toughest aspects that drive self-sabotage, specifically in relationships, is a fear of vulnerability.  Through research, Judy has discovered the number one root cause of this fear and shares how she has helped others embrace vulnerability and view it as a strength, not a weakness.</p> <p>Judy has worked with a handful of professional athletes.  She found their ability to harness the practice of visualization and planning ahead is what makes major changes in the performance.  Learn tips on how to implement these practices into your own life and actionable ways to visualize your own success.</p> <p>How is your relationship with your thoughts?  Judy shares the three categories of thoughts and a very great way to manage the negative thoughts that pop up in your mind.
