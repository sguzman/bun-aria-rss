Cindy and Angelina also announce an encouraging <a href= \"https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-webinar-conference/\">Back to School online conference</a> coming up on August 26-29, 2019.</p> <p>In delving into “Araby,” Angelina talks about the history and development of the short story form. Cindy gives a little of her own background with reading James Joyce and why she loves his short stories. Angelina and Cindy also discuss the essential “Irishness” of this story and all the tales in <em>The Dubliners</em>. Angelina walks us through the story, highlighting the kinds of questions and things we should look for when reading closely. Themes discussed in this story include: blindness and sight, light and darkness, romanticism, religious devotion, the search for truth, money, courtly love, and the knight’s quest.</p> <h3><a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/\">Summer of the Short Story:</a></h3> <p>Ep 12: “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls” by G.

Deep depression settled on me under that electric glare While outside the lightsome poplars flanked the rose-beds in the square.  While outside the carefree children sported in the summer haze And released their inhibitions in a hundred different ways.
