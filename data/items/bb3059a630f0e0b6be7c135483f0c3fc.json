  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, it’s amazing that we have nearly full employment in our country. U.S unemployment is 3.7% and 4.25 and 5.5% for Hispanics and African Americans respectively. This is the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for these groups. In fact, the percentage for Black unemployment in 2009 was 14.8%. Despite the best efforts of the left within the media to stir up a story about an impending recession, as of today, there is no recession according to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Then, late-night comics have mocked President Trump for including Alabama on a hurricane chart that was displayed in the Oval Office, but it turns out CNN themselves included Alabama in a weather report during Don Lemon's program. Later, Andrea Mitchell from MSNBC interviewed former Secretary of Defense General James Mattis and consistently baited him to bad-mouth Trump, despite Mattis' differences on policies he did not take the bait. Afterward, Susan Rice is believed to have unmasked certain individuals and it's about time we get to the bottom of all of this.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
