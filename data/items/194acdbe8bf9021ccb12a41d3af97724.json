  "description": "<p>The following algorithm computes the Least squares solution || Ax -\nb|| subject to the equality constrain Bx = d. It's a classic algorithm\nthat can be implemented only using a QR decomposition and a least\nsquares solver. This implementation uses numpy and scipy. It makes use\nof the new linalg.solve_triangular function …</p>",
