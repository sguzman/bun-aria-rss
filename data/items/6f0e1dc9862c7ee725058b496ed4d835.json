  "description": "Media (except OutKick) ignores stories that go against their narrative, like young good guy with a gun shoots and kills scumbag Indiana mall shooter. \"Egregious poor decision making\": Nearly 400 cops gathered at Uvalde school before anyone did anything. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson joins Clay and Buck to answer the question no Democrat will: Can a man get pregnant? And his report from the southern border invasion and Biden's encouragement of illegal aliens, human trafficking and drug runners. Bidenflation continues to cripple the middle class. Manchin stands firm against Biden’s spending bill. Callers weigh in on the good guy with the gun story that Clay made sure they know about.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
