  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, what if the House holds an impeachment and nobody shows up? Almost nobody is watching these impeachment hearings, and it seems even the independents are turning on the democrats. The Democrats, like the Labour Party in the UK, have gone so far to the left, that moderate voters view them as radical, and they're sick and tired of them. This is why Boris Johnson beat Jeremy Corbyn in the UK. Voters are tired of AOC-type leftists destroying our economic and healthcare systems. In fact, AOC endorsed Corbyn so this loss is a loss for her as well. Now, these 31 so-called moderate Democrats in vulnerable districts are like chameleons when it comes to winning elections and will lie in order to win. Later, the Supreme Court decided to put all of the subpoena's on Trump's financial records on hold by issuing a stay. Afterward, Mitch McConnell is being encouraged by democrats to recuse himself from any impeachment trial involving Trump due to his previous discussions with the White House Counsel even though this doesn't violate any rules, and isn't unethical in any way.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
