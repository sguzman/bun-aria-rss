  "description": "<p>Chrystul Kizer was seventeen years old when she was arrested for allegedly killing the man who was sex trafficking her and who had used her to create images of child sex abuse. She is now fighting for her right to use the \"Affirmative Defense\" law to defend herself in court against charges of first degree intentional homicide and arson. The Wisconsin Supreme Court and prosecutors are debating the use of this defense which Jim breaks down for us. We talk about who this law was intended to protect, who the real victim is in this situation as well as the shocking details in Chrystul's case.&nbsp;</p><p>#ChrystulKizer</p><p>#WisconsinSupremeCourt</p><p>#AffirmativeDefense</p><p>*****PLEASE SUPPORT THE SPONSORS WHO MAKE THIS PODCAST POSSIBLE!*****</p><p>SMILE DIRECT CLUB - Lisa’s aligners have arrived and she is so excited to get started on a new smile.
