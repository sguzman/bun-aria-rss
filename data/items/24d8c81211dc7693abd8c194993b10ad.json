  "description": "We remember George Floyd as we approach the second anniversary of his murder. We'll speak with <em>Washington Post </em>reporters Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa. They argue that George Floyd's struggles in life reflect the challenges and pressures of institutional racism in the country. Their new book is <em>His Name is George Floyd</em>.<br/><br/>Also, we'll hear  about the Women's House of Detention, the  forgotten women's prison in Greenwich Village that played a role in the gay rights movement of the '60s, including the Stonewall Uprising. Angela Davis and Afeni Shakur, Tupac's mother, were incarcerated there. We'll talk with Hugh Ryan, whose new book is about what this prison tells us about queer history.<br/><br/>David Bianculli will review the new HBO documentary <em>George Carlin's American Dream</em>.",
