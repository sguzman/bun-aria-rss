  "description": "Marin Katusa, founder of Katusa Research, joins me for an interview you can’t afford to miss [30:10]. We discuss everything from gold… to uranium… to bitcoin. As always with Marin, it’s a wide-ranging interview… and he explains how to lower risk when investing in volatile sectors. In my educational segment, I break down why I’m more cautious today than I’ve been anytime in the last six years [1:12:22]. I’m not saying it’s time to sell everything and build a bunker… but it is time to lighten up your exposure. I tell you why... ------------------- P.S.
