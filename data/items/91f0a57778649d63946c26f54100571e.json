  "description": "<div>In the United States, we really aren’t as “united” as we might like to think that we are. Each state is subject to federal laws, but they also have a bit of flexibility when it comes to setting some of the laws that govern their territory.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>From state taxes to marijuana legalization, to gay marriage, each state has the flexibility to make adjustments to some of the rights that people have within their geographic location. In 2020 we saw just how important it was to live in a state-run by people with functioning brains.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>As the divide between states grows even wider, should we start to consider splitting up these formerly united states into their own jurisdictions in order to better serve their residents, or are we all stuck on this rapidly sinking ship?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Emergency Preparedness Food: </strong><a href=\"http://www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com/\">www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com</a> for $100 off a 4-week supply of food.<br>\n<strong>Chemical Free Body:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.chemicalfreebody.com/\">https://www.chemicalfreebody.com</a> and use promo code: <strong>MACRO</strong>\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Honey Colony:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.honeycolony.com/\">https://www.honeycolony.com</a> and use promo code: <strong>MACRO<br>\nC60 Purple Power: </strong><a href=\"https://c60purplepower.com/\">https://c60purplepower.com/<br>\n</a>Promo Code: <strong>MACRO</strong>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<strong>Coin Bit App:</strong> <a href=\"https://coinbitsapp.com/?ref=0SPP0gjuI68PjGU89wUv\">https://coinbitsapp.com/?ref=0SPP0gjuI68PjGU89wUv</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Macroaggressions Merch Store:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/stores/macroaggressions?ref_id=22530\">https://www.teepublic.com/stores/macroaggressions?ref_id=22530</a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<strong>Books:</strong><br>\n<strong>Controlled Demolition on Amazon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M21XKJ5\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M21XKJ5</a><br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a>\n</div>\n",
