  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Rich Valdes, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, fills in for Mark. Critical Race Theory and Critical Gender Theory are in our schools, and they are problems that are will not go away on their own. Now schools are trying to censor parents by having them sign an NDA to look at the curriculum. We have a weakened military because of people who joined in the Obama years just to get a sex change. The degree of wokeness in this country is destroying us from within. If nobody stands up to the bully, then the bad guy wins every time. We The People cannot be afraid to stand up to the bullies in Washington or in our local school boards. It’s not too late for any of us to stand up and sacrifice to preserve our liberty, just like Donald Trump running for President. Also, Attorney General Merrick Garland will not back down from calling parents domestic terrorists for standing up to their school boards. Senators John Cornyn, Tom Cotton, and Ted Cruz dug into Garland, despite Dick Durbin and Democrats lying about parental violence to protect Garland.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
