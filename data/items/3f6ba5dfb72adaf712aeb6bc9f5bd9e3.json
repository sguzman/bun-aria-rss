  "description": "<p>Fish is one of the most nutritious food sources on the planet, especially when it comes to protein. But I’m usually scared to eat it. That’s because some seafood is at risk for toxicity that can harm our health, not to mention certain aquaculture methods are contributing to declining populations and even the acidification of our oceans. It’s not all bad, but it is complex. There are several important things we should think about in order to reap the health benefits from fish and act as environmental stewards at the same time.&nbsp;</p><br><p>To better understand seafood I sat down to talk with Paul Greenberg for this week’s episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>.
