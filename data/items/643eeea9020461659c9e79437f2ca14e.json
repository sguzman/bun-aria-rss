  "content": "<p>This article summarizes the third day of the <a href=\"http://pamitc.org/iccv15/\">ICCV\n2015</a> conference, the International Conference on\nComputer Vision.\nA summary of the <a href=\"http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/blog/iccv-2015-day-1.html\">first day</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/blog/iccv-2015-day-2.html\">second day</a> is also available.</p>\n<h2>Interesting Papers</h2>\n<h3>Registering Images to Untextured Geometry Using Average Shading Gradients</h3>\n<p>By Tobias Ploetz and Stefan Roth.</p>\n<p>This work considers the difficult problem of aligning an untextured 3D surface\nto a real image of the same object, a challenging problem because of the\nabsence and presence of edges depending on texture and light.</p>\n<p>The authors propose an alignment procedure that uses efficiently computable\n<em>average shading gradient</em> images that capture expected visible edges due to\nshadows despite unknown light direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Plotz_Registering_Images_to_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Robust Nonrigid Registration by Convex Optimization</h3>\n<p>By Qifeng Chen and Vladlen Koltun.</p>\n<p>The authors consider the problem of aligning two 3D shapes to each other, where\neach shape may be corrupted by missing surfaces (non water-tight surfaces) and\nundergo severe nonrigid deformations.\nPrevious work has proposed to minimize a specific geodesic distortion measure\nover suitable classes of continuous transformations, however, this yields\ndifficult non-convex optimization problems.</p>\n<p>Because the distortion measure makes sense this work proposes a way to\napproximate while simultaneously convexifying the problem.  This is achieved by\nrepresenting the transformation nonparametrically through correspondences on\nrandomly sampled points.\nWhile the original problem was continuous and non-convex, now it is a discrete\nenergy minimization problem that can be approximately solved using a standard\nLP-based relaxation approach, where the authors use TRW-S.</p>\n<p>What is surprising is how much the results improve on benchmark data sets; the\nerror is reduced by a factor of three compared to strong baseline methods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Chen_Robust_Nonrigid_Registration_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\">Paper</a>.</p>",
