    "media:description": "Episode 20: August 31, 2022 - So many of us have that inner voice in our heads — the one telling us we’re imposters, that we’re not cut out for this, that we’ll never be able to catch up to the men in our industry. That voice is no stranger to women in investing, including Avante Capital Partners principal* Amanda Kim. She started her career in a finance role at Goldman Sachs before applying for a position as vice president at Avante.\n\nTune in with host Ann Terrell Dorsett as Amanda shares what it’s like to work in a completely women-led company and what it means to foster a diverse and welcoming workplace. Amanda also tells us why diversity is important, and offers her best tips for ensuring successful deals.\n\n*At the time of this recording, Amanda Kim held the position of vice president at Avante Capital Partners.\n\nFor more details, visit our webpage: https://www.mcguirewoods.com/deal-us-in\n\nVideos may include attorney advertising and aren’t legal advice/opinion.
