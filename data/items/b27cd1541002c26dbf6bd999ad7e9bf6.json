  "description": "<p>Stranded in a snow storm in a hotel room in DC, I cover Phenomenology, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty. Phenomenology is the study of subjective perception and Merleau-Ponty grounds perception in the body and in the \"flesh of the world\". How French is that? I also look at what it means to \"stay present\". It's the buzz phrase of the time, but how in the hell does anybody really do that? Also, what does this have to do with Pippi Longstocking? All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy...listen to my lunatic snowed-in ramblings. </p>\n",
