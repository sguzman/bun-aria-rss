  "description": "Just when we’ve overcome the horror of ghosts and monsters surrounding us but look up at the night sky, imagine if there is greater terror out there. What lies beyond us? Could we be their allies or are we their meat? We hear stories of sightings and disappearances. The more and more we explore out there the more we wonder if they’re already here.

And finally, the classic creepy pasta, A Gift of Mercy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
