  "description": "<p>The Anthropocene is the current geological age, in which human activity has profoundly shaped the planet and its biodiversity. On <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/anthropocene-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\">The Anthropocene Reviewed</a>, John Green rates different facets of the human-centered planet on a five-star scale. This week 99% Invisible is featuring two episodes of The Anthropocene Reviewed in which John Green dissects: pennies, the Piggly Wiggly grocery store chain, a 17,000-year-old cave painting, and the Taco Bell breakfast menu. Plus, Roman talks with John about the show, sports, and all the things we love now, but hated as teenagers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=28901&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">The Anthropocene Reviewed</a></p>\n<p>Subscribe to The Anthropocene Reviewed on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-anthropocene-reviewed/id1342003491\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://radiopublic.com/the-anthropocene-reviewed-Wk2ZOd\" target=\"_blank\">RadioPublic</a></p>\n",
