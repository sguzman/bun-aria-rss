  "description": "<p><p>Rising star Theo Von came by to chat with KFC and Feits about how he's sober (for now) and how Darryl Straberry helped him get there, why he also gave up porn but why he thinks guys at Barstool need to jerk off more, how women ruin birthdays, why we should all fear the Chinese, and what most people think of when they see his haircut. Catch him tonight (Mar 7) in Boston at the Chevalier Theater.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
