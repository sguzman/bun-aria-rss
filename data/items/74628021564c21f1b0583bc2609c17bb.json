  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump should shut down the government over the issue of the migrant caravan attempting to illegally enter the country at the U.S.-Mexico border. The only people who should be concerned about a shutdown are the Democrats. It’s time for a very thoughtful, compelling address to the nation in which the President explains to the American people that the Democrats simply will not help secure the border. And because the Democrats don’t take their equal responsibility of funding seriously he has to force this issue constitutionally and shut down the government. Plus, so many of our kids are leaving college confused and it’s, in part, because of Professor's like Michael Eric Dyson's race-baiting bigotry, and MSNBC has him on the air all the time. It’s these leftist professors that are teaching generation after generation to hate their own country. Later, Robert Mueller is back in the news this time pursuing Jerome Corsi for his alleged ties to Roger Stone and WikiLeaks. The media is desperately looking for a connection to bring down the President and the Executive Branch. Thas been a soft coup on the Trump Presidency from day one. Mueller is so desperate to get Paul Manafort to say something that might benefit his report so they keep pressing him. Mueller's job is to write an impeachment report, that's why the media protects him. But Trump hasn't done anything to be impeached. He hasn't even exerted executive privilege not even once to protect any of his records, not even once. Now they are fabricating stories that Manafort visited the President of Ecuador and this allegedly happened way before Manafort was even involved on the Trump Campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
