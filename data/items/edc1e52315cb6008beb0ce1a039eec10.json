  "description": "Today we are joined by Greg Larson, author of Clubbie: A Minor League Baseball Memoir (University of Nebraska, 2021). In Clubbie, Larson shares his unique perspective from his two-year stint as clubhouse attendant for the Aberdeen IronBirds, a Class A short-season affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. Larson’s starry-eyed perceptions about the game were quickly erased by the reality of a job that was time-consuming and thankless. Larson brings the reader into the minor-league clubhouse, showing how young baseball professionals are literally playing for their jobs on a day-to-day basis. As the clubhouse attendant, Larson was charged with doing laundry, making sure the players had food after the game, and keeping players supplied with equipment. He writes about the scams run by food concession officials, and also describes some of the ingenious ways he added to his own bank account. Players had to pay clubhouse dues on a limited salary, and while Larson made more than the players, broken bats, deals with beer distributors and other team staff members helped him survive. Larson spent a year living out of a converted equipment closet at Ripken Stadium to save on living expenses, and his observations are memorable. Larson’s vivid portraits of Alan Mills, Gary Allenson, Matt Merullo and Brian Graham — and himself — create a fascinating look at baseball from the bottom, looking up.\nBob D’Angelo earned his master’s degree in history from Southern New Hampshire University in May 2018.
