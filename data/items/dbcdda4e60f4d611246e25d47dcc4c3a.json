  "description": "<p>This week we are excited to welcome writer, actress and comedian Julie Klausner to the podcast, who you may know from her popular Hulu series \"Difficult People,\" her podcast DOUBLE THREAT with Tom Scharpling and/or her brand new podcast ASK JULIE! on the Forever Dog Plus Network. We discuss with Julie the many similarities between the films \"Singles\" and \"Reality Bites\" (including highlights from both soundtracks), dissect \"Empire Records\" and \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" (GWAR discussion included) and reminisce about the time Vanessa introduced Jonah to Eddie Vedder and he said Vanessa was cool. We also revisit one of the most dangerous toys of the nineties aka the Pogo Ball, and explore their unorthodox commercial campaign which for some reason featured a giant monster hand trying to destroy the universe? Then we round things out with our viral segment \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan?\" where we scan the Plain Dealer from a decade ago to find out what Clevelanders were complaining about, from smoking in casinos to extreme couponers. Unlike a Pogo Ball commute this podcast moves fast, so don't forget to don protective gear before listening. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
