  "description": "<p>Podcast 1312 with Ms. Pat</p>\n <p>Â </p>\n <p>Ms. Pat is a fantastic stand-up comedian that has had the craziest life you can imagine. Her stories are hard to believe and told with such honesty that I'm inspired by how brave she is. From her last conversation with Joe to this one she continues to amaze me. I really love her and how she's dealt with everything. Was an honor to review Ms. Pat..</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
