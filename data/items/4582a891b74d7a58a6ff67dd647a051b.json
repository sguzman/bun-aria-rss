  "description": "<p>The Joe Rogan Experience is perhaps the most&nbsp;popular podcast in the world—and it’s been at the center of a weeks-long controversy over COVID misinformation and content moderation.&nbsp;After Rogan invited on a guest who told falsehoods about the safety of COVID vaccines, outrage mounted toward Spotify, the podcasting and music streaming company that recently signed an exclusive deal with Rogan to distribute his show. Spotify came under pressure to intervene, as nearly 300 experts sent the company a <a href=\"https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> demanding it take action, and musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their music from Spotify’s streaming service.

She’s broken news on Spotify’s content guidelines and Spotify CEO’s Daniel Ek’s comments to the company’s staff, and we couldn’t think of a better person to talk to about this slow-moving disaster. How has Spotify responded to the complaints over Rogan, and what does that tell us about how the company is thinking about its responsibilities in curating content?
