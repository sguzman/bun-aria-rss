  "description": "This week we read A Shade of Vampire by Bella Forrest! Or, as we’re calling it, 50 Shades of Twilight: A Tale of Teenage Stockholm Syndrome. Full disclosure, we didn’t necessarily *like* this book, but we cannot wait to give you a hilarious after-school special about why we didn’t. We present a *very special episode* about what the kids are reading these days. \n Self Love Recommendations: \n - Watch Big Little Lies on HBO or something else where talented people are slaying the game. \n - Listen to the last 15 minutes of The Ringer's Binge Mode. In the final episode there's a beautiful oration about not being ashamed for your interests and escapism. Plus, best friends gush about each other, which you know we LOVE! \n Episode Notes: \n If you like excellent vampire tales, be sure to check out American Vampire wherever you get your comics! Scott Snyder is the main writer and they've had arcs with Stephen King and more. \n And quick *CORRECTION* from this episode, \"women in refrigerators\" or \"getting refrigerated\" began in the 90's with Green LANTERN, not Green Arrow. Either way, I think we can all agree that ladies should be fully formed characters instead of merely plot devices, right? Thank goodness even mainstream comics have seen the light since then!  \n  \nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
