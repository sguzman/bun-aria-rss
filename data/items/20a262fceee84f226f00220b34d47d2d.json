  "title": "PMS 2.0 148 - 1st Show Of The New Decade. Darius Butler, A Rather Large Announcement, & Some Life Talk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss what they did on New Years Eve, and try to get to the bottom of the people who go to New York and stand in Times Square to see the ball drop live, and discuss whether or not Steve Harvey and Gronk hate each other. Pat also dives into the coaching carousel and starts to have some second thoughts on whether or not Jason Garrett will actually be let go by the Cowboys, after he's survived multiple meetings with Jerry Jones. Joining the show is former 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots, Defensive Back with the Indianapolis Colts, Pat's former teammate, one of the smoothest athletes to ever walk the planet and host of the Everything DB Show, Darius Butler. He and Pat chat about some of the different intricacies of playing defensive back in the NFL, including how infuriating it is when commentator's misidentify who blew a coverage, why certain DB's enjoy wearing certain color gloves, which WR's gave him the most trouble during his 9 year career, and Darius and Pat go through each NFL playoff game this weekend and give their thoughts on who they like and why (22:26-44:13). Also included is some notable news with Nick that covers the US Government banning soldiers from using Tik Tok, fireworks being replaced by drones for celebrations, and a few other news items that are making waves throughout the world. Lastly, the saga of Foxy trying to add some money to the 2020 accountability bank by hitting an NBA 3 during the show, and suffice to say, it did not go as expected. Don't forget that \"Pat McAfee: Professional Baseball Player,\" is now available for free at youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow. If you haven't yet, check out the best comedic sports documentary that has ever been made. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
