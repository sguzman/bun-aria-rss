  "description": "Our audiobook teaser this week is Wicked Embrace by Olivia Boothe\n\nNarrated by Tim Paige & Kelsey Navarro\n\nI wanted one thing—to never fall in love again. But the universe had other plans. One look into Tom Wright’s olive-green eyes, and I free-fell crazy in love with the one man destined to break my heart. I know, because I’ve yet to learn my lesson. The past never dies, and mine is ready to rear its ugly head. Question is, will I be strong enough to survive the fallout?\n\nShe wasn’t supposed to happen. I’d vowed to never let anyone in, but with one curve of her lips, Sara Hart bulldozed through my heart. I’m happier than I’ve ever been yet scared as hell of how much I love her. Despite my best intentions, I haven’t been one-hundred percent honest. My biggest torment still lurks within, threatening to unwind the strings holding us together. And if I lose her now, it might as well be the end of me.\n\nGet the eBook or Audio right now » https://bit.ly/2LynKwW \n\nMore Olivia Boothe Books\nWicked Dance » https://bit.ly/36XIDJn\nEternally Yours » https://amzn.to/3q76zSn\n\nOther Books Mentioned\nThe Redemption by Nikkie Sloane » https://amzn.to/3jCWV7E\nV Card Sweetheart by Hope Ford » https://amzn.to/3d9MPKj\nFinding You Again by Reese Hart » https://amzn.to/36ZwWSx\nMoxie by Jennifer Mathieu » https://amzn.to/3p5FtK6\nTattooed Sweetheart by Jenika Snow » https://amzn.to/3rB9jHW\nThe Bachelor Cowboy by Jessica Clare » https://amzn.to/2Z4Mtfs\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
