  "description": "On this election special report, the way we win is if it's a quiet, massive turnout of voters that the pollsters are missing, they still have conservative Republicans slightly behind. I think they're wrong, but the point is we have to prove them wrong. The goal now is with about three weeks left, is for you to think for yourselves at the dinner table, at the breakfast table with your spouse if you have one, \"What can I do to make sure we win this election?\" But is that enough? You look at the states that have strong Republican governors like Florida, like South Dakota, like Texas, and some of the other states. They lay the law down or they try to. You look in Virginia, you got young and elected governor. The problem is he doesn't have enough Republicans, but they're doing their best. The key to this election is to look at the issues that matter, and how you can do your part to fix them. The Republican Party actually has a grand history. The truth about the Republican party. They really came into being not under Jefferson, but in the 1850s as an anti-slavery party. The Republican party is imperfect because people are imperfect. The Republican party today, particularly on the Senate side, is led by individuals who have no guts, who've been in Washington for decades, and who like the swamp, they just want to control it and they don't wanna stir the pot for liberty. They just want to sip at the pot. This election means everything. It means nothing. It means everything because we have to win it. But it means nothing if we win it and we don't follow through and do the things that need to be done to take our country back.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
