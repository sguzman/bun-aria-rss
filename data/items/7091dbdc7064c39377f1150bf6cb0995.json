  "description": "Our guest today is Charlotte-based interior designer, Gray Walker, of Gray Walker Interiors. She’s a 20 year industry veteran known for her feminine design that mixes both modern and antique elements. Her work has been featured in publications such as Traditional Home, House Beautiful, Southern Living, and many more. Gray shares tips on how she manages to create a fresh look while showcasing heirloom pieces, where she makes bold choices, her love of outdoor lighting, and more.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nWhen did Gray first know she wanted to be an interior designer?\n\nHow does Gray begin the discovery process for her clients?\n\nHow is Gray’s home decorated and what is her current home project?\n\nWhat is Gray’s philosophy and approach to using colors throughout the house?\n\nThe importance of outdoor lighting.\n\nHow Gray uses upholstered doors and where to get one.\n\nWhere does Gray like to take risks in decorating?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Bethany,\n\nI think you could do the quartzite countertops like in the kitchen or choose a marble where the stone color pulls from the adjacent room. I would definitely extend the cabinets all the way to the ceiling. In terms of paint, I wouldn’t use 3 colors. For the cabinet exterior would use a different finish of paint, maybe in a high gloss, that matches the wall color. For the inside of the cabinet, I would pull a soft color from the quartzite. You could also change the hardware and go for longer pulls on the uppers and/or consider centering the hardware on the lower cabinets and drawers. I would also mirror the backsplash--like use actual mirrors--that can extend the look you have from your Ballard mirror! You could definitely use some softness like a rug or curtains. The rug should match the interior color of the cabinets. And you need a WAY bigger chandelier. Think massive! Let’s add some lamps on that back buffet, too.\n\nWe aren’t sure exactly where you live, but that view! You have a beautiful space. Good luck, Bethany, and we’re so glad you found us!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nGray Walker Interiors\nGray Walker Interiors on Instagram\nKate’s House\n“Outdoor Lighting Ideas to Make Your Yard Look Like a Luxury Resort” -The Wallstreet Journal",
