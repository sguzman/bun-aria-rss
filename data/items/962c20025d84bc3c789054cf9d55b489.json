  "description": "\"Some people stand in the darkness, afraid to step into the light...\" Former lifeguard Charlotte Leslie was the MP for Bristol North West for 7 years and shares a series of brilliant insights about life and politics, including how the laws of the beach apply to handling the coronavirus pandemic. Charlotte went from increasing her majority in 2015 to losing the seat two years later. This is a great, personal and honest account of what it's like to be removed from office in your prime, the brutality of democracy and how you can still have a political impact outside of Parliament. Oh and a very important lesson about the best way to film inside a fetish club...
