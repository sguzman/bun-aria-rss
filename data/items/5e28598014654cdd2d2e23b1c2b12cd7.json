  "description": "<p>By introducing the modulus of continuity, we first establish the\ncorresponding cross-ratio distortion estimates under $ C^2 $ smoothness, and\nfurther give a Denjoy-type inequality, which is almost optimal in dealing with\ncircle diffeomorphisms. The latter plays a prominent role in the study of $ C^1\n$ conjugacy to irrational rotations. We also give the explicit integrability\ncorrelation between continuity and irrationality for the first time. Further\nthe regularity of the conjugation is also considered and proved to be sharp.\n</p>",
