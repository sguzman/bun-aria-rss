  "description": "This week, the gals team up with Em and Christine from And That's Why We Drink to investigate some stories of serious transitions. Topics include the psychology behind \"ugly ducklings,\" a young model with a badass talent, and a ridiculous theory from the so-called no-spin zone. Pour yourself a glass of Winc's QTY Pinot Noir, update your profile pic, and tune in for Glow Up Crimes.",
