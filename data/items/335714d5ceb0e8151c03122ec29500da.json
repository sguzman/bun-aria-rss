  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the media continues to promote the president's call with the Ukrainian President as nefarious and is smearing this program in the process. Present-day social activists continue staging pseudo-events and passing it off as news. There is no diversity of thought on the mainstream cable channels, they simply follow pack journalism. Newsrooms need to deal with objective truth and fact and they don't. Then, after two spies were inserted into the Trump campaign, we now have, in effect, a third spy who has infiltrated the White House under the guise of a whistleblower. A whistleblower that CBS's \"60 Minutes\" falsely said was in federal protection even though he isn't and the whistleblower's lawyer had to issue a statement correcting the media who was wrong, yet again. Later, the weak and pathetic Sen. Chuck Grassley, sides with the whistleblower. This whistleblower is getting so many rights you'd think he was an illegal alien. Afterward, the credibility of the term \"urgent concern\" as it relates to first-hand whistleblower accounts versus second-hand hearsay accounts. The suspicious timing of this change in the whistleblower rules continues to be scrutinized as more facts become clear. Speaker Nancy Pelosi must be challenged to uphold the norms and traditions of an impeachment inquiry and Leader McConnell needs to be creative in holding her to account.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
