  "description": "<p>Being Truthful (2017-02-15) - The grounds of happiness, loving relationships and a just and flourishing society is honesty. And yet our current times are characterized by a plethora of deception - both societally, and often in more subtle ways, in our personal lives. This talk examines the deep conditioning we have to deceive others, and to avoid facing and acknowledging our own vulnerability. We then explore how we can commit ourselves to deepening our truth telling, and in so doing, creating a climate of integrity and trust that can lead to a more compassionate world.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p> <p> </p>",
