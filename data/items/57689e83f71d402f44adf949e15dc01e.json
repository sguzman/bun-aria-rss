  "description": "In September of 2006, a grisly murder scene was uncovered in a picturesque farmhouse bed & breakfast in rural Maine. Four people, including the innkeeper and her daughter, were murdered and dismembered by the young cook who lived there, shocking the small town and the entire region. This is the story Julie Bullard, Selby Bullard, Cynthia Beatson, and Jimmy Whitehurst, and it’s also the story of the Maine Bed & Breakfast Killer.\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\n﻿1.
