  "description": "<p><p>Mitchell Tenpenny (1:00:36) gives us a definitive answer on if Lil Nas X is country music, his thoughts on Billy Ray Cyrus, Taylor Swift, and whether or not he washes his legs. KFC is back from Memorial Day Weekend with no stories to tell except his hatred for parades, fireworks and umbrellas. Intern Josh gives us the Ten Croc Commandments. Voicemails include: what is the Dewey Decimal sytem, paid your friends off, ass soap, and senior pranks.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
