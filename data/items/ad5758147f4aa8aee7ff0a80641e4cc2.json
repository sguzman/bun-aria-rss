  "description": "<p>“...A part of the point of the book was to not shy away from what we shy away from in real life. And one of the things we shy away from in real life is admitting for exactly how long we are a mess and don't know what we're doing.”</p> <p>From her classic essay collections, including <em>I Was Told There Would Be Cake</em> through her last bestselling novel, <em>The Clasp</em>, Sloane Crosley keeps us entertained with her trademark wit, voice and gimlet eye.
