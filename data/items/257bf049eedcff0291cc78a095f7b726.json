Needless to say, all hell broke loose when he ran into the building firing blanks at unsuspecting workers & he’s now facing terrosim charges\n\nROUND 2: Colin Obrady has 10 world records to his name. One of those is being the first person to solo trek across all of Antartica. He joins the show to talk his feats and his challenge to the listener. \n\nROUND 3- Because Colin has such a rare accomplishment, we found other top adventure stories and we are gonna see if it is more impressive or less impressive than Colin’s story. \n\nRound 4: Vladimir Putin offers Russian mothers $16K cash bonus if they have a certain number of children. \n\nSUPPORT THE SHOW!\n\nWhistlePig Whiskey\t\n- Get your bottle at https://barstool.link/WPZBT or at a local retailer.\n\nRocky Boots\t\n- Go to https://barstool.link/RockyBootsBSS and enter the code ZBT at check out for 25% off your next pair of boots.\n\nCross Country Mortgage\t\n- Go to https://barstool.link/crosscountrymortgageBSS so CrossCountry Mortgage can take care of you through the buying process</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
