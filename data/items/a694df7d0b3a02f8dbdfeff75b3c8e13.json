This week, Connor and Dan take a trip to the far east to learn all about this slightly obscure ancient thinker who was all about looking for Number One and never plucking your eyebrows (or something like that, it definitely has to do with hair). Also, if you're a history buff, this episode includes an incredibly truncated version of 2,000 years of Chinese history. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
