  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, there is a culture of loyalty within the Democrat Party that doesn't exist in the Republican Party. There hasn't been a single book written by a former Democrat staffer in the White House that has ever trashed their former Commander-in-Chief. However, the kiss-and-tell culture of disloyalty abounds in Republican circles. Not only are they disloyal but they leak information, embellish, and attack their former boss(es) for the sake of self-aggrandizement, power, fame, and a pay-day. This shows a true lack of character on the part of former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and others conducting themselves similarly. Then, you don't get to ignore your oath and define statutes as you please, but the DOJ is now investigating the Texas State law enforcement effort known as Operation Lone Star which operates near the border with Mexico for racial/ethnic profiling. Everything that the Marxists in the Democrat Party do is to make their power more permanent. Is this Administration securing our country or securing the business of the drug cartels? How many more women need to get raped? How many more children need to be abused? Biden's oversight of the border is a disaster. Later, President Biden's recent sale of oil from America's strategic petroleum reserve was sold to a company wholly owned by the Chinese Communist Party. Biden claims this was done to combat 'Putin's price hike.' Afterward, Julie Kelly joins the show with an update on Rep. Adam Schiff's plans to use the Posse Comitatus act to shield information obtained by the January 6th Committee by excluding information obtained by the U.S military. Kelly questions why Democrats would want to exclude any evidence on any matter if they are in search of the truth? \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
