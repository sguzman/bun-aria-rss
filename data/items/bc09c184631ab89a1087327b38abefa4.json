This has both major health and economic consequences. Every year we spend 50 billion dollars and lose 23 million IQ points to lead toxicity alone, which affects people of color the most, regardless of social class and income level. And you may be surprised to learn that there are many government policies and even sanctioned decisions to dump toxins that end up poisoning communities of color and stealing children’s cognition and health.</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman sat down with Harriet Washington to discuss how we are ignoring this massive health crisis and what can be done to fix it.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Harriet A. Washington has been the Shearing Fellow at the University of Nevada’s Black Mountain Institute, a Research Fellow in Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School, a senior research scholar at the National Center for Bioethics at Tuskegee University, and a visiting scholar at DePaul University College of Law.
