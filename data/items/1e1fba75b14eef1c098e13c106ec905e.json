Tone-deaf Biden Regime schedules celebration of \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" Clay says, \"Imagine the audacity of having a celebration today on the day where we're setting records in the cost increases in many different products out there.\" There's only one way to vote in November to stop Biden's disastrous policies, which are making inflation worse.

This is now just a machinery of mass vaccination that there's billions and billions of dollars attached on.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
