  "description": "This week’s guest on How To Fail with Elizabeth Day is memoirist, podcaster and journalist Dolly Alderton. Dolly, the co-host of the utterly fantastic The High Low podcast and author of the brilliant Sunday Times bestseller Everything I Know About Love, talks about being rejected from Bristol University (and still feeling resentful of anyone she meets who went there), being ‘compassionately’ fired from a job she didn’t really want and what happens when you don’t meet the love of your life, even when you think you’re going to. <br /><br />Along the way, we talk about the horror of being a teenager, internalised misogyny, the pressure for women to look good (‘I try very hard to remember that I’m not disappointing anyone if I don’t look perfect,’ says Dolly), sensitivity, people-pleasing, narcissism, discomfort zones, the brilliance of female friends and why it’s sometimes good to have a thin skin.<br /><br />We also discuss Made in Chelsea (Dolly used to be a story producer) and her efforts to invent a new game show, where you would win your dream home but it wouldn’t have any doors. Sounds amazing. Not sure why it never got commissioned.<br /><br />Note: this episode contains the phrase ‘absolute rotters’ used in a non-ironic way.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />How To Fail is hosted by Elizabeth Day and produced by Chris Sharp <br /><br /> <br /><br />How To Fail is sponsored by Moorish<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br /> <br /><br />Elizabeth Day @elizabday<br /><br /> <br /><br />Dolly Alderton @dollyalderton<br /><br /> <br /><br />The High Low @thehighlowshow<br /><br /> <br /><br />Moorish @moorishhumous",
