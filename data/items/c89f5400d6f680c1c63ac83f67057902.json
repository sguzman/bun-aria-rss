  "description": "Adam and Drew open the show continuing their discussion about death, the death of math and the death of facts. They also discuss the built in 'fear gear' that humans have built into themselves as a means of self preservation and how the current state of news media is over exercising that gear to an extreme degree leading to much more fear.  They also examine a new PSA that was put out by HBO regarding the pandemic and give their thoughts on why they consider it a terrible and possibly even dangerous message. \n\nTHANKS TO TODAY'S SPONSORS:\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM2\nGeico.com",
