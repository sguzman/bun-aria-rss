  "description": "<p>Do you remember the last time everyone united behind the same idea, on an international scale? It's only happened twice: when the Nazis lost WWII and when Julia Roberst won her Oscar for the inarguable best biopic of all time, \"Erin Brockovich.\" Why don't you listen to this episode and chime in on what your parenting style is/would be as they compare to Matt and Bow's distinct approaches. Were your parents strict and did you not give a shit? Interesting. After some discussion of the Oscars as The Academy, the boys play some new, challenging rounds of MFK with queens of the screen, and Matt's Kate Hudson impression leads him to a potentially iconic webseries idea. Yes, you heard that right, honey, no need for a q-tip, sweetheart.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
