  "description": "<div>Economic orthodoxy argues that the more connected two countries are, the less likely it is for conflict to arise. However, economic theory is starting to change regarding this premise.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/author/guntram-b-wolff/\">Guntram Wolff</a> is joined by <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/author/mark-leonard/\">Mark Leonard</a>, director of the European Council of Foreign Relations, to discuss his new book: The Age of Unpeace: how connectivity causes conflict. In his new book, Leonard argues a rather new and unique point: living in a globalised world creates new vulnerabilities due to this interconnection, and thus gives rise to unpeace. Guntram and Leonard explore how connectivity has caused fragmentation, the concept of unpeace, how we've gotten here, and what the EU should do moving forward.</div>\n",
