  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “The Manager and the Salesman.” Sabre CEO Jo Bennett, played by the Kathy Bates, visits Dunder Mifflin only to discover there are two co-managers, Michael and Jim. She gives them the ultimatum that there can only be one manager. Meanwhile it’s Valentine’s Day and Andy confuses Erin by giving Valentine’s Day cards to everyone in the office, including a pretty romantic one to Kelly. Fans send in some great continuity catches, Jenna shares how the cast and crew worked with the two Great Danes, including a particularly invasive stunt with Ed Helms, and Angela makes beet vodka in honor of Dwight.
