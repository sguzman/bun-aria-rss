  "description": "<p>We consider the problem of sequentially maximising an unknown function over a\nset of actions while ensuring that every sampled point has a function value\nbelow a given safety threshold. We model the function using kernel-based and\nGaussian process methods, while differing from previous works in our assumption\nthat the function is monotonically increasing with respect to a safety\nvariable. This assumption is motivated by various practical applications such\nas adaptive clinical trial design and robotics. Taking inspiration from the\nGP-UCB and SafeOpt algorithms, we propose an algorithm, monotone safe UCB\n(M-SafeUCB) for this task. We show that M-SafeUCB enjoys theoretical guarantees\nin terms of safety, a suitably-defined regret notion, and approximately finding\nthe entire safe boundary. In addition, we illustrate that the monotonicity\nassumption yields significant benefits in terms of both the guarantees obtained\nand the algorithmic simplicity. We support our theoretical findings by\nperforming empirical evaluations on a variety of functions.\n</p>",
