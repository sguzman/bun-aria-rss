  "description": "A popular, outgoing liberal mayor in Silicon Valley is taking on gun rights groups with a splashy municipal ordinance fashioned to curb gun violence—and be the first of its kind. Gun rights groups are foretelling doom for the new law, and the NRA called it a “ridiculous publicity stunt.” \n\nDoes this city’s initiative have the hallmarks of a breakthrough on gun violence prevention? Will lawsuits tank it before anyone has the chance to find out?\n\nGuest: Sam Liccardo, mayor of San Jose, California.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
