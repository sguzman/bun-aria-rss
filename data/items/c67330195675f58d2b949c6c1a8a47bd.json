  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Keep the questions coming! Last week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), otherwise known as the inflation rate, posted its largest gain in nearly four years - crushing expectations. And as Fed Chairman, Janet Yellen, has already promised, an interest rate hike is just around the corner. Investors everywhere are ramping up for this massive macroeconomic change. But what does this mean for gold? With mild inflationary trends and expected growth in the dollar… almost everyone is expecting the price of the yellow metal to drop. But I can’t say I agree… Then, taking my focus overseas, I talk about China’s massive real estate bubble. And highlight the best ways for investors to position themselves around the crisis. Get your pens ready as I give listeners a list of ETF’s to pay close attention to. Today’s show also covers one of the biggest topics addressed in this past election (republican or democrat) - American Infrastructure. As you’ll hear, the infrastructure trend is for real. And as far as President Trump’s lengthy promised to-do-list, I expect infrastructure changes to lead the way. Good new for investors - there are a ton of stocks still in the sector that are relatively cheap in comparison to the S&P500. Tune in as I explain why it’s time to start placing your bets… And finally, to end the episode, I bring a few stocks under the microscope. This includes some of the top companies in the US that paying the highest tax rates. The stocks are CVS Pharmacy, KMI, and General Electric. As always, thanks for tuning in and good investing, Frank Curzio PS - For those not familiar... I host my Frankly Speaking podcast every Friday. And unlike my Wall Street Unplugged podcast (I host every Wednesday), I use this show to answer my favorite subscriber questions I receive on my email. The goal is to help educate, advise, and guide listeners through all the noise surrounding the financial industry. If you have any questions and want a chance to be mentioned on this podcast - simply email me at . Also, be sure to put “Frankly Speaking” in the subject line.  Thank you for the continued support!",
