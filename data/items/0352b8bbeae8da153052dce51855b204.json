  "title": "How to Sell More Art with Nicholas Wilton [44]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we welcome a special guest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nicholas Wilton is a Californian painter who also runs a successful online art course called The Creative Visionary Program (a course both Alice and Louise have taken in the past). Nicholas has an unusual take on the age-old topic of selling art &nbsp;- and it's one that might surprise you. In this special conversation, we discuss his counter-intuitive ideas (such as the fact that the more unique your art becomes, the more others can relate to it); share our own art-making processes; discuss the value of working in a series; and consider the role intuition plays in our creative process.</p>\n<p>We also touch on the power of found materials, and learn about the profound changes that Nick and Alice are experiencing in their work. This is a conversation that is sure to energise and inspire you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is also the last week to join our exciting end-of-year event which started in Monday. “Your Best Art Year Ever” is an interactive live 5-day event during which we are sharing our approach to planning for success. There will be chat, laughs, sound advice, a chance to ask questions, and even a few free downloads so that you can plan your own “best art year ever.” You can join the Facebook group now and catch up with anything you missed.
