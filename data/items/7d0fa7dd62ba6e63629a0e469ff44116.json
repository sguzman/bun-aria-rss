  "title": "PMS 2.0 312 - OVERREACTION MONDAY, Week 14 NFL Recap, Michael Lombardi, Mark Madden, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened this weekend in the NFL including Jalen Hurts leading the Eagles to a win over the Saints, if the Packers defense/special teams will be good enough to give them a shot of going to the Super Bowl, whether or not the Steelers are DEAD, and much more. Joining the show is 3x Super Bowl Champion, former GM of the Cleveland Browns, host of the GM Shuffle Pod, co-host of HammerDAHN, and author, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Michael chat about the Saints disappointing performance against the Eagles, who he thinks has the best chance of taking down the Chiefs in the AFC, what's wrong with the Steelers, and if the Packers can make a Super Bowl run (20:32-40:31). Next, Pittsburgh radio legend, former WCW color commentator, and friend of the program, The Super Genius, Mark Madden joins the program to chat about what's wrong with the Steelers, the temperature in Pittsburgh, his thoughts on JuJu dancing on the Bills logo, why he's concerned about Big Ben, and much more (42:43-55:56). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk look back at everything we learned in week 14 of the NFL, if the Seahawks are fixed, the Giants apparently stinking again, the Washington Football Team being someone no team wants to play in the playoffs, and Derrick Henry running all over Jacksonville, plus they look ahead to tonight's Monday Night Football game between the Browns and Ravens and give their picks (55:58-1:37:11). Make sure you subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow and listen every day on Mad Dog Radio, Sirius XM Channel 82. We appreciate you all for listening, come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
