  "description": "<p>LET’S PARTY! A financial festivus is in order here at the end of the year and we’re excited to share a bunch of listener wins from the How to Money community. Unfortunately at times we can be overly driven to the point that we fail to celebrate milestones. And when we achieve something great and move right on from it, we lose something in the process. Celebrations improve our well-being, they’re fun, and can provide inspiration for others. So during this episode we share a couple of our personal money wins, but then we have a chance to hear from listeners who have paid down credit card debt, massively boosted their savings rate, purchased their first home, started house hacking for the first time, taken their side hustle full-time, invested insane amounts of money, & more. Thank you to everyone who shared their money wins and we’re excited about what 2022 has in store for the HTM community!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut PM Dawn Trillium Brewing - a big thanks to Ali for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
