  "description": "<p>In the parable of the weeds, we see Jesus depicting a cosmic truth about the kingdom of God in a very concrete way. Jesus shows us that to enter the kingdom of God, you must make Jesus your king—you must obey the one who saved you. The parable also shows us we must have patient diligence, and be careful to be neither too zealous nor too passive.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 9, 2008. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1992). Scripture: Matthew 13:24-30; 36-46.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
