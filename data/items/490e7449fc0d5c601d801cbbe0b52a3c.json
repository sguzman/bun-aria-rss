They discuss how to best reframe holiness, from a word that conjures up stiff, uptight religion (like SNL's Church Lady), to a word that excites and inspires people with the possibility of living a transcendent and abundant life.</p>\n<p>Finally, (20:01-end) the guys talk about why we often stand in awe when we meet celebrities and some words that could be used as synonyms instead of holiness.  They also ask what does living spellbound or enchanted with God's spirit look like?</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong><br />\nOur theme video on Holiness:  INSERT LINK<br />\nSubscribe here and get an update when our workbook on Holiness will become available:  INSERT LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Music Credits:</strong><br />\nDefender Instrumental : Rosasharn Music<br />\nHeal My Sorrows : Greyflood<br />\nWhere Peace and Rest Are Found : Greyflood</p>\n",
