I fell in love with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/79HbBkVgOVUuVhuTJ50pIx?si=eT9morW7R_mwwXZqZjYPOg\">Teenage Wrist</a> in 2018 when they dropped their first LP called \"Chrome Neon Jesus\" on my unsuspecting ears and it's this weird combo of Failure/Hum/Hoobastank (no joking) but simply put it just rocks. They just dropped a new heater called \"Earth Is A Black Hole\" and I had to have someone in the band on the show. Cue Marshall Gallagher and we dive deep into the bands history, his life on the road with 3OH3! (yes, that one) and growing up in the Denver suburbs. Even if you've never heard the band, you will find something to enjoy in this discussion.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
