  "description": "Spoke to the witness who took the video and he has agreed to come on the show. A listener writes “Hey everyone, So, I wanted to share my video with y’all , that I took a few Saturdays ago on 7/24. <p>First of all, I wanted to tell you a little about myself. I’m a pastor of a small country church for the past 15 years and I’m also the lead vocalist for a Christian rock band called: Stained Red.</p> <p>I live in Royse City Texas and The morning of the sighting was very hot and dry and I was basically just outside early in the morning sipping my coffee about to go in my prayer room, when I noticed a couple fields over from my farm something moving very quickly to the North.</p> <p>So, I thank God that I grabbed my phone and began to video this creature. I also noticed that it had a white tail doe on its back. ( I did have my phone on zoom) But notice how quickly it crosses the fence, which I measured at 48”, but no hair to be found , and the ground was to hard and grassy for any foot prints.</p> <p>The grass was 3’ at fence line, but it was still moving very gracefully. I couldn’t get any closer when I was filming because I was already against my fence line to my prayer room. And honestly I was a little scared to go down and look for it, not knowing if it had babies down in trees that it might try to protect.</p> <p>Tell me what you think, your friend IronMan of Stained Red . I would believe that it was about 7.5’ tall easy and very heavy. God bless you all!!!”</p> <p>It will be uploaded to the podcast players shortly.</p>",
