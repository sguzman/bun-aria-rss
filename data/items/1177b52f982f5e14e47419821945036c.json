  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 22: Hart Candidates, Lightning, Irish Hurler, & More",
  "description": "<p>In this week show, the boys open it up by discussing Tampa Bay's unlikely rise after selling off major parts, why seemingly nobody is talking up Columbus, the three team race for the #8 spot in the East, the myriad matchup possibilities out West, the red-hot Sens, and much more. Next, the fellas discuss Brad Marchand's tremendous season, his Hart Trophy qualifications, and why his name doesn't get mentioned as much as other candidates. Other MVP-worthy names are bandied about before listener questions are answered during the #AllRightHamilton segment. The gents also chat about the amazing flow on display at the legendary Minnesota State Hockey Tournament as well as an Irish hurler who complained that the Vancouver Canucks drank too much after spending time with them. There's a whole lot to unpack this week so take a listen and enjoy.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
