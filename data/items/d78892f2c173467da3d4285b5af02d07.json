A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\nThat's the question most of us will ask ourselves on Nov9th, 2016 when the dust settles and the election comes to a close. The process itself will take until mid January 2017 to flush itself clean, when the new President takes the oath of office, and we move to sit a new Congress shorty thereafter, but what about the economy, world events, the military, the poor, the dependent, taxes, our currency, etc. These are the questions that we must address as a nation, the things we must work together to resolve and move us forward, because unless we do so effectively, their will be no tomorrow to worry about because when the music stops, there may not be a chair for us to take. \n\nPodcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
