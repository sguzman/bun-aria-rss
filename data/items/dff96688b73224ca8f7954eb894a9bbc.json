  "description": "<p>Should we stop using \"Guys\" to refer to groups of women and mixed sex groups?  Why do we (particularly men) refer to many objects - like cars and boats - as \"she\"?  Are everyday foods actually \"SuperNormal\" foods - created to be absolutely irresistible and therefore causing us to be overweight?  Is it okay to employ robot to care for our elderly?  And finally, how come the ending of a movie can \"ruin the whole thing\" if it's not a good ending? After all, you enjoyed most of the movie.  In this episode I try to address these questions.  We'll talk about all these things in this episode of The Psych Files.</p>",
