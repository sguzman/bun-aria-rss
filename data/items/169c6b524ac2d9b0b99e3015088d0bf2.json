  "title": "What's behind the illiberal attacks on our institutions and how to fight back, with Jonathan Rauch",
  "description": "In this episode of The Vital Center, host Geoffrey Kabaservice and Jonathan Rauch discuss the \"deliberate, sustained, sophisticated, and very effective attack on the system we rely on to make and obtain knowledge\" in our democracy. Fighting back against disinformation involves more than throwing up our hands and wishing it never happened. We have to understand why the attacks on our institutions, our systems of knowing things, and our democratic way of life are working. \"We have to understand this as an attack by identifiable people and organizations for power and for profit, and then we have to rally and push back really hard,\" says Rauch. Today's episode gets to the root of what's causing these illiberal attacks on truth, facts, and knowledge, and what we can do to stop them. ",
