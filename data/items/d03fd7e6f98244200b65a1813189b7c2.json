  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the New York Times confirms that the FBI sent an additional spy to London to meet with the Trump campaign in 2016; she posed as an assistant. Mark Masetti and the New York Times are a propaganda mill, and they continue providing cover to Barack Obama and his administration which led these spying efforts. It's alleged that the Bureau wanted internal oversight of the campaign. This is why Democrats are so focused on trashing Attorney General William Barr. They want to discredit him and leak as much information as possible to soften the shock of this being revealed in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's upcoming report. This is why we need to put the former heads of the FBI in front of a Grand Jury and conduct a thorough leak investigation to get to the bottom of this. The left whines \" don't interfere, let them do their jobs\" and then has their friends in the media leaking info from the Horowitz's report. Then, as quoted in \"Unfreedom of The Press \" The Hutchins Commission of 1947 was accurate in saying, \"What do we mean by a free press and what is its purpose? What qualifies someone as a journalist and what is their job? \"With the means of self-destruction now at their disposal, men must live, if they are to live at all, by self-restraint and mutual understanding. They get their picture of one another through the press. If the press is inflammatory, sensational and irresponsible, it and its freedom will go down in the universal catastrophe. On the other hand, it can help create a new world community by giving men everywhere knowledge of the world and one another, by prompting comprehension and appreciation of the goals of a free society.\" Afterward, Speaker Nancy Pelosi takes aim at Attorney General Barr insinuating that he lied to Congress in yet another one of her attempts to smear him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
