  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden delivered a long, rambling, and at times barely intelligible speech to congress last night, but if you could stay awake and decipher it, there was plenty to be concerned about. Especially the part where Biden unveils his plan for “universal preschool.” I’ll explain why that is a horrible, dystopian idea. Also Five Headlines including the parents who are volunteering their babies for COVID vaccine trials. What sort of parent would do that? And a track runner in Oregon collapses on the track after being forced to run with a mask. Plus, is the No Fly List being politically weaponized by the Biden Administration? Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the outrage over comments Steve Harvey made claiming that men and women cannot be platonic friends. Is he wrong, or exactly 100 percent correct? \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
