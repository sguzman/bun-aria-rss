Not really, but there are some hating ass bitches out there. This week Sofia tells us a little story about an influencer who made the cardinal sin of talking shit by sending a message where she was talking shit about Sofia, TO SOFIA. I know you feel the second hand embarrassment. Full body CRINGE. Clearly it went down the DM this week because Sofia then breaks down the recently developed Scott Disick vs Kourtney Kardashian drama. This scandal is the inspiration of this weeks Sloot University where Sofia breaks down the type of men you need to avoid at ALL costs. Nothing worse than a bitter bitch ex, right? Mama’s boy? AVOID. Club Promoter? Run for the HILLS. Cheap? Hide your wallets. Finally, although we’ve grown up, there’s always room for just A LITTLE bit of toxicity. That’s why Sofia will be teaching you a hack to MAKE SURE your boyfriend answers ALL of your phone calls…whether he knows it or not. 100% success rate on this one.
