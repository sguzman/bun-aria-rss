  "description": "<p>Nikki is the kind of gal that likes a planned surprise when it comes to engagements, Andrew won't be able to get up from getting down on one knee. Nikki won on Celebrity Wheel of Fortune and talks about what happened behind the scenes. Over the weekend it may have been Nikki's parents who were the stars of Tom Segura's show. Andrew is very close to getting Nikki to join him at his F45 class. In Nikki's Reddit Dump we discover a new way to get around if we feel lazy, try to feel good about accomplishments and find long term partnership benefits. In the Final Thought Nikki announces that she will be on a float at the St. Louis Thanksgiving Day Parade singing the National Anthem.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Watch this episode on our Youtube Channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv56vKUY_59gXVFe0bRL8og\">The Nikki Glaser Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow the pod on Instagram for bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaserpod/\">@NikkiGlaserPod</a></p>\n<p>Leave us your voicemail: <a href=\"https://www.speakpipe.com/thenikkiglaserpodcast\">Click Here To Record</a></p>\n<p>Get Pod Merch: <a href=\"https://podshop.nikkiglaser.com/\">Podshop.NikkiGlaser.com</a></p>\n<p>Nikki's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.nikkiglaser.com/tour\">www.nikkiglaser.com/tour</a></p>\n<p>Andrew's Tour Dates: <a href=\"https://www.andrewcollincomedy.com/\">www.andrewcollincomedy.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>More Nikki: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikkiglaser/\">IG</a></p>\n<p>More Andrew:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrewtcollin/\"> IG </a></p>\n<p>More producer Noa: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noainjection\">IG</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
