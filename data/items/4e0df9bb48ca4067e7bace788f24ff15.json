  "description": "<div>Sam's guest on this week's Book Club podcast is the historian Tessa Dunlop. Tessa's new book is <em>Army Girls: The Secrets and Stories of Military Service from the Final Few Women Who Fought In World War Two</em>. She tells Sam about how she gathered testimony and formed friendships with the nonagenarian veterans of the Second World War amid the Covid lockdown; about the class-ridden rivalries between the women's services; and how while still not officially in the front line, women during the war nevertheless found themselves in the thick of it.Â </div>\n",
