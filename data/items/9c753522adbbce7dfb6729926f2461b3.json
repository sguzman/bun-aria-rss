This was during my book promotion period so the discussion is heavy around #AskGaryVee but nonetheless it's a fire interview. In this discussion we talk about my love for Q&A sessions, being a natural-born motivator, and what I want my final narrative to look like.</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5472515.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
