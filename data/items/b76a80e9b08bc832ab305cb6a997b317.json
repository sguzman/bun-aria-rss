  "title": "261 - The Grim Sleeper Serial Killer and the Southside Slayer murders",
  "description": "<p>Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was but one of the numerous prolific serial killers preying on sex workers in South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s. And then after possibly going to \"sleep\" <br />during the 1990s, he started killing again in the first decade of the 2000's. The Grim Sleeper preyed almost exclusively on black, female, crack-addicted sex workers in South Central where he lived. South Central was in the midst of a crack epidemic when he got started in 1985 (or possibly 1984), and by the time he was done in 2007, he'd killed at least ten women but likely closer to twenty-five. And one man as well. Today we dig into our first black serial killer, look into racial bias when it comes to media coverage of black killers and black victims, explore the LA 80's crack epidemic, and more, in another true crime edition of Timesuck. <br /> <br />Link to unidentified Lonnie Franklin possible murder victims: <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-grim-sleeper-lapd-pictures-photogallery.html\">https://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-grim-sleeper-lapd-pictures-photogallery.html</a><br /><br />We're donating $15,400 this month to the American Nurses Foundation Coronavirus Response Fund for Nurses.
