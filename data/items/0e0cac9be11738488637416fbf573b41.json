  "summary": "<p>Some announcements about this blog's migration to a different static site generator as well as some new GitHub repos I've created.</p>",
  "content": "<p>I've decided to migrate this blog to Pelican from Jekyll. I did this largely because\nPelican has a plugin for allowing Jupyter notebooks to be served automatically\nas blog posts. With Jekyll, I had to use nbconvert to convert my ipynb document to html\nevery time I wanted to publish a new post, and I also had to often manually edit that html document to get it formatted correctly when embedded into the site. That was fine once, but if you want to make\nedits or updates, it becomes a real hassle. Now I can directly edit the notebook\nand the post will automatically update. There are a number of typos and code bugs\nin some of my old posts that I just never got around to fixing because it was\nso annoying to re-publish the post. But now I will work on them. Unfortunately some formatting/display\nissues have arisen from the migration but I will fix them all soon.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I've created some GitHub repos for some of the code used in various projects.\nNamely, I've turned the Gridworld game from RL part 3 into a separate project on GitHub\nso you can use it in other projects more easily. Find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/outlace/Gridworld\">https://github.com/outlace/Gridworld</a></p>\n<p>I also made a simple Data Augmentation library for creating synthetic image data\nfrom originals so you can amplify your data for use in deep learning models.\nYou can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/outlace/Data-Augmentation\">https://github.com/outlace/Data-Augmentation</a></p>\n<p>As far as a roadmap for the next few months, I plan to complete the second\nsub-series in my series on Topological Data Analysis (TDA). That is, I will roll out\na series of posts on the Mapper algorithm. Simultaneously I will be slowly working on\nan open source TDA library in Python called <a href=\"https://github.com/outlace/OpenTDA\">OpenTDA</a>.</p>\n<p>After that, I want to get back into reinforcement learning as that's my biggest passion\nin machine learning. I'm not exactly sure what I plan to work on yet, but will likely\nuse OpenAI's gym library as a testing ground. Feel free to drop a comment if you have any suggestions.</p>\n<p>-Brandon</p>",
