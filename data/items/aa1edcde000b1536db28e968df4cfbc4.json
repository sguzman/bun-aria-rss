  "description": "Lions escape from an Australian zoo while children are having a sleepover. Luckily, no one was hurt, except for the people listening to us attempt an Australian accent. Joe Biden's primetime speech fails to mention inflation, gas prices, crime or education, but is filled with plenty of gaslighting when it comes to which party supports rioting and which supports the rule of law. Bill Clinton, Joy Behar and actress Jenifer Lewis all join in on the gaslighting fun. Elon Musk gets into a Twitter scuffle with AOC. And, we look at footage of a gigantic Shoebill stork and we absolutely are terrified. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
