Examples range from the cosmetic, like the way Chinese police heroically restore order in films like <em>The 355</em>. It can also be more overt, like China blocking the release of Chloé Zhao's film <em>Eternals</em> in the country. Sam and Erich Schwartzel talk about how and why China has influenced the American film industry and more reporting in his new book <em>Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. <br/><br/>You can follow us on Twitter @NPRItsBeenAMin and email us at samsanders@npr.org.</em> ",
