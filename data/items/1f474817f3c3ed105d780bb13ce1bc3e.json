  "description": "<p>Legendary master of the big wave. Waterman god and sun-kissed global icon. Today one of the&nbsp;world’s greatest living athletes drops a master class on the value of pursuing adventure and&nbsp;embracing&nbsp;life as a work of art.</p><p>Meet&nbsp;<strong>Laird Hamilton</strong>.</p><p>Most are well-versed in the lore of today’s guest as perhaps the world’s greatest big wave surfer. Under-appreciated is his impact and legacy as a pioneer&nbsp;of crossover board sports that include tow-in&nbsp;surfing, stand-up paddle boarding and the more recent hydrofoil boarding explosion — passions that have&nbsp;earned Laird the title as surfing’s biggest innovator.</p><p>An icon of fitness, longevity and well-being who has transcended the sport that made him famous, Laird and his wife Gabby Reece are the founders of&nbsp;Extreme Performance Training (XPT)&nbsp;— a&nbsp;unique fitness training and lifestyle program that includes dynamic water workouts, performance breathing,&nbsp;high-intensity and endurance training and more. He is also the founder of&nbsp;Laird Superfood,&nbsp;a purveyor of high-quality functional blends, proteins, coffee&nbsp;beans, snacks and more. Ubiquitous on grocery store shelves across the country, the company recently enjoyed a successful public&nbsp;offering.</p><p>Profiled in every major media outlet across the globe, Laird has been featured in several films, including&nbsp;Riding Giants,&nbsp;an exquisite exploration of the&nbsp;history and art of big wave surfing. Finally, he is&nbsp;the author two books:&nbsp;Force of Nature,&nbsp;and his more recent&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;bestseller,&nbsp;Liferider&nbsp;—&nbsp;both&nbsp;inspiring reads for anyone looking to elevate themselves beyond the ordinary to do&nbsp;extraordinary things.</p><p>This is a conversation is about the internal Laird. What propels the relentless pursuit of adventure. His relationship with nature’s most intimidating&nbsp;elements. And how his fulfillment derives not from external validation but rather from competition with self — and accomplishing what even he&nbsp;questions possible.</p><p>We explore his unique and always evolving training methods. His entrepreneurial journey. Marriage. Parenting girls. And turmeric.</p><p>But the heart of this exchange is a deconstruction of fear. The wisdom gleaned from gliding on the edge of disaster. And why it is crucial to always seek&nbsp;out that which scares you most.</p><p>Ask Laird and he’ll be quick to caution that we’re over-insulated from nature’s majesty. In turn, our intuitions have been muted. So, more than anything,&nbsp;this is a call to reconnect with that which makes us innately human — to constantly push beyond our limits, seek out fear, and ultimately, embrace our&nbsp;lives as an evolving and precious work of art.</p><p>Not surprisingly, I found Laird to be both humble and wise — a function of hyper-connectedness to both self and the outdoors. But I was also delighted&nbsp;to discover a human with an endearing and beautiful child-like wonder — a trait we could all benefit from cultivating more.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch our exchange on<a href=\"https://youtu.be/VjnjoHwxGVM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;YouTube.</a>&nbsp;And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>I loved this experience.
