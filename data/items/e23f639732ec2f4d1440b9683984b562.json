    "media:description": "New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 20\n\nThere are certain advantages to understanding not just how the Dialectical Left (including Marxists and Wokeness) think but how their thought evolves over time. Theirs is a wholly Leftist religion that operates through a completely dialectical faith. In this episode of New Discourses Bullets, host James Lindsay spends a few minutes unpacking the dialectic and how it works. He then uses this information to trace the development of Leftist thought over the last 260 years and offers a cogent explanation for how it will develop over the next thirty, progressing through Woke Marxism into Sustainable Capitalism and pushing onward into \"global citizenship\" and a basis for a global administrative state.\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
