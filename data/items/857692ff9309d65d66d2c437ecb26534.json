In this video, we set out to change that, I as I take part in Sun Valley's Tour de Force in a 2022 McLaren 720S Spider, a 710 horsepower supercar with a sticker price of $370,300. \n\nThere's about a three mile stretch of road just north of Sun Valley, Idaho, where the drive takes place. You start off with a blind corner about a mile long, you then have a mile further to reach the finish line, and finally you slow things down with the remaining mile. My goal was to hit 200 mph. Did I make it?
