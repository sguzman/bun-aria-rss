  "description": "<p>Pittsburgh is the original \"Gateway to the West\" and began as a Frontier Fort. In the 1900s, the Federal Courthouse was built in a design that leaves much to be desired particularly compared to the more interesting Allegheny County Courthouse. But the Federal Courthouse is quite interesting when considering the rumors that it is haunted. Pittsburgh is a very haunted city and this location is just one of the many spots harboring those still here in the afterlife. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Pittsburgh's Federal Courthouse! Moment in Oddity features Surgeon Barbers and This Day in History features the patent of the Kinetoscope. We also discuss an interesting study on how hauntings might make people more honest.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures contributed by Dan Foytik of 9th Story Studios:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/08/hgb-podcast-ep-64-pittsburghs-federal.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/08/hgb-podcast-ep-64-pittsburghs-federal.html</a></p>",
