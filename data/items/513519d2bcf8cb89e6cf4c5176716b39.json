  "title": "PMS 2.0 073 - A Really Cool Journey With Frank Caliendo",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined in studio by probably the world's greatest impressionist, actor and comedian, the man of 1,000 voices, Frank Caliendo. They have an incredible chat that ranges from Frank's career doing impressions, the life that he has lived to this point and what some of the seminal moments were to get him to this point in his career, some of the fears and anxiety's that he has trying to further his career in the digital age through Instagram and Twitter, what aspirations he still has for comedy, and some of the things he has learned from Pat trying to reinvent himself through podcasts and other forms of media. This is maybe one of the deepest and realest conversations we've ever had, and not one that should be missed (3:45-1:28:15). Pat also covers the Knicks being screwed out of the NBA draft lottery, gives a couple thoughts on the NBA playoffs now that we're down to the conference finals, and chats about Jamie Collins potentially going back to New England, as Pat remembers him jumping over Matt Overton to block an Adam Vinatieri extra point, which sends him down memory lane as to why he can't stand Walt Anderson. Today's show is a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
