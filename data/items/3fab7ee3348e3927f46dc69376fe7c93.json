  "description": "<p>This is a very special episode of Questlove Supreme. The episode takes us to Philadelphia where we recorded in Milkboy Studios formerly known famously as \"The Studio\" which was owned by one of the true musical treasures of Philadelphia, Larry Gold. Larry is an anomaly in the sense that his talent is not only essential to an iconic music movement (Gamble and Huff catalog) almost 50 years ago. His career peaked again 30 years later as he added his strings and string arrangements to some of the biggest songs and albums of the early 2000's. We are talking \"The Boy is Mine\" \"Cry Me A River\" , and from <em>Graduation</em> and <em>808's & Heartbreaks</em> to MJ's \"Scream\" and a WHOLE lot in between. Let us not forget his work with the Root's and owning a studio where they would call home for over a decade. Needless to say there is a lot to talk about and learn from our friend Larry Gold. Enjoy</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
