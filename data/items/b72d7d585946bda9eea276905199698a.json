  "description": "<p>This past week I had a flat tire during rush hour on the 405. What did I do???  It may have involved foraging for stale water bottles and Door Dash.

Why are people disingenuous with others - like the ridiculous Garth Brooks videos oozing praise on the lighting guys? I read responses from people who have worked as psychics! Are they real?  You'll have to get your entire life and find out. </p>\n",
