  "description": "In 2010, a 30-year-old man turned criminal in Ohio set off on a sinister path of destruction. After hiding in a tree while he stalked a local family of 3, he went on a murderous rampage and held one of them hostage. From revealing surveillance footage, a hollow tree hiding spot, and a house full of leaves, this case proves to be one of the strangest we’ve covered. This is the story of Matthew Hoffman. And it’s also the story of Tina Herrmann, Stephanie Sprang, and Kody and Sarah Maynard.\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/article/20101121/news/311219718\n\nhttps://murderpedia.org/male.H/h/hoffman-matthew.htm\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/article/20110209/NEWS/302099677\n\nhttps://www.toledoblade.com/State/2010/11/21/Central-Ohio-murder-suspect-known-as-loner-who-took-risks.html\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/knox-county-killer-i-did-not-know-single-one-them/530-bce26d0a-7feb-48d0-82c5-40901a730740\n\nhttps://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Matthew_Hoffman\n\nhttps://www.cantonrep.com/article/20110222/NEWS/302229924\n\nhttps://scarestreet.com/matthew-hoffman/\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2010/11/20/slain-ohio-family-were-stabbed-to-death/\n\nhttps://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/oh-matthew-hoffman-victims-found-in-a-tree-apple-valley-media-links.119851/\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/article/20101112/NEWS/311129654\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/article/20101119/NEWS/311199718\n\nhttps://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-4-missing-from-ohio-home-truck-found-near-college-2010nov12-story.html?_amp=true\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/sheriff-3-missing-people-could-be-dead/530-ea47f1d3-3cca-484d-a31f-8626daff0a71\nLearn more about your ad choices.
