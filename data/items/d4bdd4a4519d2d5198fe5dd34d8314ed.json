None of the events depicted in this video actually happened, and are merely for entertainment purposes.\n\nVideo shot by a former playtester at Nintendo, presumably for a friend to see. The level shown seems to be a scrapped third snowy level, seen here replacing Shifting Sand Land.\n\nNintendo's fun is eternal.\n\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/greenio64\nDeviantArt | https://www.deviantart.com/greenhat64",
