  "description": "We're at one of the most fraught moments in American political history. The country is polarized. The president is going to trial. That president is one of the most polarizing figures the world has ever seen. And headlines scream of momentous events in the weeks ahead. Everybody's running a fever and maybe it's time to take two aspirin and call Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and David Sanger of the New York Times. Because they have just what this moment really calls for: perspective, the long view, even wisdom. This episode of Deep State Radio may not cure what ails you but it'll help you know what the problem really is...and in the end, that's the important thing, isn't it? Join us?\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
