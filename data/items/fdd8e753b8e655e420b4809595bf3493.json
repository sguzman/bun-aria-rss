  "description": "In a far reaching and incisive conversation with Michael Morell, host of CBS News \"Intelligence Matters\" podcast and former Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Director of the CIA from 2010-2013, we discuss a world situation that in his view presents more challenges than any we have faced since World War II. However great the threats confronting us may be, they are however, compounded by problems we face at home: tension between the White House and the Intelligence Community, a political choice not to prepare for coming interference in our 2020 elections, a desire to minimize extremist threats overseas and policy choices that have exacerbated global unease. Further, our leaders and our next generation policymakers are ill-prepared to understand or deal with the emerging technologies that are remaking war, espionage, and international relations. This is an episode you won't want to miss.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
