Leaked audio of Rachel Nichols is released by the New York Times sending ESPN into a tailspin. WEEI goes off air this morning, so Greg Hill & Company recycle an old Kirk bit.

Two new parody songs & much more!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
