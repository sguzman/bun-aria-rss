They start demanding that OP gives his PS5 to their kid for Christmas. OP refuses, so then they tell OP that they promised their kid a PS5 for Christmas, so if he doesn't get one it will completely ruin his Christmas. When OP still refuses, they start trash talking about him to all the neighbors to try to guilt trip him even more. Stay strong, OP!</p>\n",
