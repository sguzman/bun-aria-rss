  "description": "New Yorker magazine cartoonist Liana Fink grew up in a Jewish household; she went to synagogue, attended Hebrew day school, and observed Shabbat. But noticing a drift between her religious practice and her interest in its traditional stories put her on a path to reclaim her faith on her own terms. The result is 'Let There Be Light,' a graphic novel that retells the Book of Genesis starring a woman as God. In an interview on Weekend Edition Sunday, Fink told Scott Simon that reimagining God as a woman through her characteristic humorous style has helped her reconnect with her faith and religion. ",
