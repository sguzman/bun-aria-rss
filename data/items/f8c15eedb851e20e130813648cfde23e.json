  "description": "<p>Ah, Cape Cod, the arm-shaped stretch of Massachusetts where Boston goes in the summer.  The sun.  The ocean.  The traffic.  The clam chowder.  The summer theatre productions.  And best of all, except for perhaps the clam chowder, the modern architecture by <strong>Marcel Breuer, Walter Gropius</strong>, and others. There are more than 100 modernist houses representing a little-known treasure map of residential architecture.  Our guest <strong>Peter McMahon</strong> is Principal of PM Design.  Peter curated an exhibition on Cape Cod Modernist architecture for the Provincetown Art Museum.  This led to the creation of the unique and highly effective Cape Cod Modern House Trust, which documents and preserves these houses and makes them available for the public to stay in.  His own summer house in Wellfleet MA was published in House Beautiful and Outside and he is co-author with <strong>Christine Cipriani</strong> of Cape Cod Modern: Mid-Century Architecture and Community on the Outer Cape. </p>",
