  "description": "<p>It’s our 5 Year Podcast Anniversary, and we’re celebrating this landmark - and a brand new ‘Best Of’ from The Guardian - with a story from Bawdy’s creator, Dixie De La Tour. Dix is not a stranger to anonymous sex, but when she’s invited to a pitch dark sex party in an art gallery, she fears ‘accidentally’ boffing someone she knows in the thumping blackness. Yes, it’s an edgy event but there are rules: crawl in, hang onto your date, be polite, and don’t forget to grab some Sibling tape! #WhoAreYou #ChuckECheese #VintageStory</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Turn off the Light’ (Kim Petras, featuring Elvira, Mistress of the Dark)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Like A Kitten: Has your sex fallen into the same old, dull routine?
