  "description": "<p>We show that if $G$ is a finitely generated group such that its profinite\ncompletion $\\widehat{G}$ is ``far from being projective'' (that is the kernel\nof the universal Frattini cover of $\\widehat{G}$ is not a small profinite\ngroup), then the class of existentially closed $G$-actions on fields is not\nelementary. Since any infinite, finitely generated, virtually free, and not\nfree group is ``far from being projective'', the main result of this paper\ncorrects an error in our paper ``Model theory of fields with virtually free\ngroup actions'', Proc. London Math. Soc., (2) 118 (2019), 221--256 by showing\nthe negation of Theorem 3.26 in that paper.\n</p>",
