  "description": "Today on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we’re joined by Thomas Brag and Matt Dajer from Yes Theory. This is an episode we’ve been wanting to record since we met the guys back in February.\nYes Theory is not only a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers, but a movement and a way of life. They believe that the best things in life come from putting yourself in uncomfortable situations and challenging yourself to say yes to more things in life. They spread that message across the world through the content the content they create and we can tell you first hand that they authentically live the message in everything they do.\nIf you haven’t checked out Yes Theory, we highly recommend you check them out on Youtube and see what they are all about, I can pretty much guarantee you’ll be hooked. When we first watched Yes Theory videos, we were instantly hooked and decided to challenge ourselves to meet them in 24 hours, which worked and we’ve been friends since.\nOn this episode we cover the early days of Yes Theory, the choices they made and the challenges they faced trying to get their idea off the ground. We were incredibly inspired while recording this episode and we think you will feel the same way after listening.\n\nCheck out Yes Theory: www.youtube.com/yestheory",
