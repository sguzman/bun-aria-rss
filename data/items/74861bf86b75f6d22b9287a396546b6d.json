  "description": "<div>Dating in your 20s is a lot like being given free range with paint as a toddler. Things can be fun but can get messy really quick. But the beauty is, you're young and have time to clean the mess up. In this episode, that is exactly what we are getting into.  <br>\n<br>\nHarry Jowsey and Georgia Hassarati - two on again off again, mid twenties, love birds in the midst of what we just described.<br>\n<br>\nHarry, Georgia and myself all met on the Netflix show that I’ve worked on as a sex expert for several seasons, Too Hot to Handle. Harry was a retreat attendee on season one and Georgia, on season three. They met because Harry asked Georgia to be a guest on his podcast, Tap in with Harry Jowsey.<br>\n<br>\nHarry and Georgia share a lot of the same things in common: background, career aspirations, sense of humor and the desire for real love in their 20s. They start hanging out, yada yada yada, they fall in love, have a few incredible rom-com-esque months together before things got a little TOO real… too heavy for Harry who then decides to call things off. But in classic-twenty-something-style our boy Harry made another big call a few weeks after that.<br>\n<br>\nAnd that’s where they are today… And if you’re not really clear where that “at” is, don’t worry, neither are they… and that’s kinda the beauty of trying to do the love thing in your twenties…right? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks to the sponsors of this episode!<br>\n<strong>ZocDoc</strong><br>\n<br>\nGo to <a href=\"https://www.zocdoc.com/?utm_medium=podcast\">ZocDoc.com/LOVERS</a> to start your search for a top rated doctor today.
