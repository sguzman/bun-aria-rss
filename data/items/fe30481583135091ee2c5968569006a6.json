  "description": "Welcome back to Part 3 on our series of \"Is Bourbon Broken?\" as we analyze the multi-part blog series from Bourbon & Banter. This episode is one that many have been waiting for as we evaluate the variable that is completely out of our control as a consumer and that's distribution and retail. We've challenged this system multiple times and I'm not sure if we'll ever figure out the correct answer, but how do we make sure it's always working in favor of the consumer? How should distributors reward stores differently? What does the future of commerce look like? And should distributors and retailers be wary of the digital age?\nShow Partners:\n\nCatoctin Creek has been honoring that tradition of small craft rye whisky since 2009.
