    "media:description": "If you’re ever in need of a replacement valve in your heart, Ellen Roche has got you covered. Roche is an Associate Professor at MIT’s Institute of Medical Engineering and Science and the Department of Mechanical Engineering; she’s devoted to teaching the next generation of medical engineers and inventors. She’s also a professor at Harvard Medical School, and part of the rockstar team of instructors teaching 2.75, Medical Device Design. Last Spring, Roche and co. took their lab class hybrid following the partial re-opening of campus due to the pandemic. The teams of senior undergraduate and graduate students took on various roles, depending on who was in person and who was remote, to \"somehow, magically\" bring their projects to fruition.\n\n\nMB0149UI113E7FG",
