  "description": "The end of the saga of Gilgamesh...and possibly the end of Gilgamesh, but not if the demi-god has anything to say about it. After a tragic loss, Gilgamesh goes on a quest to defeat mankind's greatest enemy - death itself, and he learns the secrets of our destructive past. The creature this week slathers his naked body in mud and twigs. Hows that for juxtaposition? Sponsors: Loot Crate!
