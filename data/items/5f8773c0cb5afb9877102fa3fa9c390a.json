  "description": "<p>Do you enjoy knights, wizards, and dragons? How about medieval history? Folklore, maybe? Want to learn how England became England? We learned a lot about the beginning of the mythology that has led to our cultural fascination with knights, jousting, sword fighting, dragons, and everything medieval in this Suck. There would be no Game of Thrones without Arthurian legend. No Lord of the Rings as we know it. No Dungeons and Dragons. Also, the biggest Timesucker Updates ever with a lot of poignant personal accounts from those who have known those who fought in the Vietnam War.
