Many of you probably never checked the band out when they were active and playing shows but, now is your chance to get familiar. Jaime Mason was the vocalist of the dark hardcore/punk/metal band from the Northeast (specifically the Martha's Vineyard hardcore scene...which is a hilarious thing to type) and has just recently re-released their awesome EP \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1at9Ncdbdoed2T4KemoT5x?si=YQXLr8ILR6G8HgL0FcUk3A\">Somnambulists</a>\" on the re-launched Iodine Recordings. We discuss his time in the band, working in the restaurant industry and why resurrecting the band now made sense.
