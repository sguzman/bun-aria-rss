  "description": "On the internet, body shaming is alive and well, nutrition advice can be wildly inaccurate, and it's a lot easier to scroll through Instagram for hours than to get up and go for a run. But Danielle Friedman, who literally https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645493/lets-get-physical-by-danielle-friedman/ (wrote the book) on women's fitness, says there's one extremely good thing that social media has done for our bodies, which we shouldn't ignore.\n\"Body acceptance activist Virgie Tovar told me that social media has given a voice to the people who have always been the majority in number, but not in influence,\" Danielle says. \n\"You don't have to go through all of the traditional channels to be visible. You can just start posting selfies and find an audience and build an audience that way. And I know it's easier said than done, but in spending years researching this history, that is a significant shift.\"\nToday on Follow Friday, Danielle talks about what else she learned while researching https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645493/lets-get-physical-by-danielle-friedman/ (Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped the World).
