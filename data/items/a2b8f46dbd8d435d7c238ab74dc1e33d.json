  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we’re joined by one of the founders and creators of Yes Theory - Ammar Kandil. Ammar and Yes Theory have built a global movement through their youtube videos about seeking discomfort, if you don’t know yes theory they believe that the best things in life are on the other side of your comfort zone and the best experiences in life can often times be achieved just by saying one simple yes. Today Yes Theory has over 3 Million subscribers on YouTube and a rapidly growing fanbase across all platforms. \nOn this episode we talk to Ammar about creating global movements, he has this incredible ability to not only capture the attention of a large audience but also inspire them to take action. Ammar was originally born in Egypt and traveled all over the world before landing in venice beach with the guys from yes theory to start building their vision. \nWe talk about growing up in Egypt, living through the Egyptian revolution, creating digital and physical movements, starting Yes Theory and even more topics than I can list considering this was officially our longest podcast ever. Get comfortable, this is one of our best episode to date. \nBecause this is an episode about global community - we’d love to hear from you and where you are listening from, post a screenshot IG stories and on twitter, tell us where in the world you are listening from and tag @colinandsamir and @ammar to let us know where you are listening from.",
