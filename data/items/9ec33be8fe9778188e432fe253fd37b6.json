Even if they’ve found some things that improve their condition, they continue searching for new ways to feel better and better. This is how we break down walls in medicine. The Functional Medicine methodology is the same; there is no end to searching for what is underneath the symptoms. Functional Medicine healing protocols can ultimately help change the prognosis of so many conditions, including the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Terry Wahls and Dr. Todd LePine about using diet, meditation, and much more to reverse devastating autoimmune disease symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Terry Wahls is a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Iowa. Her secondary progressive multiple sclerosis confined her to a tilt-recline wheelchair for four years, but she restored her health using a diet and lifestyle program she designed specifically for mitochondrial health and now pedals her bike to work each day. She is the author of <em>The Wahls Protocol: How I Beat Progressive MS Using Paleo Principles and Functional Medicine</em>, <em>The Wahls Protocol: A Radical New Way to Treat All Chronic Autoimmune Conditions Using Paleo Principles</em>, and the cookbook, <em>The Wahls Protocol Cooking for Life: The Revolutionary Modern Paleo Plan to Treat All Chronic Autoimmune Conditions</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is board certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine certified practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Paleovalley, and InsideTracker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs.
