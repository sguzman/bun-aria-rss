  "description": "<p>Meditation - The Return to Presence: Rest Your Mind In What Is (2017-01-25) - It’s natural that our attention wanders, and the more we relax back, the more that becomes our habit…returning to presence. This meditation opens with conscious breathing and awakening through the body. We then rest in open awareness, and when the attention drifts, guide ourselves to rest our minds, over and over, in the aliveness and presence that is right here.</p> <p>Free download of Tara’s 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease” when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
