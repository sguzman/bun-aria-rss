Lucas began his career working for Michael S. Smith, but quickly built his own business, which has evolved to include multi line showrooms in New York and Los Angeles. On either coast, Joe has his finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the design world. He chats about the tension between street level shops and the design center in LA, the prevalence of lookalikes and knockoffs in the industry today, and why he believes that multiline showrooms will always have a role to play. <i>This episode is sponsored by The Shade Store and Universal Furniture.  </i></p>\n",
