  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, presidential polls this early in an election can be misleading just like Walter Mondale being ahead in June of 1983, however, these polls often go without any pushback. In 1983, 1991, 1995 and 2011 these polls were wrong. Some polls and the reporting on these polls can dispirit supporters from being aggressive political activists. However, we can't lose sight that Nancy Pelosi and Congress overall are viewed very poorly and President Trump hasn't even started campaigning yet. So many candidates have simply regurgitated the Soviet Constitution that virtually says the government will give you everything. Then, liberals continue to push the lie that Americans support impeachment. Also, freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on \"ABC This Week\" for a friendly interview where she wasn't questioned on anything substantive. Later, The New York Times reviews many books, yet they overlook their own #1 bestseller \"Unfreedom OF The Press.\" Finally, Bernie Sanders tells Fox News that only a few wealthy people control all of the power in the country—a lie disproved by the election of Donald Trump when the three wealthiest families in the U.S supported Hillary Clinton and she still lost.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
