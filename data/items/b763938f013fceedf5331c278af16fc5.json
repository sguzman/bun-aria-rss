  "description": "We’re back for a brand new season and PINCH ME BECAUSE I TRULY CAN’T BELIEVE I’M WRITING THIS but…<br /><br />Our first guest of 2022 is…<br /><br />The one, the only…<br /><br />Brené Brown.<br /><br />I’m a huge admirer of Brené’s work, much of which laid the groundwork for the formation of this podcast. She has spent the past two decades researching and changing the global conversation around courage, shame, empathy and vulnerability. She is a professor at the University of Houston, the the author of five number one New York Times bestsellers, the host of the weekly podcast Unlocking Us, which averages one million listens per episode and her 2010 TED talk, ‘The Power of Vulnerability’ is one of the most-watched of all time. Her latest book, Atlas of the Heart, takes the reader on a journey through 87 emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human.<br /><br />Brené joins me to talk about the failure of her first book, failure to prize consistency over intensity and her multiple failed hobbies ‘where buying the supplies was more fun than the actual hobby.’ I loved this conversation so much because of the truth bombs it contains (I was feverishly writing notes so I would’t forget any of what she said) but also because Brené speaks with such honesty, clarity and humour about what it is to be human and how to make sense of the world.<br /><br />Even if this weren’t actually my podcast, I’d tell you this episode is a must-listen.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buy Atlas of the Heart here: shorturl.at/bgEZ6<br />Visit Brené's website here: <a href=\"https://brenebrown.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://brenebrown.com/</a><br />Listen to Brené's podcasts here: <a href=\"https://brenebrown.com/podcasts/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://brenebrown.com/podcasts/</a><br />Watch Brené's TED talk here: <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/brene_brown\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.ted.com/speakers/brene_brown</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted by Elizabeth Day, produced by Naomi Mantin and Chris Sharp.
