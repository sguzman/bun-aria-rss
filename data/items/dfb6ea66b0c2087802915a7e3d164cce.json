We tell you about some good upcoming schedules, talk FAAB (2:30), debate Cam Newton's value (5:50) and go over the big news (8:55) to start the show ...

Recapping DET-GB (32:30) and PIT-LAC (37:10). What are Kerryon Johnson's and Melvin Gordon's values rest of season? We also tell you who to drop (45:10) and then take a closer look at the Waiver Wire for each position (47:30) ...
