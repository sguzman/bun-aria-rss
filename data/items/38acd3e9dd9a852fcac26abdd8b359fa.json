  "description": "In Episode 37 I sit down for the second time with Dr Michelle McMacken (previous guest on Episode 2) to talk about where the science lies in terms of eating for longevity.\n\nWe talk about a plethora of fascinating topics including:\n\n\nMichelle's project with Bellevue Hospital which is now offering out-patients with chronic disease the option of participating in a plant based food program\n\nWhere the science lies in terms of saturated fat & cholesterol and their contributions to disease\n\nThe particular type of fat & cholesterol we need to be worried about when it comes to atherosclerosis (narrowing of our arteries) and cardiovascular disease\n\nSources of healthy fats\n\nThe Paleo & Keto diets and where the science sits in terms of these diets being helpful or harmful from a longevity & disease point of view\n\nWhat Type 2 diabetes is and helpful nutritional information for managing and reversing this disease\n\nand much much more\n\n\nThis is an absolute cracker of an episode, one of my favourites so far in terms of breaking down the science, clearing the confusion and helping us all understand what we should be eating more of and what we should be eating less of. Despite the headlines, the science is very clear and in this episode Michelle offers agenda free insight into exactly what it means. Grab a pen and paper...you're going to want to take notes and more than likely listen 2-3 times!\n\nTo connect with Michelle you can find her on Instagram @veg_md- I strongly suggest following her page as she often posts really helpful information directly from the many lifestyle medicine conferences she attends and speaks at.\n\nFor extra information from Michelle explaining Cholesterol, LDL-C & HDL-C please read here\n\nAs always folks I hope you enjoy the episode and find it thought provoking. I definitely did! If you did enjoy it please share your feedback by leaving a review on iTunes or posting on social media and tagging Michelle and Myself (@plant_proof) (I re share a lot of the feedback posted on my own story).\n\nSimon Hill\nFor agenda free information on plant based nutrition checkout my website plantproof.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
