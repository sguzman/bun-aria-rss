In this episode, John Maxwell talks with his good friend Dr. Caroline Leaf––a world-renowned communication pathologist and cognitive neuroscientist who just released her newest book <em>Cleaning Up Your Mental Mess</em>.</p> <p>Dr. Leaf dives deep into her book and explains how properly managing our mind and thinking habits can shape our brain, and even our DNA, in a positive way.
