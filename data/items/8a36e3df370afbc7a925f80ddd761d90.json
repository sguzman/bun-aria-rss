  "description": "<p>Jonathan Mann writes and publishes a song every single day. He's done this without missing a day since January 1st, 2009, and holds the Guinness World Record for most consecutive days writing a song.</p> <p>His inspiration, passion, consistency, and all-around charm really comes through as he explores his journey in both music and crypto. Infatuated with the ideas and methodology behind CryptoPunks, he's launched his own NFT project for his daily songs with an accompanying DAO - SongADAO.</p> <p>Creation, labor, value, and scarcity blend together in Jonathan's world. He exemplifies Layer 0 brilliantly -- a mortal human behind lines of code, expressed through music and commitment. When you stretch art this far, cool things emerge.
