  "description": "<p>Everything's coming up Kirk Minihane. Yesterday, in less than 5 minutes, Kirk S. Minihane sold over 1,100 tickets to his June 20 live show at the Wilbur Theater in Boston. So of course we've added a second show. Tickets go on sale today at noon. After a well deserved victory lap, Minihane revisits the Red Sox's most recent trade (0:53:00). The parody song writers come out in force to rub Mike Geary's nose in his mistakes (1:19:00). Minihane gets a taste of a happening new foodie podcast, which of course leads to Tube Galore (1:33:24).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
