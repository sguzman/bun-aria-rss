What does that Buying Philosophy mean to you and how does it impact what you pay at the cash register? This episode of Inside Trader Joe’s goes inside the Buying Philosophy – why we do it, how it works, and most importantly, what it means for you at the cash register, every time you shop.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode41-Transcript.pdf\"> Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
