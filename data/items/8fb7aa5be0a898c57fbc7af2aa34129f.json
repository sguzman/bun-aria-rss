  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, WABC radio host Rich Valdes “Mr. Call Screener” fills in for Mark. Regressive progressives are trying to raize the republic. They are trying to get the election over with as fast as possible, which is why there is such a push by the media to ignore evidence of voter fraud. Mail-in ballot fraud was used to affect the 1864 election to try and remove President Abraham Lincoln, just like what the Democrats are trying to pull off in the 2020 election. Even worse was the 1876 election of Rutherford B. Hayes, which saw Democrats go so far as to kill political opponents in order to steal the election. The “hate America” first crowd cannot be allowed to take over, or else we are screwed. The media is on an all-out assault on our republic, trying to destroy the aspects of democracy that we love and pervert them for their purposes. Also, we have turned a blind eye to what Barack Obama has done. The divider and demagogue in chief pitted Americans against each other, and is now openly hating evangelicals and Latino Trump supporters. He spent 8 years creating racial division, which paved the way for BLM.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
