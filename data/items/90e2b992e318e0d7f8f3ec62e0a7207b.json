  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, there are a number of important and very close elections tonight. Billionaire activist George Soros has invested heavily in flipping Virginia and weakening the state's gun laws. Just like they are hitting it hard in Mississippi and Kentucky changing life as we know it and redefining our criminal justice systems across America. Everyone must get active and vote because the future of our children is at stake. There are no more election cake walks anymore. When it comes to impeachment, if they're not alleging treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors then one must remember these two words: \"Who cares?\" There is no statutory requirement to protect the identity of a so-called whistleblower that supersedes the constitution or the duty for the President to uphold the Constitution. Then, Ambassador Gordon Sondland has amended his testimony and it still doesn't confirm a quid pro quo because in his words he knew of nothing definitive, yet the media has contorted that into something else. Later, a cartel in Mexico has massacred entire families including women and children as they were headed to a wedding. President Trump has vowed to support the Mexican Government in destroying the cartels. Afterward, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must use his power to police what's happening in the House with impeachment instead of becoming an accomplice to it. This battle will come down to the Senate, not the Courts. Republicans will lose the senate if these GOP Senators don't step up and defend the Constitution, the presidency and this particular president. Lastly, Project Veritas has exposed the fake news media yet again, this time it's ABC News that sat on the Jeffrey Epstein story as far back as three years ago.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
