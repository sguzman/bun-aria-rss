  "description": "<p>On today's show, the boys chat about the disarray left behind after a Gumpy Nuke, Nick buying a new house, Zito looking dapper at a wedding, and they jump into a loaded Pod FOD where they discuss what movie military unit they would like to join the most, they dive through a comprehensive Halloween candy simulation to see which candy wins the most of its matchups and try to guess what the worst candies on the list are, plus Billy Tubes gets some ideas for a new tattoo, and the guys discuss whether they prefer pumpkin spice or apple cinnamon, plus much more. Don't forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD to&nbsp;@ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram to be featured on the show, and subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> for all PMI content including full episodes of this show.
