  "description": "America’s small businesses took a massive hit in 2020. But was this because of the COVID-19 pandemic, or is the government’s unprecedented response to blame? “Recovering investment banker” Carol Roth joins Glenn to break it all down, and the truth goes much deeper than we’ve been told. As Carol describes in her new book, “The War on Small Business: How the Government Used the Pandemic to Crush the Backbone of America,” wealth redistribution in America is already underway, as money is funneled from Main Street to Wall Street, and it’s ushering in the successor to capitalism: central planning. Carol puts into layman’s terms the latest on inflation, the housing crisis, social credit scores, cryptocurrency, and the Great Reset — and it’s all part of a “war” on your ability to create your own wealth.\n \nThis Week’s Sponsor:\n \nBUILT BAR has revolutionized the protein bar industry – and that’s because they understand one simple basic truth: Flavor must come first!
