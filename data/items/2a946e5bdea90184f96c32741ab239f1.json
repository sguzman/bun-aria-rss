  "description": "I just got back from my daughter’s basketball tournament in Orlando… and it was eye-opening to see how costs are rising. Speaking of rising prices, the Fed is finally serious about fighting inflation. I highlight what businesses must do to stay afloat in this environment… why supply chain constraints aren’t going away anytime soon… and which industries to avoid. I share the qualities you should look for when buying stocks… a couple of names that belong on your radar… and some positive signs that the market is near a bottom. I see huge upside potential for stocks right now. That’s why I added three new positions to the  portfolio last week… and why I’ll be releasing two new recommendations to  members tomorrow. In this episode:  Consumers are spending less money [0:23] What businesses must do to survive [8:00] Avoid these supply chain-sensitive industries [11:25] Critical qualities to look for when buying stocks [20:00] Signs we’re near a market bottom [24:00]  Enjoyed this episode?
