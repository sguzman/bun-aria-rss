  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the courts must not dictate election law! Under the federal Constitution, only the legislature of each state has all power over the times, methods, and procedures to choose their electors. A president wins a state when electors, as made lawful by state legislatures, declare a candidate the winner on December 14th and certify their respective state's electoral votes for that candidate. The Constitution provides no \"public health emergency\" exception that enables governors or judges to override them and create a new system for elections as noted by Daniel Horowitz. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the U.S Constitution. Then, Adam Laxalt calls in to explain how the Democrats changed Nevada's electoral system in the last 80 days with problems matching signatures and notes receiving multiple ballots by mail. Laxalt joins the Trump campaign in filing lawsuits to challenge unconstitutionally changes and extraconstitutional statutes. Later, Victor Davis Hanson joins the show to discuss why active litigation over contested ballots should prevent further ballot counting and states from being called for either candidate. Afterward, Republicans have held the senate and didn't lose a single incumbent in the House. Yet, President Trump who was ahead is now behind in states that other Republicans won. This is what happens when mail-in ballots are dumped overnight and new election statues are unconstitutionally created by bureaucrats and judges that are part of the establishment. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
