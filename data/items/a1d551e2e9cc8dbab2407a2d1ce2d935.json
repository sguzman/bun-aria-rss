  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the top 20% of income-earners in the U.S pay nearly 70% of all income taxes and the top 1% pays nearly 30% with 61% of Americans paying no income taxes at all. Yet Democrats spread lies about these taxpayers saying they don't pay their fair share. Then, adding 84,000 new tax collectors will target most American families with more than $10,000 in annual expenses to trigger audits on everyday Americans. This is a tax on unrealized wealth - your wealth! Later, President Biden visited NJ to make a speech about how much Americans should spend on childcare. Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci's facing heat for a cruel experiment on beagle puppies. Afterward, Barack Obama stumped for Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and spread more lies to normalize critical race theory and parental concerns over the rape and cover-ups that occurred at two different high schools. It's important to note that Obama sent his kids to an expensive private school, just like McAuliffe did. Marxists never treat people as individual human beings. They just use people and exploit their race through the public school system for their own political benefit. Finally, American Marxists in the media have abandoned impartiality and have focused on pushing the notion of GOP radicalism.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
