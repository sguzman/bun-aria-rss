  "description": "Anyone who listens to the Old Man and the Three knows that Jrue Holiday is not only a great player, but he’s also a very close friend of the pod and is universally known as ‘one of the good guys’ - on and off the court. And there’s no denying that he’s had a great career thus far. However, the last two months have brought his life and career to a completely new level, as he brought home an NBA Championship and then followed that up with a gold medal with Team USA in the Olympics. Suffice it say, things have changed just a bit, and thats what Jrue discusses today on the pod. It’s an incredible listen as he gives his account of the last couple months and what it was like going through these two unique and life changing experiences. Then, as if that isn’t entertaining enough, the OM3 crew welcomes in Chris Long to the pod for a draft that is sure to ruffle a lot of music feathers out there when they debate the \"musical acts you would least like to be stuck in a festival crowd for”. Lots of options here… who knows how this one ends up.  \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
