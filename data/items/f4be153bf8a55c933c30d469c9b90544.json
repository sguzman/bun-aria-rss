A key piece of this change is shifting emphasis from physical private goods to digital public goods. This transition requires creative solutions to the challenges of effective governance.</p> <p>The phrase “digital nationalism” refers humanity’s recent tendency to polarize and how this extends to the internet. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone great schisms, resulting in hard forks like BCH and ETC. These phenomena in the rising political economy will likely continue.</p> <p>Vitalik walks through the tricky relationship between our financial and non-monetary social motivations. Culture and narrative can be incredibly powerful tools for innovation, but altruistic people are not the only ones with access to these things.</p> <p>Vitalik concludes with thoughts on the Big X - Big Government, Big Business, Big Tech, etc. This multidisciplinary “dense jungle” is populated by a variety of powerful groups with dynamic interrelationships, and blockchains & cryptocurrencies are set up to play a vital role.</p> <p>------<br /> Vitalik's Blog:<br /> <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/\">https://vitalik.ca/</a> </p> <p>Vitalik on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin\">https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Don't stop at the video!</p> <p>Subscribe to the Bankless newsletter program<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.substack.com/%E2%80%8B\">http://bankless.substack.com/​</a> </p> <p>Visit the official Bankless website<br /> <a href= \"http://banklesshq.com/%E2%80%8B\">http://banklesshq.com/​</a> </p> <p>Follow Bankless on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ%E2%80%8B\">https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ​</a> </p> <p>Follow Ryan on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ryansadams%E2%80%8B\">https://twitter.com/ryansadams​</a> </p> <p>Follow David on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/TrustlessState%E2%80%8B\">https://twitter.com/TrustlessState​</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
