  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, there’s been no law passed or Supreme Court decision that conveys birthright citizenship onto illegal aliens. Paul Ryan claimed the 14th Amendment creates the birthright citizenship and that therefore an executive order by President Trump would be unconstitutional. Not until the 1960's has the Constitution been interpreted to convey birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens. And not due to any congressional statute or court ruling, but decisions by various departments and agencies of the federal bureaucracy. The president would not be altering the 14th amendment or the intent of the 14th amendment or the original interpretation of the 14th amendment. On the contrary, the president would be taking charge of the executive branch and upholding the 14th amendment. Conservative Review editor Daniel Horowitz calls in to explain further birthright citizenship. Later, the media continues its attacks against the president and conservatives, including Mark Levin, blaming them for the mass murder of parishioners at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Never pausing to look at the divisive rhetoric of the previous Administration. Former McCain presidential campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, said on the hate machine MSNBC that \"Mark Levin has blood on his hands\" for contributing to the heated tone of political rhetoric. Schmidt, like Joy Reid, and Al Sharpton is believed to be a bigot and shouldn’t work at MSNBC. They don't care about the carnage in Pittsburgh, they're political opportunists. Also, John James calls in to discuss his campaign for Senate in Michigan. Finally, the new book by the late great Jack Levin \"Our Police\" which promotes American greatness and values is out today on Amazon.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
