  "description": "In a recent article in the New York Times, Nicholas Wade reported that the American Anthropological Association had decided “to strip the word ‘science’ from a statement of its long-range plan.” Is this just a reflection of the long standing division between physical and cultural anthropology or is there more here?

So, what kind of discipline is anthropology, after all? And, more broadly, should scientists cross the line from research into public advocacy?",
