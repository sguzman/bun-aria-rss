  "description": "<p>TD Garden President Amy Latimer joins Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the dollars associated with the buildings that house games. Latimer, who was part of the arena's inaugural executive team in 1995, discusses a litany of topics related to how a sports arena operates, including how technology has helped franchises to know their customers and keep them satisfied. She also talks about the scheduling process, which can be a bit of a gamble when a building like TD Garden has two anchor tenants often participating in their respective playoffs. Also discussed are ticketing, food and beverage and the ongoing $130 million renovation to the facility. Also talked about is the mystery of gelato -- Celtics fans love it; Bruins fans not so much. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams </p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
