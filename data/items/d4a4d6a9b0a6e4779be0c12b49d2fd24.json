  "description": "<p>Katie Couric still has questions. But right now they're mostly focused on the future of business. Considering this unprecedented economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, how will industries like tech, education, entertainment, travel, and fashion adjust and innovate to fit our new world order. Introducing \"Back to Biz with Katie and Boz,\" a new interview series co-hosted by award-winning journalist Katie Couric and trailblazing marketing executive Bozoma Saint John. </p><p>On the premiere episode of \"Back to Biz with Katie and Boz,\" the co-hosts set the stage for their forward-looking series with their first guest, tech and media journalist and podcaster Kara Swisher who offers a big-picture look at the ways the shuttered economy has made Big Tech even bigger — for better and worse. \"Any trends that were present have been accelerated and then helped by tech,\" Kara says. \"You could go around from industry to industry. Look at streaming entertainment that people have been using. Look at Netflix — [it's] never had more usage.\" Katie, Boz and Kara discuss what it means to be an essential worker and why all businesses will have to reassess what \"gig work\" means. They also talk about the future of education, why TikTok is having more than a moment, and the innovations that are bubbling up in tech right now.
