Filming Making a Gambler,  Marty needs to know about inventions. Voicemail: $1000 to nut, bad at geography, thermostat wars. Cheeto Santino stops by to chat about how Princess Diana was murdered, hot coal football fights, his podcast with Brendan Schaub and the Call Her Daddy girls, the Red Rocket Tour and much more.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
