  "description": "Comic Phoebe Robinson told NPR's Rachel Martin that she doesn't wake up every day thinking \"time to dismantle systemic racism!\" But since she has a platform, she might as well use it to bring about some positive change. She also told Martin that her dream life involves buying sensible cardigans, getting day drunk with Kathy Lee and Hoda, and a loving marriage with Robert DeNiro. Robinson's book <em>You Can't Touch My Hair: And Other Things I Still Have to Explain</em> goes into the racism she experiences and why she would like to date either Michael Fassbender or Michael B. Jordan (sorry Mr. DeNiro).",
