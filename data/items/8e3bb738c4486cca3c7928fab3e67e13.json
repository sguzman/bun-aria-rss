Catch me live every weekday from 9AM-2PM PT here: http://twitch.tv/Northernlion\n\nI'm excited to check out Fall Guys again because of my preconceived notion that the wins will be flowing ever since the game went free-for-all. Wouldn't you know it, there apparently have been some Fall Guys ringers waiting for this moment just to tear me down. Check it out!\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please consider hitting the Like button. It helps me out a lot! \n-----------------------------------------------\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Northernlion\nFollow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Northernlion\n-----------------------------------------------",
