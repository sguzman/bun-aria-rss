  "description": "<p>Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) are efficiently constructible states that\nare computationally indistinguishable from being Haar-random, and have recently\nfound cryptographic applications. We explore new definitions, new properties\nand applications of pseudorandom states, and present the following\ncontributions:\n</p>\n<p>1. New Definitions: We study variants of pseudorandom function-like state\n(PRFS) generators, introduced by Ananth, Qian, and Yuen (CRYPTO'22), where the\npseudorandomness property holds even when the generator can be queried\nadaptively or in superposition. We show feasibility of these variants assuming\nthe existence of post-quantum one-way functions.\n</p>\n<p>2. Classical Communication: We show that PRS generators with logarithmic\noutput length imply commitment and encryption schemes with classical\ncommunication. Previous constructions of such schemes from PRS generators\nrequired quantum communication.\n</p>\n<p>3. Simplified Proof: We give a simpler proof of the Brakerski--Shmueli\n(TCC'19) result that polynomially-many copies of uniform superposition states\nwith random binary phases are indistinguishable from Haar-random states.\n</p>\n<p>4. Necessity of Computational Assumptions: We also show that a secure PRS\nwith output length logarithmic, or larger, in the key length necessarily\nrequires computational assumptions.\n</p>",
