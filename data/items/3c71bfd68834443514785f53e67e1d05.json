Beginning at about 2:45 a.m. he entered the rooms of Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy who did not survive their attacks. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and her roommate Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Kathy, who later testified in his trial, described seeing only a silhouette of a man wielding a club. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing.
