  "description": "(Have you checked out Fictional? Check out Fictional! There are three episodes waiting for you. Go to https://fictional.fm for more info.) The collection known as \"Arabian Nights\" actually has an overarching story. And it is...interesting. Full of djinn, demons, kings, and slaves, it's an incredibly interesting way to set up one of the best known collections of folklore. The framing narrative (a way to set up a story-within-a-story) is actually much more interesting than many of the stories it sets up, with betrayal, trickery, and probably the most sex and violence we've encountered so far on this podcast. The creature this time is a wise old owl...who doesn't have a problem bringing it in the fight against demons trying to steal your fingernail clippings. ----- Sponsors: Loot Crate! August's box was great, and September's looks even better with the theme of Robotic. Check out http://lootcrate.com/legends (code LEGENDS) to get $3 off your first crate.
