First, they invite Slate culture editor Forrest Wickman on as a straight correspondent to find out what he knows and misunderstands about queer sex, and why the word rosebud has more than one meaning. Next, Christina, Bryan and Brandon discuss how they learned about queer sex, what porn gets right and wrong, and what sorts of lessons belong in sex education. Then, they talk to journalist Anna Franks, who recently wrote about dental dams for the Atlantic, about if dental dams are useful and why they persist.
