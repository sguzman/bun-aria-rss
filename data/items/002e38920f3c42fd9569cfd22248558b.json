She offers multiple strategies for rewiring your own codependence, while raising kids with a strong sense of self.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
