  "title": "Robert Glasper on jazz, basketball, and his score for \"Winning Time\"",
  "description": "Robert Glasper is the only artist to have an album debut in the top 10 of 4 different Billboard charts. He's a musical polymath whose resume ranges from Kendrick Lamar to Herbie Hancock. At the piano, he serves up jazz licks worthy of Mary Lou Williams before segueing into a Nirvana cover. Glasper brings his diverse skill set to bear on his latest project, the score for the HBO series Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, composed in collaboration with \"Succession\" soundtracker Nicholas Britell. It's not just Glasper's musical chops that made him the perfect candidate for the gig: in a past life, he was a baller himself. Nate spoke with Glasper about crafting the sound of the 1980s, improvising soundtrack themes on the spot, and what jazz and basketball have in common.\n\nSongs Discussed\nRobert Glasper - Over, FTB, \"Winning Time\" and \"The Photograph\" Themes\nNicholas Britell - \"Succession\" and \"Moonlight\" Themes\nMorris Day and The Time - Get It Up\nLearn more about your ad choices.
