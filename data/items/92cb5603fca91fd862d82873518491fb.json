  "description": "After three heavy-loaded episodes regarding prayer, if God is in control or not, and the purpose of the Bible, we decided it was time for a long outro!  Mike, Tim and Bonnie sit down to discuss the lot of these things, but landed discussing the point and the practice of prayer.  Why do we pray?  Does it make any difference?  Is there a right or wrong way to pray?  What does it mean when God answers prayers, what does it mean when He doesn’t? \n\nIf you have missed the past few episodes, we encourage you to listen first here: \n\nGod is Not in Control, Part 1 with Tim Gombis: shorturl.at/qGJTZ\n\nWake up Dead Man, Part 2 with Tim Gombis: shorturl.at/ruvMR\n\nHow the Bible Works with Pete Enns: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/241-how-the-bible-works-with-pete-enns/id1049250910?i=1000473548696\n\nAll three of these episodes asked some hard questions and required us all to look at the commonly discussed topics of the Bible and prayer in brand new ways.  This week, on Tuesday May 12 we will also be meeting on Zoom with Tim Gombis (and all of you!) to further discuss these things.
