  "description": "Modern enterprises have evolved drastically over the last two years as a result of the global pandemic. Due in part to organizations pivoting quickly to new business models by migrating apps and services to the cloud to enable hybrid and remote workforces, the “new” office has quickly become the web browser. Today, business users are spending an average of 75% of their workday in a browser – that’s where productivity takes place! But the digital enhancements of the last two years have ushered in widespread transformation that expanded attack surfaces and created new opportunities for cyber miscreants, giving rise to Highly Evasive Advanced Threats (HEAT).\nDuring this episode of CyberWire-X, the CyberWire's Dave Bittner speaks with Dan Prince, Senior Lecturer in Security and Protection Science at the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, about the topic. Show Sponsor Menlo Security's Nick Edwards and Dave explore what HEAT attacks are, how they work, and why they’re resulting in the rise of ransomware attacks and account takeovers.",
