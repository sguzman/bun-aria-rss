  "description": "Jase and Al are on a vacation that includes “EBP” — everybody but Phil. Jase is technically at the beach, but that doesn't mean he actually goes down to the beach. Phil gives Miss Kay a new nickname after her recent lip injury, but she may not be happy with it. Jase describes his experience with the “Chosen Army” and says its members are “high on Jesus.” Ryan Lee, director of One Kingdom, drops by. Larry Bowles recaps the sermon he delivered on Romans 7 at WFR Church on Sunday. And Phil and Jase discuss how much power Satan has.\n\nVisit https://www.onekingdom.org/ for more information about One Kingdom's mission\nLearn more about your ad choices.
