  "description": "<div>On this week's Book Club podcast, Sam is joined by one of the most distinguished poets in the language, Paul Muldoon, to talk about his new book <em>Howdie-Skelp. </em>He tells Sam of his unfashionable belief in inspiration; why he thinks poetry – even his – needn't be difficult just because it's difficult; how writing song lyrics differs from writing poetry; and how he came to work with Sir Paul McCartney. </div>\n",
