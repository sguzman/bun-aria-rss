  "description": "As stimulus is distributed and the market looks forward, it seems everyone is bullish.   But Andrew Horowitz, president and founder of Horowitz & Company and host of The Disciplined Investor, warns that tough year-over-year inflation comparisons are coming up. When it comes to inflation, slowly rising rates are fine… but a quick spike could quickly cause further volatility.   We also discuss one of the hottest topics on Wall Street: environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing. Is this something investors should be paying attention to… or is it merely the latest Wall Street fad? Andrew explains… And, of course, he shares some of his own favorite ideas right now. [29:27]   Speaking of ESG, a research firm has recently placed a sky-high price target on one of the market’s favorite companies in the space: Tesla. In today’s educational segment, Daniel and I debate the firm’s findings.    And, as politicians gear up for a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure package, Daniel shares a few names he expects to benefit from the upcoming legislation.
