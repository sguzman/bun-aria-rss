  "description": "The experiences you carry with you from your past greatly affect how you respond in the future. We are constantly feeding our brain data based on the world and circumstances we live in. Based on these experiences, our brain is able to formulate a ‘best guess’ and, thus, we form our responses. But are we really in control of our responses? Does our brain truly know anything or is everything our brain concludes merely just a ‘best guess’ and nothing more? On this episode of Conversations with Tom, Tom joins neuroscientist, psychologist, and author Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett to discuss such matters and more as they explore how the human brain develops it’s responses to the world and why it’s important for us to not only understand it for our own sake, but for the benefit of others as well. They discuss the difference between emotion and affect, how our brains develop during childhood, how culture is built into our brains, how concepts are formed and used within our brains, what our body budgets are, and why we should be always approach each other with empathy and compassion first.

And if you live in a particular culture, your regulators are going to be really different than somebody in a different culture.” [46:14]   “The important thing to understand is that every experience you have has the capacity to, even a little bit, change your brain’s function in the future.” [53:35]   FOLLOW LISA: Website: lisafeldmanbarrett.com Twitter: twitter.com/LFeldmanBarrett",
