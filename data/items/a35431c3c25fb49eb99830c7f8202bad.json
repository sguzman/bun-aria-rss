  "description": "<p>Tonight my guest is Dallas who is a Native American and he lives in the south. Dallas had two encounters with this creature when he was a young man. He said it reminded him of a “dirty old man.” Dallas goes on to say “It looked like a giant, dirty old man. He had no clothes on and he was very close to my tractor.” You will want to tune in for this one. I will return on Sunday for the members. I have a great show planned with a gentleman from Arizona and he will be sharing his encounters with us.   https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>",
