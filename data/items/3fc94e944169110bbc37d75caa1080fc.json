    "media:description": "Why the Congressional midterms matter so much.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications ðŸ””  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOn January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Bidenâ€™s first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.\n\nThe trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act â€” all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. Thatâ€™s why the 2022 election isnâ€™t just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress â€” itâ€™s a question of who gets that power, and how theyâ€™ll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.\n\nOur buds at Vox.com also did this story in text form if you like reading! https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23435135/2022-midterms-congress-republican-democrat\n\nFor more reporting on the 2022 US midterm elections, read up here: https://bit.ly/3U3aGxB \n\nThere are 9 races that could decide the Senate control.
