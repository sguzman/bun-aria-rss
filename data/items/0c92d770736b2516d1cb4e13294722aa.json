  "description": "<p>After this past weekend hit them like a ton of bricks (Bow more so), the jester besties share their thoughts on the chaos of Pride, and how the new tradition may actually be to Be a Bitch to Any Old Acquaintance In Your Immediate Vicinity This Pride. Reflections on the already-historic/histrionic Madonna Boom Boom Room party take up their necessary space as the boys talk about the expectations vs. reality of any situation, but particularly how it hits different when you smoke some wild-ass reefer. After some choice words about quote-tweet culture and on the beginnings of Drag Race All Stars 6, Bowen randomly starts getting emotional about what Conan O’Brien means to him which is probably due to drugs but he still means it. IDTSHs eventually open up discussions about Jamie Lynn Spears’s fecklessness and ice at parties before the boys close on their quick thoughts about “Planet Her” and the new Tyler, The Creator. It’s a wild one, folks.
