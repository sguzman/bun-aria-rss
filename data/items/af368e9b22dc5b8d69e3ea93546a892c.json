  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys look more at the Conference Championship matchups and whether or not Patrick Mahomes is going to be able to start against the Bills, the narrative of Brady vs. Rodgers, and welcome three great guests. First, like he has every week this season, QB of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers joins Pat and AJ to recap last weekend's game against the Rams, how he is so comfortable, his thoughts on this week's matchup against the Bucs, how much media porn Brady vs. Rodgers is, and what his state of mind has been like, and why it looks like he's having so much damn fun (19:57-1:04:41). Next, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, the highest paid Safety in NFL History, Budda Baker joins the program to chat about his playing style, not being afraid of anything, why he thinks he might get fined or flagged more than others, what offense is difficult to prepare for, if he's ever been to Kliff Kingsbury's house, and getting caught by DK Metcalf (1:06:26-1:30:41). Later, Hall of Famer, 6x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, one of the greatest WR's to ever play the game, Terrell Owens joins the program to chat about his career and how the media had a fair say in how he's perceived, his new wine company, 81Vino, if he ever tried to battle his persona, where he thinks he ranks all-time, who the greatest of all-time is, what kind of numbers he'd put up today, and much more (1:32:53-2:00:15).
