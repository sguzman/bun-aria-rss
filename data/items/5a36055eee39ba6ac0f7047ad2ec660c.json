Due to the description, OSP was called to the scene where they confirmed the license plate. There is a badly decomposed body seatbelted in the driver's seat, who will likely be identified as my father. Due to the location, and limited amount of daylight remaining, the vehicle and scene were secured by OSP and left overnight to recover first thing this morning.

I guess it does provide some relief just knowing we have him now and can say our proper goodbyes. Hopefully now we can start determining exactly what happened to him.
