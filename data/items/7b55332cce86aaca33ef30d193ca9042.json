  "description": "<p>The collective properties of final state hadrons produced in the high\nstatistics $_{44}^{96}$Ru+$_{44}^{96}$Ru and $_{40}^{96}$Zr+$_{40}^{96}$Zr\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 200~\\mathrm{GeV}$ are found to be\nsignificantly different. Such differences were argued to be precise probes of\nthe difference in nucleon distribution in the isobar nuclei. We investigate the\n$J/\\psi$ production in the isobar collision via a relativistic transport\napproach. By comparing the isobar systems according to equal centrality bin and\nequal multiplicity bin, we find that the yield ratio of $J/\\psi$ is sensitive\nto the differences in both the number of binary collisions and the medium\nevolution. Besides, the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $J/\\psi$ is qualitatively\ndifferent from the light hadrons, and the ratio between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr\ncollisions is sensitive to the medium evolution. The charmonium production\nprovides an independent probe to study the nucleon distribution in the isobar\nsystem.\n</p>",
