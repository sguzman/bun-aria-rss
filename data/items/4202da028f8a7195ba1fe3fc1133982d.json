  "description": "<p>For much of its history, the United States has had a single law on the books that governs when the president can deploy the military to enforce federal law within the United States: the Insurrection Act. While the act hasn't been invoked in decades, it played an important role in several recent controversies, including the acts of Jan. 6. Now, some scholars have <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/statement-january-6th-committee-reforming-insurrection-act\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">written</a> the Jan. 6 commission, urging that it be included in the broader set of reforms that committee is reportedly getting ready to endorse.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more, <em>Lawfare</em> senior editor Scott R. Anderson sat down with the two authors of the recent submission to the committee: Liza Goitein, senior director of the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, and her colleague Joseph Nunn, counsel at the same program. They discussed the history of the Insurrection Act, what they think makes it dangerous, and how Congress should try to fix it.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
