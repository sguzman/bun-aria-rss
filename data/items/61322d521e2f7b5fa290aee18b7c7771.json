If so, how do you engage leadership to renegotiate terms? We'll tackle this and more on this Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!

The problem: you remember them, but they don't remember you. <strong>How can you stand out?</strong></li>\n<li>You want to leave factory life behind and relocate closer to your kids, <strong>but you're 40 and don't have the skills for a different job.</strong> What's your best next step?</li>\n<li>Even though you're curious about your own genetics, <strong>are you right to be wary of the potential privacy concerns that arise from taking a home DNA test?</strong></li>\n<li>You're speaking at a conference on behalf of your company where many industry leaders will be attending. <strong>How can you best network during your time offstage?</strong></li>\n<li>You've lost respect for a friend who would rather waste their money than repay an old debt. <strong>Is this resolvable, or is it time for the friendship to move on?</strong></li>\n<li>Life Pro Tip: <strong>Don't just thank someone when they do something for you.
