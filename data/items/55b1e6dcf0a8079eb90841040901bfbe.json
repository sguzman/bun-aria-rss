Despite this, her husband insists on hanging out with his buddies every night to watch sports games. OP goes into labor, and her husband refuses to come take her to the hospital because the game isn't over yet. He even lies to her and tells her that he's on the way, when in reality he was just hanging with his friends, watching the game. OP eventually had to call another relative to take her to the hospital.</p>\n",
