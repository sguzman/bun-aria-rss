  "description": "We always talk about how life is too short but the question I want you to think about is - Is life actually short or are we speeding it up? We are constantly trying to keep ourselves busy and entertained and I have found that doing so actually makes time feel like it is moving faster. When we slow down time slows down. In this episode I talk about how I figured this out and how you can use this in your life as well.<br> <br>The link I speak about in the episode is MWFmotivation.com/episode103<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
