On Sept. 9 and 10, instead of being home in Pinehurst, North Carolina, with his wife and two daughters, Stayskal was in Washington, D.C. trying to drum up support for his namesake legislation, the SFC Richard Stayskal Military Medical Accountability Act, which would allow service members to sue the government for certain medical malpractice incidents.  President Trump has signed the bill, but it needs to pass the Senate and is currently being blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham.  We need your help.  3 weeks ago we discussed this story on air and Richard was kind enough to drive down and do the show, but he needs other voices to speak out as well.  Please contact anyone you know and share his story!</p>\n\n\nAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands\n\nPrivacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",
