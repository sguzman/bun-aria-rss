  "description": "The first round of the 2018 NFL Draft is in the books so Ryan Wilson and John Breech join Will Brinson to break down all the action and figure out who won and lost. The guys divide the draft into three sections -- 1-10, 11-20, 21-32 -- and pick a winner and loser from each, then give an overarching theme for the draft and close it out by looking at what might happen on the second day of the draft. Winners include the Ravens for landing Lamar Jackson, the Chargers for stealing Derwin James and the Packers for their Jaire Alexander play. Losers include the Saints for the price to move up and Josh Allen for having the weight of Buffalo on his shoulders.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
