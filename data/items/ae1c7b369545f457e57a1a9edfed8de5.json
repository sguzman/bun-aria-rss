  "description": "<div>Watch Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore with the MuggleCasters in our movie commentary track! We had a ton of fun watching the movie together and making sense of everything that's going on. What are each character's motives? What are we noticing now that we're watching in the comfort of our own homes? Even the credits had a surprise that a couple of us weren't aware of! We discuss every moment of the movie as we watch it together!<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>The Secrets of Dumbledore was just released on HBO Max, and now you can watch the movie in real time with your Harry Potter friends (Us). You will need to bring your own copy of the movie to get the full experience. Currently it's available on HBO Max and will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital at the end of June.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>At the beginning of the episode we help you sync up with us. Our sync point is just after the WB logo flies past the camera. For us, this was 53 seconds into the movie, but your timecode may differ if you don't have a HBO ad at the beginning.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>This week's episode is sponsored by BetterHelp (Get 10% off your first month at <a href=\"https://www.BetterHelp.com/mugglecast\">BetterHelp.com/mugglecast</a>) and Masterclass (Get 15% off an annual subscription by visiting <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/mugglecast\">Masterclass.com/mugglecast</a>).<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
