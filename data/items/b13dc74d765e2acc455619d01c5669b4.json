  "title": "Anne Willan on Cookbooks, Culinary School, and Julia Child",
  "description": "Some might know Anne Willan as the doyenne of La Varenne, the influential culinary school she ran in Paris and Burgundy, but she’s also the author of more than 30 cookbooks, including her latest, 'Women in the Kitchen,' '12 Essential Cookbook Writers who Defined the Way We Eat, from 1661 to Today.' Anne joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about everything from the early days of La Varenne to her friend Julia Child and the antiquarian cookbook collection that Anne and her husband, the late Mark Cherniavsky, donated to the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. Anne reflects on her life as an author, historian, and teacher and you don’t want to miss it. \nToday’s show is supported by the sponsors of The Julia Jubilee: Kerrygold, Crate&Barrel, Whole Foods Market, Le Creuset, San Pellegrino, and Kobrand Fine Wine & Spirits. \n",
