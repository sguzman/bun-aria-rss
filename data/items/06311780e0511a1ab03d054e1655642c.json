  "title": "Waiver Wire! Brace for the Byenado! (10/19 Fantasy Football Podcast)",
  "description": "There is some serious talent on bye this week, so let's hope you don't have to drop anyone too valuable to make a waiver claim for Week 7. Before we get to the waiver wire, how about Derrick Henry!? Is he a sell high? What would it take for the Henry manager to trade him away? ... Best waiver wire options in shallower leagues (6:45), in deeper leagues (12:50) and in \"normal\" leagues (13:40)! In shallower leagues, keep an eye out for J.D. McKissic, Zach Ertz, Dallas Goedert and Kadarius Toney. In deeper leagues, you've got the Browns and Ravens RBs to consider. And for the leagues we address most often, Sterling Shepard is a headliner but how does he compare to Devonta Freeman and D'Ernest Johnson? Also, keep in mind this might be the week to save your waiver wire priority (24:00), but we'll also have a FAB discussion if you need to make moves (30:00) ... News and notes (32:00) and the Top 3 at each position: QB (35:00), RB (37:15), WR (38:10), TE (41:00), DST (43:50) and Kicker. ... Recapping Bills-Titans (45:50), getting the Dropometer out (52:35) and taking a longer look at the waiver wire (55:00) with IDP suggestions at the very end of the show ...
