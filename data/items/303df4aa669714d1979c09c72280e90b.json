  "description": "<p>The parable of the prodigal son gives us incredible insights about how the grace of God creates a unique kind of Christian community. The one thing everybody knows when you read the parable of the prodigal son is that it's about forgiveness.</p>\n<p>What does this story teach us about forgiveness? What kind of community would we be if we took its teaching about forgiveness seriously? In this sermon, we'll see that forgiveness is assertive, it’s sacrificial, it’s powered from inside, and it leads to a resurrection.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 26, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:11-24.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
