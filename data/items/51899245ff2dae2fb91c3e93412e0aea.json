One mother of a newborn had such bad namer's remorse, she poured out her heart to strangers online. Speaking of mothers and daughters: Laura Ingalls Wilder didn't write the \"Little House on the Prairie\" series alone. She had help from her daughter Rose--who turned out to be quite a demanding editor. And where in the world would you find an upstairs basement? Plus: scat singing, jook joints, makes no nevermind, from hell to breakfast, dog pound vs. animal shelter, and what you're supposed to do in an upstairs basement.FULL DETAILSGiving your baby an uncommon name may seem like a swell idea. But what if you're the parent of a newborn and you already have namer’s remorse? A potch or putch is a slap, as in potch in tuchis. This term for spanking related to German Patsch, meaning \"a slap.\" A listener in Springfield, New Hampshire, says her family also used the term potching around to describe her mischievous behavior as a toddler.Scat singing doesn't have any relation to scat, as in \"excrement.\" Musical scat probably derives from the sound of one of the nonsense syllables in such songs.Sitzfleisch, from German words that literally mean \"sit-flesh,\" refers to perseverance--the ability, in other words, to sit and endure something for a long period of time. How is Betsy Ross like tight pants? Our Quiz Guy John Chaneski wants to know.The term dog pound sounds a lot more menacing than animal shelter, until you learn that pound simply has to do with the idea of an enclosed space, as does a pond, which is often formed by enclosing a space and filling it with water.A jook joint is a roadside establishment where all sorts of drinking, dancing, and gambling may occur. Zora Neale Hurston described them in her 1934 essay \"Characteristics of Negro Expression,\" and the term probably derives from a West African term for \"jumping around.\" We've talked before about the term wasband, as in, ex-husband.
