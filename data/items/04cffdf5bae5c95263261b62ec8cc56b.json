  "description": "If you've been with us since Episode 2 you may remember Joe painfully discussing his childhood crush not giving him the time of day in 6th grade. Well, as usual, Twitter found her; so we reached out and brought her onto the podcast as our first guest to discuss her role in Joe's path to relationship destruction! We'll just name Episode 6, \"OLS -1\". Subscribe on iTunes & comment below so Marisa can reply back to you in anger lol.",
