  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.jedidiahjenkins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jedidiah Jenkins</a> is a storyteller, adventurer and powerful advocate for intentional living.</p><p>Leaving behind his training in law to tap a lifelong gift for storytelling and a deep heart of service, Jedidiah joined the team at Invisible Children. They would eventually launch the KONY 2012 campaign, producing a video that went massively viral with more than 100-million views in the first week. This both shined the light on a nation in dire need, but also brought on a fierce backlash that led to a lot of pain and self-exploration.</p><p>As he neared his 30th birthday, Jedidiah started feeling called to commit to a powerful personal quest. So, he made the frightening decision to leave a job he loved to pursue an untested dream: bicycling to Patagonia and writing a book about it. From the cartels of Mexico, to the mega-churches of the US, to the Amazon in Bolivia, he&nbsp;has&nbsp;seen some crazy things.</p><p>In this week's episode, we explore his epic journey, and the adventures still yet to come.</p><p><strong>Rockstar Sponsors:</strong></p><p><strong>RXBAR Kids</strong> is a snack bar made with high-quality, real ingredients designed specifically for kids.
