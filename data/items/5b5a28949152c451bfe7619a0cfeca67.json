  "description": "Sponsor: Home Title Lock: Everything is stored online these days - including your home's title information. Domestic and international cyber-thieves target U.S. homeowners equity in their homes. Removing you from your home's title takes just minutes. Then they forge their name on the title document and refile it. Next, they take out loans using your home's equity and stick you with the payments. You likely won't know until you get a late payment or foreclosure notice from several banks. Identity theft programs, banks, and homeowner insurance policies DON'T protect you. For pennies a day, Home Title Lock posts a virtual perimeter around your home's online title and mortgage information. https://HomeTitleLock.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
