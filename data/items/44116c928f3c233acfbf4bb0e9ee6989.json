  "description": "<p>In our first episode of 2020, we tackle the idea of success. Many of us have been planning for the new year, but what is it that we want to achieve? Is money the ultimate measure of success? Is recognition more important? What about our success as a friend or spouse or parent? In this episode, we dig into our own personal definitions and, as with most things, we find that there is no one right answer. We also discuss how much our ideas of success change over time - what we wanted at 25 is never going to be the same as what we want 20 years later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our conversation also covers second-hand art books, a Tate Modern exhibition that Alice <em>really</em> didn't like, and the newest star on Tik-Tok (the world's fastest growing social media platform).</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Wait list for Connected Artist Club: <a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/artists\">https://www.alicesheridan.com/artists</a></p>\n<p>Charlie D'Amelio on Tik-Tok: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF0ysSzsNFc&t=56s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF0ysSzsNFc&t=56s</a></p>\n<p>Gary Vee interviews Charli D'Amelio: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpEszCguMJU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpEszCguMJU</a></p>\n<p>Olafur Eliasson at Tate Modern: <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson\">https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Youtube millionaire: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SunnyLenarduzzi\">https://www.youtube.com/user/SunnyLenarduzzi</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
