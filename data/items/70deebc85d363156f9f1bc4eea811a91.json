Going shopping at night wasn’t unusual for her, and being right before Christmas and just days before her oldest daughter’s birthday, no one thought twice about it. But at midnight that night, Michele’s husband woke up their 14 year-old daughter, Amanda, worried that her mom had not come home.</p><p>Michele never returned, and neither her, nor her van have ever been seen since.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Michele Hundley Smith, please contact the<strong> </strong>Rockingham County Sheriff’s Office at 336-634-3232.</p><p>You can follow Michele’s case on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Bring-Michele-Hundley-Smith-Home-2057060437846688/\" target=\"_blank\">Bring Michele Hundley Smith Home</a>.</p><p>The episode was co-researched and written by Marissa Jones and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://agpstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Anna Priestland</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://getquip.com/vanished\" target=\"_blank\">Quip</a>- If you go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://getquip.com/vanished\" target=\"_blank\">Getquip.com/vanished</a>&nbsp;right now, you'll get your first refill pack FREE with a QUIP electric toothbrush.</p><p><a href=\"http://betabrand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Betabrand-</a> Get 20% off Betabrand's dress pant yoga pants by visiting <a href=\"http://betabrand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">betabrand.com</a>&nbsp;and using code VANISHED.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
