  "description": "<div>The European Green Deal is one of the landmarks of Ursula von der Leyen's Commission. But, without an ambitious investment behind it, what could be its potential implications for the EU? Could it go as far as to threaten the EU's single market? This week, Renew Europe's vice-president, MEP Luis Garicano, joins Guntram Wolff and Maria Demertzis to discuss not only the European Green Deal but also the EU Budget and the Banking Union. <br>\n<br>\nDisclaimer: this episode was recorded on the 20th of February, before Bruegel hosted the event \"The Ressurection of the European Banking Union\". </div>\n",
