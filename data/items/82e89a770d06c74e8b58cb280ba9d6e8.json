  "description": "As we anticipate months more of lockdown and efforts at recovery, at further tragic loss of life and catastrophic economic dislocation, it is clear that we are living through an era-defining event. Such events typically shape the outlook of generations and lead to shifts in priorities, program, and even the distribution of wealth and power in society. What will the consequences of this era's upheaval be? We speak with the Center for Global Development's Jeremy Konyndyk, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law and Edward Luce of the Financial Times to discuss. We also cover whether there is any cause for optimism in recent news and what caveats should be added to hopes for an early return to \"normalcy.\" A great discussion. Please join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
