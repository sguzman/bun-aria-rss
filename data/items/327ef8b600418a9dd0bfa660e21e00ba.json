Have you been avoiding certain groups of people because the environment is so toxic? Have you caught yourself wondering after a conversation if you, in fact, were the one being difficult with someone else? While each scenario is different, the solution is nearly the same, and it requires you to show up as your best self even when it’s difficult. We can’t control other people’s emotions and responses but we are in control of our own. Leading with kindness when you encounter difficult people is the best way to ensure that you have meaningful relationships and conversations with others. You’re not always going to agree, but you can disagree and seek to understand where you may be wrong to make sure you have the healthiest relationships with family, friends, and teammates.<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />0:00 | Introduction<br />1:34 | Toxicity In the Family<br />8:12 | Aggressive People In Denial<br />13:15 | Can’t Accept They’re Wrong<br />17:41 | Steel Man the Argument<br />23:16 | Dealing With Obnoxious People<br />26:32 | Know If You’re Being Difficult<br />29:00 | Keep Arguments Grounded<br />33:49 | Give People Space To Process<br />36:07 | Ending Difficulty for Harmony<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“It is okay for people to have a negative opinion about you.” [3:16]<br /> <br />“Anything that stops you from seeing yourself clearly, is something that holds you back.
