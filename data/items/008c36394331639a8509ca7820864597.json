  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nAlexandra Spence expands on her relationship to objects and how she translates their textures and histories into sound; the development of her practice and its relation to landscape; and shares reflections on her new album Blue waves, Green waves.\n\nAlexandra Spence is a sound artist and musician attempting to reimagine the intricate relationships between the listener, the object, and the surrounding environment. Her aesthetic favours field recordings, analogue technologies and object interventions. She holds the belief that electricity might actually be magic.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/adam-golebiewski-eva-birch-with-j-alexandra-spence\n\nRitual Community Music\n24 July 2022\nThe Oratory, Abbotsford Convent\nPresented by Abbotsford Convent and Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: Joseph Mayers\n\nProduced by Mara Schwerdtfeger. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
