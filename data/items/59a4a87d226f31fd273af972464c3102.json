They also discuss Facebook possibly banning political ads, and why it's a cop-out. They go deeper on the issue with Friend of Pivot Rashad Robinson, the Executive Director of Color of Change, who has been meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg after helping to organize the July ad boycott of the platform.
