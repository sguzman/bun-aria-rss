  "description": "How do we help our kids learn to love learning? Well, guess what: It has nothing to do with success or achievement ... instead, it has everything to do with tolerating the frustration of the working process. The more we help our kids manage the feelings that come up as they work hard, struggle, and try again, the more they will embrace challenges and bounce back from failures.   In this Deep Dive episode, Dr. Becky chats with Susie Allison, the childhood education advocate and mom of three behind @busytoddler, about teaching kids to embrace and even love the learning process. They share as many deep thoughts about child development as practical ideas for engaging your child in fun, enriching play. And most importantly, the two remind all of us that learning is a life-long process: As parents, we need to embrace our own \"not knowing yet\" stages, too.<p/> \n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
