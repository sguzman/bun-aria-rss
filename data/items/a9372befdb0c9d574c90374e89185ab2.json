It is within this setting that makeup artist, model, and visual chameleon Alexis Stone joins Trixie and Katya to talk about art, science, and precisely where the two meet.\n\nFollow Alexis: @TheAlexisStone\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TrixieKatyaYT\n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
