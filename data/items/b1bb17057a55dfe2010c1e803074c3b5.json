  "description": "WILLOW's first single, \"Whip My Hair,\" came out just shy of the singer's 10th birthday. Now 21, she's returned with her fifth full-length album, titled <em><COPINGMECHANISM></em>. The record has big arena-rock vibes to go with its spiky pop-punk songcraft, and it effectively captures WILLOW's gift for conveying deeply felt emotions and the thrum of anxiety. We've also got new albums from genre-smashing singer, rapper and multi-instrumentalist NNAMDÏ, arty rapper Open Mike Eagle, dance-music producer TSHA and the venerated space-jazz ensemble Sun Ra Arkestra. <br/><br/><strong>Featured Albums: <br/></strong><br/>1. WILLOW — <em><COPINGMECHANISM></em> <br/>Featured Songs: \"WHY?,\" \"ur a <stranger>\" <br/>2. NNAMDÏ — <em>Please Have a Seat</em> <br/>Featured Songs: \"Armoire,\" \"ANXIOUS EATER,\" \"Careful\" <br/>3. Open Mike Eagle — <em>Component System With the Auto Reverse</em> <br/>Featured Songs: \"79th and Stony Island,\" \"I Retired Then I Changed My Mind,\" \"Peak Lockdown Raps\" <br/>4. TSHA — <em>Capricorn Sun <br/></em>Featured Songs: \"OnlyL (feat. Nimmo),\" \"Giving Up (feat. Mafro),\" \"Running,\" \"Sister,\" \"Anxious Mind (feat. Clementine Douglas)\" <br/>5. Sun Ra Arkestra — <em>Living Sky</em> <br/>Featured Songs: \"Somebody Else's Idea,\" \"Marshall's Groove,\" \"Night of the Living Sky,\" \"Firefly\" <br/><br/><strong>Lightning Round: <br/></strong><br/>Quavo & Takeoff — <em>Only Built for Infinity Links</em> <br/>Fatnice — <em>Vanglorious</em> <br/>Say She She — <em>Prism</em> <br/>Collapsing Stars — <em>Chapter</em>",
