  "description": "<p>Sam Tripoli, Jason Rouse, and Chris Neff joined me, Ari Shaffir, in the old phone room at the Comedy Store to talk about the comedy tour we all went on 2 years prior. It was one of the funnest months of my life. It was the opposite of any road gig I've ever done. We drove from gig to gig, we slept 3 to a room at cheap motels and we did a lot of drugs. Join us as we recap the adventure.</p>",
