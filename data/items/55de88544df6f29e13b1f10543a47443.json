  "description": "<p>The goal of this paper is to establish a complete Khintchine-Groshev type\ntheorem in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous setting, on analytic\nnondegenerate manifolds over a local field of positive characteristic. The dual\nform of Diophantine approximation has been considered here. Our treatise\nprovides the function field analogues of the various earlier results of this\ntype, studied in the euclidean and S-adic framework, by Bernik, Kleinbock and\nMargulis [10], Beresnevich, Bernik, Kleinbock and Margulis [3], Badziahin,\nBeresnevich and Velani [4], Mohammadi and Golsefidy [38, 39] and Datta and\nGhosh [13].\n</p>",
