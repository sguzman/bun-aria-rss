  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the stock market hasn't been this bad since 1932 and if President Biden doesn't improve his handling of the economy we will go from a recession to a depression. Every time a nation goes into a recession the government gets stronger and the individual gets weaker. The electrical grid already faces brown-outs and blackouts in California and that can be expected to spread across the country. California is already facing an electric vehicle (EV) problem. Even though there are still gas-fueled cars, the current amount of electric vehicles is already impacting citizens because the electrical grid cannot re-charge the 7 million cars that currently exist. Once all Americans have electric vehicles the country is expected to have 400 million electric cars to charge, how will we charge all of them? Then, the Marxists’ plan to incrementally increase the presence of socialism in American economic policy is right on track. They have drained our strategic oil reserves to create the problems that they wish to solve. Democrats have not made any policies that strengthen our economy, not a single one. Later, Professor Michael Eric Dyson says that the Constitution was built on White supremacy and that critiques of CRT are rooted in White people's fears of becoming the minority. This destructive ideology is what is being taught in Dyson's course at Vanderbilt University. Afterward, it’s now being reported that pro-abortion activists are calling to burn down the supreme court and murder the justices and their clerks. Yet Sen. Amy Klobuchar seemingly doesn't understand federalism and thinks that states should not decide abortion cases for themselves. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
