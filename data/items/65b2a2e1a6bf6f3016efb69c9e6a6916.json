  "itunes:summary": "In Rorschach Audio: Art & Illusion for Sound, British sound artist and writer Joe Banks offers a critical account of Spiritualistic and allegedly supernatural Electronic Voice Phenomena (ghost­voice) recordings, tracing the uncanny phenomena back through the histories of art, literature and the little-known audio monitoring work by UK wartime intelligence agencies. Via a series of fascinating and bizarre psychoacoustic illusions Banks argues that ‘the earliest form of sound recording technology was not a machine but was written language’.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/lecture-rorschach-audio/\n\nHistories and Theories of Sound\n3 June, 2015\nGertrude Contemporary, Fitzroy\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Monash University Museum of Art | MUMA\n\nAudio: Mara Schwerdtfeger\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
