  "description": "After two years of wearing easy cheese-stained sweatpants and that vintage Cher 'Do You Believe?' tour t-shirt, it's time to re-visit your closet and break out those accessories. While dainty chains, layered strands, and zodiac trinkets have been en vogue this past summer, it's time to step out into the crisp, fall air with some bold bijoux that tells everyone around you, \"I'm a Winner.\" Made from only the most affordable raw copper on the market, the \"Winner\" necklace is the must-have accessory as you sip your pumpkin spice latte and pleasure yourself in the park to the fiery foliage this autumn. While your parents, family, and teachers may have never said it, we here at Bald, LLC want you to know that in our humble opinion, you're the epitome of a winner.\nDownload Karma Now: https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyayt\nWatch the full Karma Now commercial: https://lpkarmanow.onelink.me/nSgX/TrixieandKatyawatch\nCancel unnecessary subscriptions now with RocketMoney!
