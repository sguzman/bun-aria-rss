  "description": "<p>Despite what conventional medicine has told us, type 1 diabetes is not a sentence for a heavy reliance on insulin. For many people, a diet that carefully monitors carb intake can dramatically reduce blood sugar swings and reduce the amount of insulin needed.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Keto (or the ketogenic diet) has gotten a lot of buzz lately, and this fat-heavy very low-carb approach to eating is showing some promise for diabetics and many other metabolic diseases as well. With that being said, there is no perfect diet for everyone, and each person needs to find what works best for them. One of my guests on this week’s Doctor’s Farmacy podcast, Dr. Carrie Diulus, has found vegan keto is the best approach for managing her type 1 diabetes and maintaining a healthy weight. We’re also joined by Dr. Ethan Weiss, who’s been steadily in ketosis for about 2 years using a plant-heavy, mostly pescatarian keto approach.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market and SomniFix.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule. Not only does Thrive offer 25 to 50% off all of my favorite brands, but they also give back. For every membership purchased, they give a membership to a family in need, and they make it easy to find the right membership for you and your family. You can choose from 1-month, 3-month, or 12-month plans. And right now, Thrive is offering all <em>Doctor's Farmac</em>y listeners a great deal, you’ll get up to $20 in shopping credit when you sign up, to spend on all your own favorite natural food, body, and household items.
