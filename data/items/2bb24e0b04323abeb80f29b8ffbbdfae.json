  "description": "2011-09-07 - Finding The Juice Inside of Fear - Learning to bring a mindful presence to fear is an intrinsic part of spiritual awakening. In this talk we look at the ways we get caught in the trance of fear, and how the two wings of presence--clear recognition and openheartedness--can free us.  This process of facing unmet fears is necessary not only for our own healing, but for any possibility of peace and the healing of our planet.
