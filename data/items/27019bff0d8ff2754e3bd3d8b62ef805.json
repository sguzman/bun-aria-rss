Rozum, the author of Grasslands Grown: Creating Place on the U.S. Northern Plains and Canadian Prairies (U of Nebraska P & U of Manitoba P, 2021). Molly Rozum is currently the Ronald R.

The mission of The Champlain Society is to increase public awareness of, and accessibility to, Canada’s rich store of historical records.\nGregory P.
