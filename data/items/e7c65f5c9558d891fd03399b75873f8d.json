  "description": "<p>It’s Christmas!!!! But slightly different in 2020. With the coronavirus still here and a full rollout of a vaccine still distant, there might be many who face Christmas on their own or not seeing many people. Therefore Pete and Gav thought it would be the right thing to do and create another economics of Christmas! So sit down with your drink of choice, get in your favourite chair and listen to your friendly neighbourhood economists as they go through 10 questions that will teach you some economics and provide some festive cheer! You can even have a go at a Christmas quiz - can you recognise ‘Merry Christmas’ in 10 different languages or at least beat Pete’s score? &nbsp; Technical support (and jingle bells) as always comes from St. Nic. Music comes from Jukedeck and you can create your own at <a href=\"http://jukedeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jukedeck.com</a>. Have a merry Christmas everyone!!!</p>\n",
