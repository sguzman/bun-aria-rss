  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Giants and the Washington Football Team and how it is a \"Something's Gotta Give\" Game of sorts with a lot of pressure on Danny Dimes, and Washington looking to get in the win column after a tough week one loss to the Chargers, plus Pat dives into his risk free parlay tonight on FanDuel. Joining the program is 11 year NFL veteran, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, starting Quarterback for the Houston Texans, Tyrod Taylor. Pat and Tyrod chat about keeping the noise outside of the team out of the building, his impressive performance week 1 against Jacksonville, if he ever reflects on how he might be the unluckiest QB of all-time, if he knew he would have to have a massive leadership role for this team to be successful, and what Jack Easterby is like (16:58-28:50). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion, Head Coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mike Tomlin joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his team this year, how he's adapted to the change in locker rooms over time, some old stories of his interactions with Pat, how incredible his defense is, and much much more in an incredible conversation (39:56-58:48). Later, NFL Network Insider and friend of the program, Ian Rapoport joins the show for his weekly RapSheet Wrap Up to cover all the loose ends floating around and what we need to know as he we head into week 2 of the NFL season (58:50-1:17:04).
