  "description": "<p>We had to do it. After 12 years and <em>3,000,000x</em> appreciation, we kick off Season 8 with the best investment of all-time and our biggest episode ever: Bitcoin. From the first bitcoin transaction of 10k for two Papa John's pizzas (worth about $350m today!!) to $40k+ BTC and maybe the moon beyond, we cover the whole crazy, improbable journey of how a single 8-page PDF document changed the world of money — and perhaps the world itself — forever.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you love Acquired and want more, join our LP Community for access to over 50 LP-only episodes, monthly Zoom calls, and live access for big events like emergency pods and book club discussions with authors. We can't wait to see you there. <strong>Join here at: <a href= \"https://acquired.fm/lp/\">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> The Bitcoin Playbook:</strong></p> <p>(also available on our website at <a href= \"https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin\">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/bitcoin</a> )</p> <p><strong>1. Technological paradigm shifts are ideal opportunities for attacking incumbents.</strong></p> <ul> <li>The traditional finance system worked fantastically well for 500 years, but it wasn't built for the internet. The fact that sharing your bank account or credit card number is required in order to transact, but there's no really robust way to protect against fraud when doing so, provided the perfect seam for a new entrant. Bitcoin and its creators saw this shortcoming and created a new form of money that worked like email.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. In the early days of a network-effect system, usage matters more than use-cases.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Because the value of a network grows as a function of Metcalfe's Law (value = # of engaged participants squared), in the early days simply growing the number of engaged participants matters more than the specifics of what those participants are actually doing. As the network's value grows, it will become attractive to successively more groups of users and use cases.</li> <li>Bitcoin started as the domain of researchers and fringe libertarians, then illicit transactions (Silk Road), then speculation (the ICO boom) before finally reaching adoption by the mainstream investment community. Each wave built enough monetary value in the network to make it attractive to the next set of users. Similarly Facebook went from sharing photos of attractive undergrads to how billions communicate, and Airbnb went from ratty airbeds to ~10x larger than any hotel chain, all within a few short years.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Distributing network value out to its participants creates large incentives for adoption.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rewarding miners with bitcoin itself created a huge incentive for participants to join and stay in the Bitcoin network. Although this dynamic got a bad rap during the ICO bubble when it was overused and overpromised by grifters and scammers, it remains a powerful strategy and will likely be used more going forward.</li> <li>Perhaps most excitingly, this incentive unlocks massive new potential for open-source software development: people who work on open-source software (or provide other functions) can now receive direct value for their contributions, without being employed in any traditional sense.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Just HODL, baby.</strong> (aka let your winners run)</p> <ul> <li>You can get rich quickly by getting in early on a winning investment. But you can only get <em>really</em> rich by holding a compounding asset for an extended period of time. Sequoia learned this lesson painfully with its Apple investment in the 1970's: selling its entire position for just a ~$6m profit within a few years. Similarly, anyone who bought 1,000 bitcoin for $10 a piece in 2012 could have sold them for $1m four years later in 2016. But four years on from that, they're now worth $35 million. If you continue to believe Bitcoin has a bright longterm future (which, to be fair, you may not!), what could they be worth in 2024?</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. We're only just realizing the implications of digital scarcity.</strong></p> <ul> <li>For its entire existence before Bitcoin, computing and the internet was all about turning scarcity into abundance. (via infinitely replicable + easily distributable software and other digital goods) For the first time in history, Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain have introduced the opposite: scarce, non-replicable digital assets. Native digital currency (Bitcoin) and smart contracts (Ethereum) are the first big outcomes of this advancement, but there may be many more seismic shifts to come.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Satoshi's Whitepaper: <a href= \"https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf\">https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf</a></li> <li>Matt Huang's \"Bitcoin for the Open-Minded Skeptic\": <a href= \"https://www.paradigm.xyz/Bitcoin_For_The_Open_Minded_Skeptic.pdf\">https://www.paradigm.xyz/Bitcoin_For_The_Open_Minded_Skeptic.pdf</a></li> <li>Nellie Bowles's \"Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You’re Not\": <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html</a></li> <li>Square’s $50m investment in BTC: <a href= \"https://images.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5sXNrlEh2mEnTvvhgtYOm2/737bcfdc15e2a1c3cbd9b9451710ce54/Square_Inc._Bitcoin_Investment_Whitepaper.pdf\"> https://images.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5sXNrlEh2mEnTvvhgtYOm2/737bcfdc15e2a1c3cbd9b9451710ce54/Square_Inc._Bitcoin_Investment_Whitepaper.pdf</a><br />  <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Episode Sources:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Full list of episode sources available here: <a href= \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QCDNm2qzG3Bn5h1j1KXisxL_JGT7egDx7czX9ThHLY/edit?usp=sharing\"> https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QCDNm2qzG3Bn5h1j1KXisxL_JGT7egDx7czX9ThHLY/edit?usp=sharing</a> </li> </ul>",
