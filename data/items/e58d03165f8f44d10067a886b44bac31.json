  "description": "What is the role of evidence in the policy process? In The Politics of Evidence: From Evidence-Based Policy to the Good Governance of Evidence (Routledge, 2016), Justin Parkhurst, Associate Professor of Global Health Policy at the London School of Economics, maps the history of evidence based policy making and offers a new model for the good governance of appropriate evidence in policy. The book is both agenda setting and a detailed and insightful overview of evidence in policy. Moreover, the range of examples shows the importance of understanding the norms and values shaping politics and thus setting the circumstances for evidence use. In the complex and contested current context for evidence in policy, the book makes an important intervention charting the possibility of a more transparent form of decision making and a more evidence informed approach to policy. The book is available as an open access version here.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
