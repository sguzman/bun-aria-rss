  "title": "Ep 120 | Who Is More Evil: Government or Facebook? | Robby Soave | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "The Left and Right agree: Social media companies like Facebook are abusing their power — whether through censorship or harmful, groupthink-creating algorithms. But is the solution really more censorship and regulation, like government fearmongers and leftist “whistleblowers” have insisted? Glenn sits down with the senior editor at Reason, Robby Soave, who has a much more refreshing solution laid out in his latest book, “Tech Panic: Why We Shouldn’t Fear Facebook and the Future.” Politicians have weaponized the fear we have about social media. So, maybe we should be looking at the positives. Glenn and Robby take a look at the (very familiar) history of tech panic and censorship, balance the consequences of changing Section 230, and expose the real threat to the future of free speech: Progressive tyranny entrenched in the old school media.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
