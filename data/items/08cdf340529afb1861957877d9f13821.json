  "title": "PMS 2.0 509 - Aaron Rodgers Tuesday Week 4, Monday Night Football Recap, Michael Lombardi, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Chargers and the Raiders, the rain delay that pushed the game back 30 minutes, Justin Herbert being an absolute dude, Joey Bosa's comments about Derek Carr after the game, and all the fallout from the Urban Meyer situation in Jacksonville, with reports coming out that his time could be coming to an end there already. Joining the program for week 4, coming off a big win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, is the QB of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about this weekend's game, his moment with Mike Tomlin, Randall Cobb's performance and getting him back into the fold, and much much more, before he reveals the fifth book of the Aaron Rodgers book club (29:43-1:13:28). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, former GM for the Cleveland Browns, a special assistant to the coaching staff of the New England Patriots, host of the GM Shuffle podcast, The Lombardi Line, author of the Daily Coach, Michael Lombardi joins the show. Pat and Michael chat about what he's hearing from Jacksonville and why he thinks Urban is out the door, why he was doomed to fail from the get go, his thoughts on Matt Nagy in Chicago, if all the Brady Belichick stuff was a joke leading into the Sunday Night game, and more (1:13:32-1:33:23). Later, Pat and AJ chat about all the different stories circulating around the NFL and put a bow on the Urban Meyer discussion (1:36:50-2:13:17).
