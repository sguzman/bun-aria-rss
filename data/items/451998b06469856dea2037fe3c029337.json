  "description": "We're so close to the end that we're nearly going to cry and there is a lot of crying today especially if you're Canadian so we try to make sure your tears are wiped away in the best possible way. Just how on earth did Canada lose to Germany in ice hockey? Just how on earth did Canada lose to Switzerland in curling? Just how on earth is it deemed a failure for Canada despite the fact they won a medal of every colour on day 14? How on earth is channel 7 even in Korea still when they are so focused on the Commonwealth Games already? And do you think Roger Federer would be a fan of our show if we were Swiss? So much to answer, so little time for you to click download!",
