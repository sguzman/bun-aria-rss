  "description": "<p>We develop a simple analytic model for what happens when an O star (or\ncompact cluster of OB stars) forms in a shock compressed layer and carves out\nan approximately circular hole in the layer, at the waist of a bipolar HII\nRegion (HIIR). The model is characterised by three parameters: the\nhalf-thickness of the undisturbed layer, Zlay, the mean number-density of\nhydrogen molecules in the undisturbed layer, nlay, and the (collective)\nionising output of the star(s), NdotLyC. The radius of the circular hole is\ngiven by WIF ~ 3.8 pc [Zlay/0.1pc]^{-1/6} [nlay/10^4cm^{-3}]^{-1/3}\n[NdotLyC/10^{49} s^{-1}]^{1/6} [t/Myr]^{2/3}. Similar power-law expressions are\nobtained for the rate at which ionised gas is fed into the bipolar lobes; the\nrate at which molecular gas is swept up into a dense ring by the shock front\n(SF) that precedes the ionisation front (IF); and the density in this dense\nring. We suggest that our model might be a useful zeroth-order representation\nof many observed HIIRs. From viewing directions close to the midplane of the\nlayer, the HIIR will appear bipolar. From viewing directions approximately\nnormal to the layer it will appear to be a limb-brightened shell but too faint\nthrough the centre to be a spherically symmetric bubble. From intermediate\nviewing angles more complicated morphologies can be expected.\n</p>",
