  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP is sailing on his boat with his kids. An absolute insane Karen docks next to OP, and hilarious hijinks ensue. To start off, the Karen thinks that every single boat in the marina is a rented boat, and that she can just take any boat she wants. OP is shocked when Karen demands to have his boat because she assumes that she can just rent it. OP refuses, and when he tries to leave Karen literally grabs his boat to stop it from leaving, and then falls into the ocean!</p>\n",
