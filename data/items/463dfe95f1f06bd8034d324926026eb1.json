  "description": "Do you consider yourself to be a confident person? In this episode, the guys discuss how to differentiate between natural and artificial confidence. True confidence comes from knowing who you are (your traits) and whose you are (a child of a loving God). Once you are confident in who you are in the spirit realm and you can activate that confidence in your daily life.

Your confidence must always come from within.\n Listener Perks \n  \nMY ROLLING BILLBOARD Are you looking for an affordable way to advertise your business to up to 1.2 million potential customers and clients per month?
