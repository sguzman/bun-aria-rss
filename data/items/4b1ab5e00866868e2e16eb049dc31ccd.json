Through the adoption of simple practices — many of which defined humanity for millennia — he aids people in living healthier and more connected lives&nbsp;by changing our relationship to ourselves, to others and our personal environments.</p><p>Putting his life philosophy into action, Tony is attempting to run the entire length of Great Britain,&nbsp;barefoot. Beginning September 1 at Land’s End, he will run 900 miles — 30 miles a day for 30 consecutive days — until he reaches John O'Groats, convening with sustainability experts along the way.
