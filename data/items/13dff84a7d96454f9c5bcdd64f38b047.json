And in many ways the face to find that candidate has stirred just as much intrigue as the inevitable campaign road ahead.\n\nOver the past few months the playing field of over 20 potential leadership nominees has whittled down to just a select few, with each offering a different vision of what the party should look like in the years ahead.\n\nIn many ways these diverging views also result in very different visions of public policy, not the least of which including a policy area heavily impacted by President Trump’s “America First” vision – foreign policy.\n\nHow does Joe Biden’s vision of America’s place in the world differ from Bernie Sanders’, or Elizabeth Warren’s for that matter?
