  "description": "At first blush, Horse Feathers might seem like the prototypical purveyor of ineffectual beard-folk, complete with a stirring string section. But two factors elevate the band to greatness: 1) That is a 'hell' of a stirring string section, which helps Horse Feathers achieve rare exquisiteness; and 2) singer Justin Ringle knows how to use his warm, kind tenor to mask powerful lyrics about dark secrets and bruised souls. Hear Horse Feathers perform songs from this year's excellent 'Thistled Spring' live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
