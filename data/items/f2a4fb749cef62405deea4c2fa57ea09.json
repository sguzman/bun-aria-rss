  "description": "Today we wanted to talk about color and the psychology behind it, because there’s a lot more that goes into color than most people might think. People’s tastes in color can vary widely from one another and people can have different reactions to colors such as yellow where it might make them more energized and therefore you wouldn’t want to paint a room where people sleep in that color, as opposed to a pale pink color that might calm someone down. If you were to put complementary colors together, they would look like a sports jersey for example because they often combine opposite colors. Some people may see color better or worse than others, and that can be why color preferences vary so much between different people, like a husband and wife for example. <br /><br />Referencing and using the color wheel in design 2:30<br />The psychology of color 5:41<br />Picking color last 10:35<br />Complementary colors versus analogous colors 13:03<br />Men and women often perceive color differently 19:13<br />Color combinations that are moody and great for walls 23:48<br />Adding color to a neutral room and what goes well with plants 26:23<br /><br />“Complementary, I think we’re all familiar with that on the color wheel, it’s the ones that are exact opposites of each other. So red is complementary to green, blue is complementary to orange, and purple is complementary to yellow. Oftentimes we don’t apply that in a very primary situation, but as you go to those gradients, more secondary, if you want to feel real contrast from a space to another space, or in a material in that space that you’re painting green.” 13:20<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
