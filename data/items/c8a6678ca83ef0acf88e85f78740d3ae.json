  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Paul Howard, an Atlanta prosecutor, all but tried his case against the police officer in the Rayshard Brooks case on TV. It was shocking that such a spectacle even occurred. This flies in the face of justice and due process; no citizen should ever be denied these fundamental rights. Then, just two weeks ago this same prosecutor charged six cops (five of which are African American) with using a taser as a deadly weapon. This case is clearly not about race and the prosecutor has no basis for such charges - especially before the final report of the shooting from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Later, former National Security Advisor John Bolton is positioning himself as a super patriot for being disloyal to the country in name of selling books. Selling his notes and insight of private discussions with the President is just as bad as what James Comey did in this leak to the New York Times.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
