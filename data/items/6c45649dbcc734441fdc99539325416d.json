  "title": "We're All Very Outraged",
  "description": "<p><p>The theme for today's show: idiots are mad on the internet. Some Politico reporter is mad that Donald Trump Jr. gets to go on podcasts. Harvard and Yale students are mad that endowment fund managers invest in energy companies. Virtual signaling \"influencers\" are pissed off that some guy Twitter doesn't like Indian food. Feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian is angry that we invited her on the show to talk about how she's angry about Disney's The Mandalorian. The New York Times is upset with Saturday Night Live's portrayal of the androgynous character \"Pat\". Also in the angry column: Blind Mike, following the failure of the KMS interns to live up to his standards.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
