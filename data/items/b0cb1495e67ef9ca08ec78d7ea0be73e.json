Fear not my friends, today I'm excited to bring to you my second ever canning Q&A. This episode is a recording from a Q&A session I held with my followers on Facebook Live. Today we discuss things like canning condiments, what to do with bad recipes, what soups you can and can't can, and much more. Tune in to find out the solutions to problems that homesteaders just like you are dealing with.</p><p>Ready to join my Canning Made Easy Course and take advantage of all of the incredible bonuses?

I have learned over the years that not all salt is created equal and having the good stuff really does make a difference in your culinary adventures. Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too. Since I can’t grow salt myself (obviously) Right now, Redmond's is offering 15% off your entire order just for my podcast listeners.
