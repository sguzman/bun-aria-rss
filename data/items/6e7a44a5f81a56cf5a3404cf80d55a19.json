  "description": "<p>This week, we peek into the world of a man who had more than his fair share of what he called \"personal problems\". These problems overtook a once promising NBA career, and sent him to much less glamorous places, such as Binghamton, NY, and prison. Find out why he would flee from a hospital with a gaping stab wound in his neck, or why he just couldn't seem to ever be anywhere that he was supposed to be, when he was supposed to be there. Or, most importantly, why couldn't he stop committing horribly repugnant, and violent crimes!! Skip out on practice, call a press conference, and do horrid things to those who are closest to you with Sylvester \"Sly\" Williams!! Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!</p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br> </p><p>New episodes every Tuesday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Crime in Sports!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Small Town Murder</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/crimeinsports\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/crimeinsports</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CrimeInSports\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: <a href=\"mailto:crimeinsports@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">crimeinsports@gmail.com</a></p><p>Donate on Patreon: patreon.com/crimeinsports</p><p>PayPal: paypal.me/crimeinsports</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
