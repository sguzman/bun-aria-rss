In May, the US ambassador in Warsaw <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/555770-poland-us-troops-record/\">revealed</a> that over 12,600 American military personnel were in the country, the largest number in history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n            <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a> how long he is going to keep US troops in Poland and other NATO counties. “Look, they will be there for a long time”- said Biden as he left the East Room. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PR24_pl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PR24_pl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sJyEQa9VgL\">pic.twitter.com/sJyEQa9VgL</a></p>&mdash; Marek Wałkuski (@Marekwalkuski) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Marekwalkuski/status/1587894583865872384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n    \n\n<p>Warsaw <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/563325-poland-security-nato-putin/\">called</a> for additional NATO forces to be deployed in Poland and the Baltic States in September, as a response to the partial mobilization of reservists in Russia.</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565557-poland-us-nuclear-offer/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Poland accepts US nuclear proposal\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>Last month, Polish President Andrzej Duda&rsquo;s foreign policy adviser Jakub Kumoch <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565545-poland-nuclear-weapons-president/\">said</a> Washington should permanently station troops and even nuclear weapons on Polish territory.
