  "title": "#95: Following Your Curiosity With Brian Koppelman",
  "description": "<p>Brian Koppelman is a man of many hats- music executive, screenwriter, and now podcast host. I talk with Brian about career trajectories in the modern economy and how having a set career path at the beginning of your career just doesn't work very well. Instead of having a rigid plan, Brian argues that we should instead tenaciously follow our curiosity while developing skills that will open up new doors. Brian gives concrete examples from his own career of following his curiosity. We also discuss the importance of hard work, learning to deal with failure and rejections, and what Brian has learned about men from writing films.</p>\n",
