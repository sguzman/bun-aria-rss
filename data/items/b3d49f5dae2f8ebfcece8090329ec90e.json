  "description": "The 2020 NFL Trade Deadline was more about inaction rather than action. Nonetheless, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down the moves that were made and the moves that weren't made on Tuesday. Notably, the Packers failed to add a WR and get a deal done for Will Fuller. Was he worth a 2nd-round pick though? Is that really all that's separating Green Bay from a potential Super Bowl berth? Another name in the trade mills rumors that didn't get dealt was Stephon Gilmore. Again, this may have been a case of the asking price being too high. The Pick Six Superfriends then quickly roundup the other names that were traded in previous days including Carlos Dunlap, Desmond King and Kwon Alexander.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
