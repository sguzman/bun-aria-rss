  "description": "Have you heard us talk about shipping bourbon on the show before? Of course you have. Heck, I know I sound like a broken record as we try to become more stewards for reform in this space by talking about it almost every week. But this time you get to hear from an Expert. Alex Koral is the Regulatory General Counsel for Sovos ShipCompliant, a pioneer in the space of alcohol beverage delivery and making sure companies stay compliant since every state is different. We ask why wine gets a lot more slack than spirits when it comes to shipping and what is keeping that back. We also get his opinion on the supreme court rulings over the past few years as it relates to the commerce clause and why change is so reluctant and slow. As you can guess, there's a lot of red tape and lobbyists involved but the good news is that we are seeing incremental positive change. And Alex gives us a few tips on what we can all do to make change happen at our local level.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nAbove the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about how long a bourbon can last in a small jar\n\nHow did you get into the world of spirits shipping?\n\nWas the three tier system implemented after prohibition?\n\nWhat is working in the current three-tier model that should be kept?\n\nWhat does SOVOS and ShipCompliant do for producers?\n\nWhy does wine get a pass when it comes to these laws?\n\nWhat percentage of sales does a winery do with direct to consumer?\n\nWhy do distributors and wine industry players not want to have spirit shipping equality?\n\nDo you find it interesting that conservative states that want an open and free market like TX and TN but still hang on to these archaic ideas?\n\nAre states that don't want shipping getting lobbied too much?\n\nWhy didn't the TN Supreme Court case have a wider and quicker effect for domestic shipping?\n\nHow disruptive could Amazon be to all this?\n\nHow are these law proposals being presented to decision makers?\n\nIs the law of mandating selling through a distributor stifling growth?\n\n@shipcompliant\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon",
