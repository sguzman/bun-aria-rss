They were asked about ten areas:\n\n \tPhysical abuse\n \tSexual abuse\n \tEmotional abuse\n \tPhysical neglect\n \tEmotional neglect\n \tMother treated violently\n \tHousehold substance abuse\n \tHousehold mental illness\n \tParental separation or divorce\n \tIncarcerated household member\n\nFindings\nThe study found that Adverse Childhood Experiences were common. They tended to occur together. And finally the higher the number of them an individual was exposed to the more predictive they were of future health, social and behavioral problems. Subsequent studies have confirmed these findings and continue to expand our understanding of the prevalence of exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences across different populations and geography.\nIntervention\nThe strong links to future health, social and behavioral problems has called attention to the need for interventions to prevent Adverse Childhood Experiences and to treat individuals that already have an exposure to them.
