  "description": "There has been a dramatic leap in education across the world over the past 150 years–from the importance and longevity to Western-style universities to truth and knowledge production created through schooling, permeating to almost every culture throughout the globe. Dr. David Baker, professor at Penn State University, calls this phenomenon the “education revolution” in his most recent book, entitled The Schooled Society: The Educational Transformation of Global Culture (Stanford University Press 2014).\n\nWhat is the “Schooled Society” and how was it created? Drawing on neo-institutional theories and real world examples, Dr. Baker provides an interesting and compelling take on society and its interactions with education. He joins New Books in Education for the interview. For questions or comments on the podcast, you can find the host on Twitter at @PoliticsAndEd.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
