  "description": "<p>David Poses (speaker, expert, activist, author of <i>The Weight of Air</i>) discusses the intersection of addiction and mental health. He opens up about becoming addicted to heroin in an attempt to treat his depression after learning about it in a school drug education program, and how he was able to function on and effectively hide his addiction to the drug. Mayim and David debate the benefits and disadvantages of 12-step programs and consider how society’s need for instant gratification may contribute to the ongoing opioid epidemic. They discuss the need to change our perceptions about those with substance abuse issues and restructure the way we view mental illness in general. Mayim explains the effects of marijuana on depression in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything.</p><p>David Poses' Book: <a href=\"https://davidposes.com/the-weight-of-air\">https://davidposes.com/the-weight-of-air</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
