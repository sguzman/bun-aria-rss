  "description": "About twice a year we have a guest on the show that just amazes us with the science behind bourbon. Stuart Williams is a professor that directs the microfluidic systems laboratory at the University of Louisville. He discovered that when bourbon begins evaporating, it creates a web that resembles constellations in the dark sky. Stuart was able to document his findings and show how bourbons that come from the same distillery create similar webs. Pictures speak louder than words so make sure you check out his website at WhiskeyWebs.org to see the stunning representations.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about sourced whiskey.\n\nHow did you become so passionate about this research?\n\nTell us about fluid dynamics.\n\nWhat is a whiskey web?\n\nTalk about filtration.\n\nIs it good to have more colloids vs. less?\n\nTell us about the physics of evaporation.\n\nWhat proof were you testing at?\n\nWill 3 different bottles of the same whiskey have the same pattern?\n\nWhich bourbon didn't show a web?\n\nWhat other things could you test with this research?\n\nCould you use the whiskey web to determine taste?\n\nWhiskeyWebs.org\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
