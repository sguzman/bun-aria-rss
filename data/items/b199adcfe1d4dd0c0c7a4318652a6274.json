  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I had drawn an area in Fall Creek Falls state park. Once again it was bow season. I knew a little about the area I was going to hunt. The deer in this area was massive and not accustom to being hunted.</p> <p>I got to my area before sunrise and was heading up my tree. I started hearing this sound in the woods. It sounded like one of those old Samurai movies. I could hear two men making this sound. I turned around in my stand trying to find the location it was coming from. While turning I made some noise with my stand and the chatter stopped. I waited for what seemed like an eternity. Then I heard something coming around the trail I had come in on. Thinking this was a hunter I turned on my flashlight and called out. Everything got quite. Then I heard them step off the trail. One to the left and one to the right. I called out again and once more it got real silent. With daylight approaching I advised them I had drawn this area I let them know if I was in the wrong could they please advise me. Nothing, not a sound.</p> <p>Now I am getting mad. Wanting to hunt and now someone messing with me.</p> <p>I started climbing out of the tree. While climbing I could hear the one to left moving towards me and the other moving back toward the trail. When I got to the ground I was expecting to see someone waiting to explain the mix up. Unhooking my stand I scanned the area with my flashlight. I advised them I was going to the ranger station to sort this out.</p> <p>When I got to the trail It sounded like they were standing just off the trail. I heard one of them mumble something and that is when I went off on them. I was yelling and cussing them. After my rant I turned around and headed toward my truck. I could hear them following behind me. I turned once more and yelled some more. This time when I turned to head out one of them threw a rock at me. The rock did not hit me but landed very close. I continued out the trail and they continued to follow. Tossing rocks and sticks at me. When I got to the truck I was very mad. I started the truck then spun out several times. I started honking the horn and flashing my lights. I was acting like a child but I thought if I could not hunt this area neither were they. As I left one of them threw a rock that hit the back off my truck.</p> <p>When I got to the ranger station I explained what happened. They took me to a different area.</p> <p>I did not think nothing of these events until a few months ago. While listening to your show I heard a sound that made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. It was that Samurai sound. The events of that day and the earlier event came back to me. A sick feeling came over me.”</p>",
