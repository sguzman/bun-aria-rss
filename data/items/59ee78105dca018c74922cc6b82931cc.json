    "media:description": "Original video on Rumble: https://rumble.com/v11n4sn-taylor-lorenzs-doxxing-of-libsoftiktok-reveals-who-corporate-journalists-se.html\n\nTrump-era corporate journalism ceased viewing real power centers as adversaries (CIA/NSA/FBI/WallSt). The real enemy are citizens with the wrong politics. Rather than confront real power centers, the largest and richest media corporations - eg, the Bezos-owned WPost - allied with those factions and attack citizens. \n\nThe 2018 CNN obscenity featured in this video is most illustrative: they confronted an old lady with a tiny pro-Trump FB page on her yard. We recall when CNN threatened to dox someone who made an anti-CNN meme and when the Daily Beast published dirt and the real name of someone who published a video making Nancy Pelosi look drunk.\n\nThis is the key lesson of the latest tawdry episode with the WashPost's Taylor Lorenz: ever since a Trump presidency became a possibility, the largest liberal media corporations - over and over - have used their vast resources to target and punish private citizens for the wrong politics.",
