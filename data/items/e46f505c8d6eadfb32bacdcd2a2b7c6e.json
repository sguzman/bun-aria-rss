Not being sure what to do, Julian buried the drugs and more or less let them be. As the 2008 crash put Rodney in dire financial straits, he began assembling a team to retrieve the cocaine in a mission that was a combination of a heist, a search for buried treasure, and an international drug deal. Join the guys as they sit down with director Theo Love for a peek behind the curtain of this strange, true story.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\" rel=\"payment\">They don't want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
