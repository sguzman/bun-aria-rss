  "description": "<p>Communication has opened up between Justin and Erika Nardini, CEO of Barstool Sports. Kirk had some feedback for Erika but the biggest takeaway: \"Justin is very loyal\" (00:20:15). ESPN's Stephen A. Smith apologizes for criticizing Shohei Ohtani's use of an interpreter (00:12:40). Gerry Callahan didn't think Smith should apologize and knows only one man who wouldn't apologize making that type of money... Kirk Minihane.  Greg Hill donates $5,000 to some area restaurants that are struggling, so we find out how far that money can go (00:43:10). On the Wrap Up Show, Justin describes the differences between working with Steve and Dave.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
