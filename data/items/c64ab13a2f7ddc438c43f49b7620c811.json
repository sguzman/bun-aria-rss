  "description": "<p>Today's episode is for anyone who has something they feel called to do, but can't seem to get around to it. You've got to evaluate WHY you feel called to it. If the reasons are good, you can run through a checklist of reasons why you aren't motivated to do something you think is so important. Those reasons range from lazy to benign to actively being sabotaged (often by someone you're married to, unfortunately). This episode of #SASF is all about the practical nature of getting things done and refusing to quit.<br />#StoriesAreSoulFood #NDWilson #motivation #writingadvice #writing #writinglife</p>\n<p>Check out&nbsp;N.D.
