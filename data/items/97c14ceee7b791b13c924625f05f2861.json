  "description": "In this episode I address the stunning admission by the Washington Post that they have different standards for Republicans and Democrats. I also cover the attempt by Buzzfeed to change the narrative regarding the Trump Tower meeting. Finally, I address the big data problem and the failure of liberal policies in New York and elsewhere. News Picks:\nThe Pentagon is sending more troops to the border.\n \nAdam Schiff has been proven a liar; again.\n \nThis leak to Buzzfeed is clearly an effort to deflect attention away from the Clinton’s connections to the Russians involved in the Trump Tower meeting.\n \nNew York continues to tax their citizens at some of the highest rates in the country, and they are still losing tax revenue.\n \nThe Washington Post treated Kavanaugh far differently than the Democrat Lt. Governor of Virginia. \n \nBig data has the potential to cause big problems for us in the future. \n \nCopyright Dan Bongino All Rights Reserved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
