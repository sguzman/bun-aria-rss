  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address was a compelling address focused on faith, harmony, and unity. Lincoln urged \"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.” Then, Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls for statues that have been in the Capitol building to be removed. Interestingly when she was Speaker, Barack Obama was President, Joe Biden was Vice President, and Harry Reid was Senate Majority Leader (all four of them Democrats) they did nothing to remove the statues then. Later, the violence that the hard left has embraced is the acceptance of totalitarianism. The media's silence is the acquiescence of the takeover of a Seattle police precinct and six blocks surrounding it. Afterward, the Democrats thrive when Americans have their hands at each other's throats. Sen. Tim Scott is labeled \"a token\" by the left for being a successful African American because he's a Republican and the left never seeks to lift up, they only seek to tear down. Meanwhile, then-Sen. Joe Biden praised the daughters of the confederacy as \"very fine people\" for continuing to display the confederate flag.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
