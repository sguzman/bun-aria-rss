  "description": "What’s the right age to get your kid a cell phone? Dr. Lisa and Reena look at the research on both sides of the debate. When a parent writes in asking if thirteen might be the right age, Lisa shares what parents should consider before handing their kid a first phone. She also explains how you can hit the reset button with kids who may already have a phone and Reena asks what parents can say to their kids when they want to hold off. Lisa also talks about the one reason when you absolutely should get your kid a phone and how modeling good digital habits can make a difference. \n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn @AskLisaPodcast, @LDamour, @ReenaNinan\n\nAdditional resources: \nhttps://www.drlisadamour.com/\n\nAsk Lisa is produced by: \nWww.GoodTroubleProductions.com\n\n\nSee acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
