  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stemming from the episode last week about codependency, this week I wanted to talk about a related topic. Especially for those concerned with codependency, it can be really easy to go to the other side of the spectrum and become hyper-independent. So, that’s what I’m discussing in this episode.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s really important to me that I communicate that it’s okay to lean on your loved ones for support and help. Doing so doesn’t equate to codependency, and I know that sometimes it can be confusing to navigate that. It’s really easy to demonize dependency in general when you’re in this position, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s what I dig into on this episode:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Codependency vs. Interdependence</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Accepting Support from Loved Ones </span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s my hope that this episode reframes the way that you look at independence, dependence on others, and how they relate to codependency.
