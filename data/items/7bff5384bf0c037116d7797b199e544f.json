  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show with Drew revealing one of the aesthetics to watch in 2021 and how it related closely to our response to Covid. As they continue to discuss the response to Covid, specifically in California and how it's impacting Adam's children at their school. Drew also marvels at the religious nature surrounding mask wearing in California and breaks down the news surrounding the new variant and how the media has been reacting. Drew harkens back to the development of the AIDS epidemic and recounts some of the mistakes that were made but still can be viewed logically and how that differs from Covid. As the show wraps up they speak with a caller who is working for the US Census and wants their opinions. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSubscribe to The Jordan Harbinger Show\nCon-Cret.com/podcast\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nTalkSpace.com, promo code ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM",
