All of this starts with helping you understand what’s happening within the walls of your home and outside of it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>One of Nest’s first goals was to simplify home security, and it helped millions of people across the globe do this. So when we started dreaming up our next generation of cameras and doorbells, we wanted to incorporate the way the connected home — and your expectations — were heading. That included smarter alerts, wire-free options for installation flexibility, greater value and beautiful designs, plus enhanced privacy and security. We wanted our newest line to give you the most comprehensive set of intelligent alerts right out of the box, and easily work with your other Nest products, like displays.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Today <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-google-nest-latest-cams-and-doorbells-are-here/\">we’re introducing</a> our next-generation Nest Cams and Doorbell: <b>Google Nest Cam</b> (battery) is our first outdoor/indoor battery-powered camera ($329); <b>Google Nest Doorbell</b> (battery) is our first battery-powered doorbell ($329). <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/11-things-love-about-new-nest-cam-and-doorbell/\">Learn more about 11 things to love about the new Nest Cam and Doorbell</a>.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZlm-dPWL1w/YQunKyyxLNI/AAAAAAAAC4Q/lqiz97B4WrU60z5lIwF4CYZqfnzmQQO8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/Google%2BNest%2BCam%2B%2528Snow%2529%2B-%2BOutdoor%2BWired.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1366\" data-original-width=\"2048\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZlm-dPWL1w/YQunKyyxLNI/AAAAAAAAC4Q/lqiz97B4WrU60z5lIwF4CYZqfnzmQQO8ACLcBGAsYHQ/w200-h133/Google%2BNest%2BCam%2B%2528Snow%2529%2B-%2BOutdoor%2BWired.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></a><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yPNxLrNBaMY/YQunRoX5QLI/AAAAAAAAC4U/ZrH5FySieAgerDpjAdfEGZKpOHVaCdfrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/Google%2BNest%2BDoorbell%2B%2528Snow%2529%2B-%2BInstalled.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1366\" data-original-width=\"2048\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yPNxLrNBaMY/YQunRoX5QLI/AAAAAAAAC4U/ZrH5FySieAgerDpjAdfEGZKpOHVaCdfrwCLcBGAsYHQ/w200-h133/Google%2BNest%2BDoorbell%2B%2528Snow%2529%2B-%2BInstalled.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><i>Meet the new Google Nest Cam and Google Nest Doorbell</i></div><br /><div>Then there’s <b>Google Nest Cam with floodlight</b>, our first connected floodlight camera ($549) and finally the second-generation <b>Google Nest Cam</b> (wired), a wired indoor camera and our most affordable Nest Cam ever ($169).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We’ve heard how much people appreciate it when their Nest products all work well together.
