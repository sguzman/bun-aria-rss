  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, we are excited to bring you a much anticipated interview with Dr. Carolyn Weber, author of the popular memoir, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YGmoqu\">Surprised by Oxford</a></em>. She is also currently a professor at New College Franklin. To keep up with Carolyn, visit <a href= \"https://www.carolynweber.com\">carolynweber.com</a> or follow her on <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/CarolynWeber.author/photos/?ref=page_internal\"> Facebook</a>. Angelina and Cindy kick off the conversation by asking Carolyn about her childhood and how she came to love reading. They talk about her experience in school education and whether that differed from her personal reading life. Carolyn talks about her love of teaching and her immersive literary education experience at Oxford. She also expands on the way that reading the Bible for the first time opened her eyes to so many more of the truths in the literature she had read.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Unexpectedly, it was Oxford that taught me it was okay to be both feminine and smart, that intelligence was, as a friend put it, a “woman’s best cosmetic.”</p> <cite>Carolyn Weber</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>I’m like an addict when it comes to books. Compelled to read, understand, savor, wrangle with, be moved by, learn to live from these silent companions who speak so loudly. Surely some language must have a word for such a “book junkie”?</p> <cite>Carolyn Weber</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>We must not, that is, try to behave as though the Fall had never occurred nor yet say that the Fall was a Good Thing in itself. But we may redeem the Fall by a creative act.</p> <cite>Dorothy Sayers</cite></blockquote> <h3>Batter my heart, three-person’d God</h3> <p><em>by John Donne</em></p> <pre class=\"wp-block-verse\"> Batter my heart, three-person'd God, for you As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend; That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new. I, like an usurp'd town to another due, Labor to admit you, but oh, to no end; Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend, But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue. Yet dearly I love you, and would be lov'd fain, But am betroth'd unto your enemy; Divorce me, untie or break that knot again, Take me to you, imprison me, for I, Except you enthrall me, never shall be free, Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me. </pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YGmoqu\">Surprised by Oxford</a></em> by Carolyn Weber</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nHFdDC\">Holy Is the Day</a></em> by Carolyn Weber</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3l1aI9U\"><em>The Mind of the Maker</em></a> by Dorothy Sayers</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DLbGhF\">Rebecca</a></em> by Daphne du Maurier</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3l2Zwtc\"><em>Jane Eyre</em></a> by Charlotte Brontë</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DNGUov\">Robertson Davies</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cFrLty\">Margaret Atwood</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/30Pz1jE\">Stephen Leacock</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/30NuFu2\">Flannery O’Connor</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3r5hVtg\">Wuthering Heights</a></em> by Emily Brontë</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cGvmaB\">Last Child in the Woods</a></em> by Richard Louv</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FweLTs\">Mousekins books by Edna Miller</a></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CM3IUe\">Wind in the Willows</a></em> by Kenneth Grahame</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nG36LC\">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> by C.
