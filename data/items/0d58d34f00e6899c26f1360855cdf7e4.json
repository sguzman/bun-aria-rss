  "description": "When Brandon Prestwood’s left hand was caught in an industrial conveyor belt 10 years ago, he lost his hand and forearm. Scientists are unraveling the science of touch by trying to tap into the human nervous system and re-create the sensation for people like Prestwood. After an experimental surgery, Prestwood’s prosthetic arm was upgraded with a rudimentary sense of touch—a major development in technology that could bring us all a little closer together.\nFor more information on this episode, visit nationalgeographic.com/overheard. \n \nWant More?\nTo learn more about this story and writer Cynthia Gorney’s other reporting on the science of touch, take a look at her feature article.\nThe robotic arm isn't the only nascent technology that seems like it's right out of Star Wars.
