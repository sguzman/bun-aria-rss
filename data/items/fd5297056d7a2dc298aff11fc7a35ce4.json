  "description": "<p>October 8, 1976. Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee. In what was supposed to be a fun surprise, 16 year old Trenny Gibson's teacher didn't tell her or the other high school students where the class was going for their field trip until after they had boarded the bus to go. The trip was to be at the Great Smoky Mountains so that they could observe the plants and trees as they were learning about horticulture. The bus parked near Clingman's Dome and the class headed toward Andrews Bald (a grassy meadow at high elevation) as instructed. But despite being told not to take side trails or deviate from the path specified, Trenny disappeared from the group. Had she separated from the group and gotten lost? Or had someone kidnapped her and taken her from the park? Interviews with the students by the teacher as well as FBI agents painted a mysterious picture of what might have happened to Trenny Gibson.</p><p><br></p><p>More information: https://www.canadiangurl77.com/</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
