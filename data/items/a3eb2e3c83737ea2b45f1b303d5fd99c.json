  "description": "<p>Crows have funerals? CROWS HAVE FUNERALS. The inky black bird with the big brain warns and maybe mourns around their fallen friends and Dr. Kaeli Swift is here to tell us all about it. As an avid wildlife researcher and corvid specialist, she's observed death behaviors that will shock you to your bones and ruffle your hackles -- while somehow also making you cry about peanuts. Also: so much inspiration to keep being yourself and to work hard toward what you love. She is a hero. </p><p><br /></p><p>Dr. Kaeli Swift's <a href=\"https://corvidresearch.blog\" target=\"_blank\">Blog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJwx6BBZDKgc8ITVQzQ2HQ\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corvidresearch\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> & <a href=\"http://instagram.com/corvidresearch\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>More links at <a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.alieward.com</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
