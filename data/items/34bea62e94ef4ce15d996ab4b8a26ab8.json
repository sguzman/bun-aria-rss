It is a common problem that plagues so many of us. Often we don’t realize that the last thing we want to do—exercise—could be an easy solution to increasing our energy levels. When we create stress in the body from exercise or other stressors, also called hormesis, we can actually build back stronger as the body heals and repairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode of my new <em>Masterclass</em> series, I am interviewed by my good friend and podcast host, Dhru Purohit, about all the things we can do to improve our energy levels. We also talk about how caffeine and sugar in your diet impact energy, as well as answer questions from our community about the value of napping, if MCT oil increases energy, and why fruit juice is not a great choice.</p><br><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry.
