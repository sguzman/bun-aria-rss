  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 10/5/22",
  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has unleashed a war on American energy independence and the leftwing alliance for electricity (disguised as climate change activism) is ideological and insane. The country doesn't have enough electricity to go around, especially since it takes fossil fuels to create electricity in the first place. Biden's horrific policies on energy have driven Saudi Arabia into an alliance with Russia and will drive up the cost of fuel in the United States. This will seriously damage the lifestyles of Americans on fixed incomes and Biden will simply blame the oil companies and gas station owners for his man-made disaster. Then, American voters must be diligent in defeating the Democrat power structure. We're either going to vote them out or they're going to take our power. Democrats are focused on strengthening the power of the state by destroying the relationship between parents and children, dismantling law and order, and our economic system. Later, Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson claims the founders approached the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments in a race-conscious way, but in fact, they approached it from the perspective of equal justice under the law. Brown-Jackson's legal reasoning is going to make Justice Sotomayor's opinions look like Oliver Wendell Holmes's. Sadly, the civil rights movement has adopted the leftist Marxist agenda and if you don't embrace it, you're a racist. Afterward, US Sen. Mike Lee joins the show to discuss his re-election race and how it's never been more important for Republicans to have a majority. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
