  "description": "Frank’s on vacation with his family, so I (Daniel) am behind the mic this week. The market surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference yesterday, which followed another 75-basis-point interest rate hike. I break down what he said that sent markets soaring… and what it means for “risk-on” assets going forward. The next Fed meeting isn’t until September, which means investors can shift their attention back to inflation and the economy. I share what to expect from inflation over the next couple of months… and how the recent pullback in commodities will affect the data. Despite the pullback, I’m still bullish on commodities… and explain why you should have exposure to this sector—particularly oil and gas. In this episode  Why the markets surged after Powell’s press conference [1:30] Powell’s thoughts on jobs, spending, and whether we’re in a recession [9:20]  The role of commodities in future inflation data [13:15]  Why you should be long energy stocks [17:00]   Enjoyed this episode?
