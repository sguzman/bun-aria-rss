  "description": "Are you a book-lover, or like, a book... *lover*? What is it about literary characters that make us so damn thirsty? Special guest Mallory Ortberg (Dear Prudence, The Toast) joins us to talk about the first loves that made us stay up past our bedtimes, the ones we sneaked under the covers and explored every inch of — literary baes. How awful and perfect (for each other and for us!) were Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester? Why was Shug Avery so magnetic? Is revenge a dish best served cold or not eaten at all? We have an exciting Thirst Sommelier, but no drabbles this week, and that's because we have a supremely hilarious reading from Mallory, in which we are dragged, cleansed and blessed.\nRead Things I’ve Learned About Heterosexual Female Desire From Decades Of Reading by Mallory Ortberg, and listen to Bim & Nichole's episodes of Dear Prudence. \nCome see us live! Thirst Aid Kit Live: The Quenchening is February 12th, 2018 at the Jerome L. Greene Space in NYC. Find tickets and information here!\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
