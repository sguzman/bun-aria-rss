  "description": "<p>Let's admit that evangelism can be scary. We often feel unprepared, overwhelmed at the idea, and avoid it all costs. But it is less scary if we avoid these evangelism mistakes. Being aware of these mistakes can make it less scary and let the Holy Spirit work through you. \n\nTake the OMA Mental Health Crash Course <a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc</a>\nTake the OMA Apologetics Crash Course <a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc</a>\n<a href='https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist'> https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist </a>\n\nDo you ever doubt your ability to answer bigger than life questions like, “Why do I exist? What is the purpose of life? Can I know God? If so, how? Are miracles possible?” And if God exists what’s with all the evil in the world? Do questions like these ever nag at you? If so, you’ve come to the right podcast. I too am a fellow wonderer who thinks about stuff like this. \n\nI (Bobby Conway) am the founder and host of the rapidly-growing ministry, The One Minute Apologist, which is found on YouTube and at oneminuteapologist.com. Here I provide quick, credible answers to apologetic questions that resource people with a hunger to defend their Christian faith. These videos will often include interviews. I’ve had the privilege of interviewing some of the world's leading Christian apologists. Among them are: William Lane Craig, Josh McDowell, Hank Hanegraaff, JP Moreland, Norman Geisler, Frank Turek, and many more. #evangelism #apologetics #christianapologetics #oneminapologist #Christianity #God #bobbyconway #doubtingGod #doubtingJesus #doubtingtowardfaith</p>\n",
