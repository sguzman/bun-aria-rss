  "description": "<div>To celebrate reaching 100 episodes on Patreon, we decided to release one of our favorite recent Patreon eps on the main feed. <br>\n<br>\n The boys riff from an Oklahoma hotel room about how only rich people die from erotic asphyxiation, getting horny off scent memory, and whether or not there are hot carnies. They also get legendary cock talk / sock talk / secret socks about mom banging, jerking off at the fertility clinic, and the infamous Washington Scrub and Rub.  <br>\n<br>\nGet 4 bonus episodes a month and instant access to the Patreon back catalog for $5/month at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod\">www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod</a>\n</div>\n",
