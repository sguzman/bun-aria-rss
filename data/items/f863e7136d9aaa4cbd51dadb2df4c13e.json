You should also pack a bottle of Chilean red and a nice lump of cheddar (it'll all make sense). As well as book chat - including a discussion about what part if any his politics play in them - Jeffrey Archer also reflects on his time as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party (and his relationships with Margaret Thatcher and John Major), his famous shepherd's pie and champagne parties and his time in prison.
