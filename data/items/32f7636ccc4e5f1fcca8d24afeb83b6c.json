  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, isolationists fit right into the fusion of George Soros and Charles Koch parroting the pacifistic propaganda of keeping America out of endless wars or radical interventionism. President Reagan's view was that enemies couldn't be contained therefore prudently going on offense was his preferred alternative. However, the leftist and/or the pacifist pigeonhole any activity that doesn't bow down to an opposing regime as an \"escalation\" to weaken the U.S position and prevent America from asserting any dominance against aggressive foreign actors. Then, throughout our history Pat Buchannan, and before him, William Howard Taft embraced similar isolationist positions unsuccessfully. Charles Lindbergh also tried this but corrected the course because he realized he was wrong. Reagan understood this and Donald Trump did too that's why he took out Iranian General Soleimani. These populist and isolationist agendas must be rejected because there isn't a single example of pacifism ever succeeding in the face of aggression. Later, U.S Sen. Candidate Rep. Mo Brooks joins the show to explain how Sen. Mitch McConnell continues to smear his campaign. Brooks is a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus with the support of Libertarians and Constitutional Conservatives. Finally, former Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway calls in to discuss her new book, Here's the Deal: A Memoir. She explained that Donald Trump plucked her from obscurity and made her the first woman campaign manager to win a presidential campaign. Conway describes how she met Trump years earlier and the challenges she endured with the political differences she had with her husband who criticized Trump and was part of the Lincoln Project.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Untitled-Memoir-Be-Confirmed-Threshold/dp/1982187344/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26XRJ74AU2WGF&keywords=kellyann+conway+book&qid=1653318903&sprefix=KellyAnne+Conway+%2Caps%2C237&sr=8-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
