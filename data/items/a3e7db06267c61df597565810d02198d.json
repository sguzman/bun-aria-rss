  "description": "Richard Thompson's Beeswing: Losing My Way and Finding My Voice 1967-1975 (Algonquin Books, 2021) gives fans of his music a tale as rollicking and entertaining as the reels and ballads he recorded with the band Fairport Convention. Fairport Convention was one of the central bands in the British Folk Rock scene, blending traditional English songs and melodies with the energy and irreverence of rock and roll. Thompson's memoir of his time with the band discusses the process of recording their classic albums, as well as run-ins with figures like Buck Owens, Nick Drake, and Jimi Hendrix. He also discusses his childhood in post-war London, his relationship with his then-wife and collaborator Linda Thompson, and his search for spiritual purpose, which he eventually found in Sufi Islam.\nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
