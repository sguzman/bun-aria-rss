  "description": "<p>2020 has definitely been one for the books, and it isn’t even over yet. Amid a global pandemic, so much is uncertain and unknown. What will the future look like? What will tomorrow look like? What will the world be like after all of this is over? It is not surprising that so many people are struggling with anxiety, grief, depression, anger and loneliness—we have all experienced low moments over the past few months. Thankfully, there is a way we can calm the mental chaos we are experiencing and take back control. In this week’s podcast and blog, I speak with Harvard-trained psychologist and health coach Dr. Sasha Heinz about why we struggle to get a handle on our anxiety, how to go from knowing what to do to doing it, how we can unsubscribe from our thoughts, how to handle pandemic fears and frustrations and what we can do now to create our own future, even when facing the unknown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/title &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more info on Dr. Sasha see here: https://drsashaheinz.com &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>**Special offers from this episode's sponsor:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-NOOM (the best healthy habit company!): For your NOOM special offer see: https://noom.com/DRLEAF &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><u>Podcast Highlights</u></p>\n<p>2:00 The intention-action gap, and how to overcome it</p>\n<p>7:18 How to get unstuck & control the mental chaos</p>\n<p>24:11 The different components of wellbeing</p>\n<p>27:30 Why we need to think about our thinking</p>\n<p>32:50 How to deal with grief and negative emotions</p>\n<p>36:40 The difference between clean pain and dirty pain</p>\n<p>40:35 How to unsubscribe from your own thoughts</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additional resources: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Sign up to join my free text program and receive mental health care tips and strategies, exclusive offers and more!
