  "description": "<p><strong>Subscribe to Get Real with Caroline Hobby</strong></p><p>I met Kristen the day she moved to Nashville. She was working for my hubby’s record label and we met on Michael’s bus before a show... It was friendship love at first sight. Kristen is a force. She loves BIG and HARD. She wears her soul on her sleeve and she isn’t scared to be raw and real and really share and bare it. Connecting with others and realizing we are not alone in this life is her mission statement. On this episode we talk a longggg time about the power of manifesting and her tips for getting your mind right. We talk about marriage. She tells me about the dance parties she and Preston (LoCash) have every night with their kids and how they have had to learn the new normal of him being home all the time since touring shut down due to Corona. We talk about loss. She miscarried in between her 2 kids and the ache and love for that child is so strong. I also relate to that ache. We talk about her podcast “In Kristen We Brust,” and why she started it, and what it’s all about. This convo is truly two best girlfriends/wives/mothers living in the music industry, talking about everything in God’s green earth, and recognizing how precious it is to have friendships that fuel your soul, allow you to be vulnerable and seen, and hold your hand while we make our way through this wild, wonderful, crazy life.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
