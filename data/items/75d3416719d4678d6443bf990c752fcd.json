  "description": "<p>Letting Go: The Freedom of Awake Awareness (2016-08-31) - We know we need to let go of harmful habits like obsessive worry, blame and over consuming to experience true well-being, yet much of the time we are stuck and judge ourselves for being out of control. This talk explores what's so difficult about letting go and how we can't will it but we can be willing. We then explore the shift to awake awareness that enables a natural dissolution of clinging and resistance, and the deep peace and freedom of letting be.  </p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p> <p> </p>",
