  "description": "<p>Rolf Potts met me in Tompkins Square Park to talk to me about travel. Rolf wrote one of my favorite books of all time called Vagabonding. It's all about long term travel. It influenced the hell out of me. And I was so stoked to be able to talk about getting out there in the world with such a well worn traveler like him.</p> <p>Also, my special \"Double Negative\" is on Netflix right now! Go watch it!</p>",
