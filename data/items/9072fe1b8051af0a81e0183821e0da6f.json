  "description": "Below you will find three types of podcasts: 'Ken's tour' which guides you around the book; 'Global sociology' podcasts featuring students from around the world; and 'Practical sociology' podcasts where researchers talk about their work. It is strongly recommended that you listen to Ken's tour before you embark on the textbook and each section in it. These podcasts aim to bring the whole point of the textbook alive.",
