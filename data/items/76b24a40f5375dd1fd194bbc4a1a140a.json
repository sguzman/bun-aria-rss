He previously contributed two very interesting guest posts to the site, one on <a href=\"http://efavdb.github.io/machine-learning-for-facial-recognition-3\">facial recognition software</a> and one on the <a href=\"http://efavdb.github.io/machine-learning-with-wearable-sensors\">interpretation of wearable sensor data</a> (eg, <a href=\"https://jawbone.com/\">Jawbone&#8217;s up band</a>). We aim to eventually bring site membership up to about four or five like-minded, yet complementary contributors, each interested in contributing about one machine-learning related post a month. We&#8217;re especially excited to welcome Damien on board &#8212; he&#8217;s an old pal, and also one with a keen eye for finding topics of general interest. In fact, we&#8217;re working on a joint post together right now that is both timely and interesting &#8212; stay&nbsp;tuned!</p>\n<p>Details of our perfect&nbsp;week:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Point spread</th>\n<th># games</th>\n<th>Accuracy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt; 5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-9</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><span class=\"caps\">NA</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-14</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><span class=\"caps\">NA</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;14</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
