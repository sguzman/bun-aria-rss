  "description": "<p>Original Airdate: May 6, 2019</p><p><i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Tara Westover discusses her memoir, “Educated.” Tara describes what it was like growing up in the remote Idaho mountains as the daughter of survivalist Mormons. She explains her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when Tara’s older brother became violent. Tara did not attend school or see doctors and had minimal interaction with the outside world for 17 years. Despite this unorthodox upbringing, Tara taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to earn acceptance into Brigham Young University. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her to Cambridge University, where she earned her Ph.D. in history. This coming-of-age story of courage serves as an inspiring reminder to anyone looking to find their own voice. This conversation was recorded in front of an audience.</p>\n",
