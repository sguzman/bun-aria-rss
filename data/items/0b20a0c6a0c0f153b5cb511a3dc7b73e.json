  "description": "<p>We answer an open complexity question by Hofman, Lasota, Mayr, Totzke (LMCS\n2016) for simulation preorder on the class of succinct one-counter nets (i.e.,\none-counter automata with no zero tests where counter increments and decrements\nare integers written in binary); the problem was known to be PSPACE-hard and in\nEXPSPACE. We show that all relations between bisimulation equivalence and\nsimulation preorder are EXPSPACE-hard for these nets; simulation preorder is\nthus EXPSPACE-complete. The result is proven by a reduction from reachability\ngames whose EXPSPACE-completeness in the case of succinct one-counter nets was\nshown by Hunter (RP 2015), by using other results. We also provide a direct\nself-contained EXPSPACE-completeness proof for a special case of such\nreachability games, namely for a modification of countdown games that were\nshown EXPTIME-complete by Jurdzinski, Sproston, Laroussinie (LMCS 2008); in our\nmodification the initial counter value is not given but is freely chosen by the\nfirst player. We also present an alternative proof for the upper bound by\nHofman et al. In particular, we give a new simplified proof of the belt theorem\nthat yields a simple graphic presentation of simulation preorder on\n(non-succinct) one-counter nets and leads to a polynomial-space algorithm\n(which is trivially extended to an exponential-space algorithm for succinct\none-counter nets).\n</p>",
