  "description": "<p>How are babies made? We speak with Cory Silverberg, author of <em>What Makes A Baby,</em> for answers to questions about how we all come into the world. This is a conversation that welcomes all kinds of families as we answer questions about why babies don't hatch out of eggs, why boys have nipples, why girls have babies but boys don't and why some people look more like one parent more than the other. Later in the episode we also explore how we get our last names and how two people can have the same last name when they're not related. We made this episode with our youngest listeners in mind, but parents may want to preview this episode on their own or listen with their kids.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nDownload our learning guides: <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/45/48/a87af5fa4f408b5a0563ed77103d/how-are-babies-made.pdf\" title=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/53/d5/5b37ff6a4d75a6b5ef6d80c3b413/how-are-babies-made.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ffXHA52utVnNP6wYesFAHHsRRbNv3l0QKrN5RgpbNUs/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/7a/ba/d9ad12f64d259ef54dfafdd67e10/but-why-168-babies-transcript.pdf\" title=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/5a/ab/7aae9458431b8cdc45d8d2dd90d9/but-why-168-babies-transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><br>\n\"How are babies made?\" - Wade, 7, Charlottesville, Va.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In his book <em>What Makes a Baby</em>, Cory Silverberg begins by reminding kids and grownups that there are really two questions: what makes a baby in general, and then the more specific question that is unique to you--where did you come from?
