  "description": "<p>Dr. Phil has been on the air for over 25 years and now is starting a podcast called “Phil in the blanks”. His conversation with Joe was really interesting and gives a good insight into how he thinks. Dr. Phil also covers the “catch me outside” girl and all the silliness there.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
