  "title": "PMS 2.0 188 - Super Bowl Champ Roman Harper, His Neck, & Cliff Avril Stop By For Some Great Conversation. And Of Course The Legend, AJ Hawk, As Well",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by a couple of great guests. First, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the program, Roman Harper FaceTimes into the show. Pat and Roman chat about his thoughts on Tua and what he thinks is in store for him not only in the NFL draft, but what he thinks of his injury history, and his career at Alabama, and how he thinks Covid19 is going to affect the draft process for scouts, general managers, and coaches, and why getting a guy into the building or having a face to face conversation is so beneficial in learning more about them (2:33-18:55). Next, it's another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss ESPN's HORSE broadcast and whether or not they were entertained, NASCAR driver Kyle Larson making a monumental mistake on a racing livestream with other drivers, what their plans are for the NFL Draft and their reactions to the news coming out about the draft. They also discuss Ohio State's Athletic Director Gene Smith's comments about the upcoming college football season, and Pat remembers some fond memories of Rich Rodriguez at West Virginia (18:57-1:29:06). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion and Pro Bowler, former defensive end for the Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks, Cliff Avril joins Pat and the boys. They discuss his experiences on winning a Super Bowl and also being on the 0-16 Lions and some of the differences he noticed between the two, his thoughts on the NFL Draft and why he thinks we should expect fireworks with all the tech issues, what the Seahawks need to do in the offseason/draft in order to get back on top of the NFC, what he thinks is going to happen with Jadeveon Clowney and what kind of player he is, and his approach to playing rookie quarterbacks during the season (1:31:20-1:44:17). Today's show is a fun one. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the opportunity to win some free merch. As always, stay safe out there, we're all in this thing together. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
