  "description": "I’m not going to bury the lede here, and that’s mostly because I need to get back to my Ozark binge: This episode of Business Casual features Reed Hastings, cofounder, chairman, and co-CEO of Netflix.\nThere’s a lot to unpack with Reed. Because companies don’t just become cultural cornerstones overnight. It takes luck, hard work, and, as it turns out, a very distinct corporate strategy. After all, what you watch on Netflix says a lot about you...how you run Netflix might say more.\nThe ways Reed runs Netflix might surprise you. In this interview, he gets candid about his triumphs and failures and gives us the state of play in these so-called streaming wars. Spoiler alert: Netflix is winning. \nReed gives an inside look at what makes Netflix tick—and how it became a $200 billion company with more than 190 million subscribers worldwide...some 3x the subscriber count of its biggest competitor.\nAnd most importantly, Reed predicts how Netflix might meet its demise. Because for every Netflix, there’s a Blockbuster. And someday Netflix will be the Blockbuster.\nAfter you listen, read my column to find out why I disagree with Reed: https://column.businesscasual.fm/timing-beats-culture",
