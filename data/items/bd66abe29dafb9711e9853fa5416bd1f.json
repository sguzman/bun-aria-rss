  "description": "<p>What cultural or religious programming do you have around sex? Even if you didn’t grow up in a church, sexual shame is – in so many ways – the air we breathe. But here’s the reality: you didn’t put those thoughts there. Someone else did. And on today’s show with guest Erin Tillman, we’re calling out those judgmental messages, and choosing the sex messaging that actually serves us. The result? A radically more authentic, more liberated sex life.</p><br><p>As an inclusive dating coach, Erin is no stranger to shame – and she’s heard it all from her clients. Whether it was that one rude thing a partner said that haunted you for years, or a parent that told you masturbation was dirty, shame love to hide in the shadows…and hold you back in the bedroom. So on today’s show, Erin and I talk about how we healed our own sexual shame, dropped performative sex, and got comfortable with the word “no.” You’ll also learn the difference between “no” and “not yet” when it comes to dating, how to make good choices on dating apps, and how to flip your internal shame script.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>More Erin Tillman<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://erintillman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/datingadvicegrl?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/misserintillman/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/guides/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yes No Maybe List</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
