  "description": "Nowadays it seems that even high-performing kids are acutely stressed and lacking motivation. Many feel that they have no control over their own lives. Some stumble in high school, or hit college and unravel. As parents, we can only drive our kids so far; at some point, they will have to take the wheel and map out their own path. The Self-Driven Child (Penguin, 2019) written by Dr. William Stixrud, a clinical neuropsychologist, and Ned Johnson, a motivational coach who runs an elite tutoring service, offers a combination of cutting-edge brain science, the latest discoveries in behavioral therapy, and case studies drawn from the thousands of kids and teens. Together, Bill Stixrud and Ned Johnson discovered that the best antidote to stress is to give kids more of a sense of control over their lives. But this doesn't mean giving up your authority as a parent. In this groundbreaking book they reveal how you can actively help your child to sculpt a brain that is resilient, and ready to take on new challenges.\nIn this interview, cross-posted from the podcast Psychologists Off The Clock, Dr. Diana Hill interviews Dr. Stixrud about how to support healthy development, self-motivation, and emotional resilience in our kids. They discuss more effective approaches to dealing with homework battles, technology use, and underage drinking.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
