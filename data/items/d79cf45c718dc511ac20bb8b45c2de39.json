  "description": "<p>Zeneca_33 is an NFT influencer, thought leader, and community member (whatever your preferred term is). After playing poker professionally, Zeneca fell down the NFT rabbit hole in early 2021 and has quickly amassed a huge following. His takes are often sobering and always even-keeled, which is incredibly valuable in this emotional and chaotic market.</p> <p>We knew Zeneca had to be one of the first guests on the show. His wisdom and knowledge are reality checks for any type of market, and we go through his approach to the space, how he picks projects, and his own project - ZenAcademy.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://jpegs.banklesshq.com/\">https://jpegs.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST<br /> APPLE: <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/overpriced-jpegs/id1591954323\"> https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/overpriced-jpegs/id1591954323</a> <br />  SPOTIFY: <a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/5G2HSDneVg8mZUQ3zUIoLX?si=6d57ee1f89184974\"> https://open.spotify.com/show/5G2HSDneVg8mZUQ3zUIoLX?si=6d57ee1f89184974</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>👀 ZERION | YOUR NFT PORTFOLIO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> </p> <p>💸 ONJUNO | YOUR CRYPTO PAYCHECK<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>🌊 INDEX COOP | METAVERSE INDEX<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MVI\">https://bankless.cc/MVI</a> </p> <p>🦄 BLOCK::BLOCK | METAVERSE IP<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/blockblock\">https://bankless.cc/blockblock</a> </p> <p>------</p> <p>Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:00 Zeneca_33<br /> 8:08 Distaste for Roadmap<br /> 11:12 How Zeneca Picks Projects<br /> 16:11 Approaching the Market<br /> 25:07 How to Flip NFTs<br /> 30:08 Art Blocks<br /> 39:30 Veblen Goods<br /> 44:44 ZenAcademy<br /> 56:59 Network Effects<br /> 1:01:11 Advice to the Community<br /> 1:07:40 Culture & Ethos<br /> 1:13:09 Closing</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Zeneca_33<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20</a> </p> <p>ZenAcademy <br /> <a href= \"https://zenacademy.io/\">https://zenacademy.io/</a> </p> <p>Studio by Hatch Coding<br /> <a href= \"https://www.hatch.art/for-ages-9-17\">https://www.hatch.art/for-ages-9-17</a> </p> <p>Blitmap<br /> <a href= \"https://www.blitmap.com/\">https://www.blitmap.com/</a> </p> <p>Top Dog Beach Club<br /> <a href= \"https://topdogbeachclub.com/\">https://topdogbeachclub.com/</a> </p> <p>Curious Addy’s Trading Club<br /> <a href= \"https://www.curiousaddys.com/\">https://www.curiousaddys.com/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
