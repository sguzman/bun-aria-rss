Once you enter a guess, individual letters within the word you entered will appear in different colors. Each color has a different meaning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Green: The letter entered is 100% correct — the right letter in the right space.</li>\n<li>Yellow: The entered letter is in the correct word, but you&#8217;ve placed it in the wrong space.</li>\n<li>Gray: The entered letter is not used in the answer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal is to guess the correct word in as few attempts as possible. If you don&#8217;t get the answer in six guesses, you lose.</p>\n<h2>Hints for today&#8217;s Wordle</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Today’s Wordle starts with the letter D.</li>\n<li>Today’s Wordle doesn&#8217;t use the same letter twice.</li>\n<li>Today&#8217;s Wordle uses two vowels.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3207273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3207273\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img  class=\" size-full wp-image-3207273\" src=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image_adobe_express.jpeg?fit=4500%2C3000&p=1\" alt=\"Someone playing Wordle on a smartphone.\"   /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3207273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">wachiwit - stock.adobe.com</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the answer to Wordle #504 on November 5?</h2>\n<p>Still having trouble?
