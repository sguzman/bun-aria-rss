  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys look ahead to tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Bengals and Browns and whether or not it is a must win for Baker Mayfield and the Browns. Joining the show is Pat's former teammate, Pro Bowler, 11 year NFL veteran with the Browns and Colts, D'Qwell Jackson. Pat and D'Qwell chat about tonight's game, why the Browns can't seem to turn it around, and the first time D'Qwell met Pat in the Colts locker room (1:48-16:56). Next, Pat is joined by former NFL Quarterback and current QB Guru who has coached the likes of Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, and Sam Darnold among others, Jordan Palmer. Pat and Jordan discuss what makes Joe Burrow different and what he has that makes him different and why he thinks Baker Mayfield has a lot more to offer and that he still has a lot of good football ahead of him (16:58-33:01). Later, former Colts and Patriots defensive back, 9 year NFL veteran, cohost of the Man-To-Man Pod and Everything DB, friend of the program, Darius Butler joins Pat and AJ Hawk for another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. DB breaks down why he thinks Joe Burrow will hit his passing yards over tonight, what he thinks of each teams defense, what the Colts need to do to turn things around, and more (39:42-51:56). Then, Pat and AJ discuss the way each of them practiced, they give their predictions for tonight's game, and chat about the newest NFL Hall of Fame nominees and who's getting in next year (33:03-1:04:18).
