  "title": "Conference Report: Genocide In World History, Bryant University, 9-10 October 2015",
  "description": "Today’s podcast marks the beginning of what I hope might become a regular feature on the podcast. The session was recorded live on the campus of Bryant University at the end of weekend conference with the title Genocide in World History, sponsored by the New England region of the World History Association. I’m hoping that occasional reports from conferences will help shed light on new research and new directions in the field.  They will of necessity be a bit rawer than ordinary interviews. But I think the benefits far outweigh occasional blemishes.\n\nThe conference at Bryant stressed the need to see genocide through the lens of the discipline of world history.  Individual panels tended to focus on specific cases. But several papers took an explicitly comparative perspective.  And the capstone session looked carefully at what it might mean to study genocide from the perspective of a world historian.\n\nThe podcast features four participants from the conference: Jonathan Bush, Jon Cox, Tommy O’Connell and Michael Bryant. I hope you find their contributions interesting.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
