She’s been on a few times so far: <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2018/11/28/3-something-we-said-wicked-deeds-on-a-winters-night\">Wicked Deeds on a Winter’s Night</a>, the <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/3/18/95-foodie-romance-interstitial\">food romance episode</a>, and <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/8/12/representation-of-trauma-survivors-in-romance-adriana-herrera-and-jen-prokop\">she and Jen talked about trauma in romance</a>. This week, her March 2020 release American Sweethearts appeared on the <a href=\"https://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2020\">Publisher’s Weekly Best of 2020 List</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shutupaida/status/1116548553906774018?s=20\">Normalize pegging at all costs</a>.</p><p class=\"\">If you’re going to come to the phone bank this weekend dressed as a romance heroine, might we suggest you drape <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mantilla\">a mantilla</a> over your head and carry a pistol? You’ll be a dead ringer for Jessica Trent from <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/11/25/s0212-lord-of-scoundrels\">Lord of Scoundrels</a>. Sarah was on a panel with Loretta Chase a few weeks ago, and I guess the only blessing of these Zoom times is watching these things online. IS THERE A LINK TO THIS?</p><p class=\"\">Adriana has written a few pieces about immigration in romance, one <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/immigrant-stories-in-romance-novels-are-revolutionary-we-need-more-of-them-19300979?scrlybrkr=d1a4d975\">for Bustle</a> and one for <a href=\"https://remezcla.com/features/culture/romance-genre-afro-latinx-authors-challenges/\">Remezcla</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Just a quick primer, because we didn’t clarify these definitions on the podcast and <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-01-06/first-generation-second-immigrants-and-their-children-question-meaning\">it’s complicated,</a> because both terms are widely used to describe the same group of people--American-born children of immigrants. While Sarah grew up thinking of herself as <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/first-generation\">\"first-generation,\"</a> many modern academics & the Census label her as <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/07/second-generation-americans/\">\"second-generation.\"</a> Here's <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/first-generation-immigrant-defined-1951570\">a cool article</a> on all the terms, and how they've evolved.</p><p class=\"\">Also, it’s useful to know the difference between <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/push-pull-factors-1434837\">push and pull factors</a> that drive immigration.</p><p class=\"\">If you want to read a terrific immigrant superhero story, Jen recommends a graphic novel she teaches to her 7th graders, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e0RGM2\">The Shadow Hero by Gene Yang.</a> She’s also really loved his recent release <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35LDBP4\">Dragon Hoops.</a></p><p class=\"\">Adriana loves the podcast <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/\">On Being, hosted by Krista Tippet</a>. <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/ocean-vuong-a-life-worthy-of-our-breath/\">The episode with Ocean Vuong</a>, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37TRLQu\">On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</a>, features some interesting discussion of his own immigrant story.</p><p class=\"\">We do not recommend reading American Dirt, but you should know <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/22/21075629/american-dirt-controversy-explained-jeanine-cummins-oprah-flatiron\">the story of how and why it was published</a>, some ideas about <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/american-dirt-book-controversy/\">why publishing was so eager to sell</a> this particular story from a variety of <a href=\"https://www.latinorebels.com/2020/01/21/americandirtproblem/\">Latinx authors and thinkers</a>.</p><p class=\"\">When Adriana mentioned “the fun kind of thrust” she is referencing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyNordbak/status/1145072209808912385?s=20\">Jenny Nordbak’s best advice for finding a sex scene in a book: search for the word “thrust.”</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/how-to-use-and-understand-diacritics-diacritical-marks\">Diacritical marks</a> are symbols added to letters which tells the speaker how to correctly pronounce the word. In <em>The Bride Test</em>, the same words have diacritical marks when spoken by Esme, a character newly immigrated from Vietnam, but do not have them when spoken by Vietnamese-Americans. Also, <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2013/11/05/why-children-of-immigrants-often-involuntarily-lose-a/\">language loss in the children of immigrant families</a> is a well-documented phenomena.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/10/the-worst-best-man-project-x-entertainment-feature-rights-to-mia-sosa-bestseller-1234600411/\">The Worst Best Man has recently been optioned as a movie</a>!</p><p class=\"\">Take a look at <a href=\"https://ltclanguagesolutions.com/blog/crashing-into-the-cultural-iceberg/\">the cultural iceberg</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/26/massive-protests-nigeria-explained/\">Nigeria and SARS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/life/sars-protests-nigeria\">what you can do about it</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Jeannette Ng’s piece, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nettlefish/cultural-appropriation-in-books-that-are-kinda-meh-44c3491a2906\">Critiquing Cultural Appropriation in Books That Are Kinda Meh</a>, is about the pressure to research and how it undermines the lived experience of #OwnVoices authors.</p><p class=\"\">Jen mentioned a piece in Kirkus called <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/100-books/\">100 books by Cynthia Leitich Smith,</a> which argues “Before trying to write any character outside one’s lived experience, I recommend reading at least 100 books* by authors from that community. To start.” By the way, Smith is the author of a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e0SKzw\">terrific YA novel called Hearts Unbroken </a>if you’re interested.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo\">Trujillo was terrible</a>! Don’t steal Adriana’s idea to write a story about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_settlement_in_the_Dominican_Republic\">Japanese-Dominican people</a> who were living on the border of the Domenican Republic and Haiti.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2015/changing-face-ethiopia\">Ethiopia and its capital Addis Ababa</a> are fascinating places. Adriana and her partner lived there for five years. Also, <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/features/addis-ababa-lion/\">the lions of Ethiopia are genetically distinct from other lions.</a></p><p class=\"\">When it comes to holiday shopping, <a href=\"https://bookriot.com/october-is-the-new-december/\">October is the new December.</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahmaclean/status/1320022176414781440?s=20\">Sarah wrote a long thread of some of her favorite local indies that carry romance</a>.
