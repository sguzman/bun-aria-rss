  "description": "The Book of Esther has inspired and impacted the American project since its very inception. Rabbis and ethicists, abolitionists and artists, preachers and presidents, have understood the text to speak to their moment. It has offered solace to immigrants, forged solidarity, impacted politics, and, in the spirit of Esther 4:14, roused individuals to realize that deliverance was not to come from some other place, but from their own heroic actions on behalf of their people.\nEsther in America (Maddig, 2020) is a splendid collection of essays on the complex history of the Book of Esther in American — and particularly American Jewish — culture. Rabbi Dr. Stuart Halpern has assembled a range of essays from some of today's sharpest scholars.\nMatthew Miller is a graduate of Yeshivat Yesodei HaTorah. He studied Jewish Studies and Linguistics at McGill for his BA and completed an MA in Hebrew Linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. He works with Jewish organizations in media and content distribution, such as TheHabura.com and RabbiEfremGoldberg.org.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
