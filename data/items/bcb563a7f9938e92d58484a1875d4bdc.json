Are people expecting too much from celebs when meeting them in person? Are celebs required to behave a certain way? We share our thoughts and stories on meeting people we admire.\n\nThe Friend Zone Live is back on the road! And this time we're taking our siblings, Jade + Keia of @gettingrown, along for the ride!\nDecember 7th - San Francisco\nDecember 14th - Atlanta (SOLD OUT)\nTickets: TheFriendZoneLive.com\n\nWellness Segment: Black Esthetician http://www.skinbymamie.com\n\nThank you to our Sponsors:\n\nTalkspace - These days, everyone knows that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. But scheduling in-person therapy sessions can be inconvenient, not to mention expensive. Thankfully there’s Talkspace, the online talk therapy platform that’s with you 24/7. Talkspace matches you with one of their 5,000+ licensed therapists based on your preferences, because they know that therapy isn’t one-size-fits all (and it shouldn’t be! Their therapists are trained for every need—including depression, anxiety, LGBT-specific issues, and more). You can make your account right from your phone or computer and a matching agent will help you identify your therapy needs. Both messaging and video-based plans are available depending on the level of support you want and you get to choose a plan that fits your budget too. You’ll get 24/7 access from your phone or computer to a licensed therapist that fits your needs. That’s https://www.talkspace.com promo code ZONE.\n\nBombas - Bombas socks are SOFT. Like, “made-with-the-softest-cotton-in-the-world” soft. They’re built with extra cushioning, so whether you’re walking the dog, chilling at home, or playing drums, you’ll be comfortable. Bombas socks provide support in places you didn’t even know you needed it, like your arches. Each sock is built with a special arch-support system that feels like a nice hug for your foot. And they’re smooth across the top – no more annoying toe seam. Bombas makes all types of socks – dress socks for work, performance socks for working out, and limited-edition holiday socks. They even have a line of Merino Wool socks that are soft, warm, and naturally moisture-wicking. Bombas is the gift even that person will love…even that person who seems impossible to shop for. And for every pair you buy, Bombas donates a pair to someone in need. Go to https://bombas.com/friendzone today, and get twenty percent off your first purchase.\n\nAurate - Aurate [pronounced or-rate] is fine jewelry made in New York City, founded by women for women. Pieces range from classic, to statement, to completely original. It’s the jewelry you’ve always wanted, but could never find. Aurate was founded on the desire to shake up the jewelry market by offering modern women beautiful designs, amazing quality at affordable prices, and ethically sourced pieces they can wear every day. Because it’s all real gold, you can wear it and never have to take it off – shower, sport, sleep, cook, anything. It’s jewelry for life! And because Aurate sells direct to you without the middleman markup, they can offer the same quality as traditional 5th Avenue brands at a fraction of the cost. All Aurate pieces come with a lifetime warranty because they know it lasts. Give the gift of high-quality sustainable jewelry this holiday season without the killer price tags, with Aurate. For 15% off your first Aurate purchase, go to https://auratenewyork.com/friendzone and use promo code FRIENDZONE.\n\nFollow us online:\nTwitter - https://www.twitter.com/friendzonepod\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/thefriendzonepodcast\n\nHave a GREAT day!",
