  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris keep trying to fool smart, thinking Americans that President Trump is responsible for coronavirus deaths. Even though, nine out of ten states with the highest deaths-per-million in the country are states run by Democrats. Nearly one-third of all US deaths occurred in New Jersey and New York. Then, Anthony Fauci, who is to blame for so much of this pandemic, agrees with Joe Biden who says wearing masks until the election would save 40,000 lives, despite the claim having no basis in science. With respect to mask-wearing, a government that can control what you wear and what you do when you're outside is a government that has no limits on its power. This is not about science. It has never been about science — it’s a power grab. Later, US Ambassador David Friedman calls in to discuss a once-in-a-generation peace plan. The achievement of normalizing diplomatic ties between Israel and the Arab nations of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The plan suspends annexation of Israeli territory to protect its sovereignty. Friedman reiterated that the Trump administration's support help advance this agreement noting that the Obama-Biden administration did not accomplish anything on this issue in their tenure. Afterward, Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, joins the show to explain that the UAE is now the third Arab state to join a peace agreement with Israel and the first with no territorial concessions. Dermer said more Arab states are expected to join this peace accord but they must all eventually have cooperation with Palestine. Dermer was optimistic that this deal would bring an end to rejectionism and broader peace to the region.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
