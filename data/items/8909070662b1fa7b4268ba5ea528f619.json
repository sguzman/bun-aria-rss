  "description": "There was a time when the kind of music you listened to could fully define the kind of lifestyle you led, says Dawnie Walton, author of <em>The Final Revival of Opal and Nev</em>. It's less restricting now, but your taste in music can still say quite a bit about who you are. In her book and in Tiphanie Yanique's novel <em>Monster in the Middle,</em> music plays at the center of its characters' stories, as they wrestle with figuring out who they are in their relationships, with significant others and their families. NPR's Scott Simon talks with each author about it in today's episode. ",
