  "description": "<p>This week, in Dickinson, North Dakota, a grisly, and horrifying scene is found in a small town motel, populated by transient oil workers, and drifters, of all types. The problem is that no one in this tiny police department had ever dealt with a double homicide, and it shows. The case goes cold, after years pass, but eventually FBI agent John Douglas puts a profile together, that matches one of the original suspects, perfectly. When they track this man down, they find out he's definitely murdered another woman, and is wanted for being a suspect in many more, across multiple states. It looks like the beginning of uncovering the depths of a serial killer... until it all stops cold.
