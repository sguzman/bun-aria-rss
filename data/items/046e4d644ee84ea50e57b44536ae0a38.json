  "description": "<p>Not all rental properties are created equally- and we’re not just talking about how well they’re built! There are a number of factors to keep in mind when you’re considering purchasing different properties as potential rentals. In this episode we talk about finding a good deal on a property and then we cover our favorite criteria that we like to use to filter out those good deals. We also spend some time talking about the 1% rule and if we feel it’s even still relevant in a hot housing market!</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we both enjoyed a beer by Borg Brugghús called Garún Nr. 19, which is an Icelandic Stout. This beer was donated by listeners, so a special thanks to our friends Michelle and Jenn for supporting us!
