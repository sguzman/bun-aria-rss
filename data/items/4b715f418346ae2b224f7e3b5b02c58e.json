Minnesota's ruining Michigan's year! Texas Tech is going to have a only somewhat awful defense! These are but a few of the incredibly ill-advised predictions either you or we proposed, but now is the time to get them all out there before the season immediately proves everything we think we know totally wrong. Think of it as a cleanse for all of our dumb. (We'll find more dumb, don't worry.)\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
