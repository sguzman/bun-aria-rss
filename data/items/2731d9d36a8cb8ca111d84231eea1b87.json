  "description": "President Trump has been acquitted of both articles of impeachment by every Senate Republican except … Romney. The former Republican presidential nominee changed his mind at the last minute, but was he ever a conservative? And the Iowa caucus results are ALMOST in. Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are virtually tied, but no one trusts the data. Also, AI predicted the coronavirus could kill 53 million people, and Nancy Pelosi was caught pre-ripping Trump’s SOTU speech. But most disturbingly, tonight Glenn exposes what can only be described as Iran-Contra II: Obama’s secret wars.
