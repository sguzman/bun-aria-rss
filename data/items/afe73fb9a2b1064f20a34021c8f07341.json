  "description": "<div>Who is the person or “thing” on the other side of a mysterious phone line?<br>\nHere is a preview of the story.<br>\n“I remember all hours I could call that number, and someone would pick up. If you were bored late-night and called that number, there would be somebody there willing to talk, or you got stuck with a busy signal. It was kind of badass how our childhood was, but on with the story.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>There were some strange calls we got, and we got death threats where they knew where we were, and they were waiting for us outside. We were spending time together in an elevator; I was 15 or 16 back then in 1999 and so most of the time I passed the phone to someone more physically threatening. I remember hearing a call with yelling in the background where it simply scared me, I did not know how to react, and I hung up.”<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>To hear more real ghost stories, become a supporter of our show and get every episode, including our weekly bonus episodes at <a href=\"http://www.ghostpodcast.com\">http://www.ghostpodcast.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories\">http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Follow Tony:<br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski\">HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski</a><br>\nTikToc: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski\">https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski\">https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
