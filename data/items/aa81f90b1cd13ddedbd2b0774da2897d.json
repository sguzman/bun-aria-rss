  "description": "In a series of riveting and in depth interviews, America's senior statesman, former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, discusses the challenges of directing foreign policy during times of great global tension. With insights which are pertinent to the present and indeed the future.\nAs National Security Advisor to President Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger utterly transformed America's approach to diplomacy and in particular with China, the USSR, Vietnam, and the Middle East, helping to lay the foundations for geopolitics of the past fifty years, as well as we know them today. In a series of questions and answers with his friend and long-time associate Winston Lord, himself a well-know and celebrated figure--Ambassador to China, Director of the Policy Planning staff, Assistant Secretary of State and head of the Council on Foreign Relations--these conversations provide unique insights into the mind of one of the most celebrated figures in 20th-century American history. Kissinger on Kissinger: Reflections on Diplomacy, Grand Strategy, and Leadership (All Points Books, 2019) is a series of faithfully transcribed interviews between these two men. The result is a frank and well-informed overview of US foreign policy in the tumultuous period of the Nixon-Ford Presidency. This book is essential reading for anyone hoping to understand tomorrow's global challenges.\nCharles Coutinho has a doctorate in history from New York University. Where he studied with Tony Judt, Stewart Stehlin and McGeorge Bundy. His Ph. D. dissertation was on Anglo-American relations in the run-up to the Suez Crisis of 1956. His area of specialization is 19th and 20th-century European, American diplomatic and political history.
