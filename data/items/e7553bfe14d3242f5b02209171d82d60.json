  "description": "<p>Here's the audio from this month's video ROMA that I make for supporters of the podcast. No video for you (!) but some extras, including talking about when/how to offer advice to friends, and how sometimes it's not about what the friend needs, it's what YOU need. Plus, what to do when you can't find your path, how to negotiate (or not) at the beginning of a relationship, and lots of other interesting issues. </p> <p>Music: \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7YPkTrnD4o\">The End</a>,\" by the Stereo MCs; \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V-Em41OZ8U\">Daniela</a>,\" by the John Butler Trio.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
