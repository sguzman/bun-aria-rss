  "description": "<p>We present a complete and independent off-shell Green's basis of the\ndimension 8 operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT). We\npropose an off-shell amplitude formalism such that this new kind of amplitudes\nhas a one-to-one correspondence to general operators carrying all kinds of\nredundancies. The advantage of such formalism is that all kinds of redundancies\ncan be formulated explicitly in terms of the off-shell spinors and thus be\nremoved systematically from the exhaustive list of the general off-shell\namplitudes. Following such procedure, redundant operators can be reduced to the\nones with the only redundancy from the equation of motion kept, the Green's\nbasis. We find there are (993+1649) independent (on-shell + off-shell)\noperators for one generation of fermions and (44807+66197) ones for three\ngenerations at the dimension 8. This systematic method can be applied to obtain\nthe Green's basis at any mass dimension for general EFTs.\n</p>",
