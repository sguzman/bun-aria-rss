  "itunes:summary": "Her Majesty the Queen, Elizabeth II, has ruled the United Kingdom for nearly seventy years. She is now by far the longest reigning British monarch. Each year, on Christmas Day, the Queen gives a message to the nation. On 25 December, 2021 she said, ‘The birth of Jesus marked a new dawn with endless potential. His teachings have been handed down from generation to generation and have been the bedrock of my faith.’\nIn another recent message she said, &#039;Only a few acknowledged Jesus when he was born. Now billions follow him. The message of Jesus is never out of date and is needed as much as ever.&#039;\nIn a previous year, she said of Jesus, &#039;Billions of people now follow his teaching and find in him the guiding light for their lives. I am one of them.&#039;\nThe Queen of the United Kingdom was pointing to another kingdom, a kingdom that Jesus came to establish, and which he will come again to rule. Jesus taught us to pray, &#039;Your kingdom come&#039; (Matthew 6:10). The kingdom of God is the rule and reign of God.",
