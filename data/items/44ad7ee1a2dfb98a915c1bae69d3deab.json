  "description": "<p>“Today, we are supercompetent when it comes to efficiency, utility, speed, convenience, and getting ahead in the world; but we are at a loss concerning what it’s all for,” Leon Kass writes in his 2017 book “<a href=\"https://www.encounterbooks.com/books/leading-worthy-life/\" target=\"_blank\">Leading a Worthy Life</a>.” “This lack of cultural and moral confidence about what makes a life worth living is perhaps the deepest curse of living in our interesting time.”</p><p>Kass spent more than 30 years as an award-winning teacher at the University of Chicago, where he gained a reputation among students for his commitment to the big questions of human existence and the study of classic texts. And he’s written books and essays on marriage, sports, ethics, friendship, romance, the philosophy of food, biblical wisdom and more. In many ways, Kass’s career represents a lifelong effort to grapple with the biggest question of all: What does it mean to live a meaningful life?</p><p>This conversation, between Kass and the New York Times Opinion columnist David Brooks, is an attempt to answer that question. Along the way, they discuss the difference between choosing a career and discovering a vocation; the key ingredients of a successful romantic relationship; how to distinguish between superficial friendships and life-altering ones; why finding the right job is less about searching within ourselves and more about committing to something beyond ourselves; Kass’s view that the most distinctive thing about individuals isn’t their race, gender or class but “the ruling passions of their souls”; and what the biblical Exodus story can teach Americans about how to live together more harmoniously.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300253030/founding-gods-nation\" target=\"_blank\">Founding God’s Nation</a> by Leon Kass</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/217649/the-second-mountain-by-david-brooks/\" target=\"_blank\">The Second Mountain</a> by David Brooks</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html\">Nicomachean Ethics</a> by Aristotle</p><p><a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393292497\" target=\"_blank\">The Hebrew Bible</a>, especially Genesis and Exodus</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/39840/democracy-in-america-by-alexis-de-tocqueville/\" target=\"_blank\">Democracy in America</a> by Alexis de Tocqueville</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/45821/daniel-deronda-by-george-eliot-introduction-by-edmund-white/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Deronda</a> by George Eliot</p><p>This episode is guest-hosted by David Brooks, a New York Times columnist, whose work focuses on politics, culture and moral formation.
