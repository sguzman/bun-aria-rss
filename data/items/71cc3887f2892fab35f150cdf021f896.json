Like a calm before the storm, our society may be on the brink of irreversible and incomprehensible consequences. All objective truth may soon be removed from society and be replaced with a post-modernist approach where truth simply cannot exist. Still, what is the truth? What is the undeniable evolutionary science behind men and women in today’s society? On this episode of Conversations with Tom, Tom is joined by Evolutionary Biologist Heather Heying to discuss such matters and more as they explore today’s society and the undeniable biological differences between men and women, how each sex has a unique and powerful role in societies, and why in today’s modern age, culture wars has eroded trust in objective truth. They discuss today’s social movements and the harmful consequences of letting them go too far, the differences between men and women in society, how hunter-gatherer societies may be key to understanding our roles, the origin of men and women being divided in society by role and purpose, the dangers we face if we continue to deny our differences, why the culture war movements are power hungry, how to have a successful workplace environment and team, and the risks we face as a society if we overprotect our children and refuse to let them take risks and make their own decisions.   SHOW NOTES:   Controversy | Heather reveals why talking about the sexes is now a hot button issue.

[2:07:27]   QUOTES:   “…is it true that an entirely male power structure has a tendency to go off the rails in a particular way in which we’re well familiar from like all of history? Yeah, of course, right? Would an all-female power structure go off the rails in a particular way that we’re less familiar with from history? A hundred-percent. I don’t want to see that anymore than I want to see, you know, another World War II…” [15:30]   “…what you said earlier is just exactly right and I’ve never heard anyone say it before which is that when you have been on all-male teams, it’s easier, and when you have been on mixed-sex teams, it’s more productive and I just, you know, so hope that that anecdote holds across everything. It’s what I’m sort of banking on…” [57:23]   “The thing is, yes we get less flexible as we age, for sure. Our brains get less plastic, we get more, you know, canalized into our particular ways of thinking but continuing to expose ourselves to more and more experiences that are different from anything we imagined is how to keep that flexibility…” [1:29:20]   FOLLOW HEATHER:   Website: heatherheying.com Twitter: twitter.com/HeatherEHeying LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/heathereheying Podcast: youtube.com/channel/UCi5N_uAqApEUIlg32QzkPlg Patreon: patreon.com/heatherheying  ",
