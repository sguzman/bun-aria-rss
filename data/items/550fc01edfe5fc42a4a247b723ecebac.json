  "description": "<p>Does God really care about your sex life? And if so, does that also mean that God can help you have the best sex of your life? After more than a decade of Catholic school and Christain churches I was unclear about the Bible, God's actual will, sex, and the relationship between pleasure and sin. In an effort to gain clarity, I brought in some people to talk about it! This week's staring guest is Shameless Maya – A Christian YouTube star who was conflicted and confused while practicing celibacy. You'll also be hearing from theology expert Tara Teng, Christian influencer Brenda Marie Davies aka God is Grey, Jared Brady and his father Derrex Brady.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Shan on Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shanboody\">www.instagram.com/shanboody</a></p>\n<p>Stay up to date with Shan and Lovers and Friends Casting: <a href=\"https://www.shanboodram.com/join\">www.shanboodram.com/join</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Shameless Maya Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mayasworld\">www.instagram.com/mayasworld</a></p>\n<p>Follow Maya's Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/shamelessmaya\">https://www.youtube.com/c/shamelessmaya</a></p>\n<p>Follow Maya and Max's YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxMayaLiving\">https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxMayaLiving</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Derrex Brady</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/derrexbrady\">https://www.instagram.com/derrexbrady</a></p>\n<p>Watch JOHNSON on Bounce TV</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Tara Teng</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/misstarateng/\">https://www.instagram.com/misstarateng/</a></p>\n<p>Preorder Brenda's books \"Your Body is a Revolution: Healing Our Relationships with Our Bodies, Each Other and the Earth\".  Available everywhere Spring 2023.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Brenda \"God is Grey\"</p>\n<p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/GodisGrey\">https://www.youtube.com/c/GodisGrey</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow Jared:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/enjoyjaredbrady\">http://instagram.com/enjoyjaredbrady</a></p>\n\n",
