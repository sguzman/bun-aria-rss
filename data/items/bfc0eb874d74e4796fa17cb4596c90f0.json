  "description": "Ken Clarke is the Father of the House and one of the longest serving Cabinet ministers in British history. A prominent Chancellor, Health Secretary and Home Secretary among many other positions, he is one of the most popular politicians in Parliament. He now finds himself in an unusual position, having the Conservative Whip removed for blocking a 'No Deal' Brexit. He joins Matt on the evening that Boris Johnson addressed the Commons following the Supreme Court ruling that found he'd acted unlawfully in proroguing Parliament (and explains why he wasn't there to witness it). As well as giving us his hilarious and frank assessment of the state we're in, Ken gives us the inside story on some of the biggest moments in recent history including The Poll Tax and The Miner's Strike. By the time you listen to this, who knows what role Ken may have..?
