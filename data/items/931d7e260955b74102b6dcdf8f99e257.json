  "title": "PMS 2.0 020 - A Life Coach Calls The Show",
  "description": "Today's show is packed with some incredible conversations. First, former Iowa Hawkeye legend and Colts linebacker, Pat Angerer, joins the show to talk about being George Kittle's newly appointed life coach, what he's been up to, being a newly minted tag team champion on a local wrestling circuit in Iowa, and how he's been enjoying this NFL season along with his Super Bowl pick. Also included is his infamous naked locker room fight story from the first time he was on the show (3:55-33:33). Later, Pat sits down with Digs for another edition of Quick Hits to cover everything going on in the NFL, Connor and Evan join Pat to discuss how incredible Zion Williamson's debut was, Todd and Pat chat about Brock Lesnar sticking with the WWE through April and what that means for his UFC prospects, and Nick joins the show for some Throwback Thursday music and a little hockey talk. Stick around until the end for an incredible #endgang #endgame opportunity. It's a good one. Come laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
