  "description": "<p>Is it possible to pay down $200,000 of debt while living in a big city, and still find enjoyment in everyday life? Yes! In this episode we’re lucky enough to sit down with Kiersten and Julien Saunders who blog at <a href=\"http://richandregular.com/\">RichAndRegular.com</a> where they document their journey to financial independence. During this episode we hear from Kiersten and Julien about the unique struggles of African Americans in the corporate world, how they stayed motivated to pay down debt, their approach to effective budgeting, and how Julien’s background as a professional chef keeps their monthly expenses down. </p><p>During this episode we all shared a beer- The Last Blockbuster by 10 Barrel Brewing which you can find on Untappd. A huge thanks to our friend Scott out in Bend, Or for donating this beer to the show!
