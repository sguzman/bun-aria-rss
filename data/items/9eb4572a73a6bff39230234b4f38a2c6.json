  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There aren’t many recent romances you can point to and categorically label as game changers, but Sally Thorne’s <em>The Hating Game</em> definitely fits this bill. We talk about all the ways we love it, about sparkling dialogue and witty writing and what makes a romcom and how this book changed the cover game for a generation of romance. Oh, and yes, we get to the bottom (jk, there is no bottom) of Jen’s issues with first-person present.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You still have time to buy the Fated Mates Best of 2020 Book Pack from our friends at <a href=\"https://www.oldtownbooks.com/fatedmates\">Old Town Books in Alexandria Virginia</a>, and get the seven traditionally published books on the list, a Fated Mates sticker and a candle from the bookstore! <a href=\"https://www.oldtownbooks.com/fatedmates\">Order before December 5th for Christmas delivery!</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you, as always, for listening!
