  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Rep Liz Cheney suggests that then-President Trump committed a federal crime on January 6th, 2021. Of course, Congress has no authority to prosecute any crime, and acting in this manner violates one's Fifth Amendment rights. in doing so, Liz Cheney has demonstrated that many in Trump's inner circle urged him via texts to Mark Meadows to speak out against the violence at the Capitol. Incidentally, Trump had offered 10,000 National Guard troops, but Speaker Pelosi rejected the President's offer. This Pelosi-appointed committee is covering up for her. The real question is: what did Pelosi know and when did she know it? Then, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who lied about combat service in Vietnam, attended the 102nd-anniversary celebration of the Communist Party USA. Blumenthal had his American Marxism on full display. Later, Barak Ravid fires back on Twitter but remains a small fish in a large pond. Israeli prosecutors have made flimsy allegations against Benjamin Netanyahu hoping that the charges will stick. Afterward, smash-and-grab robberies abound in California and while retailers are installing barbed wire, leftwing politicians refuse to empower police or prosecutors to stop the problem. The White House dodges questions on crime and remains silent on this issue. Finally, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich joins the show with an update on his lawsuits against the Biden Administration's unconstitutional policies on vaccine mandates and the southern border. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
