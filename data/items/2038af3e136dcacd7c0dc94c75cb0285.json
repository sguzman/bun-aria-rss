  "description": "<p>r/Askreddit On today's episode we have two askreddit questions: What's the best joke you know? and What are your night shift horror stories? I wanted to include the jokes to lighten the mood at a bit, because some of the horror stories are downright horrifying, disgusting, and creepy. For example, one user who worked at a morgue told a story about a guy who tried to pay them money to let him spend a few hours alone with the freshest corpses. What do you think he wanted to do with them?</p>\n",
