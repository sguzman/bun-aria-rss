  "itunes:summary": "If your child escalates quickly, struggles to calm down, and hates talking about their feelings… there's nothing wrong with them. And there’s nothing wrong with you. Your kid is probably a Deeply Feeling Kid. In this week’s episode, Dr. Becky hears from three parents of DFKs and explains why these kids need a different approach—and what that approach looks like. She shares scripts and strategies to help you show up as a sturdy leader, put up boundaries to stop difficult behavior, and bring out the good inside your child. Dr. Becky also reminds parents that seeking additional support for your DFK is a sign of everything that’s *right* in your family: You’re willing to work through the tricky things, together. \n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
