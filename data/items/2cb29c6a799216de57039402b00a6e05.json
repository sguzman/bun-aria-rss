    "media:description": "I’m sure we’ve all been through that phase when you just want to make 30 minute thinly veiled monochrome allegories about your fear of ageing. \nBooks what I wrote, yo ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3 \n\nBonus trivia: This video is not finished. But if I don’t let it go now, I will be. \nThe beginning fell into my head several months ago. I assumed it would take a few weeks to make, at most. Little did I know it would sprout multiple heads and take over my life for two and a half months. If you didn’t enjoy watching it, take comfort that I didn’t enjoy making it. (Just jokez. Thanks for watching my stuff as always, and hope you’re well :) )\n\nBonus bonus trivia: The original title was supposed to be \"The Nine Isles of Neverdead\", but google told me Neverdead is already a thing; apparently a video game about demons and stuff. \n\nI'm sorry this one took a while. I'm especially sorry to folks on Patreon. I think I told you it would only be another week about three weeks ago? Apologies, but I didn't want to put the thing out half baked.\n\n A very, very big thank you to a friend who wishes to go by the name Jimmy Cakeshoes. When the editing was almost done, it was impossible to render the video because my PC kept having little meltdowns and locking up. One genius technical fix later from Dr. Cakeshoes and all was well. Big love to you, man. \n\nThe poems mentioned at the end are: \n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot\nhttps://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock\n\nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge \nhttps://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834\n\nKubla Khan also by Samuel Taylor Coleridge \nhttps://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan\n\nI fully admit to stealing that line from the end of The Great Gatsby. \n\nDiscord server ► https://discord.gg/76ybBSR  (just in case that doesn’t work: discord.gg/exurb1a)\nThe Fifth Science Paperback ► https://tinyurl.com/y5zj33s5 (you may need to change your region accordingly: .co.uk, etc)\n I also make horrendous music ► https://soundcloud.com/exurbia-1\n For sending personalised insults ► https://www.facebook.com/exurb1a/ \nHelp me to do this full-time, if you're deranged enough ► https://www.patreon.com/exurb1r?ty=h \nThe rest of my books ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3\n\nAnd as always, the entirety of this one was edited with the feline sleeping on my lap.",
