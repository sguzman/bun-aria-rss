  "description": "<p>Investigative reporter and co-author of the book “Victim F”, Nicole Weisensee Egan&nbsp;deep dives&nbsp;into the tactics used against Aaron&nbsp;when he was interrogated by police. Jim and Laura are shocked that the detective who handled this case so badly actually received&nbsp;the “Law Enforcement Officer of the Year” Award that year. Jim weighs in with what he thinks was going on with the initial police investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura reads a reprehensible quote that Detective Matt Mustard said to Denise’s mother and also points out that the misogynistic attitudes&nbsp;evidenced&nbsp;by&nbsp;some&nbsp;in the Vallejo police should disqualify them from dealing with vulnerable victims.</p><p><br></p><p>LINK TO VICTIM F BOOK</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3fPBbo2</a></p><p><br></p><p>You can hear the links used in this episode in their entirety here:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://abc7news.com/gone-girl-kidnapping-case-vallejo-kidnap-hoax-matthew-muller/1335950/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://abc7news.com/gone-girl-kidnapping-case-vallejo-kidnap-hoax-matthew-muller/1335950/</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/police-cast-doubt-aaron-quinns-story-denise-huskins-78095427\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/police-cast-doubt-aaron-quinns-story-denise-huskins-78095427</a></p><p><br></p><p>We are so thankful for our sponsors.
