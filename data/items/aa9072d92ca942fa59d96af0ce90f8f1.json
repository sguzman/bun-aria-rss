Dan is the host of the podcast <em>Missing Richard Simmons, Running from Cops</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Line</em>. His new show is called <em>9/12,</em> and the series is about what happened after 9/11: How 9/11 the day became 9/11 the idea, and how that idea has shaped the world, our culture, and ourselves for the past 20 years. While my series focuses on the deep personal histories, experiences of the day itself, and the long aftermath for people who have experienced the tragedy up close, Dan’s series takes a sweeping look at the cultural, social, political and conspiratorial implications of 9/11 and what it means for us today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Social Media</strong>: Instagram: @actuallyhappening</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.thisisactuallyhappening.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.thisisactuallyhappening.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wondery Plus: All episodes of the show prior to episode #130 are now part of the Wondery Plus premium service.
