There is a multi-trillion dollar global food industry that is growing, processing, manufacturing, marketing, and serving food like substances that are making us sick and fat. They are cheap to make and rake in big profits for ”Big Food” which is furiously promoting false science. And many of the nutrition myths that are prevalent today were spread like propaganda by the food industry.</p><br><p>Taxpayers are footing the bill for the growing of processed foods (through agricultural subsidies for the raw materials of processed food—namely wheat, corn, and soy), and for providing the poor quality processed food and soda to the poor (through our food stamps program). Then, we also pay for the costs of obesity and chronic disease caused by that food through Medicaid and Medicare. Not to mention the costs of soil degradation, depletion of our water supplies, climate change, and the widespread damage to humans and ecosystems from pesticides. This is because the food industry lobbyists push policies that use our tax dollars against us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman talks about all this and more in this mini-episode.
