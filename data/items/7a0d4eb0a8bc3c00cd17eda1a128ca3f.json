  "description": "<p>It's time for a Friday Flight! These episodes are all about the week’s news and the effects of Covid-19 on your personal finances. There are a lot of headlines out there, but we are distilling it down to specific takeaways that will allow you to not just weather this health and financial crisis, but to come out on the other side even stronger. In this episode we cover some practical topics like the rise of fake podcasts, the increased number of new books to be published this fall, digital coupons, what the payroll tax holiday means for you, and how much money working from home is saving our country. After all of that we touch on what airlines are dropping their change fees, the rush of speculative day traders, and the high cost of money therapists.</p><p>Also, don’t forget this is your chance to raid our bookshelf! You can win 3 of the dozen books we’re giving away and we’re talking about books of previous guests who we’ve had on the show. Titles like <em>I Will Teach You to be Rich</em>, <em>The Behavioral Investor</em>, <em>Can I Have Your Attention?</em> as well as several others. And the way to be one of the 4 winners is by leaving us a written review over at Apple Podcasts.
