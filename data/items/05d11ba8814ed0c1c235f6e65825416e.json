A road map for setting,<br>planning, and achieving your goals.<br>And she also attended college at both the University of<br>Nebraska and the University of Wisconsin,<br>and I shared that because I know there are at<br>least a few people in the audience who will think<br>more highly of our guests because of her affiliation with<br>those two schools. So let me bring Deborah up onto<br>the screen here.<br>Hold on if you if you&#8217;re just joining type in<br>Hi Deb to let her know that we&#8217;re watching and<br>I&#8217;m going to bring it to the show.<br>Hello Deb. Hi, thank you so much for having me<br>and I have to tell you this is the first<br>time I&#8217;ve been introduced with both of my college affiliation.<br>So Gold Star for being original and cool and awesome.<br>Hey that&#8217;s fantastic and I&#8217;m also trying something a little<br>bit different.<br>I used to do these shows and I did sort<br>of a little bit of small talk at the beginning<br>to let people.<br>Get in an and get on the show,<br>but we&#8217;re not going to do that today,<br>so we&#8217;re just going to dive right into the topic<br>this week about goal setting and how to do better.<br>So we&#8217;re just going to start out with what is<br>the most important part of setting a goal.<br>Well, I love this question because what happens is people<br>overthink or they under think their goals.<br>So the most important part is figuring out what it<br>is you want &#8217;cause you can get what you want.<br>If you don&#8217;t know what you want.<br>So I created the dead method.<br>Now I&#8217;ve been coaching and leading groups and helping people<br>define,<br>plan and achieve their goals for years.<br>And then in 2018 I rebranded as the name of<br>my system which is the depth method isn&#8217;t that convenient?<br>Fit my days worked out.<br>But Deb stands for determine your mission.<br>Explore your options. Brainstorm your path so these are the<br>three phases that I came up with,<br>which will really help you figure out what you want<br>and create a plan to achieve it.<br>And it really starts with that first,<br>then D. Determine your mission and that&#8217;s when you really<br>think about what is the life you want.<br>What do you want to create?<br>What is your goal? Topia?<br>That&#8217;s the word I made up for your perfect world<br>where you&#8217;re living like you want an.<br>Realizing your goals, what does that look like and then<br>think about where you are and then where you&#8217;re going?<br>And then what is your mission behind it?<br>Why do you want these things?<br>What do you have to offer the world?<br>What do you want to create and how will it<br>help you but also help others?<br>And from there you can like drill it down to<br>a motto.<br>So if you know all those things and I know<br>it&#8217;s a long answer,<br>but if you&#8217;ve got that basis then all the goals<br>that you set in relation to your mission.<br>In relation to your motto,<br>you&#8217;re already halfway there because you know what you want.<br>You&#8217;re just setting your goals to achieve that.<br>Right, eight I, I agree,<br>and this is good, we have Christina&#8217;s chiming in.<br>She is a no no resolution type of person and<br>that is OK.<br>Everyone&#8217;s a little bit different,<br>but. Yeah, resolutions and goals and I&#8217;m actually going to<br>jump into that right now.<br>Is there a difference between resolutions and goals?<br>I really don&#8217;t think so.<br>I think resolutions are the start of every year.<br>The opportunity to start from scratch,<br>but I believe the goal setting is really year round.<br>You can start reassess, figure out what you want in<br>life.<br>All the time, anytime beginning of the year,<br>every three months, the only thing or when something happens<br>I change either by choice or by circumstance,<br>and you need to reevaluate your life.<br>Those are the best times to set goals,<br>set resolutions, what you want to be wary of is<br>you don&#8217;t want to set knew big big goals like<br>every week,<br>every month because you&#8217;re not giving the goals.<br>A chance to realize themselves.<br>So start with that step of figuring out what you<br>want and make a plan to get it,<br>and then Jack in with yourself every couple months.<br>See if it&#8217;s working for you and again you have<br>a life change or you need to make a decision.<br>That&#8217;s when you should look at those goals and the<br>resolutions.<br>But we do get a reminder the beginning of every<br>year.<br>OK, let&#8217;s start fresh slate.<br>I I love that idea of start with what you<br>want because it&#8217;s important to know that wait,<br>I have a question for you.<br>Yeah, what is your resolution?<br>You know, hey, this is great.<br>I said I want to do it 10.<br>Amazon lives by the end of January and so I&#8217;m<br>feeling alright on this.<br>Amazon Live is a new platform.<br>It&#8217;s kind of new to me.<br>I&#8217;m trying it out and I&#8217;ve done 3 so far.<br>So you&#8217;re the third, you&#8217;re not my third live show,<br>you&#8217;re my third Amazon live.<br>So that&#8217;s fantastic. You&#8217;re actually my first author interview,<br>so I think I&#8217;m going to be doing a lot<br>more of those,<br>and I want to set that goal because I wanted<br>to evaluate the Amazon Live platform to see if it&#8217;s<br>a platform I want to continue going live on further<br>in 2021.<br>Can I ask a follow up?<br>Yeah, I know you&#8217;re interviewing me,<br>but I&#8217;m just curious. So you,<br>what is your goal? What do you want to be<br>able to say at the end of 2021?<br>Alright, so here is, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on setting<br>up I I was a Blogger in data science for<br>years.<br>I still have a blog and one of the things<br>I kind of wanted to transition myself into.<br>Helping other people in the field of technology become content<br>creators.<br>And so I am going to be interviewing book authors<br>and other content creators for the duration of 2021,<br>hoping that eventually I can start offering a course in<br>some training around.<br>How do you become a content creator?<br>OK, so your goal Topia if I may be so<br>bold.<br>Yes, to be the go to guy on content creation<br>for people in tech,<br>yes.<br>That&#8217;s perfect, so your resolution in your goals are all<br>working together to get you to that place.<br>So your gold stars where my gold stars.<br>I say there we go.<br>Well, thanks, I feel like I&#8217;m getting a free consulting<br>session,<br>so thank you for that.<br>So can I challenge the audience?<br>Can I change the question you you can do whatever<br>you want on the show here I guess.<br>So rather than think of it in terms of resolutions,<br>think of it in terms of what I just asked,<br>Ryan. What do you want to be able to say<br>at the end of next year that you accomplished and<br>then you said so you&#8217;re looking at a year long<br>goal and then look to it as what short term<br>goals do you have to do in order to reach<br>that long term goal?<br>So and I&#8217;m backing I&#8217;m backing into the dev method<br>here,<br>so you determine your mission.<br>Next, you want to explore your options.<br>You want to see? OK,<br>I want this. What does that mean?<br>I want to be the go to.<br>Accounting guy for attack? Well,<br>what do I do? Do I block and I&#8217;m using<br>you as an example,<br>even though you&#8217;ve done this because it works really well.<br>Do I block? Do I do live shows?<br>Do I do podcasting? Do I write a book?<br>What ways do I want to manifest this knowledge?<br>And then you research the different things and figure out<br>OK,<br>what&#8217;s the fit? Great go to guy on content for<br>text Anne,<br>I&#8217;m going to do it via live shows,<br>so then you brainstorm your path.<br>Everything you need to do to accomplish that goal at<br>the end of the year.<br>It&#8217;s math were tech people watching.<br>Think of the endpoint and what you need to do<br>to get there.<br>It&#8217;s it&#8217;s just brainstorming, logic and planning,<br>and so my follow-up question for Deb on this is<br>what are some of the common mistakes you see with<br>people in goal setting?<br>Well, the first one we already addressed,<br>which is not knowing what you want because you can&#8217;t<br>get what you want if you don&#8217;t know what you<br>want,<br>simple, basic, etc. Beyond that,<br>don&#8217;t.<br>I love this story. Friend of mine once told me<br>that she writes down her goals at the beginning of<br>the year,<br>puts them in a drawer and at the end of<br>the year she will look and be pleasantly surprised if<br>she accomplishes something.<br>That is probably the biggest mistake you can make,<br>which is putting them aside and in crossing your fingers.<br>Not only do you need to know what it is,<br>but you should keep a top of mind.<br>So big mistake not looking at your goals direction.<br>Look at your goals.<br>But then you could do a List 35 whatever your<br>top goals that you are working towards throughout the year<br>and put it.<br>I have mine like behind my computer.<br>I look at it all the time.<br>Another place to do it is take a picture of<br>that list and put it on your phone as the<br>wallpaper.<br>Put another good one. I put it on your computer.<br>I say if your your yoga teacher put on new<br>yoga mat.<br>If you&#8217;re a chef, put on your fridge,<br>put it in that place that you know you&#8217;re going<br>to look at because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a top of mind<br>thing.<br>So very common. Mistake the other common mistake is not<br>prioritizing yourself or your goals,<br>because a lot of the people who I work with<br>they have these wonderful passion projects that aren&#8217;t necessarily currently.<br>Revenue generating, they have things that they are building.<br>They want to write a book.<br>They want to launch a course.<br>Things that benefit down the line.<br>But right now it&#8217;s Oh my goodness.<br>How do I find the time?<br>And you need to prioritize yourself an even if it&#8217;s<br>an hour a week,<br>do half hours a week,<br>15 minutes, four times a week,<br>whatever. When you look at your life,<br>your calendar, you want to set yourself up for success.<br>So look at your life Z.<br>What&#8217;s feasable, put those appointments in your calendar and keep<br>them.<br>I audience here. Christina says one of her biggest problems<br>is unplanned or incorrect prioritization,<br>or prioritizing too much. She also said she likes the<br>phone background suggestion.<br>That was a great one that was a little nugget<br>that you threw out there free for everyone that&#8217;s listening<br>here.<br>I kind of want to dive into this one before<br>I go back to the calendar.<br>How do you deal with or how do you make<br>sure that you avoid incorrect prioritization or prioritizing?<br>Too many things because we all get in that you<br>can&#8217;t say everything is my top priority,<br>because if everything through top priority nothings are top priority,<br>exactly in that goes back to what&#8217;s the biggest challenge<br>people have with goals they under think them.<br>Or they overthink them. They don&#8217;t have a plan,<br>so thank you, Christina, that that is the crux of<br>most people&#8217;s challenges.<br>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to call back to the<br>mission and Motto.<br>So if you have your mission behind what you were<br>doing it acts like a compass.<br>So my mission is to help a do use my<br>background experience and systems to help as many people as<br>possible.<br>Figure out what they want and how to get it<br>through.<br>Goal setting and productivity. I know really,<br>really long, but that&#8217;s why we have a motto because<br>we can take that long thing and shorten it up.<br>So my motto is goal setting simplified,<br>so all of my activities related to.<br>Anything in getting myself out into the world?<br>I have the the simplified process,<br>so my book really super easy instructions because I believe<br>changing your life is difficult enough.<br>You shouldn&#8217;t have to question or get too caught up<br>in how to connect the dots.<br>Write my workshops by seminars anytime I speak.<br>It&#8217;s all with that logic and I love that you<br>use stress free goal setting in the title of this<br>because.<br>The goals that you&#8217;ve set it should make your life<br>better.<br>They should not stress you out.<br>They shouldn&#8217;t drive you like why am I doing this?<br>No, so when you have that model,<br>that is your barometer. So when opportunities come your way,<br>you can say does this fit in line with my<br>mission and motto?<br>Yes, great no skip it.<br>Or if something comes your way that it isn&#8217;t in<br>alignment but enriches you in another way,<br>then that&#8217;s also fine. But when you know these things,<br>the end goal. It really helps with that prioritization.<br>The other thing in going back to brainstorm your path<br>I love.<br>I love writing the things.<br>Obviously my background is communications and project management.<br>So what do you do to make a plan right?<br>Everything out, organize it, categorize it,<br>put in deadlines. Figure out what you need to do.<br>So go back to that.<br>Look at your life, say see how much time you<br>have to devote to these goals in the week.<br>Put together those appointments. But look at that big list<br>of the things that you have to do an an<br>map it all out.<br>Which action items lead to each benchmark?<br>Which benchmark leads to each short term goal with short<br>term goal leads to each long-term goal?<br>Oh, this is this is great stuff and I love<br>that you were saying about it.<br>All ties back to you.<br>You need to know what you want because opportunities are<br>going to come your way throughout the gear and you<br>need to know whether that really aligns with what you<br>want to do or not.<br>And I will say this is one of the things<br>I&#8217;ve struggled with with a lot of my like side<br>projects and like my blog and people ask me to<br>post things on my blog and I never really had<br>a good method for does this align with what I<br>want my blog to talk about.<br>Or not, and I started realizing it just took me<br>down a lot of different paths that.<br>Maybe weren&#8217;t so beneficial for me and didn&#8217;t help me<br>reach any of my goals.<br>They just took time. And fill it,<br>that&#8217;s exactly it. I&#8217;ve got a great story.<br>Do you want a good story that goes with that<br>example I,<br>you know, we always want a good story here on<br>the live show.<br>And now I feel like I I really like oversold<br>it,<br>but a couple of years ago somebody asked me to<br>speak on a panel and it was something about women<br>in the workplace.<br>I&#8217;m woman worked day job for many years.<br>It was not in complete alignment with what I did,<br>but it was a friend and I said OK,<br>but I was a little.<br>About it and once you know the day of the<br>event was cancelled,<br>I mean talk about the universe right and when this<br>person rescheduled the event it was for January and I<br>said,<br>you know what? I would love to help you out.<br>But January is goal setting season in my big busiest<br>time and I&#8217;m not available to do it.<br>Thank you for thinking of me.<br>So I I took my own advice.<br>Looked say OK it it would be a nice thing<br>to do,<br>but I couldn&#8217;t so I went with my gut.<br>I aligned with my motto and said no.<br>Thank you and wouldn&#8217;t you know an opportunity that was<br>much more in alignment.<br>Came up for that same night.<br>So trust your gut, your house,<br>your motto, trust your mission.<br>It will not steer you wrong.<br>It&#8217;s it&#8217;s hard to say no.<br>I know sometimes but but if you get that beginning<br>of know what you want,<br>it helped make saying no better because.<br>You have a reason for saying no,<br>and I, I think people understand when you just say<br>you know this doesn&#8217;t really align with what I want<br>to do,<br>so I&#8217;m going to say no,<br>yeah, yeah, blame me, blame me honestly.<br>Because when you add in in one of the things<br>that that I discovered when I was doing research for<br>my book,<br>working in my book proposal is most books that help<br>people with goals don&#8217;t take the time to help you<br>figure out what those goals are in.<br>For me, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s the crux.<br>And I talked too much with my hands and my<br>microphone just went that way.<br>I thought I wouldn&#8217;t have that problem.<br>If I use the mic microphone,<br>but apparently I&#8217;m very, very talented.<br>It happens on alright. I wanted to.<br>I wanted to come back.<br>You started mentioning this this calendar and this idea,<br>and I know this is something you like to talk<br>about.<br>I love I love my To Do List and I<br>love my calendar so tell us a little bit about<br>you said very briefly,<br>you said, make appointments with yourself and put them on<br>the calendar.<br>Speak about that a little bit.<br>Well, it goes back to that.<br>That mistake people make, which is not prioritizing themselves not<br>prioritizing their goals.<br>When you make appointments with yourself then you are treating<br>your time as sacred as the time you reserved for<br>other people.<br>You wouldn&#8217;t cancel an appointment with your boss or a<br>client,<br>or really anybody, because it&#8217;s their time,<br>so why would you cancel an appointment with yourself?<br>I do have a little loophole in that the calendar<br>rule,<br>which is you look at your life.<br>You say, OK, I could do 2 hours on my<br>goals this week and I&#8217;m not quite sure which too,<br>but still clean the time you can move the appointments,<br>but you can&#8217;t delete.<br>Oh, that is that is Golden.<br>There you can move the appointment but you can&#8217;t delete<br>him.<br>And one other thing on that.<br>So here is a problem that I know people frequently<br>have.<br>When they I&#8217;ve heard of people,<br>they set up these calendars and they put 15 minutes.<br>Today in 15 minutes. Tomorrow in 15 minutes the next<br>day and they miss it today because life happens and<br>we we all have to deal with that.<br>You never know what&#8217;s going to happen in life.<br>Things happen. You miss an appointment.<br>So then tomorrow they&#8217;ve got well.<br>They feel like they need to make up for yesterday&#8217;s<br>15 minutes that they missed.<br>What do you say about that?<br>Oh my goodness, you didn&#8217;t realize this,<br>but this is my five of seven roll.<br>It is what it in an I used 15 minutes<br>is the example when I talk about it as well<br>is a lot of people say you should do something<br>every day in like you?<br>I say that&#8217;s great. In theory it&#8217;s not realistic and<br>that&#8217;s why I say look at your calendar.<br>Look at your life and put in those appointments because<br>what&#8217;s gonna happen is you miss a day so you<br>think you should do 30 minutes and then you missed<br>two days so you figure OK Tuesday I&#8217;ll do 45<br>minutes and by Wednesday if you didn&#8217;t have 15 minutes.<br>You don&#8217;t have an hour skip the days.<br>You have to skip and start over.<br>Yeah, so that that&#8217;s that&#8217;s great advice there.<br>When you if you missed yesterday,<br>just move on to the next day.<br>Don&#8217;t try to pile it back on and I think<br>I think that&#8217;s great information.<br>Now I&#8217;m going to dive back into it.<br>I got, I got some other questions that I wanted.<br>To talk about. Here&#8217;s an here&#8217;s an audience question,<br>so if you&#8217;re watching on Amazon Live or on wherever<br>you&#8217;re watching,<br>type in a comment and let us know whether when<br>you set goals,<br>do you set personal, professional or both,<br>and so this is what I want to talk with<br>Deb about.<br>How do you? How do you differentiate and deal with<br>these?<br>Because especially now and coronavirus a lot of us are<br>stuck at home and the difference between work and home<br>is a little more blurry than it.<br>Maybe wasn&#8217;t the past. So do you set them all<br>together or the dependent on each other?<br>What can you say about that?<br>The answer is yes. But I will elaborate great because<br>you do you need both personal and professional goals and<br>what happens is your if you.<br>When you achieve your personal goals and helps her professional<br>life and when you achieve your professional goals,<br>it&#8217;s going to help your personal life.<br>So if one of your personal goals is to have<br>a healthier life,<br>healthier lifestyle, you know if you&#8217;re healthier,<br>you&#8217;re going to be better set for business.<br>You&#8217;re going to have more energy and be more motivated<br>for professional goals.<br>If you it works going well,<br>it&#8217;s gonna leak into your personal life.<br>So they really do work together and it goes back<br>to.<br>You you figured out your mission,<br>you know your destination. What you want to accomplish and<br>when you brainstorm that major list of goals,<br>benchmarks, and action items, you should be putting in both<br>personal and professional goals.<br>So you put everything out there and then get had<br>a garage.<br>Them what needs to be done to get to each<br>benchmark?<br>What benchmarks make up each short-term goal in now personal<br>goals.<br>They work a little bit differently because sometimes you can<br>batch him up.<br>I call them project personal goals,<br>but they&#8217;re also lifestyle personal goals,<br>which are an hour a week.<br>You do this, or like you meal plan or you<br>workout three times a week and another very important personal<br>goal because you mentioned that that blurred line is make<br>up some rules for your personal goals.<br>You know, set a stop time at the end of<br>the day.<br>Give yourself a lunch break put.<br>All these things in the calendar,<br>if you can take cough dry cough the whole weekend.<br>Yeah right. Do you know anybody who other than like<br>on a vacation or an actual break takes 2 days<br>off in a row?<br>I sure don&#8217;t so more realistic.<br>Is a sign either a morning or an afternoon or<br>a whole weekend day where you&#8217;re not going to work<br>so you can do the things that are going to<br>re energize and refresh you so you&#8217;re better set for<br>the rest of the week.<br>So yes, do both again figure out what&#8217;s going to<br>work in your life.<br>Put in your calendar. Do them.<br>This is, this is so good there&#8217;s so much great<br>information being dropped and shared in here we I have<br>a follow up on this one when when you&#8217;re talking<br>about professional and personal goals.<br>How many goals should you set in either of those<br>spaces?<br>Well, what is your priority?<br>If your priority is something you&#8217;re trying to accomplish professionally,<br>you&#8217;re going to have more of those.<br>If your your priority is work,<br>life balance is so my book.<br>The first half of my book goes through the depth<br>method.<br>The second half is strategies for success,<br>and I talk about the four goal paths which are<br>work life balance,<br>the starter build, business career,<br>or job change. Known expert and I somehow managed to<br>batch all the goals into.<br>One of those four categories,<br>and if your goal is due.<br>A. Elevate yourself as an expert because it sounds like<br>that&#8217;s a lot of that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re working on and<br>things that your listeners are doing.<br>You know, data science, listeners,<br>watchers, audience, Audience, audience, audience because you want to have<br>content creation is all about sharing what you know in<br>helping others.<br>So look at what that means for you.<br>OK, I want to be known for doing this so<br>I can help other people do that better.<br>What is that mean for you?<br>So look at it. Maybe you want to do a<br>blog and then a podcast and then a video series<br>or courses.<br>But look at what is the order dry did take<br>like 1A goal and then one beta goal and all<br>the things that that go with it an I always<br>say you should be working on at least do like.<br>Impactful goals at a time.<br>Because if you&#8217;re challenged on one thing,<br>you can jump over to the other and that way<br>they are both moving forward at all times.<br>So maybe you&#8217;re developing your blog is your Alpha goal<br>and your beta goal is working on that social media<br>presence because they both inform and help each other.<br>And if you are like.<br>You can jump and work on the other and then<br>once that gets rolling,<br>jump to the first thing.<br>So in terms of goals and you only you know<br>your number.<br>Look at your life and what makes sense,<br>but I&#8217;d say an we&#8217;re talking resolutions so maybe you<br>pick like 5 things by big goals.<br>You want to have accomplished by the end of the<br>year and break them down and work on a few<br>simultaneously.<br>And so they elevate each other that that&#8217;s good to<br>have the Alpha and the beta goals there,<br>because pick on that align together so that you can<br>keep yourself moving forward if it&#8217;s one or the other.<br>The trick is not having an Alpha,<br>beta gamma, Delta not having tenable &#8217;cause then it gets<br>overwhelming because you can&#8217;t keep up with those.<br>Exactly exactly and I I will.<br>I&#8217;ll give another good example.<br>So my second book, which was right on blogging.<br>51 tips to create right and promote your blog.<br>I had been doing the guy to Gold podcast so<br>I did 40 I think 41 episodes of interviewing,<br>interesting people talking about their story in offering tips for<br>goal,<br>setting success. And it was a lot of fun,<br>but I really wanted to finish my blogging book.<br>And my blogging book was not going to get finished<br>while I was on that podcasting schedule.<br>So it&#8217;s been on hiatus.<br>It remains on hiatus.<br>One of my goals for this year was to bring<br>it back,<br>but I ended up doing the live show instead.<br>So again priorities, but you can do something for awhile<br>and then say you know this was great for me.<br>I want to put my attention towards this and in<br>podcast land we call it,<br>you know, the first season,<br>second season, coming whenever, but you may have to hit<br>the pause button on something in order to jump over<br>and work towards something else,<br>But that&#8217;s why you look at your life and see<br>what you can do and set goals you want.<br>Reach goals because you know you want that goal Topia.<br>But you also need some easy goals &#8217;cause you want<br>to have wins because those are so motivating.<br>Oh, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s great. Those those winds are huge.<br>Make sure you have things in there that you can<br>do.<br>Here&#8217;s here&#8217;s my follow up question for this one,<br>so I was earlier in the show I was telling<br>you about.<br>I had set some goals for the end of January.<br>How often do you recommend people reset goals?<br>And then as as a caveat to that.<br>How often do you? A relook at your goals to<br>reassess them.<br>Well, you need to look at your goals all the<br>time so it&#8217;s never going to be like wow,<br>really. I was gonna do that.<br>I&#8217;ve done nothing. You never want to say right?<br>But what is great about the beginning of the year?<br>Because everybody is on this.<br>Let&#8217;s get this fresh start let&#8217;s get going.<br>Let&#8217;s figure out what we want to create for ourselves<br>in the new year.<br>So beginning of the year beginning of the school year,<br>beginning of the summer, so seasonally is a really good<br>time to look at it.<br>But again, if you encounter change,<br>let&#8217;s say your your job is changing in or it<br>goes away,<br>or you just have had it and it&#8217;s time for<br>a career change,<br>well then that&#8217;s when you do the introspective thing.<br>Figure out OK. Do you want a new job?<br>Do I need a new career?<br>What do I need to do to make that happen?<br>Exploration, brainstorm, turn it into reality.<br>So when when something comes at you that you have<br>no control over.<br>If you get to the point where this job was<br>great for awhile,<br>but I really want to start my own business,<br>then you you know. You know,<br>you know, you know when.<br>If you&#8217;re in touch with what you want from life.<br>Your gut is going to tell you when you need<br>to do some of that reassessment,<br>so cycles when you need it look at them frequently.<br>Review them every season, and or when you need a<br>reboot.<br>Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely times in life that don&#8217;t come at<br>the end of a.<br>Things in a weather season or something?<br>I I mean coronavirus was definitely one of those that<br>it happened and a lot of people had to reassess<br>what they were doing and how they wanted to move<br>forward. Well, exactly in my book came out last January<br>an the reason of the primary reason that I wanted<br>to write it is because I believe everybody deserves to<br>be happy in some, if not all of their lives.<br>And if you are not getting fulfillment from your job,<br>maybe you need to take a look.<br>At what you can bring into your life that fulfills<br>you or changing that situation and then two months later<br>everybody had was put in a position to reassess.<br>So I I love that the timing of my book<br>was even more relevant than I imagined when it came<br>out.<br>Yeah, yeah, so your book came out or really 2020<br>January right January yes it&#8217;s I.<br>I&#8217;m having a book birthday on January 14th.<br>Happy Happy Book birthday in a couple of weeks.<br>Anyhow there there is Deb&#8217;s book she was just holding<br>it up.<br>We can. We can totally promote your book.<br>I put links to it in the comments on LinkedIn<br>an if you&#8217;re watching on Amazon,<br>it&#8217;ll appear in the carousel.<br>I believe they call it right underneath us,<br>or if you&#8217;re watching it in review,<br>I believe it&#8217;s over on the side.<br>But the other thing can I mention is that there<br>is a Facebook group for your goal guide,<br>so people who are going through the book.<br>You can ask questions or share their journey or get<br>like little bonus motivation.<br>So if you do go out and grab my book,<br>which your goalguidebook.com will also take you to the Amazon<br>Link,<br>please join the group. Introduce yourself say this is where<br>we met.<br>That&#8217;s a fantastic idea. You can do that.<br>I I do have some more questions.<br>The worst thing to keep going &#8217;cause I&#8217;m having a<br>good time here and let me.<br>I want to show this audience question if you if<br>you have any questions for Deb be sure to throw<br>them out there.<br>Some people are telling you Congrats on your you your<br>your book birthday.<br>So people like that, like I,<br>I&#8217;ve never had a book birthday &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve never written<br>a book so well.<br>What&#8217;s stopping you? You know,<br>I see that as your 2020 two goal.<br>I&#8217;ve had some opportunities to write books in the past<br>and<br>I&#8217;ve always said no because I don&#8217;t.<br>I don&#8217;t know that writing a book.<br>Gets me super excited. And so then you shouldn&#8217;t write<br>a book.<br>Yeah, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s really you asked about mistakes people make<br>with setting goals.<br>You should always love what you were working on,<br>because if you&#8217;re not excited about it,<br>it&#8217;s gonna shine through. Yeah,<br>and so maybe I just haven&#8217;t found the topic that<br>I want to write the book about yet,<br>so. Yeah alright so I have.<br>I I I looked into you and Ann went out<br>and read about you and.<br>I wanted to know more about this.<br>A little bit about what you do in your career,<br>but somehow your career went from you are doing.<br>I mean it was vague on your website.<br>It said I was helping with some events at Barnes<br>and Noble and then they asked me to set up<br>some other things and then while it&#8217;s like I don&#8217;t<br>know five years, three, I don&#8217;t know how many years<br>later you are a goal setting Coach,<br>which I don&#8217;t think was what you originally doing at<br>Barnes and Noble.<br>So can you walk us through that a little bit?<br>I would love to because believe it or not,<br>Barnes and Noble did set me on this path.<br>I was the now they called it a community relations<br>coordinator back when I worked at Barnes and Noble in<br>the 90s.<br>If you want to do math,<br>you can. Feel free, but I&#8217;m not giving you anymore<br>than that.<br>It&#8217;s alright. So I was the event coordinator for Barnes<br>and Noble in Schaumburg,<br>IL, and I grew up in in Highland Park,<br>IL, and one day somebody walked in and said,<br>Hey Deb would you start a writer support group an<br>I said if you think people will come I&#8217;m more<br>than happy to try it out and they did an<br>it was a hit in for me.<br>I would support group meant OK,<br>what do you work in mental setting?<br>What are you working on?<br>What did you accomplish? What are you planning for next<br>time an whereas I was giving everybody homework.<br>I was also giving myself homework,<br>so I graduated from UW Madison degree in journalism,<br>working at a bookstore so you know adjacent to that<br>light that writer life an,<br>but I hadn&#8217;t been freelancing so I gave myself a<br>goal for every meeting I was going to write a<br>spec column,<br>slice of life and. A few months into it I.<br>Was Adam Expo and I was chatting with people from<br>a magazine and I&#8217;m like are you looking for freelancers?<br>Do you have clips and I&#8217;m like,<br>well, I do have articles and so setting that goal<br>prepared me for when an opportunity arose.<br>So I will go back to answering your questions.<br>So this is what started.<br>I moved to LA in the late 90s 2002.<br>I restarted my goal group at Barnes and Noble in<br>Santa Monica,<br>CA. And over the years my group has evolved and<br>grew to embrace creatives and entrepreneurs.<br>Not just writers. But somewhere along the line,<br>people said, hey Deb, you&#8217;re good at this.<br>Can you help me? An OK or a dub?<br>Would you talk about goal setting at this conference?<br>OK, so my business background was communications and project management,<br>so take that with the goal setting and I basically<br>got set on this path to do something that I<br>love and I always thought you want to talk about<br>Motto from a young age.<br>I always said that whatever I did in my life,<br>I wanted to just go full throttle.<br>You know, be able to share my expertise and help<br>others.<br>So I guess that worked out,<br>huh? I it did that.<br>There&#8217;s so many things I&#8217;m trying to keep all these<br>notes in my mind that I wanted to talk about.<br>So Jed, this is in response to me writing a<br>book.<br>He said he&#8217;s tried to talk me into writing a<br>book a number of times,<br>but, well, I I do Coach,<br>can I help people put their ideas together so to<br>file in in your mind and I I feel like<br>I should.<br>Well, I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;m gonna say it anyway though.<br>A lot of the clients I work with,<br>some of them are. I don&#8217;t know what to do<br>next.<br>I need a plan. An we meet an hour an<br>I set them on their course and they&#8217;re good or<br>they&#8217;ll take one of my workshops or sometimes all clients<br>who say I always wanted to do this and I<br>can&#8217;t organize it and we Deb method then give them<br>a plan and I work like a fitness trainer to<br>help them achieve those goals.<br>Yeah, and one other thing that you were saying back<br>in there is I loved your story about.<br>Someone asked you to do something at Barnes and Noble<br>and you said.<br>OK, it&#8217;s not gonna fill up.<br>I&#8217;ll do it, but the second part of it,<br>which I thought was great was you&#8217;d set a goal<br>for yourself to start writing those weekly.<br>I don&#8217;t remember you call them articles or whatever you<br>started writing every week an collecting these and months later,<br>a magazine opportunity showed up and they wanted to know<br>if you had any material and you said why?<br>Yes, I do, and that&#8217;s one of the big things<br>that I especially we&#8217;re talking about tech inside projects and.<br>Kind of things like that.<br>Going out and starting something is really important,<br>especially if you start something that you&#8217;re excited about and<br>that you like about and that you like to do.<br>Eventually, something will come along or someone will want help<br>with that thing that you know how to do,<br>and you will be able to say,<br>hey, I&#8217;ve already written 50 articles,<br>or I&#8217;ve already put up 100 blog posts about this.<br>I&#8217;ve already done 10 live streams and you&#8217;re already there,<br>and so kudos to you for.<br>Get that started and going and I love that story.<br>If you have that story,<br>do you want another one real quick?<br>Love you. Let&#8217;s keep going.<br>You&#8217;re gonna love this one.<br>So I told you a spring of 2018 I rebranded<br>as the dev method because one of my main communication<br>clients was going away an I took it as the<br>opportunity to step fully into this mission myself.<br>Created the DAB method a few months later.<br>An agent who I had met years like six or<br>seven years.<br>Before I re met because somebody in my life,<br>group management and event referred him to my group,<br>we started talking. He said where&#8217;s your book proposal and<br>said why was planning to self publish.<br>He said let me let me see what I can<br>do and when by aligning myself with this mission by<br>stepping full into dub these opportunities.<br>When you know what you want,<br>when you are open to this life,<br>fulfilling your mission opportunities come you in a way.<br>Like never before, so that happened more than once.<br>Yes it does and I can say from being a<br>Blogger and being out there on the social media.<br>Internet opportunities do come your way.<br>It&#8217;s important though to have your what do you really<br>want to let you know when to say yes and<br>when to say no.<br>I got it. I got a couple of other questions<br>we&#8217;re going to skip some that I was maybe going<br>to ask for what you just said.<br>Because that&#8217;s really awesome Goldstar.<br>Thank you when I had my live meetings I had<br>stickers.<br>Now I&#8217;ve just have a sticky note that I just<br>pull out when I&#8217;m talking to people when they&#8217;re being<br>awesome.<br>Well, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s fun. Thank you for the Gold Star<br>I earned today.<br>Here&#8217;s one &#8217;cause I know you wrote a book on<br>blogging and it falls clearly into the area of content<br>creation is 2021 too late to start a blog?<br>No, it&#8217;s never too late.<br>One thing that 2020 showed us is that it&#8217;s really<br>not too late to recreate ourselves.<br>If you want to start a blog,<br>start a blog. You want to start podcast started podcasts.<br>Figure out the way in which you want to share<br>your voice.<br>And make a plan to get it out in the<br>world.<br>That&#8217;s great, I want to cut that clip out.<br>That last, that last quote that you said so so<br>go to that alright here here is my.<br>My selfish question &#8217;cause I have teenagers at my house<br>that sometimes ask interesting questions about this and so I<br>figured when I get the opportunity to talk to interesting<br>people like yourself, I was going to throw this question<br>in there and what career advice would you have for<br>the teenage version of yourself?<br>Well, this is something I did as a teenager,<br>but it&#8217;s advice that I love to give to teens.<br>So can I alter the question?<br>Sir, I did I did competitive public speaking all through<br>college and things are a little different right now,<br>so I don&#8217;t know when that what version of it<br>is in this current reality.<br>But any opportunities children or teenagers or young adults have<br>to speak are going to help them so much in<br>their career.<br>Because when you have strong written and oral communication skills.<br>You could basically do anything,<br>so my advice is your teenager.<br>Start a podcast. Start a video,<br>show him up with a buddy in write speeches and<br>give them to each other.<br>My first book, Purple Pencil Adventures writing prompts for Kids<br>of all ages.<br>I wrote because one of the moms of my life<br>group said my daughter loves to write.<br>Would you? Coach are an I said oh,<br>good opportunity for a blog,<br>and that blog became my first book.<br>But one of the instructions I have in it because<br>I say all ages usually like.<br>Middle School is the average,<br>but younger kids can use it to write shorter stories<br>to draw pictures for the from these writing prompts and<br>teenagers,<br>and even some of my adult writer friends use it<br>to get unstuck.<br>But one of the best ways to use that book<br>is you take the prompt.<br>Everybody in the family right story,<br>and then you read them aloud.<br>So you&#8217;re practicing both your written.<br>Andrew verbal communication. Out that there&#8217;s a fantastic answer.<br>My kids, my kids are are going to be upset<br>now.<br>&#8217;cause I&#8217;m going to make them watch that &#8217;cause you<br>told them.<br>Start a podcast, start a blog,<br>start a live show, and whatever you&#8217;re interested.<br>It starts something &#8217;cause I tell them that all the<br>time and I OK.<br>So now I&#8217;m telling them you&#8217;re welcome,<br>but it&#8217;s the thing that they&#8217;re interested in.<br>If they&#8217;re going. If there are more likely to do<br>audio only,<br>then that&#8217;s what they should be doing.<br>Or if they want to be on video.<br>When I did my podcast,<br>I did both because I figured if I&#8217;m doing audio<br>I might as well do video anyway an but it&#8217;s<br>it&#8217;s your comfort level.<br>What is going to set you up for success?<br>And they don&#8217;t even have.<br>I know you&#8217;re going to make them put it out<br>in the world,<br>but if you&#8217;re uncomfortable, just practice.<br>You never have. You can go live just to yourself<br>for practice in that works too.<br>Yeah, we we always tell people we have a LinkedIn<br>live group of live streamers and we always tell people<br>if you want to practice live streaming.<br>You can set up like private events or private Facebook<br>groups and private.<br>You can go live on YouTube to some channel that<br>has no followers and.<br>You can go live and no one is going to<br>watch,<br>and even if you have a show that&#8217;s public,<br>is sometimes not that many people show up to watch<br>anyway,<br>so.<br>I just got a couple of questions left,<br>but Judd says learn to speak clearly and concisely and<br>that is a big one.<br>Speaking and writing are two huge skills.<br>It doesn&#8217;t matter what careerfield you are in.<br>Oh alright, so as we&#8217;re as we&#8217;re finishing up the<br>show here and.<br>Find the comment that I put out there with the<br>link to Deb&#8217;s book and go get yourself Debs book<br>or click on the carousel below.<br>If you&#8217;re on Amazon live,<br>but as we finish out water a few quick tips<br>that you have.<br>To set better goals.<br>Well, if you haven&#8217;t figured out what you want,<br>do that, and if you&#8217;re not sure what that is,<br>what is? What is your medium?<br>Do meditation, do journaling. I I have this this process<br>I call directed journaling,<br>which is when you&#8217;re in the exploration phase.<br>OK, I want to create this.<br>What does that look like?<br>I suggest using that, but you can also use it<br>to figure out what you want,<br>and it&#8217;s very simple. Set 3 four 515 minute appointments<br>with yourself,<br>of course. Keep them and during that time you&#8217;re just<br>brain storming the answer to a question.<br>So whether it&#8217;s what do I want?<br>How do I make it happen?<br>Or this is my mission?<br>What do I need to do?<br>But what&#8217;s going to happen is you&#8217;re just brainstorming free<br>writing and the trick is to do this a few<br>times but not look at what you wrote before until<br>after you&#8217;ve done it. Then go back and read through<br>and circle highlight.<br>Find those common themes because you know the answers.<br>You just need to give yourself the time and the<br>opportunity.<br>Jew let it come out of you an embrace it<br>and move forward.<br>So it&#8217;s not a quick tip but it&#8217;s this quick,<br>adjacent, right? So use journaling or meditation or whatever to<br>figure out what that goal Topia is.<br>And then the other tip that I love is.<br>I love setting a timer to Heimer is great because<br>if you don&#8217;t want to do something you said OK,<br>I&#8217;ll do 15 minutes and see if it gets me<br>going.<br>So set the timer on your eye.<br>I just did like a egg timer,<br>but everybody has one on their cell phone and then<br>June whatever and then when it goes off.<br>If you are on a roll,<br>keep going. If you&#8217;re not,<br>you did your time, you&#8217;re good till your next session.<br>So use little tricks like that to keep you moving<br>forward in your projects or working on your book or<br>those things that you know you need or want to<br>do but don&#8217;t have time for.<br>Do in really small. Increments,<br>so did this answer. Yes,<br>it answered the question to set better goals,<br>you need to know what you want to figure out<br>what you want.<br>You could do this.<br>Look at your life, look at your schedule and do<br>things a little bit at a time.<br>Because it will add up as well.<br>Great, great final tip there a little bit at a<br>time.<br>Little things make a big difference going forward and my<br>my last question for you is I&#8217;m throwing up your<br>website here people.<br>That&#8217;s where you can go to find out more about<br>that,<br>but what else would you like to tell?<br>Where do you want people to go find out more<br>about you and why would they reach out to you?<br>Well, the devmethod.com is great also please find me on<br>LinkedIn and jot a note that says that we met<br>here.<br>I love making new friends in one of my big<br>feelings is you you don&#8217;t reach your goals on your<br>own.<br>You need your tribe. You need your community.<br>So always look for those opportunities to grow your network.<br>I&#8217;m also at the dev method everywhere.<br>LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and also write an on line which<br>was my original.<br>Writers support Group now for writers,<br>creatives and entrepreneurs. I have a Facebook page and a<br>group that you all are welcome to join as well.<br>Learn more about my book.<br>Click on the links that Ryan gave you an join.<br>the Facebook Group an IF you need coaching.<br>Need someone on one or if you have an organization<br>that you would like me to come speak to.<br>Reach out for that as well.<br>Well that is fantastic.
