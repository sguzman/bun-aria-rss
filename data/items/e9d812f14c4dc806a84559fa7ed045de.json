  "description": "October 22nd, 1999. Bald Head Island, North Carolina. A police officer radios dispatch to report that she has stopped three people. Soon after she is heard telling one of them that there is no reason to have a gun on the island. A loud squelch noise will be heard followed by radio silence. By the time another officer arrived on scene it was too late. Officer Jones was dead. Her death was ruled as a suicide. A single shot to the back of her head with her own service weapon had ended her life. Rumors of a coverup seem to explain why what appears to be a murder would be interpreted as a suicide by officials. But was it a murder? Could officer Jones have staged her death so that her family would receive money? Or could there be another explanation? We break this case down using the known facts and even include a piece of evidence that you may never have heard about until now.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
