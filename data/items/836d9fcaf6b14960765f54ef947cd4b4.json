Section 10 producer Steven Perrault joins the show to admit that he was wrong to talk shit about Minihane behind his back. Ring, kissed. We can all move on.

Minihane prepares to see his childhood hero Howard Stern debase himself with Ellen Degeneres.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
