  "description": "Protests, racial divisions, political polarization, and a law-and-order president – it's easy to draw comparisons between 2020 and 1968.  But, Adam Serwer, who covers politics at <em>The Atlantic, </em>says that a much better point of comparison actually starts a century earlier – 1868. This week, we share an episode we loved from<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/872281949/trump-v-nixon-on-race-why-2020-isnt-quite-1968\"> It's Been A Minute with Sam Sanders</a> that explores a moment when white Republicans fought for years for the rights of Black Americans, before abandoning them to pursue white voters.",
