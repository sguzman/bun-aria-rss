We aint talkin about Jill Biden either, folks. \n\nRound 2: Last week we talked about gate guards and all the terrible things they have to do on a daily basis. I think they took it too far because some Air Force MPs destroyed a car by deploying the emergency barriers which seems like a really fun time. \n\nRound 3: It’s strange when we hear senior leaders making sense especially when that sense involves making junior folks train less. \n\nRound 4: Australia is putting the United States to shame as far as vaccines go.
