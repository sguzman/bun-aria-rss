  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats should be paying for this one-sided January 6 propaganda and journalists should question whether or how they even cover something as propagandistic as this so-called hearing. They've created a fall guy in John Eastman a law professor that advocated for Trump. The Committee has cherry-picked testimony, depositions, and even interpretations of the law. They've failed to mention how Democrats have contested the counting of electoral votes in every Republican victory for the past two decades claiming the election was stolen as far back as 2001 when 31 congressional Democrats voted to challenge Ohio's electoral votes. The most recent example of their omissions is when Hillary Clinton objected to the 2016 election blaming voting machines and Russian interference. Let's not forget the riots and bombs found when Trump was inaugurated in 2017. They criticize Trump for waiting an hour to put out a video condemning the January 6 violence yet, to date Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, and the Democrats have still not put out any videos condemning the violence against Trump. Then, the January 6th Committee is using fissures in the relationship between Trump and Pence to exploit one against the other and former Attorney General Barr is dancing right into their trap. Pence's aide Marc Short is being used and this will have political blowback if Pence ever decided to run for President. All of this un-vetted, unchallenged, one-sided manipulation from the committee and the media happily reports on it as if it were fact. Later, Congressman Lee Zeldin calls in to share how challenging life in New York is because of the Democrat's single-party control and policies. Zeldin added that violence is also on the rise and combines with rising costs of living makes New York less and less livable and he intends to change that. Afterward, Democrats push against school choice and charter schools. Pelosi attended private school and sent her son to a private school, yet she also opposes private school choice and scholarships for low-income children. \n \n \n \nTAGS: june 16, january 6, jan 6, john eastman, eastman, j michael luttig, luttig, lee zeldin, zeldin, pennsylvania, mike pence, pence, state legislatures, janes revenge, donald trump, trump, Economy, inflation, stock market, stocks, farm, food, farmer, new york, ny, school, school choice, private school, public school, liz cheney, cheney, I pencil, pencil\nLearn more about your ad choices.
