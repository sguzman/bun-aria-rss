  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Jerry Jones's assertion that his Dallas Cowboys are worth $10 billion. Jones bought the team in 1989 for a then-record $150 million. Jones also said he'd never sell the NFL club. Also discussed is Major League Baseball's $5 billion extension with  Fox, netting owners a 36 percent average annual increase over the existing deal. The agreement keeps marquee properties like the World Series and All-Star Game with Fox after its parent completes the $71 billion sale of assets to Walt Disney Co. Also discussed is MLB's three-year digital rights deal with John Skipper-led DAZN. It will deliver a live show each weeknight via the company's digital sports streaming platform.  Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
