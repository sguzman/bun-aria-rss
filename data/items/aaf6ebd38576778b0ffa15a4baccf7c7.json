  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, There is no attack on the free press, the attack is on fake news. Many in the media are liars and propagandists. President Trump has not arrested any members of the media like Abraham Lincoln did, nor has he used the FBI against the media like Barack Obama did. The left repeatedly tries to stop the likes of FOX News and Conservative talk radio through legislation because they can’t beat them in ratings. Then, John Brennan claims that Trump is an authoritarian dictator for revoking his security clearance, despite Brennan, who is now a paid media analyst, having no constitutional right to know or have access to classified information. Brennan ran a spy agency that spied on members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Later, Robert Mueller poses a bigger threat to America’s constitutional system than Russian President Vladimir Putin because he’s being used, wittingly, to reverse the last election. Overturning a free and fair election from within the government is indeed a bigger threat to constitutional government than the external security threat from a Russian despot. Also, Mueller may be gearing up to subpoena the President, but we must ask by what authority does the Special Counsel operate and what exactly is he trying to glean from such an interview that may lead to a criminal prosecution. Three federal courts have upheld that Mueller is an inferior employee of the DOJ, therefore as an Assistant US Attorney he cannot subpoena the president or demand an interview. Finally, Aretha Franklin passed away at 76. There will never be another voice like hers, she will be missed.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
