  "description": "<p>In our ongoing series focusing on independent record labels, we have Kevin Bergeron from Waxwork Records on the show. Waxwork Records is an independent, soundtrack focused label that has put out some amazing titles like Friday the 13th, Creepshow and some more recent scores from Starry Eyes and Phase IV. Kevin comes from a punk/hardcore background so I had to have him on. We discussed DIY culture, living in New Orleans and of course, soundtracks. MONTHLY DONATIONONE TIME DONATION</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
