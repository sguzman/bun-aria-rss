Serch and the GYP (The Get Yourz Posse).  Take a ride with us to Long Beach, New York, and hear how this little beach town became the center of Serch’s life.\n\nDOOM and Subroc’s crib was where the formation of all their biggest ideas and master plans were conceptualized. Along with Ahmed’s basement, directly across the street, this little area was where the GYP and KMD was birthed. Hip hop, along with the help of Islam, helped these young minds develop a strong sense of self and a viewpoint that played a crucial part in their music and the development of their individual personalities.\n\nThis episode also looks into the evolution of KMD and Onyx -The Birthstone Kid (Last living member of KMD) Onyx shares his memories of bonding with his brothers for the first time, and tells the story of how a vicious dog played a key role in all of their paths crossing. We also hear the tale of how a trip in a car to the local mall bore a well-known saying in pop culture, still used to this day.\n\n\n\nNew episodes of \"Did I Ever Tell You The One About... MF DOOM\" drop every Monday! Available wherever you get your podcasts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
