  "description": "We’ve all been sheltering in place for some time now, which has given us ample time to think about who our ideal quarantine buddies would be. Who would our Thirst Buckets like to be holed up with in a cabin made for two? The Thirst Object field was diverse: constant TB-favourite Tessa Thompson came up, as did Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, Westworld’s Rodrigo Santoro, and even Jidenna’s sweet musical stylings (among other things)... No drabbles this week but Nichole and Bim also revealed their own choices for optimal quarantine activities. A fun time is had by all!\nIn this week’s Slate Plus, we draw your attention to men’s forearms aka the modern equivalent of a delicate Victorian ankle — is there a body part more laden with meaning? A revealed forearm, tanned, hairy, lightly-veined and solid… it does things to a person, you know?\nSlate Plus members get a bonus segment on Thirst Aid Kit each week. Sign up now to listen and support our show.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
