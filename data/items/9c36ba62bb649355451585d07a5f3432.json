  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden calls for gas station owners to charge less, while he's releasing millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and sending some of it overseas. Experts warn that some states are under increased threat of losing power as their electric grids have been weakened by switching to renewable energy and taking coal, nuclear, and traditional sources of energy typically used to produce electricity. Then, despite Illinois' strict red flag laws, strict gun control, and police encounters the Highland Park shooter was still able to kill. Conversely, in Richmond, VA a citizen overheard a similar threat of violence on July 4th and reported it. Police responded and arrested illegal immigrants with firearms and averted any further incidents. Later, the attack on Justice Clarence Thomas continues with critics now saying he's turned his back on Black thinkers like Malcolm X. Thomas has indicated that most of these critiques are false and that he is comfortable around other Blacks but usually isn't welcomed around White liberals. Afterward, the New York Times puts its bigotry on display and attacks Congresswoman Mayra Flores. The Gray Lady besmirched her and other Latina Republicans as right-wing. Finally, Biden's border policies continue to brutalize women who are being raped and extorted as they attempt to cross with children and the Administration does nothing to stop the humanitarian crisis that they exacerbated. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
