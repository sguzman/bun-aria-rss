  "description": "<p>Inflammation is a critical part of our evolution, survival, and our overall health. Without it, we could never heal a cut or fight off a fever. But in our culture, our body’s inflammation responses are in overdrive, which over time can damage our cells and organs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Chronic long-term inflammation is linked to a myriad of health issues including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune diseases. That’s why it’s so important that we have a baseline understanding of inflammation, what it does, and how to manage it. On this masterclass episode of The Model Health Show, we’re breaking down what inflammation is, how it works, and clinically proven strategies you can use to cool down the fire of chronic inflammation.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>We’re diving into the five biggest contributors to neuroinflammation, plus clinically proven strategies you can implement to protect your brain from inflammation.
