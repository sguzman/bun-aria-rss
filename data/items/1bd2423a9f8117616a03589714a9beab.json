Budda Baker will now become the highest-paid safety in the NFL (33:45). What does the deal mean for the Cardinals and the DB market? The newsworthy offseason continues for Washington (39:00) as Ron Rivera is battling cancer, the team hired its first Black president and Alex Smith is back competing. Brinson and Wilson break it all down. Finally, they cover the relevant injuries and contract disputes that we've seen in recent weeks (50:45).\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilson\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
