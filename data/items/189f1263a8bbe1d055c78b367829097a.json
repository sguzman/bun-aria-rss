  "title": "Kirk Minihane Roasts His Old Station's New Show",
  "description": "<p><p>WEEI has added a new chapter to their remarkable story of self-destruction, and Kirk Minihane is enjoying it like a true professional. Minihane and Blind Mike pan the debut of The Greg Hill Show and explore the new developments in liberal activists' war on entertaining radio. A nemesis from the Boston Globe has returned with a pathetic -- and entirely predictable -- take on craft beer. Minihane reviews the new Tarantino flick. Minihane's long-forgotten producer (no, the other one) returns to America. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
