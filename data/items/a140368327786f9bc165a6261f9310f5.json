  "description": "<p>This week, in Beckley, West Virginia, we look at 2 stories, because they were too crazy to pick just one! First, a man with a \"history of meanness\" takes vengeance & violence to a whole new level, with acts that so brazen, it's like he wants to spend the rest of his life in prison. For the second story, we talk about a murder so horrendous, that's it's hard to believe that it's real. Twelve people are killed, in the most terrible way imaginable, so one teenaged young lady can continue her love affair with her adult cousin. The thing is, she might just get away with it. Find out what happens! It's absolutely mind boggling!!</p><p><br></p><p>Along the way, we find out that West Virginia is for murder lovers, that you can even be murdered for doing exactly what the murderer tells you, and that cousin love must be HOT, because some people will fight for it, over everything!!</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo and Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p><br></p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com and use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on...</p><p><br></p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p><br></p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
