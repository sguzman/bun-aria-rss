  "description": "Perth, the capital of Western Australia, during the 1950’s was described as being more like a big country town rather than a city. Neighbours knew each other, cars were left parked in the driveway and streets with the keys still in the ignition. Front doors were left unlocked, house windows were left wide open day and night.\nIn January of 1959 in the peak of summer. Residents within the city and outlying suburbs slept with doors and windows open in attempt to cool their dwellings during the above average temperatures the city was experiencing at the time. It wasn’t unusual to find residents sleeping outdoors on balconies, porches and even on the ground in the front yard.  People had a laid back approach to home security. Crime was low and it seemed that everyone trusted those around them. It wouldn’t be long before a string of violent and seemingly unrelated crimes would make them question this trust and turn a once quiet and peaceful city in to panicked frenzy.",
