  "description": "<p>Welcome to the second part of our discussion of Euripides’ <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yz6sSS\"><em>The Trojan Women</em></a> here on The Literary Life podcast. This week Angelina, Cindy and Thomas really get into the meat of the play. If you missed last week’s <a href=\"http://theliterary.life/052/\">introduction episode</a>, you will want to go back and listen to that first to set the stage, so to speak. Cindy and Angelina talk about how much emotion is evoked by Euripides’ portrayal of these women and their situation. Thomas brings in some of the surrounding myths that connect to the characters in this play, as well.</p> <p>Angelina and Cindy highlight the characteristics of Hecuba and Andromache amidst such trying circumstances. In discussing Helen’s role in the play, Cindy mentions a short story C. S. Lewis wrote about Helen of Troy called “After Ten Years.” It can be found in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dZ8l1V\"><em>The Dark Tower: and Other Storie</em>s</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30CZoXZ\"><em>Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories</em></a>. Our hosts share their emotional responses to the utter heartbreak of the mothers on top of the demise of Troy itself.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></span></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>There are decades where nothing happens, and weeks where decades happen.</p> <cite>Vladimir Lenin</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>While affording some secrets of ‘the way of the will’ to young people, we should perhaps beware of presenting the ideas of ‘self-knowledge, self-reverence, and self-control.’ All adequate education must be outward bound, and the mind which is concentrated upon self-emolument, even though it be the emolument of all the virtues, misses the higher and the simpler secrets of life.
