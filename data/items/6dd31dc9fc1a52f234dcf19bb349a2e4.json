  "title": "Julian Strube, \"Global Tantra: Religion, Science, and Nationalism in Colonial Modernity\" (Oxford UP, 2022)",
  "description": "Julian Strube's book Global Tantra (Oxford UP, 2022) explores the global exchanges that shaped a subject often associated with sexuality, social liberation, and bodily wellbeing but that also offers insights into political and religious developments in colonial India, involving race, education, and national identity. The study elides boundaries in disciplinary, historical, and regional contexts, tackles issues such as revivalism and reformism, and provides an integrative approach that suggests ideas to advance the debate about (post)colonialism and cultural appropriation.\nRaj Balkaran is a scholar, educator, consultant, and life coach.
