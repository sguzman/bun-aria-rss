    "media:description": "When harnessing the power of life, being able to see what's going on at the microscopic level comes in handy. Maxine Jonas and Steven Wasserman are teaching faculty in the Department of Biological Engineering and co-instructors of 20.309, Instrumentation and Measurements for Biological Systems. Thanks to their combined expertise and legendary teaching style, this lab-based, microscope-building class feels more like a family in a playground of endless creative adventures than a required course for the major. And new ways of teaching and learning due to the pandemic only served to strengthen this force of nature at work. \n\n\nMB0136GFNUODT0B",
