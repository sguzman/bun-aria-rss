  "description": "<p>Multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer Emily Wells joins John Schaefer live in the studio to talk through and perform songs from her brand-new album, <em>Promise</em>.  The music comes across as a startling mix of styles; there’s live loops and samples as in electronic music – all analog, no laptop, yet there are also classical strings, but everything is layered in a way that might be more akin to hip-hop production than anything else.</p>\n<p>Emily Wells grew up in the church, and has classical roots. Her music, she admits, draws from the ultimate musical architect: J.S. Bach. But she also cites as influences Tori Amos, Vivaldi, and Terry Riley.

There’s also music by Julianna Barwick and her many layers, as well as a song from Ben Folds and yMusic to round out the show. </p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3825, with Emily Wells (First Aired 2-2-2016)    </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Emily Wells<br>WORK: Take it Easy [6:53]<br>RECORDING: Promise<br>SOURCE: Thesis + Instinct Records<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://emilywellsmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilywellsmusic.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Emily Wells<br>WORK: Light is Drainin / Antidote [16:28]<br>RECORDING: Live, WNYC, Feb. 2016<br>SOURCE: This performance not commercially available. <br>INFO: These songs appear on “Promise.” <a href=\"http://emilywellsmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilywellsmusic.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Goran Kajfes Subtropic Arkestra<br>WORK: Okwukwe Na Nchekwube, excerpt [:45]<br>RECORDING: The Reason Why, Vol. 16.<br>SOURCE: Headspin Recordings<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://headspinrecordings.com/releases/releasedetails.php?ID=42\" target=\"_blank\">headspinrecordings.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Emily Wells<br>WORK: Don’t Use Me Up [4:27]<br>RECORDING: Live, WNYC, Feb. 2016<br>SOURCE: This performance not commercially available. <br>INFO: These songs appear on “Promise.” <a href=\"http://emilywellsmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilywellsmusic.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Goran Kajfes Subtropic Arkestra<br>WORK: Okwukwe Na Nchekwube, excerpt [:30]<br>RECORDING: The Reason Why, Vol. 16.<br>SOURCE: Headspin Recordings<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://headspinrecordings.com/releases/releasedetails.php?ID=42\" target=\"_blank\">headspinrecordings.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Ben Folds &amp; yMusic<br>WORK: Capable of Anything [3:46]<br>RECORDING: So There<br>SOURCE: New West Records<br>INFO: <a href=\"https://www.benfolds.com/music-store\" target=\"_blank\">benfolds.com/music-store</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Julianna Barwick<br>WORK: Forever, excerpt [4:12]<br>RECORDING: Nepenthe<br>SOURCE: Dead Oceans DOC 069<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.scdistribution.com/music-shop.html?class=artist&amp;artist=julianna%20barwick\" target=\"_blank\">scdistribution.com</a></p>",
