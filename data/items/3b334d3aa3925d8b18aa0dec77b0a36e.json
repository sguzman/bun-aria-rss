If you haven't listened to part one, please go back and do so. Enjoy!\n\nVincent Van Gogh's suicide is a huge part of the mythology surrounding him: as much as the famous tale of the cut-off ear is. This so-called \"tortured genius,\" it is said, was so broken down by life and failure that he had no choice but to end his life. Right? But in 2011, two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors published a book titled Van Gogh: The Life that stunned the art world. Therein, Gregory White Smith and Stephen Naifeh state that the artist didn't actually commit suicide.\nNo, they say: he was actually murdered.\n \nPlease  SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts!\n\nTwitter / Facebook/ Instagram\n\n \nSPONSORS:\n\nThe Great Courses Plus\n\nShout-out to Art and Object\n\nZola - get $50 off your registry and your free wedding website\nPerfect Keto - use promo code \"art\" at checkout for 30% off sitewide\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
