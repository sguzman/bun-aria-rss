An entitled parent has her hands full, so she puts her purse on OP's lap without getting permission. When OP calls the Karen out on her behavior, the Karen replies, \"Aren't you glad that you can finally feel useful?\" Wow, imagine being so entitled that you literally treat a disabled child like a coffee table.</p>\n",
