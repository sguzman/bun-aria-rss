  "itunes:summary": "Joe Biden&#8217;s difficulty in articulating a clear policy on court reform &#8212; e.g., packing the court &#8212; has brought the former vice president some criticism.  It has also brought comparisons to 1937, when FDR tried to pack the court &#8212; and failed.  Historian Jeff Shesol, author of a book exploring Roosevelt&#8217;s gambit, finds similarities between the two Democrats.<br />\nAnd S.V. Date, the HuffPost correspondent who asked President Trump at a news briefing why he lies so much, talks about the roadblocks for White House reporters to get information, and the truth, from the president.<br />\nPlus, some highlights, as they were, from the final Trump-Biden debate.<br />\nPhoto credit Associated Press.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMusic used in this podcast:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgf_btTFlc\">Here Comes Your Man by The Pixies</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEoGDxgcg18\">Dear Supreme Court by C-Murder</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4FsMlzPwT8\">Lies by The Knickerbockers</a><br />",
