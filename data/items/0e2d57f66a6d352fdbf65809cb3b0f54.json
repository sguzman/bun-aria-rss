  "itunes:summary": "I have good news and bad news. Bad news first: It’s true most people are not creative. At least Aristotle wouldn’t think so. Most folks agree that the phrase “we are what we repeatedly do” is a good summary of his mindset. And so, if that’s true. The crucial mark of the artist or creator is just one thing: do you do it repeatedly? Essentially, is being creative a habit? And so, since most people do not have a creative habit, Aristotle would then conclude, most people are NOT creatives! \n\nAnd that brings us to the good news: if you are what you repeatedly do, you GET TO DECIDE whether you're a creative. Being creative isn't a thing you have or you don't, it's a practice.\n\nTad Carpenter is one of the most prolific creative people I’ve ever met. Yes. He has a clear abundance of talent, but the reason I wanted him on the show today was because I think he has some basic principles that can help you be a true creative. As we dive into his multi-year creative project, this episode will help you find ways of practicing creativity on a regular basis that is custom tailored and works for you!\n\nEpisode Artwork is a collaborative piece by Tad Carpenter and Andy J.
