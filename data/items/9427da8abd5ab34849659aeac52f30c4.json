  "description": "Walton Goggins has played tough guys, weird guys and guys who completely defy description, but to him it’s all just playing pretend. Walton found himself as the center of attention at a young age while he was being raised by a group of women - his mother, his aunts and his grandmother. He caught the performance bug wile living in Georgia and a random American Express mail promotion became his ticket to Los Angeles. Walton tells Marc what it was like to learn on the job from Robert Duvall and Anthony Hopkins, why he panicked after watching Vice Principals for the first time, and how he first met Quentin Tarantino. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/lights-out-with-david-spade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lights Out with David Spade on Comedy Central</a>, <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
