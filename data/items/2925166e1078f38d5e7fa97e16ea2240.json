  "description": "Donald P. Haider-Markel and Jami K. Taylor are the editors of Transgender Rights and Politics: Groups, Issue Framing and Policy Adoption (University of Michigan UP, 2014). Haider-Markel is professor of political science and chair at the University of Kansas, Taylor is associate professor of political science and public administration at the University of Toledo.\nLast week, Frank Baumgartner came on the podcast to talk about his newest book on policy process theory at the national level of US government. Haider-Markel and Taylor’s new edited volume draws on similar literature, but applies it to state and local politics. They also have collected up an array of excellent research on an understudied issue: transgender politics. Chapters by Anthony Nownes on transgender interest groups and Mitchell Sellers and Rod Colvin on how local governments have adopted transgender policies are particularly noteworthy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
