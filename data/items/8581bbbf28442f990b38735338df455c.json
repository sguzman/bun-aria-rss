  "description": "Betsy Faria was known to her friends and family as such a beautiful soul. She had life-long friends who just loved to be around her because she always loved to have a good time and make those around her feel happy and loved. In addition to all those amazing friends, Betsy had a husband and two beautiful daughters who loved her endlessly. When she was diagnosed with Cancer all of those friends and family banded around her to make sure she had all the support she needed. One of those friends, Pam Hupp, took a special interest in taking care of Betsy. In fact, she was the last person to see Betsy alive. Not because Betsy had passed from Cancer, but because two days after Christmas on December 27, 2011, Betsy Faria was found stabbed to death in her own home.<br>\n<br>\nArticle that Ash mentioned and used during the research process: <a href=\"https://www.stlmag.com/longform/pam-hupp/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.stlmag.com/longform/pam-hupp/</a> written by  Jeannette Cooperman<br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nThirdlove: Right now, you can get 20% off your first order at <a href=\"http://THIRDLOVE.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">THIRDLOVE.com/MORBID</a><br>\n<br>\nScribd: Go to <a href=\"http://try.scribd.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">try.scribd.com/MORBID</a> for your free trial! <br>\n<br>\nShopify: Go to <a href=\"http://shopify.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">shopify.com/morbid</a> ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of features\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
