    "media:description": "Here is the latest installment in the 2021 Masamap series chronicling the distinct ethno-racial-religious-linguistic groups of the world, this time focused on the European continent. With over 700 million people, Europe is certainly a hardy task to pinpoint the different ethnic and cultural identities that transcend borders and modern nations, but I feel I have created a good representation of not only the historic ethnic groups of the continent, but also some of the more contentious nuances surrounding the linguistic and religious makeup of some of these groups.\n\nPart 3 will be out shortly, followed by an eventual release of the full map, but keep in mind, some of the areas may change, as I reserve the right to revise and edit my work. Thank you all so much for the encouragement and patience you've shown over the years and thanks for watching!",
