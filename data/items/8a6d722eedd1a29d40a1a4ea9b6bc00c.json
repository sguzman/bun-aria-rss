She is telling us about the episode \"When Was the Last Time You Checked Your Hormones?\" with Dr. Tara Scott, and her experience with it. On Thursdays, I will be doing a bonus episode where my friends and I will discuss about some of our own personal discoveries and opinions on beauty, health and wellness. <p>And I also want to hear from you. Share some of your aha moments on beauty, health and wellness, and have a discussion. If you're on Apple podcasts, write your aha moment in the comment section. Or you can email me at <a href= \"mailto:beautyuncovered@olaplex.com\">beautyuncovered@olaplex.com</a>. And maybe you could be chosen to come on our Thursday discussion panel.</p>",
