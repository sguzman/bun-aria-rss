People shouldn’t worry about which vaccine they get, what matters is they get one. All of the Covid-19 vaccines available in the US right now are more effective than the flu shot. Vox senior correspondent Dylan Scott lays out what’s going on with the Covid-19 vaccines and answers questions about efficacy rates, vaccine hesitancy, and whether there’s finally some room for optimism about the end of the US outbreak. \n\nReferences: \n\nRead Dylan’s Covid-19 vaccine breakdown here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
