  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, energy independence was once inconceivable, now it’s a reality in the United States. ISIS once brutalized parts of the middle east but President Trump defeated ISIS early on his administration. The previous administration gave Iran cash when they were looking to gain nuclear capability, but Trump reversed it. Trump stood up to Syria when they gassed their citizens and he ended diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority because they refused to acknowledge our strongest ally in the middle east. It took an outsider to achieve this, yet the Democrats just want to attack Trump. Then, Democrats are creating unique complications with respect to the upcoming election. The Constitution (Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2) leaves it to the state legislatures to choose the electors. A Pelosi presidency is unlikely but a possibility if the 270 electoral vote threshold isn't met and the voting moves from state legislatures to the House of Representatives. Later, Joe Biden has still not condemned Cuomo, Murphy, and other Democrats that made the delayed decision to comingle COVID-19 patients with the elderly in the nursing homes. We've seen Biden's record on a pandemic response and his delivery time for a vaccine doesn't begin to compare to Trump and there likely would have been tens of thousands of more deaths as a result.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
