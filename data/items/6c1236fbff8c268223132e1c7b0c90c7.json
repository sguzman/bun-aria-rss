  "title": "Double Date with Megan Rapinoe & Sue Bird!",
  "description": "For their first (of hopefully many) podcast double dates, Abby and Glennon sit down with the icons, activists, and Olympians Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird. In this honest and hilarious conversation, we find out:\n\n1. The delightfully awkward moment Megan and Sue first met;\n2. What’s hard for each of them right now;\n3. The boundaries they’re working on together;\n4. How they communicate and deal with jealousy; and \n5. How they help each other show up in the world as champions for change.  \n\nAbout Sue: \nRegarded as the world’s premier point guard, Sue Bird is the WNBA’s All-Time Leader in Assists and known for being selfless, driven, encouraging, funny and smart. Bird is a seasoned veteran and a born leader who has dominated at every level. She is one of only seven women to win an Olympic Gold Medal (she’s won five), a World Championship Gold Medal (she’s won four) an NCAA Championship (she’s won two), and a WNBA Championship (she’s won four – the last just weeks before her 40th birthday). Sue is also a five-time Euroleague Champion, a twelve- time WNBA All-Star, was voted by the fans as one of the WNBA’s Top 15 Players of All Time. Off the court, Sue spends time as a basketball analyst for ESPN and as an outspoken and visible activist advocating for Black Lives, equality, health and wellness and expanding opportunities for girls and all marginalized people.\n \nTW: @S10Bird\nIG: @suebird10\n\nAbout Megan: \nTwo-time World Cup Champion and Olympic Gold Medalist, Megan Rapinoe is a fan favorite and one of the team’s most technical and craftiest players. A vocal leader on and off the pitch, Megan helped lead the USWNT to the 2019 Women’s World Cup Championship scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. Megan took home the tournament’s two top honors – the Golden Boot for top scorer, and the Golden Ball for the best player in the tournament. Megan is an advocate for equality for all and has been able to intersect her passion for humanity and authenticity. \n \nTW: @mPinoe\nIG: @mrapinoe\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
