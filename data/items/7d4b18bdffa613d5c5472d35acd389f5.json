  "itunes:summary": "Artist and organiser Bridget Chappell talks through the experiments, research, and activities that have formed their exhibition No Comment. With particular attention paid toward their investigations into the science of phase-cancellation as bringing forward an acoustic insurrection through “phase-canceling the cops”, Chappell presents anti-police sound technologies through material research together with theoretical articulations of ungovernable space, tactical defence and silence as a means of political enunciation.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/bridget-chappell-no-comment\n\n17 March - 3 April 2021\nBlindside, Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Blindside, and City of Melbourne\n\nImage: Lou Wheeler\n\nTranscript: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uFbJ1RishuDg9micQLFctnbetewscg4R9BhRAWfBxOw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
