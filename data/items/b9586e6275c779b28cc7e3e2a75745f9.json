We've seen characters like her before — think of the power-obsessed personalities in shows like <em>Billions</em> and <em>Succession</em>. The big difference? The stakes are much higher for a young Black woman like Harper. <br/><br/>Myha'la talks to guest host <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TracieHunte\">Tracie Hunte</a> about the new season of <em>Industry</em>, bringing her own context to a complex, morally ambiguous character and why she credits her mom for her success. <br/><br/><em>You can follow us on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPRItsBeenAMin\"><em>@NPRItsBeenAMin</em></a><em> and email us at </em><a href=\"mailto:ibam@npr.org\"><em>ibam@npr.org</em></a><em>.</em> ",
