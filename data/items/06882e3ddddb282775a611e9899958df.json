  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Phyllis' Wedding. We are joined by this episode's director, Ken Whittingham, who shares his memories of this episode and his time on The Office. And we aren't stopping there, the shimmy queen herself, Phyllis Smith, sends in audio memories for this episode as well. We jump in by discussing Pam clocking Phyllis using all of her wedding ideas, we get a 'shallow dive' on Ivan Pavlov, and we get a Dwight talking head that will be important later in the show series. Then, we go to the room where the fart happened and Phyllis Smith answers all your questions about that scene. Finally, ladies share some funny wedding memories, chat about that hilarious bouquet swat, and we end with a deleted scene that proves Phyllis didn't steal every wedding idea from Pam. </p>\n",
