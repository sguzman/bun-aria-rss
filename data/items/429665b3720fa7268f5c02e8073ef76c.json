  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the media had a completely different reaction to a government shutdown versus private businesses being shut down via lockdown orders. The left has shut down businesses, created edicts to wear masks everywhere including inside one's home, and endangered the livelihoods of so many Americans that rely on the free market for their survival. In a period of less than a year, the Democrat party's unconstitutional mandates are driving America into massive debt. That's the private sector fighting to survive. However, there are government employees that don't care about the economy because they continue getting paid in the public sector. Now, the bureaucrats want to cover up the damage with a new 'stimulus' bill under the guise of coronavirus relief. So, why isn't the government shrinking the way the private sector is? Then, Ambassador Ron Dermer calls in to discuss the Abraham Accords and the latest nation to join the peace agreement - Morocco. Dermer clarified that Iran's terror proxies are an existential threat to the survival of the State of Israel and lauded the Trump Administration for reinstating sanctions. Later, Washington can focus on China but can't ignore other threats to the United States. This country has many enemies and to think otherwise is both simplistic and dangerous. Despite reassurances from Homeland Security cybersecurity specialists, the US Government has been massively attacked by hackers suspected to be Russian intelligence operatives. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
