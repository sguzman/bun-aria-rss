  "title": "37- Does God Cause Suffering - Part 2",
  "description": "In this episode we revisit the challenging question, \"Does God Cause Suffering?\" through observing the poetic narrative of the book of Job.  In recent weeks I have been in a discussion on Twitter regarding this topic in response to The Gospel Coalition video posted at the end of this summary, that suggests that God not only causes suffering but, ordains it.  Job is a commonly misunderstood book in it's writing style and is often used to defend the stance that God ordains evil works. We actually believe it presents a convincing counterpoint.  Enjoy! We're looking forward to your thoughts and comments below.\n",
