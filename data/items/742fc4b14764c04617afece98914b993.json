  "description": "Singer-songwriter S.G. Goodman creates songs about complex people and conflicting ideas. She sings about complications that are close to her heart because she has lived them. Raised on a farm in rural Western Kentucky, growing up with a strong Christian background, reconciling the basis of her faith with her emerging understanding of philosophy, S.G. has plenty of stories she can tell through song. Marc talks with S.G. about farm life, being traumatized by corn, her OCD diagnosis, and her pandemic pen pal, Paul Schrader. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
