For this episode, we want to look farther afield at how the pandemic is affecting economies across the world - especially in the Global South.\n\nAyeisha is joined by Dr Tobias Franz, Lecturer in Economics at SOAS and Shreya Nanda, Economist at the Centre for Economic Justice at the Institute for Public Policy Research.\n\n-----\n\nResearched by Margaret Welsh.
