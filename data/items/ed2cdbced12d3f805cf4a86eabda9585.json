    "media:description": "This video shows the live playback of the background music from the \"What Is Ardour?\" video:\nhttps://youtu.be/YpMP8uGGpzI\n\nIt demonstrates an entirely \"in-the-box\" approach to creating music - with nearly all sounds and arrangements being created inside Ardour, using synthesizer and effect plugins, MIDI sequencing and automation.\n\nArdour can be used to make many different kinds of music, but we thought it might be helpful to show how the program looks and works with this particular piece and style. If you're thinking of using Ardour to record actual performances on various instruments (acoustic or electronic), the workflow will be fairly different, but the final result in terms what an Ardour session looks like will be similar.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nYou can also watch on PeerTube:\nhttps://pe.ertu.be/videos/watch/c444d3c8-56af-4902-b30a-f7efd207fcc1",
