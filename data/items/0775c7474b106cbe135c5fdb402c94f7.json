From allegations of fostering a toxic workplace environment to sexual harrassment to their long overdue name change, the franchise under owner Daniel Snyder is constantly in the news…and not for success on the field. But if previous scandals and offenses haven’t seemed to move the needle enough for the league, now Snyder and the Commanders are under scrutiny for something we know the NFL cares about: money. ESPN’s Commanders reporter John Keim explains why politicians on Capitol Hill are now digging into the team’s finances, and whether this latest scandal could finally bring the league to step in and force out owner Daniel Snyder.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
