  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Florida has been on pace to get hit directly by  Hurricane Dorian and Governor Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss the latest. DeSantis urged all residents to be prepared for landfall especially the east coast. Then, the media is attacking Sean Hannity for his friendship with President Trump. The media is all too happy to attack conservatives.  After, China is secreting its way into the Hong King Police Department and they are now arresting protesters that oppose the Communist regime's policy on extradition. Yet, the media will never criticize red China. They will never write articles stating that this is the umpteenth time that Biden has lied, the way the do to Trump. Joe Biden says we don't need detention centers so children getting smuggled can be kept together with the adults claiming to be their parents. How can we vet illegal aliens seeking asylum if we don't detain them? Later, meteorologist Joe Bastardi gives us an update on Hurricane Dorian's path. Afterward, Judge Jeanine Piro joins the program to discuss her new book \"Radicals, Resistance, and Revenge: The Left's Plot to Remake America\". \nLearn more about your ad choices.
