  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats and the media have taken an ugly turn. They no longer pretend to be the Party civil rights, but now many have become anti-Semitic. The Washington Post is an anti-Semitic Newspaper who defends Rep Rashida Tlaib and they trash this program while trashing America in their reporting. President Trump is not a racist, but Rep Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez attack an entire faith - the entire nation of Israel with their anti-Semitic tropes. They hate President Trump because he has two strikes against him — he loves America and because he's the best president Israel has ever seen! What exactly has Ilhan Omar done for women of color? Nothing! What has Rashida Tlaib done for women of color? Nothing! What has Ocasio-Cortez done for women of color? Nothing! Now, what has Trump done for women of color, for Muslims? Trump saved women of color, men of color, and children of color who were under chemical attack until Trump ordered a bomb strike to stop that regime for this genocide. Does this sound like a racist? No, Donald Trump is a patriot. This led the Washington Post to criticize this program, revealing their own hatred for Jews. Then, Senator Rand Paul and his \"Blame America first\" policies are now looking to get involved in dealing with Iran. Paul's former aide Jack Hunter, a known neo-confederate sympathizer, penned a piece taking exception to this program's commentary. Later, MSNBC's Donny Deutsch criticized all Trump supporters in his heart-to-heart with white people requesting that they abandon Trump. After, Jeffrey Lord calls in to discuss his new book, “Swamp Wars: Donald Trump and the New American Populism vs. The Old Order.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
