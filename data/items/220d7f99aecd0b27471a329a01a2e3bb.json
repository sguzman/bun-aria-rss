  "description": "<p>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a well known piece of fiction written by Washington Irving in 1819. Many of us first heard the story in our youth and the tale fueled our imagination with images of a headless horseman chasing a man through the forest, carrying a fiery pumpkin that represented his head. It was a terrifying tale. But is this just a piece of fiction? Is there some truth to the story? Headless figures seem quite common in the world of the paranormal, so it's not too hard to believe that some may ride horses. And what of this place called Sleepy Hollow? There is a town that does indeed bear this name, as does a cemetery, and both are reputed to be haunted. Join us as we explore the legends of the headless horseman and the history and hauntings of Sleepy Hollow! The Moment in Oddity features the Disappearance of Solomon Northup and This Day in History features the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio being founded. Our topic was suggested by listeners Lexi Goober and Seth Nathan. We had research assistance from Melissa Cabic. Our cover art is by artist and listener Sara Otterstatter.
