  "description": "It was July 1972 and Leeds United had just beaten Arsenal in the FA Cup final.  Near Tamworth, a young girl went for a ride on her bike one summers evening never  to return.  Who was responsible for her disappearance: a local soldier who had experienced vivid dreams about the girl?  Or could it even have been the Peter Sutcliffe, TheYorkshire Ripper?   This week's episode of the UK True Crime Weekly Podcast examines this case in detail.&#13;\n&#13;\nwww.uktruecrime.com&#13;\nhttps://m.facebook.com/groups/1479468325433430&#13;\nwww.patreon.com/uktruecrime",
