  "description": "<p>   Paul was a member of the SUNY Purchase Mafia and talks about his college days with Edie Falco, Hal Hartley and Wesley Snipes. He originally auditioned for the role of Mikey Palmice, but after his audition David Chase asked him to read for Father Phil. Strangely, Paul’s real life dad was a bit of a flawed priest himself so Paul knew exactly how to play that part. </p><p>     Then Jason Minter joins the podcast. Jason started out as the locations manager for the Sopranos but David Chase quickly took him on as his own personal assistant. Jason saw the entire Sopranos operation from the inside out. He knew what was going on before the actors, producers or directors did. When someone on staff leaked secrets about the show, Jason was the one who did some digging to figure out who it was. Turns out the guilty party was making hundreds of thousands of dollars selling story lines to the tabloids. </p><p>     After that Michael and Steve break down this week’s episode. It was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and a big one for both Steve Buscemi and Edie Falco. Check out Talking Sopranos #59 “Sentimental Education” S5 -Ep6.
