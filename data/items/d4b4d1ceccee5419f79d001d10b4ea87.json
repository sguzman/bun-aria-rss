  "description": "<p>What’s your relationship with failure like? Do you accept it as part of the process of progression or does it debilitate you?</p>\n<p>This a question many of us ask ourselves when we inevitably encounter failure. We either use it as a learning opportunity or we become entrenched in our ways of thinking blaming everyone else for the failure. 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<p>This book examines many different concepts, such as cognitive dissonance, defining failure and achieving small steps over giant leaps. It’s one of the rare books that I read that leaves me questioning many different elements not only of myself but of society as a whole.</p>\n<p>How can we all take more responsibility for the role that we have in society and apply these principles to create a better society? I do believe it is by constantly seeking the correct ways of improvement as this book suggests on multiple occasions. But it is also changing the stigma behind failure. Not as a badge of negative connotation, but instead of honour knowing that the same mistake can be prevented in the future. 📚</p>\n<p>Another great book that I have read that I recommend. It seems every book I am reading at the moment is 💯.</p>\n<p>Appreciate @matthewsyedauthor for writing this, I look forward to reading your other work as well. 👍📚</p>\n<p>Have you read this? If so, what were your thoughts? 📚</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
