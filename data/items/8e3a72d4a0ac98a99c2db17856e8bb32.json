  "description": "<p>Nick Santonastasso personifies the concept of inspiration. Nick was born with a very rare condition called Hanhart Syndrome, only 3 out of 12 others Born with this condition are alive . Although he survived, Nick was born legless and with only a portion of one of his arms.</p> Nick has not allowed any of those challenges to stop him from achieving his biggest dreams. He doesn't use prosthetics to get around—he is pictured usually standing upright on what is left of his legs, rarely without a massive grin.  <p>Santonastasso gained fame as a teenager with his prank videos—notably, one where  he dressed up as a zombie and scared Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus. Today, he spends most of his time in the gym and doing motivational speaking. </p> <p>I am rarely speechless in any interview and don’t lose my composure or control of my emotions. However , there is a moment in this interview of such incredible emotion inspiration that I couldn’t quite pull it together. I know you will feel the same.</p> <p>This interview will change your life, PERIOD. Your life and the lives of your family, friends and colleagues will never be the same again.I’m humbled, privileged and honored to share this inspiring conversation with you.</p>\n",
