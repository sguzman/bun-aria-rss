  "title": "Ep 165 | The Benham Brothers & Fake News, Silent Christian Celebs & Social Justice in the Church",
  "description": "David and Jason Benham were the targets of fake news and cancel culture before those things were trendy hashtags. On their \"Unashamed\" debut, the Benham brothers talk with Phil and Al about how to live boldly for Jesus, how to demolish anything that goes up against the knowledge of God, and how they built their real estate company on scripture. David and Jason look back at GLAAD's cancel campaign against them and discuss the agenda to silence, marginalize, demonize, and criminalize Christians. The guys also tackle the silence of many Christian celebrities and how failing to speak up hinders the gospel. And Al describes an event with 30+ pastors where he heard more about social justice than the gospel.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
