  "description": "<p>David Johansen is one of the all-time front&nbsp;men in music and an artist who keeps changing the game &ndash; not by degrees but by solar systems. In the 1980s, he had everyone feeling &ldquo;Hot, Hot, Hot&rdquo; as Buster Poindexter. Then he showed up as the taxi-driving Ghost of Christmas Past in the Bill Murray film <em>Scrooged.</em> Before all this, he was the glammed-up lead singer of The New York Dolls, the mythic rock band of the downtown NYC scene of the 1970s. Hard rock, punk rock, glam rock, heavy metal &ndash; the Dolls sit atop a lot of family trees. To this day, whatever room he walks into, from loft spaces to the swanky Caf&eacute; Carlyle, David Johansen owns it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In part one of this epic two-part interview, David talks with host <strong>Kevin Burke </strong>about coming of age on Staten Island in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, a kid riding bikes, buying and listening to records, going to Catholic School, joining a band, and graduating from high school at the height of the Vietnam War. How did he get from the house his grandfather built on the North Shore to the pulsating East Village at the dawn of an era he&rsquo;d help define?
