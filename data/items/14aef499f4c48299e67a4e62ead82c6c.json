  "description": "<p>Meditation: Living Presence (2016-03-23) (20:01 min) - The pathway to experiencing full aliveness and openheartedness is by awakening awareness throughout the body. This meditation begins by establishing a rhythmic inflow and outflow of the breath, in order to calm and collect the mind. Then continuing with the conscious breathing, we are guided through the body - bringing attention to sensations and space. This attention becomes a very vibrant living presence, and we end by experiencing that living presence as a natural openheartedness that includes all of life.</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donate.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p>\n<p>With thanks and love, Tara</p>",
