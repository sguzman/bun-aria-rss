  "description": "Tonight’s special guest is Susan Pinsky, the First Lady of Loveline, and host of the new podcast Calling out with Susan Pinsky. Susan gets intimate about her sex life with her husband, Dr. Drew Pinsky, host of the Loveline, Celebrity Rehab, and Dr.Drew on Call. Although they have an amazing sex life now, it wasn’t always that way. After having triplets(!), Susan completely lost her sex drive. Her hormone levels plummeted after giving birth and she couldn’t figure out how to reinvigorate her sex life. Her problems were exacerbated with the onset of early menopause. Susan shares her journey to reclaim her sex drive through bioidentical hormones. Finally she found the solution that worked for her and shares how she got her sex drive back right when they received the devastating news of Dr. Drew’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We even talk to Susan’s doctor, Dr. Jennifer Park in Pasadena who specializes in hormone pellet therapy. Mismatched libidos is one of the most common problems in relationships. One partner is enthusiastic about being sexually intimate while the other is subdued. And this takes a toll on the relationship. 48% of people say they are satisfied with their sex life. That’s not enough people. There are many reasons why people’s libido change over the years: Stress Depression Age Lifestyle choices, including: alcohol, drugs, sleep, diet Medication, including antidepressants Lack of sexual enjoyment during sex And of course, kids. You’re bound to fall into one of these categories at some point in your life. Susan and I discuss what you can do if your partner wants more or less sex than you. We end the show with a special call from Susan’s psychic Rebecca Fearing. She gives me an amazing psychic reading on my love life and things to come in the future.
