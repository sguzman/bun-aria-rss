    "media:description": "How do events factor into our mental linguistics? How can we adjust our logic to capture different sentence permutations? In this week's episode, we take a look at event semantics: what problems they're meant to solve, how they help us limit time and place in our sentences, and what evidence we have that events are real.\n\nThis is Topic #92!\n\nThis week's tag language: Tswana!\n\nRelated videos:\nMeaning Predicated on Logic: Predicate Logic - https://youtu.be/al5SJSbIyvM\nSplit Personality: The Syntax of VP Shells - https://youtu.be/lY1X2BnjmNI\nRelatively Close: The Syntax of Relative Clauses - https://youtu.be/Bra5gExyPbY\n\nLast episode:\nBending the Truth: The Linguistics of Propaganda and Censorship - https://youtu.be/X82SFZ_eXOU\n\nOther of our semantics videos:\nDownward Spiral: Negative Polarity Items - https://youtu.be/vd8cjyxHQdw\nTopic of Focus: Information Structure - https://youtu.be/gZ6o8yFvJYI\nOperation Relevance: Relevance Theory - https://youtu.be/yRv1agt776c\n\nOur website also has extra content about this week's topic, on different kinds of events, at: http://www.thelingspace.com/episode-92/\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: http://thelingspace.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheLingSpace\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, http://www.thelingspace.com/ !\nYou can also find our store at the website, https://thelingspace.storenvy.com/\n\nWe also have forums to discuss this episode, and linguistics more generally.\n\nSources:\nDavidson's original paper on event semantics: http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/Ling7800/Davidson.pdf\nA useful handout that gets into the entailment patterns: http://people.umass.edu/partee/RGGU_2005/RGGU05Lec12.pdf\nA handy and short summary of the topic: http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/jFhNWM2M/eventbasedsemantics.pdf\n\nLooking forward to next time!",
