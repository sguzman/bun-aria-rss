able to interview Brigadier General Fred Lewis, who has recently retired from the Canadian Armed Forces after a career that spanned over thirty years.  General Lewis is an inspiring leader who always knew and spoke of the value of military families.  As a military <a title=\"Canadian Engineers Museum\" href=\"http://www.cmemuseum.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer</a> and Combat Diver, he has had the ability to deploy and serve in many of the world&#8217;s hot-spots.  I am certain that you&#8217;ll enjoy this episode.</p>\n<p>I am going to put out a little bit of a challenge for you; please email me at mikelacroixcmhp@gmail.com with the comments made by the guests of the podcast that really stand out most to you.  In June, I will compile a &#8220;Best of Season One&#8221; type of episode that will re-visit those themes and those messages.  I am not going to give you categories, so please come up with a category yourself when you make your suggestion.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank Scott Gardener and Chris Honeywell, the Two True Freaks, for prompting me to produce a promo for the show which they have offered to play on an upcoming podcast.  You can find the Freaks at <a title=\"Two True Freaks\" href=\"http://twotruefreaks.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.twotruefreaks.com</a> for their shows about movies, Sci-Fi, Star Trek, Star Wars, Comics, Disney and much more.</p>\n<p>I am also looking for feedback from you about the show and also about the promo.  Please take a moment and let me know what you think by email or on <a title=\"CMHP Facebook Page\"

am!</p>\n<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>\n<p>Mike Lacroix</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that you can support this site by shopping on <a title=\"Amazon.ca\"
