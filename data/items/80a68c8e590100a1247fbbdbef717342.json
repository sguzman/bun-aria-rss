Designed for high availability, the region opens with three zones which enables us to deliver two geographically separated cloud regions to our Kiwi customers to meet IT and business requirements for disaster recovery while maintaining the reliability of their data.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Collectively, these investments will deliver geographically distributed and secure infrastructure to customers across New Zealand, enabling them to take advantage of the cleanest cloud in the industry.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><a href=\"https://www.trademe.co.nz/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Trade Me</span></a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> talked about their decision to migrate from their on-premise data centers to run on Google Cloud. Paolo Ragone, Chief Technology Officer said, “We moved to Google Cloud to improve the stability and resilience of our infrastructure and become more cloud-native as part of a digital transformation program that keeps the customer at the heart of our business. We welcome Google Cloud’s investment in ANZ and what they present to improve Trade Me’s agility and performance.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"background-color: white; line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As organisations continue to look to cloud services to drive the digital transformation of their businesses. Google Cloud is here to help businesses become smarter with data, deploy faster, connect more easily with people and customers throughout the globe, and protect everything that matters to their businesses. Our investments in connectivity and cloud infrastructure are a catalyst for this change, and we look forward to seeing how customers and partners grow, innovate, and drive digital transformation forward in the region.</span></p></span></span><div><br /></div>Post content  <span class=\"post-author\">Posted by Matthew Zwolenski, Director of Cloud Customer Engineering, Australia &amp; New Zealand.</span>",
