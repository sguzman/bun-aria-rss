  "description": "<p>When Reese Witherspoon was in rehearsals for her lead role in the 2005 film Walk the Line, she wanted to quit–every day. But she went on to win the Oscar for her performance as June Carter Cash. Since then, she’s gone from playing iconic roles in films (Legally Blonde, Election, Water for Elephants) to also producing and starring in her own TV shows and movies (Little Fires Everywhere, Big Little Lies, Wild). Reese talks to Adam about how she's built confidence by facing her doubts head on, and shares why acknowledging what she doesn’t know has helped her found a company–which was recently acquired for $900 million–that finally puts women at the center of their stories.
