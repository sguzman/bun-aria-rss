  "description": "<p>XFL Commissioner Oliver Luck joins Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including what it has been like to build a professional sports league from scratch. The XFL earlier this week announced its cities and venues -- just a part of what it'll take to build a spring football league. Also discussed is the rebooted league's broadcast media plan, which will be announced soon, how it's using junior college players to re-imagine the game, and how technology will be utilized to make the in-venue and at-home experiences better for football fans. Luck also talks about his boss, World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, and how the league intends to make the game of football safer. Luck also touches on Miguel de Cervantes's character Don Quixote, and whether a new football league is akin to tilting at windmills. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams </p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
