  "description": "Today I have another special interview with longtime friend, Marin Katusa, founder of Katusa Research. Marin starts off this episode by giving us his outlook concerning the gold and silver markets. Marin shares his thoughts on how to navigate through this tough sector, giving us details on what to look for while these stocks are still in their early stages. Marin then gives us his insight on where gold prices are going to be in the next three to five years based on just two fundamental aspects. He then talks about \"smart money\" and his experience with warrants and why every accredited investor should be aware of these opportunities. Finally, Marin shares some interesting ideas on what to look forward to in other commodity sectors aside from gold and silver. These are sectors that not everyone will agree with, but potentially have tremendous upside in the near future. Don’t miss out on this week’s exclusive educational segment covering the popular short sale of First Majestic Silver (AG). By the end of this segment, you'll know what direction to take.",
