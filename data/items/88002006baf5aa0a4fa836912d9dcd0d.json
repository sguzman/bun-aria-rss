  "description": "This report draws on a unique, longitudinal dataset of over 250,000 San Francisco Bay Area residents to examine residential instability—including moving, crowding, and financial health—in the Bay Area during the pandemic. Our research finds a substantial decrease in moving during the pandemic, particularly for residents of extremely low socioeconomic status (SES). At the same time, we report a concerning rise in residents living in crowded conditions and experiencing declining credit scores. These trends suggest that COVID-19 rent relief programs and eviction moratoria may be successful in reducing displacement; however, alternative strategies may be necessary to address other forms of residential instability, like crowding, especially in Black and low-income neighborhoods. This report concludes with recommendations to address residential instability in the Bay Area.",
