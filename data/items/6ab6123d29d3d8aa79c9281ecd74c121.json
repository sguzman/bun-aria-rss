  "description": "Fed members can’t help themselves: They continue to move markets with their speeches and seem dead-set on crashing every asset class. (And Daniel thinks the Fed is trolling me.) The Wall Street Journal reports that the Fed may hike interest rates by another 75 basis points later this month… and continue its aggressive path for the foreseeable future. I break down how hard and fast stocks will fall from current levels if the Fed follows through on this plan. In fact, it’s pushing us towards a depression. Turning to energy, Daniel highlights why all investors should have exposure to oil & gas stocks right now… and one activist investor urging more oil and natural gas production. But I disagree, and explain the no-brainer way to play the energy markets (which you can get easy exposure to with The Dollar Stock Club)… In this episode  Is the Fed trolling me? [1:00] Why the Fed is scaring the s*** out of me [6:25] The data the Fed should pay attention to [8:15] Hard proof inflation will keep coming down [11:50]  Why Daniel is bullish on oil [19:46] What Frank is buying instead of oil & gas stocks [24:22] The “anti-woke” activist investor [33:03]   Enjoyed this episode?
