  "description": "<p>This week, we look at an Olympic gold medalist, and world class human garbage pile. He went from being one of his country's biggest heroes, to being known for his heinous crimes, including the international smuggling of women, and putting together plots to kidnap billionaire's daughters for ransom. Just when you think he can't be any worse of a person, he becomes friends with some even worse people, while serving time for his awful acts, forming maybe the most horrible little gang in history. He's crazy. He's evil. And he is a complete idiot. Slip on your bedazzled leotard, leap into the air, and hope to be judged kindly with Wolfgang Scwarz!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
