  "description": "<p>A challenge which machine learning practitioners often face, is how to deal with skewed classes in classification problems. Such a tricky situation occurs when one class is over-represented in the data set. A common example for this issue is fraud detection: a very big part of the data set, usually 9x%, describes normal activities and only a small fraction of the data records should get classified as fraud. In such a case, if the model always predicts &#8220;normal&#8221;, then it is correct 9x% of the time. At first, the accuracy and therewith the quality of such a model might seemâ€¦</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://florianhartl.com/thoughts-on-machine-learning-dealing-with-skewed-classes.html\">Thoughts on Machine Learning &#8211; Dealing with Skewed Classes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://florianhartl.com\">Florian Hartl</a>.</p>\n",
