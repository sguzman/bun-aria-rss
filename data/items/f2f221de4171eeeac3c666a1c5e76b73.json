  "description": "\"The fragility of the EU is increasing,\" says EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, and, \"the cracks are growing in size.\" The cracks appear in many forms. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel says migration is the issue that \"could decide the EU's fate.\" Her French counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron, wants urgent economic reform and a \"profound transformation\" of the EU. His solution in part is to \"give Europe back to its citizens.\" But what do European citizen want? Some want out, as seen in Brexit. Many others don't like the way the EU is currently run. That's behind the rise of Eurosceptic governments in Hungary, Poland, and now Italy. Can the gap be closed between French hopes and German fears? Who has the will and the wherewithal to reform the EU before another political or economic crisis engulfs it? And if no change comes is the EU's very survival at risk?\n\n(Photo: EU flag billows all tattered and torn. Credit: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images)",
