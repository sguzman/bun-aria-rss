  "description": "<p>In this 62nd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss the value of gratitude, always but especially now. We pivot to the lab leak hypothesis, and what its discussion in the mainstream media means for the ability of society at large to consider what might be true regarding the origins of SARS-CoV2. We discuss what happened in the Capitol on January 6, and and the ensuing censorship and purges by the big tech platforms. We see the boot coming down hard and fast, with calls from U.S. Representatives to refocus our concern on events and enemies within our own borders. Finally, a reading from Thich Nhat Hanh’s 2012 book, Fear: Essential Wisdom for Getting Through the Storm. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
