  "description": "<p>BONUS - We open the show today with something a little different, providing a little mental refresher for everyone out there listening at home. A Zero Blog Thirty first. Then, we get into the rounds and we have a full show!\n\n\nRound 1: Andrew Yang talked to a friend who was a soldier and we all had to read the dumbest tweet as a result. Hey Andrew, you got firewatch, bitch\n\nRound 2: Huge shoutout to our friends down under. They might be providing an escape for the entire world right now by utilizing a private island for Sports. Our beloved, beloved sports.\n\nRound 3: Motivator, motivator come on out. We wanna hear Cpl Greg Fisher, who we post on social media every monday, scream and shout. \n\nRound 4: As many of you know, toilet paper can be hard to get your hands on. So can eggs, milk, and lysol. One industry is booming during quarantine season, you guessed it. It’s baby chick time. \n\nRound 5: The Career Fair continues and we talk to a Chaplain\n\nRound 6: The leader of ISIS in Afghanistan was arrested with 19 other militants. We arent going to spend much time on it, I just really wanna mention how fucking ugly this dude is. Buzz, your girlfriend… WOOOF\n\nRound 7: I finally got around to watching Captain America from 2011 and I have some thoughts about this American hero.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
