If you were one of our winners, please email Cindy at Rollinsfamily11(at)gmail(dot)com to give her your contact information and get your prize!

Register at <a href= \"https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-2020/\">CindyRollins.net</a> to get access live or later!</p> <p>Our guest today is Lit Life “superfan” Emily Raible. Emily is a homeschool mom, an avid reader, birdwatcher, baker and probably Angelina’s most loyal student. In telling the story of her reading life, Emily talks about her childhood and how she was not a reader as a young person. She shares how she finally started getting interested in reading through Janette Oke and Hardy Boys books. Then she tells about borrowing books from a local family’s home library and starting to fall in love with true classics.</p> <p>After getting married to an avid reader, Emily started going through her husband’s own library during her long hours at home alone. Even after she became of lover of reading, Emily still didn’t define herself as a real reader. Emily shares her journey to becoming a homeschooling parent, how she learned about Charlotte Mason and classical education, and her first time meeting Angelina and Cindy. They continue the conversation expanding on the feast of ideas, what it means to be a “reader,” and how we learn and enter into the literary world throughout our lives.</p> <p>Stay tuned next week when we will be discussing Tolkein’s essay “<a href= \"http://www.heritagepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/Tolkien-On-Fairy-Stories-subcreation.pdf\">On Fairy Stories</a>“, followed by a conversation about his short story “<a href= \"http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm\">Leaf by Niggle</a>” for the next two weeks.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>But the object of my school is to show how many extraordinary things even a lazy and ordinary man may see, if he can spur himself to the single activity of seeing.</p> <cite>G. K. Chesterton</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Time can be both a threat and a friend to hope. Injustice, for example, has to be tediously dismantled, not exploded. This is often infuriating, but it is true.</p> <cite>Makoto Fujimura</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The poet is traditionally a blind man, but the Christian poet, and story-teller as well, is like the blind man whom Christ touched, who looked then and saw men as if they were trees but walking. This is the beginning of vision, and it is an invitation to deeper and stranger visions than we shall have to learn to accept if we are to realize a truly Christian literature.</p> <cite>Flannery O’Connor</cite></blockquote> <h3>Armies in the Fire</h3> <p><em>by Robert Louis Stevenson</em></p> <p>The lamps now glitter down the street;<br /> Faintly sound the falling feet;<br /> And the blue even slowly falls<br /> About the garden trees and walls.</p> <p>Now in the falling of the gloom<br /> The red fire paints the empty room:<br /> And warmly on the roof it looks,<br /> And flickers on the back of books.</p> <p>Armies march by tower and spire<br /> Of cities blazing, in the fire;—<br /> Till as I gaze with staring eyes,<br /> The armies fall, the lustre dies.</p> <p>Then once again the glow returns;<br /> Again the phantom city burns;<br /> And down the red-hot valley, lo!<br /> The phantom armies marching go!</p> <p>Blinking embers, tell me true<br /> Where are those armies marching to,<br /> And what the burning city is<br /> That crumbles in your furnaces!</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p>(Amazon affiliate links)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/398LVcS\">Tremendous Trifles</a></em> by G.
