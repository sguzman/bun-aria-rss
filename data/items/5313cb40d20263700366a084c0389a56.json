  "title": "Summer Treat #4: Raleigh Ritchie, the Reluctant Thirst Object",
  "description": "Our last summer treat features Raleigh Ritchie (aka Jacob Anderson aka Grey Worm from Game of Thrones). Raleigh may have a hard time thinking of himself as a Thirst Object but he’s cute, shy, and multitalented. How could we not swoon over him? With Bim on leave in London, Nichole asks Raleigh about his musical influences (Spice Girls, Destiny’s Child, Musiq Soulchild, The Maccabees, and more), his own singing career, what’s on his baby-making playlist, and the significance of portraying a eunuch who falls in love. Let Raleigh’s soothing voice tuck you in as we get ready for our season three premiere next week and be sure to check out his single “Time in a Tree.”\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
