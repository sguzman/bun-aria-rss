  "title": "Weekly Wrap: School Surveillance, That Anonymous Book, College Tuition Benefits",
  "description": "Senate Republicans have introduced a bill that would expand online and other surveillance of American schoolchildren, in what they call an effort to prevent mass shootings and other violence.  But is that type of surveillance effective — and what does it mean for privacy?  Plus, news of a book purportedly written by a Trump administration insider, who last year published an anonymous New York Times op-ed  about resisting the President's agenda.  Service-industry employers such as Chipotle are expanding college tuition benefits to attract workers and reduce turnover.  Sam speaks to a Starbucks employee who is close to finishing her degree through that company's program and asks whether most employees can actually take advantage of these benefits. Sam is joined by NPR education correspondent Anya Kamenetz and NPR arts editor Rose Friedman.",
