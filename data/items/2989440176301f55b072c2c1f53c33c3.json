  "description": "<p><strong>John and Christine Gachot</strong> are the husband-and-wife team behind the design studio that bears their name, Gachot Studios. The two first met while working together for iconic designer Bill Sofield in the late 1990s, but it took them a long time to start their own firm. First, Christine spent a decade with hotelier Andre Balazs, while John acted as design director for David Easton and then Thad Hayes. In 2012, the Gachots finally started working together, and their studio has been on a tear ever since, designing everything from magazine-ready homes; to the Shinola hotel in Detroit and the Pendry in New York; to a line of fixtures for Waterworks.</p><p>In this episode of the podcast, John and Christine speak with host Dennis Scully about taking on different kinds of work to stay creatively engaged, why they don’t charge markups on product, and their approach to thoughtfully growing—and keeping—a large design team.  </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.theshadestore.com/customer-service/to-the-trade\">The Shade Store</a> and <a href=\"https://crypton.com/\">Crypton</a>.</p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"https://www.gachotstudios.com/\"><strong>Gachot Studios</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\"><strong>Dennis Scully</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a></p>\n",
