Sign up today:</em></p><p>Returning guest and scholar of the Sahel Alex Thurston joins me to discuss the recently reported <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200605-french-forces-kill-al-qaeda-s-north-africa-chief-in-mali-ministry-says\">death</a> of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb leader Abdelmalek Droukdel.
