After quickly eating and bathing, you enjoy anywhere from two to four hours of shut eye, usually in the back of a Subaru as it drives through the night to meet dawn in an adjoining state. Then you heave your weary bones up, eat, get dressed and do it all over again.

I know what it's like to fall asleep on your bike. I know what it's like to have saddle sores so painful you can't sit down. I know what it's like to run through the night, hallucinating. And I know what it's like when that inevitable moment arises and you ask yourself:&nbsp;what am I doing to myself?</p><p>But James and his entire family were all in from the get go. To underwrite the endeavor, they even sold their house and put all their earthly possessions in storage. So never&nbsp;for a second did I doubt his level of commitment. I knew he could complete 50 ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states. It was the 50 days&nbsp;part that bent my brain. Certainly he'll have to take&nbsp;at least one day off, right? Maybe two.

It's not just that you did what you said you would do. It's the way you did it. It was your&nbsp;composure. It was you tremendous grace under fire.
