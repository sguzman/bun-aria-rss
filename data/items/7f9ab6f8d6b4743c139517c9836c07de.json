  "description": "<p>Stavros Halkios came to my apartment to tell me all about the people bringing down the EU; Greeks.

Greeks are the least maligned group of people in America because nobody knows crap about them. Let's change that. Let's find a new group to hate. And with Stavros's help, maybe that group can be Greeks.</p>",
