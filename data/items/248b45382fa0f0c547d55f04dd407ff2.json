  "description": "I won’t sugarcoat it: The last several weeks have been sh***y for the markets. I want to be here for you, so I’m answering more questions from listeners and subscribers. (I’ll continue taking questions over the next few weeks, so if you have any, email me at frank@curzioresearch.com.) To start, I cover the latest painful market movements—and why you need to steer clear of companies that haven’t reported earnings yet… but highlight some positive signs I’m seeing.  Then, I answer questions on whether Amazon is a buy... and how much cash you should hold in your portfolio. Plus, a listener shares how I saved him money earlier this year. Lastly, I break down the state of the supply chain crisis for automakers—and whether any of these companies are worth considering. In this episode:  Investors with an 18-month time horizon should be excited [2:37] Stay away from companies that haven’t reported earnings [4:47] Is Amazon a buy? [10:00] What should you do with your cash? [17:31] How I helped one listener get ahead of inflation [28:34] Are any automakers buys amid the supply chain crisis? [31:50]  Enjoyed this episode?
