  "description": "Recently we have had some people asking about the definitions of certains words or how things generally work, so today we wanted to break down the design world a little bit so you can better understand what we’re talking about. I go over the definition of market, which is a show you can go to to see essentially any product that you could need in the home. Show houses are used for showing off home designs and some times, especially in Utah, there will be big shows called the Parade of Homes where you will see a series of homes that have been put up for show. We talk about different books and what you should look for to showcase in your home.<br /><br />What is Market? 1:06<br />What are show houses? 8:52<br />Must read/must have books 17:06<br />Must have tools 26:02<br /><br />“All of the different ways of displaying art. There’s several different types of easels. We’ve got lucite, we’ve got painted, kind of white plastery color, we’ve got walnut, we’ve got a walnut book cradle, a lucite book cradle, and we’ve also got some really beautiful plastery white pedestals to display sculpture and it looks so smart and so gallery.” 27:55<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
