  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 35: Featuring Shawn Thornton",
  "description": "<p>On this week's show, the guys kick things off with the Stanley Cup Final and break down how the Pens were the first team to repeat in almost 20 years, why the Preds are hardly a flash in the pan, when officiating screws up on the grandest stage, and much more. Next up, two-time Stanley Cup winner and Boston Bruins legend Shawn Thornton joins the show to discuss his decision to eschew a TV job with NESN in Boston to become Vice President of Business Operations for the Panthers in Sunrise, Florida. The loquacious Thorty also talks about fighting's role in the future, moving into the heart of Boston's tight-knit, Irish Charlestown neighborhood and becoming a Townie, Cam Neely's phone call that helped lure him to Boston, and the very first time he met Rear Admiral in a bar nearly a decade ago and put him in charge of.....the Stanley Cup. We could've had Thorty on for five hours if time permitted---he's a \"must listen\" guest. Enjoy.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
