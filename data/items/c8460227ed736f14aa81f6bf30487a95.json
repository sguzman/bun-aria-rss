Since we’re all staying sanitized and socially distant, remember that your phone is probably super super gross, and you should clean it as often as you wash your hands. They are about $80 and on backorder til April (as I write this), but I bought one anyway because you know what?

This week, so many of you stepped up and donated small amounts towards a pot for the Y, the JCC and for Meals On Wheels, which will serve as lifelines and lifesavers for our most vulnerable and at-risk neighbors. As I am writing these show notes on March 12th, we’ve PASSED our $5000 goal! If you still want to donate a buck or two, you can Venmo me @socarolinesays. I am really proud of this community we’re building together, and that we can both enjoy buying things like ~*~Diamond Dazzle Stiks~*~ <em>and</em> know when it’s time to put our money towards a more important cause.
