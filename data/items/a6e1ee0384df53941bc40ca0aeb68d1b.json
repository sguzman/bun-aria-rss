  "description": "<p>The municipal actors of the Catalan capital wish to obtain a reversal of the\nnegative representations concerning the lack of attractiveness of the district\nof Poblenou considered as one of the poorest and most marginalized districts of\nthe city while having as identity the expression of \"Manchester southern\nEurope\", recalling its role as a factory for Spain and an emblem of the\nIndustrial Revolution for the Iberian Peninsula. Conceptualization, programming\nand construction of a new image of the city through this large urban wasteland\nare made concrete thanks to an urban marketing operation. The specifications\nallow the construction of innovative buildings, with resolutely contemporary\narchitecture, breaking with the regulations in force on the limitation of the\nheight of skyscrapers in order to make this pericentral territory visible and\nattractive. Catalan society in the 21st century has produced a fragmented and\ndominating neo-capitalist space through a thoughtless real estate frenzy and\ncomplex land games. Walking through the streets of Poblenou, one is forced to\nthink of the work of Henri Lefebvre on the production of space and the three\norders of understanding the design of an urban composition. Here, the city has\nbecome a stake and the place of economic growth based on innovation. Finally,\nneighborhood life is in complete mutation which seems for this territory to\nleave a chance for a long time on the sidelines. We present an economic\nanalysis grid of a cluster with graphs and statistics.\n</p>",
