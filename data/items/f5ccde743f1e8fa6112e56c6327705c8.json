  "description": "<p>The wellness world can be overwhelming. There is so much advice out there, much of which is conflicting, that it is sometimes hard to know what to do or even who to believe. It can also affect our mental health, making us feel guilty if something that promises to “change your life forever” doesn’t work for us, or if we fail to do all 700 things we need to do each day to be healthy.
