  "title": "Mark Levin Midterm Election Special - Part Two",
  "description": "On this special podcast only edition of the Mark Levin Show, the FBI raided former President Donald Trump's house at Mar-a-Lago in a calculated political move that could affect the midterm elections and beyond.  It's no accident. It's no coincidence that this is right before the midterm election. They want to have not only a political impact on those elections, they want to have a legal impact on those elections. It's no accident and it's no coincidence that they act now in anticipation of Donald Trump, who appears to be poised to announce that he's going to run for president in the Republican primary.  Donald Trump stood up to the ruling class and what we have now is the revolt of the ruling class. Donald Trump has nothing to do with the ruling class. That's the Democrat party and much of the Republican party.  Particularly if you look at the leadership in the Senate, they hate Donald Trump more than they love America. The Democrats will retain the Senate and they claim there's no chance the Democrats will keep the house. Now, why is that? It's because the leadership in the Senate, it's not because of Donald Trump's quote unquote candidates, but that's the spin in the corrupt media because Mitch McConnell hasn't laid out a plan for his Republicans to run on the way the Republican leadership in the house has.  The Biden administration desperately seeks to put Donald Trump in jail. Desperately they've tried everything. They've tried everything like nothing before against any president or presidential candidate, they're punishing everybody and anybody who's close to him. But what this demonstrates is that you have to become more of an activist than ever before.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
