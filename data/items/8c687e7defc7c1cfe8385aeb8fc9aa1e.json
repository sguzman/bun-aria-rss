  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Ian Goldin | \nWe are at a crossroads. The wrecking-ball of COVID-19 has destroyed global norms. Many think that after the devastation there will be a bounce back. The event will explore Ian Goldin's latest book, Rescue: From Global Crisis to a Better World.\nIan Goldin believes that this crisis can create opportunities for change, just as the Second World War forged the ideas behind the Beveridge Report. Published in 1942, it was revolutionary and laid the foundations for the welfare state alongside a host of other social and economic reforms, changing the world for the better. Ian Goldin tackles the challenges and opportunities posed by the pandemic, ranging from globalisation to the future of jobs, income inequality and geopolitics, the climate crisis and the modern city. It is a fresh, bold call for an optimistic future and one we all have the power to create.\nMeet our speaker and chair\nIan Goldin (@ian_goldin) is the Oxford University Professor of Globalisation and Development and was the founding Director of the Oxford Martin School. Ian leads the Oxford Martin Programmes on Technological and Economic Change, Future of Work and Future of Development.
