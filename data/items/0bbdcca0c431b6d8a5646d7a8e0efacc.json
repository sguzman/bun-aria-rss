  "description": "<p>I've dealt with depression in my life. My body temperature also seems to run hot; in fact my wife Kate has nicknamed me \"the baked potato.\"</p>\n<p>My guest today says that there may be a connection between those two things. His name is Charles Raison, he's a psychiatrist, professor of psychiatry, and the co-author of <a href=\"https://amazon.com\"><em>The New Mind-Body Science of Depression</em></a>. We begin our conversation with why Charles thinks it's important to ask the question, \"Does Major Depression even exist?\" and what we do and don't know about what causes depression. We then turn to the emerging theory that physical inflammation may play a role in depression; Charles describes what inflammation is, and why the body may become inflamed and physically hotter not only in response to physical illness, but psychological stress as well. We then discuss the paradoxical finding that short-term exposure to inflammation in the form of exercise or sitting in a sauna can reduce long-term inflammation, and how hot you probably have to get in a sauna for it to have antidepressant effects. We also talk about how intermittent fasting may have a beneficial effect on inflammation, before turning to whether taking anti-inflammatory drugs could also help, and why you might want to get a blood test to see if your body's inflamed. We end our conversation with Charles' thoughts on how to figure out the right treatment for depression for each individual.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/inflammationdepression\">aom.is/inflammationdepression</a>.</p>\n",
