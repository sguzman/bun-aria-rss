  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Failure is a natural part of life, but we can learn how to make the most out of those inevitable failures. In this episode, John Maxwell asks why some people allow failure to build them up and others allow it to derail them. John offers four observations about how people view failure, as well as four alternatives that will allow us to maximize our misses.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Mark Cole shares how learning from failure has made him the man he is today, and provided the experience needed to lead at a higher level. Richard follows up with a reminder that we need to be intentional in thinking about failure, not only in the past, but also, in the future. Mark and Richard challenge us not to shy away from an opportunity because it has low odds. We may fail, but we can learn from that failure and turn it into tomorrow’s success.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Failure Is Not Final Worksheet.
