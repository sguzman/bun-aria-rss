  "description": "<p>This episode is a little different, Usually we record with hundreds of miles separating us, but this week, we take a rare opportunity to meet up and spend some time chatting about studio spaces, art careers and whatever else comes up. We drink tea, drive through London, and eat sugared chickpeas while we geek out about recording equipment, discuss the importance of resilience, and visit both of Alice's studios (old and new). During the visit to the new studio, we discuss Alice's newest paintings and share how it feels when your work moves into surprising new territory.</p>\n<p>You can watch the accompanying short video on YouTube and get a sneak peek at Alice's new work HERE: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TchzUtqwUaM\"><strong>https://youtu.be/TchzUtqwUaM</strong></a></p>\n<p>And also see images of the lighting products and paintings at each of our websites:<br>\n<a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artjuice59/\">https://alicesheridan.com/artjuice60/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Surrey Contemporary Art Fair 13-15th March 2020<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://contemporaryartfairs.co.uk/surrey-spring/\"><u><strong>https://contemporaryartfairs.co.uk/surrey-spring/</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><strong>Royal Watercolour Society 6-18th March 2020<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.royalwatercoloursociety.co.uk/exhibitions/36-rws-contemporary-watercolour-competition/overview/\"><u><strong>https://www.royalwatercoloursociety.co.uk/exhibitions/36-rws-contemporary-watercolour-competition/overview/</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><strong>Lighting products discussed:<br>\n</strong>Simple ring light and phone holder for livestreams <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Velouer-3-Light-Brightness-Adjustment-Facebook/dp/B075155F8S/ref=sr_1_19?crid=3KF4V12J548E5&keywords=ring%2Blight%2Bphone%2Bholder&qid=1583753345&sprefix=ring%2Blight%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-19&th=1 \">HERE</a><strong><br>\n</strong>Arm clamps for phone and ring light <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07W1X4MMP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">HERE</a><br>\nDay Light Umbrella Continuous Lighting Kit <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Photography-Lighting-Portrait-Umbrella-Continuous/dp/B07YHC5FQX/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2RT8W24Z1YBXA&keywords=umbrella+photography+light&qid=1583753495&sprefix=umbrella+photo%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-7\">HERE</a><br>\nLED lights <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07ZVC3YWP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">HERE</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em><strong><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://contemporaryartfairs.co.uk/surrey-spring/\"><strong><br>\n</strong></a></p>\n",
