  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys call Mitt to check in on him on his vacation and to no one's surprise, he picks up the phone from a local booze joint in Colorado. Bill also strategically places a few packs of Pokemon cards around the studio, the guys chat more about what they're currently watching, and dive into a loaded Pod FOD that includes questions about McConaughey running for office in Texas, what the easiest breakfast food is to eliminate when setting up the ultimate breakfast spread, the guys discuss a big giveaway they're doing for The Pod Youtube (search \"The Pod\" on Youtube to subscribe), plus Nick cooks up a special Maraldo's Mad Lib for March Madness being right around the corner. Make sure you send in submissions to The Pod FOD @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram and subscribe to the Youtube as we continue to try and grow the channel. We appreciate you all for listening, have a fantastic weekend, we'll see you on Wednesday.</p>\n",
