  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #41</strong>, my guest is artist, photographer, life coach, and mentor <strong>Andrea Scher</strong>, the creator of <strong>Superhero Life</strong> — <em>\"where we all learn together to use our voices, share our superpowers and live life in full color.\"</em><br /><br /><strong>Andrea</strong> joins me for a great conversation about her work as a creative, coach, and healer; her Mondo Beyondo talk at WDS 2011 that helped inspire my first podcast (<strong>Radio Enso</strong>); her creative practices and classes, and much, much more!<br /><br />About: I’m <strong>Andrea Scher</strong>, creator of <strong>Superhero Life</strong> — where we all learn together to use our voices, share our superpowers and live life in full color. As an artist, photographer, life coach + mentor, I’m redefining what it means to be a SUPERHERO — ‘cause in my world, it’s got nothing to do with capes, spandex or sidekicks and everything to do with tenderness, intuition & baby steps of bravery.<br /><br />Back in 1995 when I was living in New Orleans, a tarot card reader told me that I was an artist. At the time, I held an oh-so practical degree in Economics, and rarely shared my passion for painting + photography with anyone. (But then, you can’t fool a good psychic.)<br /><br />She also said that my real work was as a healer — that I would heal people through my art. All of the hairs on my arms pricked up. All I could think was: Yes! Yes! But how? I never forgot that wise woman <em>(she is still my spiritual advisor to this day)</em> or that quiet promise I made to myself — to fulfill my true calling, and be a healing force in the world.<br /><br />But first, I had to start with myself. I began painting every day.<br /><br />I began painting . . . to find freedom + flexibility. To find the joy in the mess. To keep myself feeling engaged and alive and curious — not necessarily to save the world, but simply to fully experience it.<br /><br />But that’s the beauty of doing what we love — we delight ourselves first, and we can’t help but serve others in the process.<br /><br />To me, a <strong>Superhero</strong> is someone who invites her wisest, bravest, most alive self to come out and play, every day.<br /><br />This doesn’t mean having all the answers, being unshakably strong, or performing dramatic feats of heroism.It means being someone like you – and someone like me.<br /><br />Someone who is anxious and uncertain, oh, say, 50 – 80% of the time. Someone who wants to live a juicy, full, courageous life — but doesn’t always know how. Someone who understands that vulnerability just might be the greatest superpower of all.<br /><br />“To me, a <strong>Superhero</strong> is someone who invites her wisest, bravest, most alive self to come out and play, every day.\"<br /><br /><strong>Superhero Life</strong> is a love letter + resourceful playground for all my fellow creative superheroes. Moms who want to paint. Painters who want to write. Writers who want to travel. And travelers who want to come home.<br /><br />I’ve been writing + teaching online for nearly 10 years — back when the web was a much quieter place. My intention is to make <strong>Superhero Life</strong> feel like a virtual oasis — a space for unhurried healing, beauty, and joy to unfold.<br /><br />To learn more about <strong>Andrea</strong> and her work: <a href=\"http://superherolife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://superherolife.com/</a>.</p>",
