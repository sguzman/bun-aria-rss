Twenty years later, they've sold over 17 million records worldwide. In this episode, we'll get a view inside their 2012 song \"Felt\" from the album \"Not Your Kind of People.\" Butch Vig, who is also a legendary producer behind some of the most influential albums of all time like Nevermind by Nirvana, Siamese Dream by Smashing Pumpkins, Dirty by Sonic Youth, and countless others, spoke to me from his home studio in Los Angeles. I also interviewed Shirley Manson separately to get her insight on how the song was made. Plus some thoughts from their longtime engineer and now co-producer Billy Bush.</p>",
