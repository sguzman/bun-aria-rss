  "link": "https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/",
  "description": "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)\n(00:04:46) New: Huberman Lab Premium\n(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety\n(00:10:08) Levels, Thesis, InsideTracker\n(00:14:01) Momentous Supplements\n(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD\n(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects\n(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains\n(00:30:41) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)\n(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence\n(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function\n(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis\n(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia\n(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage\n(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects\n(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine\n(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?\n(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns\n(01:46:46) Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin\n(01:56:55) Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility\n(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences\n(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development\n(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance\n(02:25:57) Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis\n(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders\n(02:41:44) Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis\n(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
