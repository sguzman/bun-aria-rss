  "description": "<p>Rory & Mal start off recapping their week, including the NRM team holiday dinner, where the executive producer of More Sauce shamelessly admitted to being a serial killer aka sleeping with socks on. They then address the war on Christmas, men getting horrible Christmas gifts, and why we have no recent classic holiday movies. Jussie Smollett was found guilty on his fall report charges for lying his ass off, and that, of course, led to jokes. A bunch of random discussions happen in the middle of this episode - Rory gives advice on the worst places to propose, Mal admits to having a weed dealing hippie fetish, and we finally hear from one of our KanyexYe ticket winners. The guys also discuss new music, Hitman Holla’s close friends + more!</p>\n",
