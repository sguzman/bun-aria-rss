  "description": "Time-out. Dinner without dessert. No screen time. If you’re like most parents, you’ve reached your wit’s end and threatened your kid with one (or all!) of these consequences. Then the next day… they’re back to throwing blocks. How many times do you have to yell, “If you throw that block one more time, no ______!” What if we told you there was a better way? In this week’s episode, Dr. Becky explores the problem with consequences and how you can parent much more effectively without them. Don’t worry: This doesn’t mean letting your kid “get away” with challenging or dangerous behavior. It means embodying your authority, connecting to your child, and teaching them the life-long skills they need to manage big feelings. If you love the Good Inside approach *and* struggle with the idea of no consequences, one thing is true: This episode is for you. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be, at goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n<p/>\n",
