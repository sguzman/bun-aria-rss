  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, if you are vaccinated, you are immune – go live your life! Vaccines provide immunity from the virus so that people can finally live a normal life. The CDC has announced that vaccinated individuals don't need to wear masks outdoors and President Biden wore his mask while walking up to the outdoor podium to announce this. Democrats like Anthony Fauci have resisted \"the science\" around outdoor mask-wearing from the very beginning. Then, American Marxism is the title of Mark's new book and Levinites need to make sure they pre-order it before big tech censors try and limit access to it. American Marxists are taking America down a dark road and this book will arm patriots with what they can do to stop it.  Afterward, why doesn't Black Lives Matter invest in African American communities? Black and Latino business owners are emotionally distraught over the mayhem brought by BLM and American Marxists on the businesses and neighborhoods. Colleges are no longer bastions of free speech and academic freedom, they're like the old Soviet Union where only one ideology can be espoused. Finally, Ian Prior calls in to discuss his fight against school boards who are teaching our children critical race theory.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
