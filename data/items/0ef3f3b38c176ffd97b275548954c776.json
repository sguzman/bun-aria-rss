  "description": "<p>We’re pumped to talk with entrepreneur extraordinaire Codie Sanchez today. And while Codie is busy buying businesses today, the truth is, it took her a while to get there. Years ago, right out of college, Codie was working 70-hour weeks for a paycheck. And even though she had a great education and an elite job, she felt like her life was out of control. Who cares about prestigious job titles when somebody else controls your day to day?! Now, things are different: Codie is financially independent, she owns 26 small businesses, and she’s the founder and CEO of Contrarian Thinking- where she’s on a mission to free the minds of individuals who are hanging onto traditional careers, as well as the common narrative of what it means to be successful. And oftentimes this can be accomplished via buying existing businesses- which is more feasible than you might think! Listen as we discuss life as a second generation immigrant, why Codie believes we’re in a golden era of acquiring others businesses, ways to go about finding a business to buy, her views on passive income, what it means to utilize your ‘unfair advantage’, when she’d consider selling a business, and much more!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Want more How To Money in your life?
