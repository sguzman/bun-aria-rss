Lawrence.\n\n'It is a reminder that you need to be your true self in order to find fulfilment in life – and love, and that you also need to show wonder, mellowness and warmth.'\n\nMary Anne visited The Poetry Exchange at Greyfriars' Chapel in Canterbury as part of Wise Words Festival in September 2015. We’re very grateful to Wise Words Festival and Workers of Art for hosting and supporting The Poetry Exchange. Do visit them for further inspiration and beautiful encounters with poetry.\n\nhttp://www.wisewordsfestival.co.uk\nhttp://www.workers-of-art.co.uk\n\nMary Anne is in conversation with The Poetry Exchange team members Fiona Lesley Bennett and Michael Shaeffer.\n\n'I Am Like A Rose' is read by Fiona Bennet.\n\n*****\n\nI Am Like A Rose by D. H. Lawrence\n\nI am myself at last; now I achieve\nMy very self. I, with the wonder mellow,\nFull of fine warmth, I issue forth in clear\nAnd single me, perfected from my fellow.\n\nHere I am all myself. No rose-bush heaving\nIts limpid sap to culmination, has brought\nItself more sheer and naked out of the green\nIn stark-clear roses, than I to myself am brought.",
