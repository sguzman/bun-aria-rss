  "description": "As the capper to our 2019 Charity Bowl, we headed up to Ann Arbor for a live show on the most sensible day to stay inside possible: the summer solstice, with amazing weather. And because this was a Michigan show, we had to do Michigan things, like:\n- War trivia\n- Auditing the business departments of the Big Ten\n- War fan fiction\n- Explaining how all of football owes its existence to Michigan\n- Generally feeling superior to Michigan State in all things\nSpecial thanks to the Ann Arbor District Library and the squad at MGoBlog helping make this show possible.
