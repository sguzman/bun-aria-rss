  "description": "<p><em>“At a certain point, the outcome is the opportunity. We have to focus on the bottom line: what is it going to take to get kids ready?”</em> — Colin Seale</p> <p>Today it’s great to have Colin Seale on the podcast. Colin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York to a single mother and an incarcerated father. He has always had a passion for educational equity. Tracked early into gifted and talented programs, Colin was afforded opportunities his neighborhood peers were not. He founded thinkLaw (<a href=\"http://www.thinklaw.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.thinkLaw.us</a>), an award-winning organization to help educators leverage inquiry-based instructional strategies to close the critical thinking gap and ensure they teach and REACH all students, regardless of race, zipcode or what side of the poverty line they are born into. When he’s not serving as the world’s most fervent critical thinking advocate, Colin proudly serves as the world’s greatest entertainer to his two little kiddos and a loving husband to his wife Carrie.</p> <p>In this episode we discuss:</p> <ul> <li>Colin’s pragmatic approach to solving educational inequalities</li> <li>The main goals of ThinkLaw</li> <li>The benefit of people of different races talking about their common humanity</li> <li>How we can have high expectations for every child</li> <li>The twice exceptional movement</li> <li>How we continuously lead genius on the table</li> <li>The excellence gap in gifted education</li> <li>Equality of opportunity vs. equality of outcome</li> <li>The right kind of love</li> <li>How the victory is in the struggle</li> <li>Giving children a reason to have grit</li> <li>Why we need to recognize disruptors as innovators</li> <li>Creating the space for divergent thinkers</li> </ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support\">https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</a></p>\n",
