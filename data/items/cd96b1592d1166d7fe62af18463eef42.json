  "description": "I have a serious message in today’s podcast: Prepare for a tough 2022 in the stock market. In just the past week, we’ve seen wild swings in the markets over Omicron concerns, surging inflation, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell changing his tune on whether inflation is transitory. [0:40] The bottom line is that the “Goldilocks” conditions for a bull market—record low interest rates and trillions in government stimulus—are over. We’re in unprecedented times… and the only choice the Fed has to fight inflation is going to result in a bumpy ride for stocks. [5:40] We’re already seeing volatility around the expectation of rising interest rates. I highlight many stocks well off their highs.... and why you should expect more volatility going forward. [8:00] Next, I explain why the Fed’s money printing tactics were successful during the 2008-2009 financial crisis... and why that playbook won’t work this time. [12:10]  It’s not all doom and gloom, though. I share some sectors and stocks that will continue to do well as we learn to live with the coronavirus and its variants. [15:35] My advice is to be careful and look to protect yourself. And one of the best ways to do that is with our  newsletter, edited by Genia Turanova. Her recommended hedges can save a portfolio during a downturn. [18:18] In addition to hedging, you want to own quality stocks… especially those in massive growth trends.  members will learn all about an exciting new trend—and my favorite way to play it—in tomorrow's issue. [23:00] Turning to questions…  After a terrible quarter, a listener wants to know if I think DocuSign (DOCU) is a buy... along with my take on gold stocks. [25:05] Speaking of gold... Do investors have to choose between gold or cryptocurrencies? [29:00] Enjoyed this episode?
