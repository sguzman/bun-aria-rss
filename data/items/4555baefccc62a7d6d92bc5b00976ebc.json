  "description": "Brandon Mills is the author of The World Colonization Made: The Racial Geography of Early American Empire, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2020. The World Colonization Made explores the beginnings and ends of the colonization movement from the late-18th century to the coming of the Civil War. Mills uses African colonization to explore how ideas of American empire developed during the country’s formative years. From politics to racial ideology, Mills is able to chart a clear history of what the colonization movement in America meant for a diverse group of people in the United States, and how this vision ultimately could not create a nation many hoped it would.\nBrandon Mills teaches in the Department of History at the University of Colorado Denver. \n Derek Litvak is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland—College Park. His dissertation, \"The Specter of Black Citizens: Race, Slavery, and Citizenship in the Early United States,\" examines how citizenship was used to both bolster the institution of slavery and exclude Black Americans from the body politic.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
