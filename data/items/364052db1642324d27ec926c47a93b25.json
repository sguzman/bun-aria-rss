  "description": "Our audiobook this week is SMOLDER by USA Today Bestselling Author Aly Martinez! \n\n\n\nNarrated by Andi Arndt & Romualdo Palacios \n\n\n\nMateo Rodriguez was something of an anomaly. The majority of the world viewed him as a ruthless criminal with no respect for life or law. However, the man I knew was gentle and caring, catering to my every desire.\n\n\n\nHe would have been the perfect man, if only he would have left his life of crime behind and\n\n\n\nchosen me.\n\n\n\nSo there we were—for five years—in love and at a stalemate.\n\n\n\nWhen three armed men dragged me out of my bed in the middle of the night, I realized just how right I’d been to fear his lifestyle.\n\n\n\nOr, maybe I’d been wrong. Because Mateo was the only man powerful enough to save me.\n\n\n\nSINGE by Aly Martinez (Guardian Protection #1) (99 cents/KU!): https://amzn.to/2Y2yML5\n\n\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT LIES by Aly Martinez: https://amzn.to/2Y5Wy9j\n\n\n\nAly Martinez Website: https://alymartinez.com\n\n\n\nAly Martinez GC + Signed Book Giveaway! http://readmeromance.com/books/alymartinez/\n\n\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\n\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\n\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\n\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\n\n\nPodcast CreditsRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
