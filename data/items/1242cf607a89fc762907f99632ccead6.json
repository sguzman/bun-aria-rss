  "description": "<p>Duncan Davidson and Greg Koenig joined forces a few years back to start <a href=\"http://luma-labs.com/\">Luma Labs</a>, a firm that makes across-the-chest camera straps. The two collaborated first on Luma Loop, a free-sliding camera strap, and then created Cinch, one that holds a camera tighter but still allows for movement. The Loop was kaboshed by a potential patent lawsuit; the second model has been a good seller, but with volume comes decisions about ramping up production. In this episode, we discuss all that, how they developed the original Cinch and Cinch 2 (about to be released), and quite a bit about rapid prototyping.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, find them at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lumalabs\">@lumalabs</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duncan\">@duncan</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gak_pdx\">@gak_pdx</a> (Greg)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://panic.com/newdisruptors\">Status Board from Panic.</a> Beautiful data for everybody.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://squarespace.com/newdisruptors\">Squarespace</a>: Everything you need to build exceptional websites!</p>\n\n\n",
