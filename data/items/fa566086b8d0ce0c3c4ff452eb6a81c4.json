  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, Mr. call screener, Rich Valdes fills in. President Trump stepped up and stopped his successful career to help America and stop the swamp. But what are we doing to stop the swamp? The progressive left have hijacked our government and the media and we need to win the war on intellectual honesty. We need to become active and rise up a new generation of patriots, instead of the socialists that Bernie Sanders has been mentoring. Also, the democrats have been using minorities to push their own agendas for decades. Latinos are a huge voting block but by not assimilating fully they are not allowing themselves to live up to the full American dream. By not learning the language and culture they are financially setting themselves back.  Later, as Mark Levin has said, the FISA Courts should be abolished if they’re no longer acting in the best interest of the American people. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
