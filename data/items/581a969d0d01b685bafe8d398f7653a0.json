  "description": "<p>Hello Legends! Here we go again, as we do every week—with another fantastic guest! This week is the King of the Nipple Ring himself, Ian Fidance! We don’t actually know if Ian has any nipple rings, but he has the aura of a person who is more than meets the eye. He’s a favorite all across NYC, and he’s a regular opener for Dave Attel. This episode is like your fitbit sleep chart. It starts off light, then gets deep, then jumps up into crazy, then light, deep, and crazy all over again. Here are five words to describe this episode: be careful befriending while drunk.</p>",
