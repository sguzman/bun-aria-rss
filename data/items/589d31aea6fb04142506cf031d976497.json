  "description": "<p>Today Kirk and Steve mix it up with a little birch fire on the Netflix. Brandi Love, having canoodled with other Barstool Sports shows and unfollowed Kirk on Twitter, is no longer the MILF-in-Chief of the Kirk Minihane Show, so Kirk is looking for new porn star submissions. Get cracking, Minifans. Tom Cruise lampoons production employees working on the latest Mission Impossible movie for failing to adhere to COVID-19 safety guidelines. The KMS fill-in producer comes up with an incredible idea for the secret project (0:33:15). Greg Hill, the guy who saved WEEI's ratings from Mut & Callahan, gets credit for a hard-nosed interview with Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
