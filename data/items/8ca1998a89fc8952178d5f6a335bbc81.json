  "description": "<p>Dr. Julie Holland is a psychiatrist and psychopharmacologist who has written and edited many outstanding books about drugs, including most recently Good Chemistry: The Science of Connection, from Soul to Psychedelics. Julie and I teamed up last year to answer questions submitted by Psychoactive listeners. We enjoyed it so much, and the feedback was so positive, that we decided to do it again. This time the questions involved the safety of GHB, marijuana dependence, the relationship between drugs and mental illness, and the future of drug wars and drug policies. Julie is a long-time believer in the potential of psychoactive experiences to open our worlds and heal our minds but she’s also keenly sensitive to the risks entailed.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
