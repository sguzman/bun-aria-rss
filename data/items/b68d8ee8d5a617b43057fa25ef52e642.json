  "description": "It is widely understood that the mind-body connection is important, but did you know that it has the power to change your life? In this podcast (one of my personal favorites!) I speak to the incredible “Iceman” Wim Hof about the incredible capacity we all have to control our thinking and change our biology, overcome toxic stress and stay strong amidst major crises like the current pandemic. \n \nWim Hof got his nickname by breaking a number of records related to cold exposure. His feats include climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts, running a half marathon above the Arctic Circle on his bare feet, and standing in a container while covered with ice cubes for more than 112 minutes!  Having embraced the majestic force of nature, Wim became convinced that everyone can tap into this potential without having to invest the same decades worth of study, travel and daring, so he developed the Wim Hof Method: a natural path to an optimal state of body and mind. \n \nPodcast Highlights & Time Stamps\n6:20 Why we are easily overcome with fear and stress\n9:10 Why we have got so lazy with our thinking. \n10:13 Wim’s incredible story\n16:00 We can make our brains bodies happier, healthier and stronger through our mind.  \n20:30 How did Wim Hof develop his method?\n24:31 Tips to deal with crises like COVID-19 2\n7:45 What is the Wim Hof method?\n46:34 Finding peace in the eye of the storm\n50:00 How to heal a broken heart \n55:00 The “super brain” study \n1:05:00 The power of mind management \n1:11:25 Nature or nurture?\n \nRead the podcast blog and transcript here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/interview-with-wim-hof-on-how-to-train-your-mind-to-overcome-any-challenge-the-amazing-benefits-of-cold-showers-amp-how-to-use-your-breathe-to-reduce-anxiety-and-stress\n \n \nWim's website: www.wimhofmethod.com \n \nGet access to Wim's Fundamental Course at a discount here: https://www.wimhofmethod.com/elearning/fundamentals\n \nThe Science of Wim Hof method: www.wimhofmethod.com/science \n \n \nSpecial offers from this week's sponsor:\n \n-Blinkist  (my favorite reading app!): To get your free week on Blinkist AND 25% off your subscription see: https://www.blinkist.com/nc/partners/cleaning-up-the-mental-mess \n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \n-Get my new brain detox app SWITCH on sale now!
