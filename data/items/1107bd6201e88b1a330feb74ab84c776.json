  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Holzer's Ghosts The Devil in Texas The Haunting of Lydia Bell with guest Rev. Bill Bean</p>\n\n<p>Dave is joined by special guest, exorcist, Rev. Bill Bean to discuss a terrifying case that ended in tragedy over 50 years ago despite the attempts of Dr. Hans Holzer to help the family afflicted with oppression and possession.</p>\n\n<p>The Holzer Files Team is disturbed at how closely the case mirrors a modern day case. A single mother and her two sons, under attack by an unseen force. The team realizes they may be in over their heads and they call out the big guns, Rev. Bill Bean. Dave and Bill discuss the two cases featured in Season 1, Episode 4, The Devil in Texas and try to separate Hollywood fiction from horrific reality of demonic influence and possession and what we can do to protect ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Visit Bills site here: <a href=\"http://spiritualwarriorbillbean\">http://spiritualwarriorbillbean</a> </p>\n",
