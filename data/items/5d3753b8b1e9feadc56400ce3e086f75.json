Through worked examples of both solar power and wind power systems, we will consider early-stage design - where the primary focus is on aspects such as system architecture, longer-term power production, and trade-studies, through to more detailed design - where the primary focus is on specific technology characteristics, energy management, and control. These considerations support design exploration and design rigor, meaning you can navigate the technology development cycle rapidly and with confidence.</p> <p><strong>Speakers</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Graham Dudgeon, MEng, PhD</strong>, <em>Principal Technologist </em>â€“ <em>Electrical Systems, MathWorks</em></p> <ul> <li>Graham Dudgeon is principal technologist for electrical technology at MathWorks.
