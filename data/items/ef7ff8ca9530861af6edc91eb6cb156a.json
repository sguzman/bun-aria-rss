  "description": "<p>Richard Sherman reacts to the San Francisco 49ers' loss to Russell Wilson's Denver Broncos on Sunday Night Football. What did he make of Jimmy Garoppolo's performance and him running out of the endzone for a safety? Richard also discusses Dallas Cowboys' win over the New York Giants on Monday Night Football. Is there a QB controversy now between Dak Prescott & Cooper Rush? And who's the Cowboy's top running back: Ezekiel Elliott or Tony Pollard?

They talk about if Tom Brady's personal life is impacting him on the field, how Hurricane Ian is impacting the team, and they preview the Bucs matchup on Sunday Night Football vs Patrick Mahomes & the Kansas City Chiefs who no longer have WR Tyreek Hill terrorizing defenses. #volume #herd #ColinCowherd</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
