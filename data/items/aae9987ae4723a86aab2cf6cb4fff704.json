  "description": "Alaina pulls at our heartstrings this week with part one of the Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders. In June of 1977, eight year old Lori Lee Farmer, nine year old Michelle Heather Guse and ten year old Doris Denise Milner headed off to Camp Scott for a two week girl scout experience. Unfortunately someone, or potentially multiple someones, had been lurking around the camp in the weeks leading up to night one. Whoever it was had more than sinister plans to kill the three girl scouts camping out in tent one. In Part One we’ll go over who each girl was, the night of the murders and we’ll end it on a pretty convincing suspect. Don’t bet too heavy on him though, in part two Alaina will bring some evidence to the table pointing away from who we thought was our lead suspect. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors!\n<br>\n\nPurple: Go to Purple dot com slash MORBID10, and use promo code MORBID10.
