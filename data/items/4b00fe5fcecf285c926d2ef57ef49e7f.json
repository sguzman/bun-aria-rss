  "title": "Travis Walton - 291",
  "description": "<p>November 5th, 1975. Heber, Arizona. On their way back to the town of Snowlfake, a logging crew of seven men see a strange sight in the sky. Mike Rogers, who hired the other six men, stopped the truck. Travis Walton, who had been sitting up front, jumped out and moved towards what appeared to be an alien craft. A blue-green beam shot out of the craft and into Travis and was thrown backward ten feet. The men in the truck did not wait around to see what would happen next. Mike drove the truck a number of miles before stopping again. They needed to report the incident to law enforcement but they waited a bit before speaking about the 'ufo'. As the days went on and search parties failed to locate Travis, people started to wonder. Had the missing man been the victim of foul play? Was he taken by aliens? Or was this a hoax for fifteen minutes of fame and some cash? Special thanks to Nic of True Crime Garage for joining me to discuss this famous alien abduction case.
