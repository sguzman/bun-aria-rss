For a hint about American attitudes toward the conflict, we look to a fresh<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/25/ukraine-poll-post-abc/\"> Washington Post-ABC poll</a> that found that two-thirds of Americans support imposing economic sanctions on Russia for its actions. About half say they would support sanctions even if they result in higher energy prices in the United States.
