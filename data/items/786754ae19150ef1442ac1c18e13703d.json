  "description": "n this episode Massimo and Julia ask, \"Is the fundamental nature of the world knowable by science alone?\", looking at the issue through the lenses of a series of related philosophical positions: determinism, reductionism, physicalism, and naturalism. All of those \"isms\" take a stance on the question of whether there are objectively \"correct\" ways to interpret scientific facts -- like physical laws, or causality -- and if so, how do we decide what the correct interpretation is? Along the way, Massimo and Julia debate the nature of emergent properties, whether math is discovered or invented, and whether it's even logically possible for \"supernatural\" things to exist.",
