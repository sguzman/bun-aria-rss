  "description": "The story of a few violent, zombie-filled Christmases from Norse legend. There are two creatures this week! The first is the gloso! A friendly little piggy who will stop by to say hi. Except if you forget her Christmas gift. Then she turns into a demon of the night with glowing red eyes. The other is the nisse, a gnome will merely beat you senseless for forgetting his gift. Basically just remember to get gifts for all the mythological creatures on your list. Music: \"Anxiety\" by Kai Engel \"Floret\" by Kai Engel \"Delicant\" by Podington Bear \"Morels\" by Podington Bear \"Sorrento\" by Podington Bear \"Steps\" by Podington Bear \"Storm Passing\" by Podington Bear<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
