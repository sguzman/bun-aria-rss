You identify so closely with us that anytime we’re mistreated, You take it personally. Thank You for working justice on those who have opposed and oppressed Your people. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have mercy on me, a sinner. We repent of our sins and turn to You and we ask You to make our hearts clean. Like Edom, we have been passive—standing by idly while people acted unjustly. We’ve been arrogant and selfish, and we repent. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Would You inspire us to action? Show us what it looks like to care for the oppressed, to not use someone’s weakness against them, and to pursue righteousness even when it comes to those we consider to be our enemies. Use us to do Your will today.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We surrender our lives to You, Lord—every moment of our day, each decision we make, we yield our will and way to Your perfect will and way. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We love You too.
