  "description": "In the latest Deep State Radio our friends Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of IISS and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council offer secrets into how they remain so well-informed.  It all turns on fiction, apparently and those who remember what they read last will tell you what it was.  Then we turn to Trump, Italy's new prime minister, a whole slew of lies and misstatements from Trump and the gripping prospect of a US-Italy strategic alliance which should come in handy should elephants ever start coming over the Alps again.  Oh, and the decline of the West, again.  But from a new perspective.  What a great accompaniment for a summer barbecue.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
