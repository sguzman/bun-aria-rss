  "description": "Hello, I am your host Aun Abdi and welcome to the monthly One Minute Book Review podcast, where I break down in more detail the books that I have read and reviewed in the previous month. \n\nI have done something different for this month's recap episode. I didn't have the opportunity to record for October, so I have decided to combine both October and November for a longer extended podcast. This month's podcast will include six books of varying categories of which I hope to inspire you to read some of them. Those books are: 'How to Write Your Book Without A Fuss' by Lucy McCarragher and Joe Gregory; 'Letters From A Stoic' by Seneca; 'Small Giants' by Bo Burlingham; 'Start Now, Get Perfect Later' by Rob Moore; 'The Courage To Be Disliked' by Ichiro Kishimi and lastly 'Financial Intelligence' by Karen Berman and Joe Gregory.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
