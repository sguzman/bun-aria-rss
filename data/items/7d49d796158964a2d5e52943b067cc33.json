  "description": "<p><p>On this week's edition of Zero Blog 30, Chaps and Cons discuss the reaction to Pittsburgh Steelers OT Alejandro Villanueva standing for the national anthem while the rest of the team remained in the locker room. Alejandro comes on the show to talk about his journey from Afghanistan as an Army Ranger, to the gridiron as one of the premiere left tackles in the NFL. We also congratulate the first female Marine infantry officer and talk about how President Trump has made it basically impossible for Barstool to \"stick to sports.\" All this on a SPICY edition of ZBT!</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
