Since that time, my Late 2008 MacBook Pro continued to work flawlessly, most of the time keeping up with the scientific programming I would do in R, Python or Julia.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems near impossible (if not completely impossible) to get an OEM A1281 battery as a drop-in replacement. When I went to the Apple Store at Suburban Square, PA, the “Genius” that looked at my computer took 15-20 minutes to look on the Apple website (which I obviously did before arriving, so no value-add there), only to show me a battery in stock that didn’t fit my model of computer. Only after shaming him into looking up the actual part number, was he able to utter the phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oh, no, we don’t have those any more. Your model MacBook Pro was declared “Vintage”. No more original parts are available from Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Of course</em> it is. After getting home, I was able to find this <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\">service bulletin</a> from Apple, which outlines which models are obsolete. Apparently, it’s a hard and fast rule that once five years from the end of manufacturing arrives, a model is declared vintage (unless local laws require longer service). So even though the only “problem” with my MacBook Pro is that I was only getting one hour of battery life per charge (or less if I’m compiling code), the computer is destined for a new life somewhere else.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vintage-for-me-powerful-for-thee\">“Vintage” For Me, Powerful For Thee</h3>\n\n<p>While I realize I could go the 3rd-party route and get a replacement battery, at some point, you can only spend so much money keeping older technology alive. Since I use computers pretty intensively, I ended up getting a “new” (used) 2011 MacBook Pro from a neighborhood listing that has decent life on the OEM battery. Surprisingly, I was able to get $360 for my Late-2008 MacBook Pro, being fully honest about the condition, issues and battery life. The older woman who I sold it to fully understood, but worked at a desk and didn’t care about the battery! She also said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is easily the most powerful computer I’ve ever owned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple, like I said in my original post, you’ve got a customer for life. And while I’ve moved on to a newer machine, it’s beyond amazing to me that a 7-year old computer will continue to live on and work at a high level of performance. And with my 2011 MacBook Pro, I still have the option to upgrade the parts (though I don’t need to…SSD, 16GB of RAM and a quad-core i7 processor already!)</p>\n\n<p>The Retina MacBook’s are nice, but very incremental. Here’s hoping the 2011 MacBook Pro lasts as long as my Late 2008 MacBook Pro did!</p>"
