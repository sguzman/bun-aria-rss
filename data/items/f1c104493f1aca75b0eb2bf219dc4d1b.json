  "itunes:summary": "At the age of eighteen I set out to read the entire New Testament in order to disprove Christianity. As I read, I was surprised to find that I became convinced that it was true. The last thing that I wanted to do was to ‘become a Christian’. I thought that would ruin my life and make it boring by stopping me having any fun. Yet, knowing in my heart that it was true, I felt I had no option but to say ‘yes’ to Jesus.\nThe moment I did so– to use the words that C.S. Lewis chose to describe his own experience of encountering Jesus – I was ‘surprised by joy’. Ever since, Jesus has never ceased to surprise me.\nGod is the God of surprises. Jesus constantly surprised his followers and he wants to continue to surprise you.",
