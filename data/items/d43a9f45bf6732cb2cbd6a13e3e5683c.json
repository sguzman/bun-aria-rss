  "description": "<p>The ketogenic diet is generating a lot of buzz these days. Headlines often refer to it as a fad, Atkins 2.0, and even warn of its potential issues long-term. But let's all remember this important fact: there isn’t one perfect diet suited for all humans. From bio-individuality to lifestyle differences, we all operate a little differently.</p> <p>If done correctly, the ketogenic diet can be a powerful tool for burning fat, finding mental clarity, and improving digestion. To better understand the basic mechanisms of how keto works, today I’m bringing you one of the most qualified experts I know—Drew Manning. Drew is a NY Times bestselling author and outstanding coach who has done the research, written an awesome book about keto, and (most importantly) he walks his talk.</p> <p>His new book, Complete Keto, is much more than your average cookbook.
