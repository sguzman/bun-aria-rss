  "description": "In the third episode of our investigative series based on an extensive array of internal Facebook documents, we look at a persistent problem on the platform: human trafficking. WSJ's Justin Scheck describes documents showing that Facebook has closely studied how human traffickers use the platform to ensnare victims and advertise illegal sex services. The documents also show Facebook's response to these findings, which is often inadequate or nothing at all. We also hear from Patricia Wanja Kimani, a Kenyan woman who was trafficked to Saudi Arabia after responding to a job post on Facebook.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
