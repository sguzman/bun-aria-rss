    "media:description": "Do Sage Grouse Taste Like Sage Bush? The Sage grouse is a very special game bird. I wanted to find out if the rumors are true about it tasting awful so I drove over 1000 miles round trip to hunt this special bird. I was not disappointed. In this video we cook an amazing recipe inspired by Hank Shaw's wild game cook book - Pheasant Quail Cottontail.\nYou can purchase the Pheasant-Quail-Cottontail small game cookbook through my Online Affiliate Store: https://amzn.to/3rX7NBW\n(As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.)",
