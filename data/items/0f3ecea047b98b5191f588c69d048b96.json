  "description": "<p><b>Joseph and his friends officially organized the Church on April 6, 1830,  in the Whitmer home. Hank, John, and Dr. Watkins return to discuss the importance of record-keeping in the early Church, the reality of the Lord bringing the Saints along gradually, and how the Prophet grows in understanding for what the Lord has in mind for His people. We, along with Joseph, learn to put aside our prejudices and preconceived notions to help the Lord establish His baptism, his covenants, and His Church.</b></p><p><br/><br/></p>",
