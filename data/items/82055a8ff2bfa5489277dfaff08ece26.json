We get more in depth sharing stories from our vacations that we didn’t get to on the air. Eddie shares that his vacation was actually more exhausting than it was relaxing. We get an update from Raymundo’s blind item. We get into a big discussion about what is going on with our building and dealing with crazy construction.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
