    "media:description": "The story of nuclear power in the United Kingdom is one of bad economics and missed opportunities. \n\nThe British were a nuclear pioneer and their government saw civilian nuclear power as a way to diversify the country's energy mix. \n\nBut a series of bad technical decisions took the industry down the wrong path. Things got nasty.
