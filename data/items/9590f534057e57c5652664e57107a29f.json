  "description": "<p><p>Barstool drama swirls as Dave fights back against a non-existent Barstool Union, complete with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Donald Trump Jr. weighing in. Yahoo might be the worst company of all time. Adriana Chechick's teeth. Slut functionality. Do astronauts jerk off? Can you complain about loud neighbor sex? Who would you choose as a cellmete?

Pauly Shore discusses his Random Rants show, how social media has changed the landscape of comedy, and how he could've been a more dramatic actor.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
