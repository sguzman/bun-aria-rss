  "description": "After a four-year hiatus – and a name drop on a Beyoncé remix – musical polymath Santigold is back with a brand new album. Known for her signature blend of genre-defying songcraft, the artist’s fourth studio album Spirituals is one of her most artistically challenging projects yet.

On this episode of Switched On Pop, Santigold speaks about her new record, being a mother, and the emotions that went into making Spirituals. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
