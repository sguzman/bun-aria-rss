  "description": "<p>It's Episode 100 of the Straight Fire Podcast! On today's show, Jason explains why Cam Newton's benching on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills is the nail in the coffin for the former MVP's NFL career. Cam will be hard-pressed to find another starting gig next season after the way he played this season. On the flip side, Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll has turned quarterback Josh Allen into a star, and he could find himself as the next 'hot' name during the NFL Coaching Carousel this offseason. Finally, Jason tells us why the end of the Dwayne Haskins Saga in Washington could scare off some teams from drafting Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields next year. Haskins is just the latest OSU quarterback to flame out in the NFL and there are bound to be a few general managers who believe Fields is next in line. Plus, FS1 host Joy Taylor swings by to discuss what it's like working in sports media in the middle of a pandemic, why she doesn't think James Harden would be a great fit with the Miami Heat culture and why she expects the Heat to take a step back this season, why she believes the Brooklyn Nets are the team to beat in the Eastern Conference, why it's hard to compare this LeBron James-led Lakers team to the LeBron-led Heat team from back in the day, why she'd prefer if the Miami Dolphins just let Tua Tagovailoa fail than let Ryan Fitzpatrick come in late in game, why she believes it's important for networks and talent to embrace the growing popularity of streaming services, why she believes we could see an expanded College Football Playoff for the 2021 season, and much more!</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
