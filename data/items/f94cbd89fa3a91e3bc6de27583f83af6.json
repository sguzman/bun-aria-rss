  "description": "In today’s podcast we hear about how ISIS continues to pursue its strategy of using information operations to inspire lone wolves, and what investigators in France, Germany, and the United States are seeing as they look at jihadist social media. We learn about advances in facial recognition software. WikiLeaks releases audio files culled from DNC email hacks. More releases are expected, and evidence continues to point (circumstantially but substantially) toward Russian services as the hackers. Trump suggests Russian intelligence would do everyone a favor if it releases the 30,000 deleted Clinton emails many think the Russians have. Gigamon's Shezad Merchant tells us all about metadata, and Marcus Rauschecker explains the privacy implications of facial recognition software. We take a stroll through the crimeware souk (just looking, thanks).",
