  "description": "I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 20\n\nBrandon Marshall, Chad Johnson and Omar Kelly welcome former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Brian Flores. Tune in as they discuss his recent firing, lawsuit against the NFL and what the NFL and ownership needs to do to improve the status of minority leadership hires. \n\nThe show opens up with the cast all giving their best shot at defining the \"Patriots Way\" and how the organization has been able to be so successful over the years. After spending time as an assistant coach with the Patriots, Brian Flores shares that he's learned alot under Bill Belichick but they both still take a different approach to coaching. \n\nThe conversation shifts to Brian's recent firing after 3 seasons with Miami and how it came as a surprise to most of the world after he started the season off at 1-7 but ended it with a 9-8 record. Flores shares that he believes his firing was racially driven and how his open lawsuit against the NFL will help minority coaches in the future. Flores also shares his thoughts on ways that the NFL can implement changes right away that can benefit coaches in similar situations in the future. \n\nBrandon wraps the episode up by asking Brian, who is the X and who is the Z. As Brandon and Chad battle it out, Omar shares his thoughts to help move the conversation along. Omar shares that they both are talented receivers in their own ways but he has to go with Chad as the X. \n\n0:00 Cold Open\n0:36 Intro\n1:09 DraftKings Sportsbook\n2:22 Manscaped\n4:06 Defining the “Patriot’s Way”\n7:21 Brian Flores’s Firing\n12:01 Flores’s Inspiration Mel Tucker and Bill Belichick \n16:41 State of Black Coaches as Leaders in the NFL\n20:37 Rooney Rule and Black Head Coaches in NFL\n22:44 Flores’s on Tanking, Winning Culture and Respect\n29:10 Flores’s Lawsuit, Unfair Practices and Risk Challenging the NFL \n37:42 NFL Ownership and Representation\n45:20 Flores’s on How the NFL Can Implement Change\n51:35 Flores on His Family and Friends\n56:00 Flores on Ways He can Improve as a Coach\n58:39 Who’s Your X?
