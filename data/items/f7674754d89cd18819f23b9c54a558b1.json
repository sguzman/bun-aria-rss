Owens shared his thoughts on why the pandemic and political unrest has accelerated the conversation around responsibility in the fashion industry. <ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\"> <li>“This period of resetting and enforced reflection has just recharged me,” Owens said. The designer revisited his past work and discussed how fashion is a powerful mode of communication. “When I think back on everything I’ve been doing I feel like I was able to do beautiful things but I was also able to talk about values that I believe in.” The outbreak of Covid-19 and the killing of George Floyd, which has led to protests across the globe, has brought conversations about fashion’s contributions to systemic racism to the surface.</li> <li>Owens pointed out that the broader discussion around sustainability is forcing brands to reassess their businesses and consumers now more than ever are holding companies to account.</li> <li>Even as lockdown measures begin to ease and designers pivot to live stream their shows, Owens underscored that runways are not obsolete. “Adorning oneself and communicating through the way you look, it’s an ancient ritual and it’s an important part of communication… [Fashion shows will] always be there in one way or another.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles: </p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/constructing-rick-owens-creative-bubble'> Constructing Rick Owens' Creative Bubble</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/a-year-without-fashion-shows'> A Year Without Fashion Shows</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/people/the-depraved-kindness-of-rick-owens'> The Depraved Kindness of Rick Owens</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s Daily Digest newsletter <a href= 'http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>here</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
