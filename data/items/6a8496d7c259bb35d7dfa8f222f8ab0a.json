  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, in December of 2020, a Republican Congress spent trillions on a COVID bill. Democrats came into office in 2021 and pushed through a $1.9 trillion bill. Then in August 2021, Democrats voted for infrastructure bill spending trillions. Every Democrat voted for these trillions in spending as did 19 Republicans who have all contributed to the inflation we are facing today. Banks are facing loan issues; companies will begin layoffs and the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates to slow the economy and the growth of inflation. Then, the degrowth movement is destroying our industries, Biden's open border policy is allowing men that rape 10-year-old girls into the country, and we're still not producing enough domestic energy. Biden has done more to destroy our energy industry than any foreign enemy. Later, the most important legacy one can leave behind is one's children and Ivana Trump has passed away but has left the mark of great children on this world. This program extends its condolences to the Trump family. Afterward, if the Democrats get their way will go from a recession to a depression. The interest on our debt will consume a huge portion of our debt, the country cannot borrow and spend as much as it wants - our spending must be restrained. Finally, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has called for the defunding and abolition of federal and local police is complaining that the Capitol Police isn't doing enough to keep comedians from cat calls, and other free speech activity outside the Capitol. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
