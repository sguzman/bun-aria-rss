  "description": "<p>Some sixty years ago Buchdahl pioneered a program in search of static\nspherically symmetric vacua for pure $R^{2}$ gravity (Nuovo Cimento, Vol 23, No\n1, pp 141-157 (1962); [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02733549]).\nSurpassing several obstacles, his work culminated in a non-linear second-order\nordinary differential equation (ODE) which required being solved. However\nBuchdahl deemed the ODE intractable and prematurely abandoned his pursuit for\nan analytical solution. We have finally managed to break this six-decades-old\nimpasse and accomplish his goal. Reformulating the Buchdahl ODE, we obtain a\nnovel exhaustive class of metrics (which we shall call the Buchdahl-inspired\nmetrics hereafter) in a compact form. We are able to verify ex post, via direct\ninspection, that the metric obtained herein satisfies the $R^{2}$ vacuo field\nequation, hence establishing its validity. We show why the Buchdahl-inspired\nmetrics, which exhibit non-constant scalar curvature, defeat a\nLichnerowicz-type no-go theorem, previously proved for quadratic gravity, by\nevading the overly strong restriction on the asymptotic falloff of the metric\nat spatial infinity. Our novel solution thereby completes Buchdahl's\nsix-decades-old program. We also explore the mathematical properties of the\nBuchdahl-inspired metrics in the limit of small k and in the region around the\ncoordinate origin.\n</p>",
