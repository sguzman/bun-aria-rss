  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, could you imagine a Biden presidency during the height of the pandemic? The immediate implementation of the Defense Production Act to manufacture ventilators, hospital beds, and a vaccine all while people were dying. Now we have President Biden who has desperately tried to be the second coming of FDR and is destroying our economy in his stupor, zeal, failing mental health, and bad choices. Biden now agrees with his 'Ultra MAGA' critics saying that the number one threat to our economy is inflation. Biden's reckless spending and the subsequent printing of more money, along with his anti-fossil fuel energy policies, triggered inflation, to begin with. Not COVID, Not Putin. Then, the federal government has a duty to protect federal judges. Congress passed a federal law (18 USC 1507) against harassing court officers, influencing court decisions, and or preventing any federal judge from their duties and it is punishable by up to a year in prison. Why isn't anyone getting arrested for intimidating US Supreme Court Justices right outside of their private homes? Would AG Merrick Garland want the Attorney General to protect him if he would've become a SCOTUS Justice? Have conservatives been protesting outside the homes of pro-abortion justices for the last 50 years? Later, US Sen. Rick Scott joins the show to discuss inflation 'tax' and why Biden needs to resign. Scott reiterated his comments calling for all Americans to get back to work and be involved in rescuing America. Afterward, Fox News Host and Author Tyrus calls in to discuss his new book \"Just Tyrus: A Memoir.\" Tyrus discussed his humble and abusive upbringing, his pro wrestling career, and his work at Fox News\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Just-Tyrus-Memoir/dp/1637580665/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PDS7CI39EGV5&keywords=tyrus&qid=1652208413&sprefix=tyru%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
