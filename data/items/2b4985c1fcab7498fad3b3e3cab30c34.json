  "description": "Two new 2020 polls are out, and Democrats DON’T like Elizabeth Warren’s health care plan! Biden’s still on top, Buttigieg’s rising, and Bloomberg may buy some votes. Reports say Obama told candidates that Biden “doesn’t have it.” And Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence changed her mind on impeachment, but only for a day. Meanwhile, Trump told Bill O’Reilly that he NEVER sent Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine, and Melania was booed at an anti-opioid event. Pat and Stu discuss who would make it onto the “Mount Rushmore of Worst Presidents.” Also, Cap’n Crunch, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and Thanksgiving dinner are all delicious, but flawed. Listeners chime in on the elections, and Jeffy will break bad news to people on the Cameo app for money.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
