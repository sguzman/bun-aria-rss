  "description": "<p>Let’s cut to the chase. This episode of Las Culturistas features 3 in-studio vocal performances from this week’s supremely talented special guest, Amanda Shechtman…and they will blow your goddamn mind. Her voice is insane. Like, truly insane. And to sweeten the pot, former LC guest and piano savant Henry Koperski is also in-studio to accompany her on the keys. And these performances aren’t just thrown into the show haphazardly. Oh no! They are INTEGRATED into Matt & Bowen’s wonderful interview with Amanda. And in said interview, Amanda tells the nail-biting, emotional, uplifting, crazy story of her American Idol Audition and what made her step in a cultural direction (combination of Long Island Jewish American Princess, Diva Culture, mid-2000s indie girl angst, and The Muppets). Plus, Matt & Bowen tackle global warming, Henry has something he wants to say, and the answer to the question: what is the difference between Manhattan spoiled kids vs. Brooklyn spoiled kids?</p><p>DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE TO SEE AMANDA LIVE IN NYC! “Amanda Shechtman Hates To Sing\" THIS MONDAY, December 4 @7pm at The Duplex.
