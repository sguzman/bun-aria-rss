  "description": "<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast Sam's guest is Anne Sebba - whose <em>Ethel Rosenberg: A Cold War Tragedy</em> tells the story of the first woman in US history to be executed for a crime other than murder. On the podcast, she talks about how attitudes to this notorious espionage case changed over the years; and why, while not wanting to relitigate the case, she thinks it’s important to get to a sense of who Ethel really was.</div>\n",
