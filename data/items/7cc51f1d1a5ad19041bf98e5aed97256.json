  "description": "This week, the gals put on their best T-straps and knee dusters to throw back some giggle water and gab. Topics include a ragged stranger with a mysterious backstory, a very heated game of bridge, and the logistics of pooping from the top of a flagpole. Trade in that coffin varnish for a bottle of Winc's Altre Mon Red Blend, lay out your dummy, and tune in for 1920s Crimes.",
