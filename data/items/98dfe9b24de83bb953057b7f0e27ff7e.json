  "description": "In today's podcast we hear some reports that ISIS may be losing some social media ground. NATO agrees to increase cyber cooperation. A newly described malware dropper is apparently tailored to work against specific European energy companies. 600,000 patient records are breached in the US. There's a decryptor out for Jigsaw ransomware, but not for the newly introduced \"Alfa\" or \"Ranscam\" (and Ranscam doesn't even bother to decrypt in the first place). Markus Rauschecker highlights some of the challenges with information sharing. Google and Niantic deal with Pokémon Go security issues. And don't enter some strangers' home, even if you see Reshirom EX on their sofa.",
