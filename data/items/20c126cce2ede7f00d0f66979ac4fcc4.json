  "title": "What You Want to Hear vs. What You NEED to Hear | Sadie Robertson Huff & Cody Carnes",
  "description": "Sadie is delighted to welcome worship leader and songwriter of some of her all-time favorite worship songs, Cody Carnes, to the podcast. Cody shares how he and his wife — worship leader & songwriter, Kari Jobe — first started dating, and Sadie agrees that when you're finding the person you'll marry, it's so important that your people in your life love them too. Cody talks about he and Kari writing \"The Blessing\" which was released just as the world was going into lockdown, and how he's still amazed at the amount of blessings that have resulted from that song. Cody also talks about coming out of a time of chaos, where seemingly all truth is questioned, that Christians have a special privilege in knowing they can trust the Lord at His Word, when He says who He is, what He did, and what He's promised. Cody and Sadie share encouragement that God IS good and that He's the only constant and consistent thing we can count on in this world. \n\nhttps://helixsleep.com/sadie — Get up to $200 OFF AND 2 free pillows!\n\nGet a 4-week trial, free postage, and a digital scale at https://www.stamps.com/whoa\n\nhttps://athleticgreens.com/whoa — Get a FREE 1-year supply of Vitamin D & 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
