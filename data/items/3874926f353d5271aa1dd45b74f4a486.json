  "description": "In this installment of Best Of The Gist, we listen back to the Tuesday Spiel about a recent spate of really fabulous news that just gets drowned out by the steady drumbeat of negativity. Then we listen back to Mike’s February 26, 2018 interview with Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, who argues that we’ve had a roughly 300-year run of steady improvements in technology, health, and civility, and that it just so happens that the only thing as constant as human progress is our tendency to focus on human shortcomings. Pinker’s interview corresponded with the release of Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
