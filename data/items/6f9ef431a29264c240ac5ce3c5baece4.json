  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has always been an evil man. From what he did to Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, and Tara Reade, to lying about his school records. Now, he's holding back monoclonal antibodies from the state of Florida. These therapeutics were distributed by need, not by equity, but that supply has now been cut by the federal government. The insanity of this man is becoming the insanity of this country. Jen Psaki argued that the supply was rationed because of Florida's lax vaccination standards, despite having a higher vaccination rate than Washington, DC, or Illinois. Gov Ron DeSantis has long been a proponent of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapeutics and his citizens are being told, by their party-first president, to drop dead. Later, the secretary of Defense has the duty of reporting to the President and offer the best advice. Allowing Gen mark Milley to be a rogue actor is negligent and it's never routine to do it after a conversation with Speaker Pelosi which gives the patina of a soft coup. It was confirmed by Gen. McKenzie that Biden's drone strike did in fact kill as many as 10 civilians including up to seven children, not an ISIS-K militant. Afterward, Rep. Chip Roy calls in to explain the severity of the situation at the Texas-Mexico border. Roy cited increases in child trafficking and drug smuggling which affects the entire country and has called for Biden's impeachment for abdicating his Constitutional responsibility. Roy added that Texans will also suffer because of Biden's creation of a rationing problem that didn't even exist. HHS refused to respond to whether there was a shortage of treatments or not.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
