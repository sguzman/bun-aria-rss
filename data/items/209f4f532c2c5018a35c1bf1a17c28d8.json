  "description": "<p class=\"\">This week it's one of our very faves, Joanna Shupe is back! Joanna has a new book out June 30th -- The Devil of Downtown -- which is basically perfection, so we're talking about why Gilded Age romance is the best, and why everyone should be reading unusual historicals (historicals set outside the Regency in England). Get ready, your TBR will groan after this one!</p><p class=\"\">Oh, and did you know Sarah<em> also </em>has a book out June 30th?

The first was to discuss the <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/2/5/65-freewheeling-with-joanna-shupe\">enemies to lovers trope in <em>Prisoner of My Desire</em> and <em>Kiss of a Demon King</em>.</a></p><p class=\"\">Speaking of IAD: ever seen the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ileIRCUNZ0HoOYSrTsFBW0XxweCfYciaUsPYHiJNR-Y/edit?usp=sharing\">IAD spreadsheet of Wonder</a>, created be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsSarahHawley\">Sarah Hawley</a> from the Wicked Wallflowers Podcast? Oh, and if you haven't read it, why not do it this summer? There's a group read going on right now on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/248609269570128/\">a subgroup of Sarah's Facebook Book Club</a>!</p><p class=\"\">All about <a href=\"https://lithub.com/writing-in-the-shadow-of-a-masterpiece-on-homage/\">Homage</a>, <a href=\"https://literarydevices.net/allusion/\">allusion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/allegory\">allegory</a> in case it's been a while since you were in an English class.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.modernlibrary.com/\">Modern Library!</a> Where are our romances?</p><p class=\"\">Sarah has <a href=\"http://www.sarahmaclean.net/sarah-in-person\">a bunch of online events</a> this summer.</p><p class=\"\">Many of the old American historicals support an ahistorical white settler, <a href=\"https://americanexperience.si.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manifest-Destiny-and-Indian-Removal.pdf\">Manifest Destiny</a>, story of Westward Expansion. <em>Savage Thunder</em> was a particularly problematic one, and Jen only read it for the <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2018/01/who-did-it-better-on-horse.html\">\"sex on a horse\"</a> scene. Maybe watch some <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/deadwood\">Deadwood</a> instead?</p><p class=\"\">Which came first? <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/fm-euro.pdf\">Eurocentrism</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.anglophilesunited.com/\">Anglophiles</a>?</p><p class=\"\"><em>Gone With the Wind</em> is just <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/08/yes-gone-with-the-wind-is-another-neo-confederate-monument.html\">Lost Cause propaganda</a>. Don't at us. Speaking of wars: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars\">The Napoleonic Wars</a> took place during the Regency, but no one ever really talks about them in Regency romances.</p><p class=\"\">Romance's Regency blueprint was created by <a href=\"https://www.janetogeorgette.com/\">Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer.</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/history-of-piercing/5#:~:text=Nipple%20Piercings&text=In%20the%20mid%2D14th%20century,jewelry%20to%20match%20the%20dress.\">Nipple piercing has been around for a long time</a>. Look for it in Joanna's next book.</p><p class=\"\">Joanna's fascination with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\">The Gilded Age </a>started with <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/02/13/a-rooting-interest\">Edith Wharton</a>. The time period is the setting for the Uptown Girls series, but the Gilded Age also has <a href=\"https://time.com/5122375/american-inequality-gilded-age/\">lots of uncomfortable</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-21/john-d-rockefeller-was-almost-three-times-richer-than-bezos\">parallels to today</a>. If you're looking for more information about The Gilded Age, you should know that Jack Mulligan was based on real life mobster <a href=\"https://historycollection.com/rise-mob-12-people-events-created-american-mafia/4/\">Paul Kelly</a>. Joanna also recommends the following books: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hTn6pb\"><em>Low Life</em></a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hXoAi8\"><em>The Gangs of New York</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37TAq8m\"><em>Incredible New York</em></a>. If you want to hear Joanna talk about The Gilded Age, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/292796415428667/\">join her Facebook Group on July 9th, 2020 for a virtual tour!</a></p><p class=\"\">If you haven't ever been to <a href=\"https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/\">Ellis Island</a>, it's excellent. It's a dynamic museum with tons of interesting facts about European immigration to New York. Speaking of history, if you're interested in learning about <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/long-lasting-legacy-great-migration-180960118/\">The Great Migration,</a> the setting of <em>A Champion's Heart</em>, you should read <em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em>.</p><p class=\"\">Food is everyone's love language until <a href=\"https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-1950s-most-nauseating-jell-o-soaked-recipes/\">the jello molds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/vintage-recipes-inspired-swingin-60s/\">casseroles</a> start to arrive.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://lithub.com/a-century-of-reading-the-10-books-that-defined-the-1960s/\">You actually can read lots of books about the 60s</a>.</p><p class=\"\">What do you mean you haven't seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hudsucker_Proxy\">The Hudsucker Proxy</a>?</p>",
