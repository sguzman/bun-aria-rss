  "description": "<p>r/Relationships_Advice In today's episode, OP is stuck with a real headscratcher. On the plus side, his girlfriend is pretty and fun to be around. On the down side, she literally tried to murder him twice. So, should he stay with her or break up with her? Talk about a real conundrum! Personally, I feel like 1 attempted murder is 1 too many but maybe OP just draws the line at 3 attempted murdered. What do you think?</p>\n<p>🔔 Subscribe: https://bit.ly/2E3A8i6</p>\n<p>💬 Discord: https://discord.gg/VD6eYD3</p>\n<p>🎧 Podcast: https://link.chtbl.com/rslash</p>\n<p>⚓ Send me a voice message: https://anchor.fm/rslash</p>\n<p>📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rslashyt/</p>\n<p>♪ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@rslash0</p>\n<p>🛒 Merch: http://bit.ly/rSlashMerch</p>\n<p>🎁 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rslash</p>\n",
