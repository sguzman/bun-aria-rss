  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the war on American history continues, and now it has moved way beyond simply removing statues of Confederate generals. We’ll discuss the latest on that front today. Also Five Headlines including Democrats in Texas absconding from the state in order to prevent the passage of bills they oppose. These are the same people who complain about “obstructionism.” And will the Biden Administration be fact checking your text messages? A new report makes that claim. In our Daily Cancellation we talk about an article in a scientific journal claiming that geology is racist. The reason they give for this claim is so unbelievably insane and stupid that it may actually shock you.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
