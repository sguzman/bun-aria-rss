  "description": "<p>The difference between scoring a home vs. missing out can be incredibly small- and a lot of it comes down to your offer. There are lots of little things that can help your offer stand out and make the buying process move along smoothly. However, since most of us only buy a home once or twice in our lifetime, not knowing or forgetting a step can cost us a place we really want or cause us to make unwise decisions. Listen as we cover some important steps in the home buying process and how you can get a leg up when you are actually buying a home.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Space Camper Cosmic IPA by Boulevard Brewing which you can learn all about on Untappd. A special thanks to Hillary and all of our friends at Boulevard for donating this beer to the show!
