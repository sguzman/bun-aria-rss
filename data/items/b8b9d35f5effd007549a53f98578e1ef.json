  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, Cindy Rollins, Angelina Stanford and Thomas Banks begin their series on <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2VAGs9E\">The Great Divorce</a></em> by C. S. Lewis. Today you are going to get a crash-course in Medievalism through Lewis’ story, and we hope you will enjoy this book as much as our hosts do. Angelina kicks off the discussion even while sharing her commonplace quote, sharing some information about the epigraph and front matter. She gives us some historical context, both for where this books comes in Lewis’ own timeline, as well as some ideas of the journey of the soul and medieval dream literature.</p> <p>Thomas gives some background on Prudentius and his allegorical work <a href=\"https://amzn.to/352ZRmo\"><em>The Psychomachia</em></a>. Angelina goes into some comparisons between <em>The Great Divorce</em> and Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Thomas talks about Nathanial Hawthorne’s short story <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2xJ0TYR\">The Celestial Railroad</a></em> as a satire of <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>. Also, if you haven’t read and listened to E. M. Forster’s <em>Celestial Omnibus</em>, see <a href=\"https://www.theliterary.life/017/\">Episode 17</a>. As they get into discussing the Preface, Thomas give us some information on William Blake. We will be back next week with a discussion on Chapters 2-6.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them. Man cannot discover them by his own powers and if he sets out to seek for them he will find in their place counterfeits of which he will be unable to discern the falsity.</p> <cite>Simone Weil</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>No, there is no escape. There is no heaven with a little of hell in it–no plan to retain this of that of the devil in our hearts or our pockets. Out Satan must go, every hair and feather.</p> <cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>A poet is not a man who says “look at me”, but rather a man who points at something and says “look at that.”</p> <cite>C.
