  "description": "<p>This is the story of an &ldquo;inquiring mind&rdquo; who happens to be a journalist. Sewell Chan is the new editor-in-chief of <em>The Texas Tribune.</em> But before his move to Austin, and before his previous roles at the <em>L.A. Times,</em> the <em>New York Times,</em> and the <em>Washington Post,</em> he was a kid growing up in an immigrant family in the outer boroughs of New York City, where his father drove a taxicab. Both his parents had seen a lot in their lives &ndash; but said little. Their New York was the New York of work, of their community, and of striving for a quiet, peaceful place to live, which ended up being in Queens. Yet when you meet Sewell, it's surprising that he came from such a quiet place, because he&rsquo;s so engaged with the world, with history, with how people live and how things work. In this episode, Kevin Burke talks with Sewell about his coming-of-age years in New York, the meaning of home, and what the windows and doors were from where his family lived out to the larger world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Your Hometown </em>is a show where the local is the epic.
