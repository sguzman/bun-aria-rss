  "description": "<p>In this paper, we study arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay (ACM) bundles on\nhomogeneous varieties $G/P$. Indeed we characterize the homogeneous ACM bundles\non $G/P$ of Picard rank one in terms of highest weights. This is a\ngeneralization of the result on $G/P$ of classical types presented by Costa and\nMir\\'{o}-Roig for type $A$, and Du, Fang, and Ren for types $B,C$ and $D$. As a\nconsequence we prove that only finitely many irreducible homogeneous ACM\nbundles, up to twisting line bundles, exist over all such $G/P$. Moreover, we\nderive the list of the highest weights of the irreducible homogeneous ACM\nbundles on particular homogeneous varieties of exceptional types such as the\nCayley Plane and the Freudenthal variety.\n</p>",
