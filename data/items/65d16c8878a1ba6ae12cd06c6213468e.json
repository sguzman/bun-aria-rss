The transition of linear motion into rotational motion is explained. The transformation, presented, is analogous to the motion that creates a new degree of dimensionality. Transformation of physical vacuum into matter is represented by the analog of gas condensation into a solid state. The cause of neutron instability in the free state is considered. A variant of the origin of matter and physical vacuum from the previous state is proposed. The existence of the present as a mediator between the past and the future is analyzed. Evolution of the Universe in Space and Time is described. Astonishment is expressed by the coincidence of the description of the Universe evolution with the ancient Greek description of the Ouroboros.\n  \n   "
