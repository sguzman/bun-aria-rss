  "description": "<p>Cellular automata are a class of computational models based on simple rules\nand algorithms that can simulate a wide range of complex phenomena. However,\nwhen using conventional computers, these 'simple' rules are only encapsulated\nat the level of software. This can be taken one step further by simplifying the\nunderlying physical hardware. Here, we propose and implement a simple photonic\nhardware platform for simulating complex phenomena based on cellular automata.\nUsing this special-purpose computer, we experimentally demonstrate complex\nphenomena including fractals, chaos, and solitons, which are typically\nassociated with much more complex physical systems. The flexibility and\nprogrammability of our photonic computer presents new opportunities to simulate\nand harness complexity for efficient, robust, and decentralized information\nprocessing schemes using light.\n</p>",
