He believes that Bitcoin would be able to reach that milestone because of the “HODL culture.” Users with a high level of conviction will not sell their holdings since they anticipate significant price appreciation in the future.\n\n\"The DoomLoop has begun. 1 USD = 1 EUR. Prepare yourselves for YCC and $BTC = $1 million. But please be patient, these things take time.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
