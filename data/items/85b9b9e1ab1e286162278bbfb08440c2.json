  "description": "<p>The 3rd Day of Culture has arrived and we are celebrating that day when Ben Franklin, whilst flying a kite, discovered electricity. Chaotic good, much?! Bowen walks Matt through the fascinating timeline of Benj Frank's life, and the girls spin off based on one of his other inventions (bifocals!) into a conversation about Bowen and Matt's respective lifetime eye struggles. It gets really, really emotional as Matt accuses Bowen of being a \"Tina Fey about glasses\" (lying about needing them), but the two immediately reconcile. All this, the boys choose their favorite founding fathers, the \"beauty myth\" during the American Revolution is explored, and a brief word on how poop can sometimes get in your eye during lovemaking. Have you checked in on your girls? They doing crazy shit like flying a kite during a storm? Ever seen a straight guy's ass up close? Anyways, we'll see y'all again tomorrow! xo!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
