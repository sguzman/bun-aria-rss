  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I was born and raised in Lee County AL. One morning on the way to work in about 2008 I saw a Bigfoot standing in a pine thicket. It was about eight feet tall and looked like a hairy human. Didn’t look animal like to me but more human like.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and he said “I grew up in Alabama hunting and fishing and I have never seen anything or heard anything regarding Bigfoot. The state had just clear cut this area where I saw this thing. I have been camping, hunting and fishing in this area. I never believed in Bigfoot and I was in shock looking at this creature. It looked like a huge hairy human, it looked at me and I looked at it. It wasn’t a bear and it wasn’t a human being. I would say it looked more human like.”</p>",
