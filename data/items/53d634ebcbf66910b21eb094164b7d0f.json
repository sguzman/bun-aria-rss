  "description": "<p>On July 24th, 1984, Brenda Lafferty and her 15 month old daughter Erica were brutally murdered in their American Fork, Utah home. Their deaths shocked this small, tight knit community of largely Latter Day Saints church members who could not imagine such a crime occurring in their town. What shocked them further was the identity of the killers.</p><p>In the best selling book \"Under The Banner of Heaven\" investigative journalist&nbsp;Jon&nbsp;Krakaur dug deep into Brenda and Erica's case, and provided the extraordinary historical context that (he believes) led the killers to target an innocent young mother and her child. Now, Academy Award winning screenwriter, Dustin Lance Black has adapted the story for a Hulu series starring Daisy Edgar Jones as Brenda and Andrew Garfield as the detective who is sworn to bring her killers to justice. Join us as we analyse the case and compare fact to fiction.&nbsp;</p><p>#HerNameWasBrendaLafferty #HerNameWasEricaLafferty #UnderTheBannerofHeaven #JonKrakauer #DustinLanceBlack #HuluOriginal #truecrime #ExpertAnalaysis #Femicide #Infancticide #VictimsMatter #mothersmatter #childrenmatter #DishonorKilling #ToxicMasculineFragility&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
