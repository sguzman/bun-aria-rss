  "description": "<p>Squeezed light, which is easily degraded by loss, could benefit from\ngeneration directly in optical fiber. Furthermore, highly nonlinear fiber could\noffer more efficient generation with lower pump power and shorter fiber lengths\nthan standard single-mode fiber. We investigate non-polarization-maintaining\nhighly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) for squeezed-light generation by characterizing\npossible sources of excess noise, including its zero-dispersion wavelength\n(ZDW) variation and polarization noise. We find significant ZDW variation and\nexcess polarization noise. We believe the polarization noise is from non-linear\npolarization-mode dispersion. These findings are indicative of excess noise\nthat would reduce and potentially completely overtake any squeezing generated,\nexcept possibly using intensity difference detection.\n</p>",
