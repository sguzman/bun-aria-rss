Bryant, much like the late NBA Commissioner David Stern, was myopic on his relentless pursuit of perfection. His death drew an outpouring of support from world leaders, athletes and entertainers. Bryant also built an investment platform, which had him on the road to becoming a billionaire. Also discussed is the Premier Golf League, which begins play in 2022.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p><br></p><p>Producer: Charles Vollmer</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
