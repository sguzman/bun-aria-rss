  "description": "Craigslist is the internet’s classifieds section, but it’s also one of its more shadowy corners, where the ads are anonymous and ephemeral. So we found ourselves wondering - what would we find if we replied to a couple? This week, we track down the people behind two intriguing ads.\nAnd in the second half of the show - Neal Horsley was an anti-abortion activist who created a website called \"The Nuremberg Files,\" a website that listed the names and addresses of abortion providers around the country. He died last month, but the legacy of his website lives on. We talked to Jennifer Boulanger, a woman who works at a number of abortion clinics, and whose name ended up on Horsley's website in the 90's.\nReporter Bianca Giaever is a filmmaker and radio producer in New York.\nhttp://www.biancagiaever.com/\nSponsors\nHighfive (http://www.highfive.com/reply)\nOutlook for mobile devices (download for free for iOS or Android)\nMailchimp (http://www.mailchimp.com/replyall)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
