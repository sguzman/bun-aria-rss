  "title": "Ep. 937 - Disney Denies Grooming Accusation, But Promoted And Celebrated Child Drag Queens",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we will play the one clip that puts the debate over Disney grooming to rest and proves once and for all, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they do have an agenda to groom and indoctrinate children. Also, Elon Musk is now officially on the verge of becoming Twitter’s new owner. And Democrats move to legally bar Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for re-election. If you can’t beat them in the ballot box, just take them to court, apparently. Plus, Taylor Lorenz comes up with the lamest possible excuse to justify doxxing Libs of Tik Tok. And in our Daily Cancellation, a stay at home Dad weeps over the fact that his son is becoming “traditionally” masculine. What’s a gender-bending Dad supposed to do in that situation? \n\nI am now a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author.
