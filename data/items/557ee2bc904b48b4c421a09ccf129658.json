  "description": "<p>Michael Chabon is no stranger to genre fiction. He has a Lovecraftesque alter ego. He's written essays decrying navel-gazing trends in the short story world. His Pulitzer Prize-winning&nbsp;The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&nbsp;tackled its larger themes through the lens of two comic book writers.</p><p>So it should come as no surprise that in the early 2000s, Chabon took a stab at young adult fantasy with&nbsp;Summerland,&nbsp;a sprawling tale that mixes&nbsp;American folklore, Norse myth, and baseball.</p><p>Listen on as Craig attempts to convey his enthusiasm for the book, Andrew attempts to name baseball heroes, and both of us attempt to (mis)pronounce Michael Chabon's name.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
