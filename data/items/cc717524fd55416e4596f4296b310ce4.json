We will look into the history of the Nashville based company as well look into the future of the company.</p>\n<p>In the second hour, we say goodbye at least for the time being as the doors will always remain open for Chuck Morrison who is leaving us as he moves north and begins a new chapter in his life. We will light up his favorite cigar and find out what is going on with Wicked Cuisine.</p>\n<p>It’s a new era as Mr. Jonathan takes over Debonaire and Barry goes into the Asylum. We will have Cigar News, Deal of the Week, Matchup of the Week, the Classic 3-Way and all the lunacy known as The Cigar Authority.</p>\n<p>Live from Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always, you can find most of the cigars we talk about at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>www.2guyscigars.com</a></p>\n",
