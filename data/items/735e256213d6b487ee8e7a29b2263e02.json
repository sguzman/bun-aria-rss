  "description": "<p>We first brought you Emily Noble's story on September 21, 2020. Emily disappeared after spending the evening of May 24, 2020, celebrating her birthday with her husband. They stopped at several restaurants in a popular part of Westerville, Ohio. They then made their way home for the evening. Emily's husband claimed that they went to bed, and during the night, he got up to use the restroom and then went back to sleep in a guest room, not wanting to disturb Emily. When he awoke later that morning, Emily was gone, and her wallet, phone, keys, and car were still at the residence. Emily's disappearance captivated the local community, and rumors swirled from day one. Days before we were due to air Emily's story in 2020, human remains were located not far from her condo. The day after we aired Emily's episode, the Westerville Police Department held a press conference confirming the identification of Emily's remains. On June 17, 2021, her husband Matt was arrested and charged with her murder. In this special two-part update on Emily Noble, we will explore what happened after the original episode aired and what we know today about what happened to Emily.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://Acorn.TV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acorn TV</a>- Try Acorn TV free for 30 days by going to <a href=\"http://Acorn.TV \" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acorn.TV</a> and use our promo code <strong>vanished</strong>.
