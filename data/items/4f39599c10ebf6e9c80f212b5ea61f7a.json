  "description": "The way to develop an intimate relationship with God, a relationship where you hear His voice and let Him mold and make you into the person He wants you to be, is when you push away the distractions and simply sit at His feet. Perhaps you take a Scripture and just ponder over it and listen to what He is saying. Perhaps you sit quietly in His presence and say, “God, I love You today. Thank You for this day. Father, I want You to reveal more of Yourself to me.” Whatever that intimacy looks like for you, the only thing that will satisfy the needs of your soul and give vision for your life is to set yourself apart and sit at the feet of Jesus.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
