In this episode of China Uncensored, we discuss a deal he pushed through allowing a Chinese shipping company to own a share of Germany's largest port, Angela Merkel's relationship with China when she was chancellor, and why Germany could be in trouble if it doesn't give up (or at least decrease dependence on) Chinese money. \n\nThe UK Is Getting Tough on China\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXX_ook5ilw&ab_channel=ChinaUncensored\n\nYouTube demonetizes our channels, we need your support!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ChinaUncensored\nhttps://chinauncensored.locals.com\n\nWe also accept bitcoin!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin\n\nBuy our merchandise!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise\n\nMake sure to share this video with your friends!\n______________________________\nSubscribe for updates:\nyoutube.com/ChinaUncensored?sub_confirmation=1\n\n______________________________\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaUncensored\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/ChinaUncensored\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/ChinaUncensored\n\nAnd check out the China Unscripted podcast!\nhttps://youtube.com/chinaunscripted\n\n#China\n______________________________\n© All Rights Reserved.",
