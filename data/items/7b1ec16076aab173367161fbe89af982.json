  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and a few of the guys record live from a hotel room in Pittsburgh right after coming back from WWE Monday Night Raw. They recap their roadtrip from Indiana to Cleveland to Pittsburgh and everything that they did along the way including WWE Fastlane, some of their dining experiences, and beating the inclement weather that was on their backs. Also included in the show is Pat's interview with Rich Eisen on the NFL Network Free Agency Frenzy as he discussed Antonio Brown going to Oakland, who some of the best free agent punters are, and Rich gives him another push to keep the #McAfeeForMNF train rolling (28:54-36:08). Later, an absolute legend in the game, an NFL Hall of Famer, one of the most recognizable faces in NFL media, The Professor, John Clayton, joins the show. They discuss everything free agency related and how AB almost wound up in Buffalo, he gives a couple of ideas where he thinks certain players might land as teams are handing out insane amounts of cash, he dives into what his work weeks are like during these types of hot beds in the NFL calendar, gives his Super Bowl pick for next year, and chats about whether or not the pony tail is real (41:48-1:03:10.) It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
