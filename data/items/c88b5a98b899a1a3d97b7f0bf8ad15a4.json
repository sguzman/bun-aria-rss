  "description": "<p>You’ve heard the call, “I’m not religious, but I am spiritual.” What does that even mean? And, why are so many people running from organized religion, but flocking to some amorphous and ambiguous claim to spirituality that often extends not further than a sense that you yearn for something more? And, is that okay? Or, are we leaving something behind? And, if so, what? Is it a part of ourselves? A sense of wholeness and belonging? How do we reclaim a feeling of connectedness and expansiveness and ease, without also surrendering to the strictures of organized religion that, too often, integrate tribalism, separateness and disconnection from our lived, modern experience?</p><br><p>These are the questions we dive into with my guest today, Rabbi Rami Shapiro.
