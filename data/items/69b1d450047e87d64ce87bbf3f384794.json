    "media:description": "Star Wars Rogue One was a prequel no one asked for, and now we have Andor, a prequel based on a prequel that no one asked for. But is is good? Or is it another abysmal failure for the Disney Star Wars universe? \n\nEdited by CaffeineTweaker and Me\nArgued at me by Adam Friended\n\nAdam Friended and my streaming channel : https://www.youtube.com/c/PSASitchDaily/videos\nCaffeine Tweaker's twitter : https://twitter.com/CaffeineTweaker\n\nOur Graphic Novel campaign is LIVE!!!!

We had Rogue One, a Star Wars prequel no one wanted or asked for, and now we have Andor, A Star Wars prequel based off of another star wars prequel, that no one wanted or asked for. We’ve finally reached the media singularity. Space time has curved back in on itself collapsing into a world of infinite prequels. Can we go deeper down this inception hole of prequels. Maybe next Grandma Andor will get a prequel, and we can a prequel based on a prequel based on a prequel. Our society forever stuck in a loop of prequels going backwards until we have caveman jedi hitting caveman sith with rock powered lightsabers.",
