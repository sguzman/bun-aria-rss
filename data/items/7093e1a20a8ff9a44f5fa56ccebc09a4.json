  "title": "#332: Gabby Petito: Deconstructing the Body Cam Footage",
  "description": "<p>On August 12, 2021, Gabrielle Petito and Brian Laundrie were pulled over outside of Moab, Utah.&nbsp;The police officer, whose body cam was on, initially stopped their van for speeding and reckless driving.&nbsp;He realized Gabby was distraught and tried to establish what had happened and why Gabby was so upset. He was soon joined by another officer who had been responding to a possible domestic violence call in town where a witness said he saw a couple driving away in a white van, with a woman named Gabby.&nbsp;What happens next on the body cam footage is disturbing to watch. Jim and Laura breakdown the behavior of Gabby, Brian and the officers in that 1 hour and 17 minute tape and discuss the police interaction and other intervention opportunities and strategies that should have been considered. What these officers desperately needed was the DASH risk assessment tool, that Laura created, so they could have asked the most important questions, and really understood Gabby's answers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DASH Risk Model&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dashriskchecklist.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.dashriskchecklist.co.uk</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.laurarichards.co.uk/deep-diving-coercive-control/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.laurarichards.co.uk/deep-diving-coercive-control/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sign the petition to criminalize coercive control in the US</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/domestic-violence-law-reform-coercive-control-usa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.change.org/p/domestic-violence-law-reform-coercive-control-usa</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Supporting our Sponsors, you make our podcast possible, and make educating and helping victims and survivors happen!
