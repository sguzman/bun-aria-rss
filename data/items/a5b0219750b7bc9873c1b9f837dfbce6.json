    "media:description": "Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as #coding). In this course you will learn what is computer #programming all about and learn how to program comprehensively. \n\n⭐️ Join Us ⭐️\nJoin our FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cslesson\nLike our FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/cslesson/\nWebsite: https://cslesson.org",
