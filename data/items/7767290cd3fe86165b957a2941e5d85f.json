  "description": "<p>We investigate operator algebraic origins of the classical Koopman-von\nNeumann wave function $\\psi_{KvN}$ as well as the quantum mechanical one\n$\\psi_{QM}$. We introduce a formalism of Operator Mechanics (OM) based on a\nnoncommutative Poisson, symplectic and noncommutative differential structures.\nOM serves as a pre-quantum algebra from which algebraic structures relevant to\nreal-world classical and quantum mechanics follow. In particular, $\\psi_{KvN}$\nand $\\psi_{QM}$ are both consequences of this pre-quantum formalism. No a\npriori Hilbert space is needed. OM admits an algebraic notion of operator\nexpectation values without invoking states. A phase space bundle ${\\cal E}$\nfollows from this. $\\psi_{KvN}$ and $\\psi_{QM}$ are shown to be sections in\n${\\cal E}$. The difference between $\\psi_{KvN}$ and $\\psi_{QM}$ originates from\na quantization map interpreted as \"twisting\" of sections over ${\\cal E}$. We\nalso show that the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is obtained from the Koopman-von\nNeumann equation. What this suggests is that neither the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation nor the quantum wave function are fundamental structures. Rather, they\nboth originate from a pre-quantum operator algebra.\n</p>",
