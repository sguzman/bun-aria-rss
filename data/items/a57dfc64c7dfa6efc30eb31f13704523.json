    "media:description": "Prisha is a young woman whose various mental health issues—from BPD to anorexia to childhood trauma—were lumped by her doctors under the umbrella of \"gender dysphoria.\" At the age of 15 she was put on hormones and shortly thereafter had her breasts removed. We talk about the downstream effects of testosterone on her female reproductive system, and her road to self acceptance and balanced mind.\n\nFind her on twitter: https://twitter.com/detransaqua\n\nIf you feel moved, you can help fund her breast reconstruction via https://www.gofundme.com/f/Prishas-breast-reconstruction\n\nSupport this channel: \nhttps://www.paypal.me/benjaminboyce\nhttps://cash.app/$benjaminaboyce\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/benjaminaboyce\n\nFind all interviews on spotify: https://spoti.fi/3px5WnK\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/benjaminboyce\n\nJoin me on alternative video sites:\n\nhttps://odysee.com/@BenjaminABoyce\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/channel/benjaminboyce/\nhttps://rumble.com/user/BenjaminABoyce\nAnd on Twitter @BenjaminABoyce\n\n#detransition #anorexia #pepper",
