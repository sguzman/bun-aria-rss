  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the media continues to cause more and more damage with their lies. This program has always insisted on adherence to the Constitution. All violence should be condemned, all efforts to block the free exercise of speech, not even the first amendment, but simply speech overall should be condemned. The 2020 election had serious constitutional issues, and it's legitimate and necessary to raise those issues, and our elected officials in government need to correct it and follow the Constitution. Then, as outlined in \"The Liberty Amendments”, the Convention of States movement is a civil and Constitutional way to bring about change in our government. Mitch McConnell always gets good press in The Washington Post because he plays ball with the Democrats; he supported Gerald Ford instead of Ronald Reagan, he went to war with the Tea Party, and now he's supporting Nancy Pelosi's impeachment effort. Later, Pollster to President Trump, John McLaughlin joins the show to discuss new polling that shows that 70% of those surveyed believe technology companies have too much power and need to be regulated. McLaughlin says that the President has been steadily gaining support despite the smears by Washington politicians and the media. Afterward, Secretary Mike Pompeo has indicated that Iran is on the move funding operations to secretly ramp up their nuclear program and fund proxy antagonists. One of the lead brokers of the controversial Obama-era Iran deal is now being floated for CIA Director. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
