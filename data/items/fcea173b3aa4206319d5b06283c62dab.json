  "description": "<p>It’s hard to think of two fields more closely intertwined than interior design and real estate—where one goes, so goes the other. On this week’s episode of the podcast, host <strong>Dennis Scully</strong> chats with two real estate experts to hear about how COVID-19 has affected the housing market, and what comes next. First, <strong>Leonard Steinberg</strong>, a veteran agent and the chief evangelist for tech-enabled brokerage Compass, discusses whether people will really flee cities en masse. Then, <strong>Shaun Osher</strong>, the founder of boutique real estate marketing firm Core, shares some insight into what the homes of tomorrow will look like.  <i>This episode is sponsored by Buildlane.</i></p>\n",
