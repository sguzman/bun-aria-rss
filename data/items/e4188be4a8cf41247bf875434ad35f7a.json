  "description": "Noriko Manabe’s new book is a compelling analysis of the content, performance style, and role of music in social movements in contemporary Japan. Paying special attention to the constraints that limit and censor people–both ordinary citizens and musicians–from speaking out on sensitive political issues, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima (Oxford University Press, 2015) focuses on the music of post-Fukushima antinuclear protests. Manabe looks carefully at the roles and motivations of musicians in Japan who have become involved in protest movements and demonstrations that reach across a range of physical and virtual spaces. This book will be of interest to any readers eager to learn more about modern Japan, protest movements, music, and the histories of nuclear power and its discontents.\n\nMake sure to check out the companion website, which includes lots of multi-media materials that articulate with the chapters of the book!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
