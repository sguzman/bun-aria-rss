    "media:description": "Ramattra’s story is complex and multifaceted, and his ultimate goal is to protect his people, but the cost of that goal is still to be determined.\n\nOriginally a war machine, Ramattra shed his munitions for a shield to protect his people by promoting peace and tranquility. His ideals weren’t far removed from his fellow Shambli monk, Zenyatta. However, Ramattra’s story is one of hardships, trauma, and a magnified view of humanity’s harsh realities.\n\nHarmony was replaced by dissonance, and Ramattra began to approach his convictions from a more pragmatic angle—justifying any means necessary to defend his fellow omnics. As the leader of Null Sector, Ramattra boasts incredible support from his people, and he is primed to impose his philosophies on our world.\n\nRamattra will join the tank lineup at the beginning of Season Two, starting December 6. \n\n#overwatch2 #overwatch #gaming",
