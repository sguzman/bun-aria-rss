The Karen says that OP is traumatizing her child because of OP's skin condition. When OP plays at the beach, this Karen is dumb enough to think that OP is contaminating the entire ocean with her vitiligo. Imagine scolding a child who isn't even yours just because they have a skin condition.</p>\n",
