  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the Republican Party is still Donald Trump’s party! Never Trumpers, RINOs, and the media despise this but it doesn’t matter because it’s not their party. The longer Joe Biden is president the clearer it becomes how many outstanding things Trump did as president, and the further left Biden goes the more people miss Trump. The media and the Washington establishment don’t understand that Trump’s contempt for them reflects our contempt for them. They’re so concerned about Trump and CPAC, but why? Because Biden is a screwup, lying about vaccines. The majority of the American people are smart enough to see what’s going on. Also, the proposed $1.9 Trillion Democrat Coronavirus bill would give Federal employees $1400/week for 15 weeks to stay home with their kids and have them attend virtual school, and we would be paying for all of it. It is the politicians, mostly left-wing politicians, who are creating an impossible future for this country, and it’s all wrapped up in the sake of righteousness. There is no reason for such a massive bill when the economy is on the rebound, which will be destroyed by more government spending. Later, Mark talks with Matt Schlapp about the CPAC conference and the future of the Conservative Party. Finally, Sen Mike Lee calls in to discuss his great speech at CPAC today.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
