  "description": "We know they’re good for the environment, good for automakers hoping to turn a healthy profit, and good for consumers looking to save money...but where are they? If electric vehicles are so promising...how come there isn’t one in every driveway?\nThat’s what we’re taking on today on Business Casual with Wall Street Journal autos reporter Ben Foldy. We’ll parse through the many literal and figurative speedbumps to widespread electric vehicle adoption, from infrastructure concerns to misaligned government incentive programs.\nIf our last episode was an optimistic nod to the future of transportation with General Motors CEO Mary Barra...this episode is the realistic accounting of when and how that future pans out.\nWant more Business Casual?
