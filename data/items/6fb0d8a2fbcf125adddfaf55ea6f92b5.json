  "description": "Well, we have a new leader in the NFC East. It wasn't pretty (in fact it was beyond ugly), but the Eagles emerged victorious over the Giants on Thursday Night Football to claim the division lead. To break down the matchup, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Cody Benjamin (1:00). In the loss, Daniel Jones became a meme as the G-Men coughed up a late lead, largely in part to a crucial Evan Engram drop. Carson Wentz and Philly then took advantage to complete the comeback. But after that escape, are we confident that the Eagles are actually the best team in the division? Quarterback is always the focus, but is it time to admit there are coaching concerns as well? On the other side, how much blame does Daniel Jones deserve seems to always be the pressing question in New York. He's not getting much help, but he also causes his own problems when he's not tripping over himself. After the game recap, the guys chat about the Vikings dealing Yannick Ngakoue to the Ravens (31:45). The future looks bleak in Minnesota and there could be more changes on the way. Inevitably, the conversation circles back to Wentz to wrap the pod.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @CodyJBenjamin, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
