Democrats restart January 6th hearings to distract from the 40-year high inflation numbers. Clay says, \"Inflation at 40-year highs is more of a threat to Democracy than anything that happened January 6th.\" Biden is on the road raising money from mega-rich donors who won't be affected by inflation. Bidenflation is driving up interest rates, won’t be long before you see 7% mortgage rates! Saudi Arabia confirms Biden attempted to coerce them to postpone oil cuts until after the midterms, announce they have rejected his quid pro quo. Buck says, \"All countries lie. They lie to their own people. They lie to other countries.\" When will we see the end of mask madness? C&B say some people will wear them for the rest of their lives, and expect you to, even though it's based on \"science gobbledgook.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
