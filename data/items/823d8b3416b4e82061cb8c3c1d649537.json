Tragically and unexpectedly, he died later that same day. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of some colleagues, his book, \"Referring to the World: An Opinionated Introduction to the Theory of Reference,\" has just been published. In this special episode, Josh and Ray discuss Ken’s ideas about reference with USC philosopher Robin Jeshion, who helped bring the book to fruition.",
