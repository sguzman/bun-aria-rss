  "description": "One thing about the tough guys in the Trump Administration, when it comes to foreign policy they sure do have colorful fantasies.  Mike Pompeo's wish list for Iran is as far fetched as a fairy-tale but less likely to come to life.  In North Korea, the president's hopes and dreams are just as impossible.  But some of his advisors have imaginations that run to the dark side and are served by the president having wishes that will go unfulfilled.  Which is why these fantasies might have an unhappy ending.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of IISS, and Bonnie Jenkins of WCAPS and Brookings join host David Rothkopf for a walk through the wonderland of Trump foreign policy.
