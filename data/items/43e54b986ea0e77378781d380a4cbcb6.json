  "description": "<p>Jennifer Kesse goes missing after a vacation with her boyfriend. Her apartment shows no signs of a struggle. Then her black Malibu is found in an apartment complex about a mile away.  DNA evidence is found. Fingerprints are found, but are they any help in identifying who took Jennifer?  What do the Kesses, Joyce and Drew,  know about the other evidence found? Very little, they say, because the police department will not turn what they found over to the parents. In fact, the Kesses had to sue.  Where do we go from here in finding Jennifer Kesse? </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
