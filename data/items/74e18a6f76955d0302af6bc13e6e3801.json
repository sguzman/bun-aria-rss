  "description": "<p>The Golden State Warriors are your 2022 NBA Champions. Hank was live on the wood for Game 6 and explains his experience. We give the Warriors their credit and Steph gets his signature Finals MVP as well as their likeability as a Dynasty. (00:03:13-00:38:06) We then talk Stanley Cup Final, US Open and our colleague is now the Commissioner of the Mike Trout Fantasy League. (00:39:31-00:53:37) Bob Harig joins us live from the US Open to talk about his new book Tiger & Phil, the LIV tour, the US Open course and more with bonus incredible Phil stories from back in the day. (00:54:56-01:24:05) Cubs Patrick Wisdom and Frank Schwindel join the show in studio to talk baseball and some poorly timed questions about Frank pitching in blowouts (taped last Thursday). (01:24:10-01:52:49) We finish with Fyre Fest of the week and Billy thinks he can not show up to work because he's a big shot who got drunk on Wednesday night.Â (01:53:49-02:22:24)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
