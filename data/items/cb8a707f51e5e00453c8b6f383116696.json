  "description": "<p>In this paper we establish a connection between the Gauss factorials and\nIwasawa's cyclotomic $\\lambda$-invariant for an imaginary quadratic field $K$.\nAs a result, we will explain a corespondance between the 1-exceptional primes\nof Cosgrave and Dilcher for $m = 3$ and $m = 4$, and the primes for which the\n$\\lambda$-invariants for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is\ngreater than one, respectively. We refer to the latter primes as\n``non-trivial'' for their respective fields. We will also see that similar\ncorrespondences are true for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$ when $d = 2,5$ and\n$6$. As a corollary we find that primes $p$ of the form $p^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1$\nare always non-trivial for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Last, we show that the\nnon-trivial primes $p$ for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nare characterized by modulo $p^2$ congruences involving Euler and Glaisher\nnumbers respectively.\n</p>",
