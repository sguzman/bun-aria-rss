  "description": "<p>We are especially grateful (and giddy) to be sharing this episode with our listeners! Brene Brown's work really gels with our core interests here on The Psychology Podcast, and the resulting conversation contains some enthusiastic and empirically informed banter that is sure to inform and delight. We geek out over some counter-intuitive findings, like how incredibly compassionate people have a tendency to set the most boundaries and say \"no.\" We discuss the power of being vulnerable and how the data suggests that it is one of the best predictors of courage. We chat about how trying to be cool is the enemy of truly being cool, how we can enrich future generation’s learning with wholehearted living, and how ignoring our creativity defies our essential nature. It’s ~45 minutes of two experts in the field sharing data, and themselves, and it’s one of our favorite episodes yet. </p> <p>We’re making a real effort to improve the show for our listeners and would hugely appreciate 15 seconds of your time filling out this short survey: <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsurvey.libsyn.com%2Fpsychologypodcast&h=UAQGEGL0KAQFLdbINZS0b3XtXjQdWzmrLjAdFelnsvuWlXQ&enc=AZP273ZlhJrWmFxcllHP-rcpXnU_NGLyh2cFiZtMG3nvuQdbRJCZqe6cAlylay6YBt2JjXK-hKd4XHKHeg0vvLzomLJ09eVfy1oJQZzmJJn4LKJwgApWOmrYvpkNAFc7RphTLx-x6Bw9H3WHjNvM0wpZhw7tBOXfnNQtIT9iazD4DXEaX5Q4o4ls8CbE27OphNGvwjyaGDJ6fC-YKnm2tlWW&s=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://survey.libsyn.com/psychologypodcast</a> (Email is not required).</p> <p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support\">https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</a></p>\n",
