Some of the questions we tackle: How do some snakes make venom? Why are some snakes venomous and others are not? Why do rattlesnakes have a rattle? How do snakes slither on the ground without legs? Why don’t snakes have legs? Why don’t snakes have ears? How do they smell with their tongues? Why do some snakes use heat vision? Do snakes sleep? Why do snakes stick out their tongues so much?</p>\n\n<p>Download our learning guides: <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/42/26/e99eb7c646f893f6ef7fe8ccc6a5/how-do-snakes-slither.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lDLDL6wjbwb5bTodQ7Z2fO03Wyr2rnP-K6s-J1Xkp2o/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/7e/c0/3a161d1343b7aef150102cfe540e/but-why-188-snakes-transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Snakes are ectothermic - meaning they are cold-blooded and rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature.
