  "description": "<p>There’s no better way to celebrate our 200th episode than with our own shining star: the sun! In this episode we speak with Dr. Nicola Fox, who leads a team of NASA scientists that sent a probe to collect data and zoom by the sun. We also hear some great listener suggestions on what new planet could be added to our solar system. We even get a chance to check in with The Sun and her weekly broadcast, <em>That’s Hot</em>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Our 200th episode wouldn’t be complete without a visit from some of our favorite pals: Bob, Gungador, Harvey and Elevator! Of course there’s a new Mystery Sound too. And the Moment of Um comes just in time for mosquito season, because it answers the question: Why do we itch?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for helping us make 200 episodes! We could never have done it without your questions and encouragement, and we can’t wait to make 200 more!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>ID Tech (<a href=\"http://idtech.com/brainson\" class=\"c-link\">idtech.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Sakara (<a href=\"http://sakara.com/brainson\" class=\"c-link\">sakara.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>GoHenry (<a href=\"http://gohenry.com/\" class=\"c-link\">gohenry.com</a> promo code: brainson)</p>\n",
