  "description": "Clay is solo today, as Buck is planning his wedding, following the exact path long-married Clay predicted to him. Department of Justice leaks to the New York Times: Trump had 300-plus classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Notice how fast the liberal narrative pivoted from January 6th to classified documents, \"sedition, insurrection, treason.\" Clay makes his legal case for AG Merrick Garland's removal from office. The Mainstream Media is carrying the water for the Biden administration on the Mar-a-Lago raid. What would the reaction be if Donald Trump had signed off on an FBI raid against his political rival? Why can't we have scandals like this in the U.S.: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin sorry for topless guest photos at official residence. Clay takes your calls.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
