  "description": "<p>In the United States, where <em>But Why</em> is based, we have a big election coming up. Election Day is officially on November 3rd. But more Americans than usual are voting in advance this year, sometimes in person at their town hall or city office. And sometimes by mailing in their ballot-that's the piece of paper where they mark down who they want to vote for. People in lots of states are voting for their governors, who help run their states, or their Congresspeople, who work in Washington to help run the country.</p>\n\n<p>But the position that's getting the most attention is the election for who will be president for the next four years. We learn about voting and elections with Erin Geiger Smith, reporter and author of <em>Thank You For Voting</em> and <em>Thank You For Voting Young Readers' Edition</em>.  Also: how does the government work? Why haven't we had girl presidents before? Why are Democrats called Democrats? Why are Republicans called Republicans?</p>\n\n<p>Download our learning guides: <a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/sites/vpr/files/202010/why_can_t_kids_vote_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UB0R841Ld7QDV8DKy10zxCuqYxvNvfklgAy5wPhxn68/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/sites/vpr/files/202010/But-Why-137-Elections-TRANSCRIPT.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/post/who-invented-president\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Who Invented The President?</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/post/who-makes-laws#stream/0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Who Makes The Laws? </a></p>",
