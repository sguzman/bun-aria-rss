  "description": "<p>Have you ever noticed an uptick in your mood after a great workout or a relaxing massage? This is no coincidence, thanks in part to serotonin. Serotonin is a dual hormone and neurotransmitter that’s responsible for several critical roles in the body, including modulating mood, aiding in digestion, memory formation, and much more.</p> <p>On this episode of The Model Health Show, we’re digging into the science behind one of the major chemicals responsible for happiness and health—serotonin. You’re going to learn about serotonin’s roles and responsibilities in the body, how it’s made, and how it interacts with other hormones and systems. You’ll hear how hormones and neurotransmitters work, plus exactly where serotonin is produced and stored in the body.</p> <p>In addition, we’re going to cover seven clinically proven ways to naturally boost your serotonin levels. These simple and effective tips can help you elevate your serotonin and in turn boost your mood. I hope you’ll find these strategies helpful and will consider integrating them into your routine.
