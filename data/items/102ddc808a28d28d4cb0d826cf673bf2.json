  "description": "Frank is the Chairman & CEO of Snowflake, a company he joined and rapidly accelerated in 2019. Frank led Snowflake to the largest software IPO in history (his third massive IPO as CEO). Previously, he grew Data Domain from $0 in revenue in 2003 to a ~$776M IPO in 2007 and then grew ServiceNow to a $22B market cap. In this episode you will learn the principles Frank uses to achieve outlier outcomes.\n\n1 - Attracting and cultivating high-performing talent. Getting the wrong people off the bus fast is critical. Frank prefers \"drivers\" to \"passengers.\"\n2 - Without risk-taking, the business will stagnate. Left to their own devices things slow to a \"glacial pace.\" CEOs should push to find the true limits of the organization.\n3 - Intellectual honesty is required. Copy-pasting strategy from previous roles is unacceptable. You need to develop deep conviction, while maintaining humility to course correct when you are wrong.\n4 - Culture and reputation are defined by your actions. CEOs must maintain an incredibly high bar.\n\nGet his book \"Amp It Up: Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency, and Elevating Intensity\" https://ampitupbook.com/",
