  "description": "<p>System of a Down’s classic Rick Rubin-produced album, <em>Toxicity,</em> turns 20 this year. Released in 2001 one week before 9/11, the<em> </em>politically charged and wildly bizarre album provided the perfect soundtrack for a world descending into chaos. Serj Tankian, the lead singer of System, is no stranger to conflict. His family is Armenian and migrated to Los Angeles from Lebanon to escape a civil war when Serj was seven years-old. Today we’ll hear Rick Rubin talk to his good friend Serj about how hearing bombs drop outside his childhood bedroom turned him into a lifelong activist. Serj also explains how a funny line about a tapeworm almost caused System to break up, and why the first time Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine heard System play, he called it music for crazy people.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite System of a Down songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4XpIMGlIg9fRA8ED6qDbOF?si=1b83965f8fcb431f\">HERE .</a> And hear a playlist Serj put together of his favorite tracks <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/61ASFwyfXMZXWdYJx17NnE?si=a97a93dbac2e4cf6\">HERE</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
