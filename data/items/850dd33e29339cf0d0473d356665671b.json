    "media:description": "What is space?  In this video, we learn about the many different things that we might call \"space\".  We come up with both a geometric and an algebraic definition, and the discussion also leads us to the important concept of subspaces.\n\nSorry for how long this video took to make!  I mentioned in a community post that I had personal things interfering with making this video, but even after that was out of the way, this video was really hard to make.  I kept rewriting parts of it to be less confusing, and a few changes I made required drastic modifications to whole video (for example, I was originally going to define linear combinations here but then decided to wait until the next video, but I had used linear combinations in the rest of this video so I had to remove all references to them).  Hopefully the video is worth the wait.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
