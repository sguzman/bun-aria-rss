  "title": "How Finding Your \"Why\" Can Transform Your Art [35]",
  "description": "<p>Today’s discussion was inspired by a book and TED talk by Simon Sinek, both entitled ‘Find Your Why.’ &nbsp;Sinek's main point is that when you know the purpose of what you are doing, it is so much easier to make the right decisions, achieve good results, and sell it to others.</p>\n<p>As artists, we can explore this on several levels - why do I make my art? Why am I making this particular series of paintings? And, at the granular level, why am I making this one specific painting?</p>\n<p>Our wide-ranging conversation spans the desire to create things, the need to be seen, the drive to communicate our internal experience, and whether what we are really seeking is love. (Deep stuff!) We also get into how you find your purpose. It isn’t something you can just come up with in 5 &nbsp;minutes. For most of us, it is a gradual process of discovery and it arises from the work we do. We also acknowledge that so much of this changes over time - even if we know our why at this moment, it may well change in future years.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Simon Sinek &nbsp;TED talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>See fuller show notes on our websites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
