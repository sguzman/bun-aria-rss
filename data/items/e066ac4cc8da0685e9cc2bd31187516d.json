  "description": "<p>The Orleans Waterfront Inn lies between Town Cove and Route 28 in Orleans, Massachusetts. This had been the home of a sea captain whose family had strong ties to Orleans and whose ancestors were pilgrims. The original building has been here for over 100 years and was said to be a favorite haunt of the Irish Mafia where they ran whiskey. This was reputedly a brothel for a time as well, where a lady of the evening lost her life. The inn was the scene of two suicides. Perhaps because of this history, the inn is reputedly haunted. Not far from Orleans is the town of Brewster. There are several haunted locations in this town from the Crosby Mansion to the Bramble Inn and Restaurant to the Captain Freeman Perry House. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Orleans Waterfront Inn and the town of Brewster.
