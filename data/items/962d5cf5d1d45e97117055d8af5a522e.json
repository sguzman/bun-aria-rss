    "media:description": "https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/\n\nThe upcoming Thrive release features a new art gallery feature, so I thought it was about time to realise my dream of creating a jazz remix of the Thrive Main Theme to act as light background music. It was pretty fun, and I didn't go crazy on the details to keep it quick and light. Hope you find it as infectiously rhythmic as I do.\n\nArt by Roseae.\n\nFor my many subscribers who may be new to Thrive, see the above link for more information.",
