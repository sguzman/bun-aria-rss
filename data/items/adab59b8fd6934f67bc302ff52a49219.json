  "description": "<p>Virginia City is an Old West mining town complete with a history of gun fights, explosions, brothels and mine cave-ins. The Comstock Lode was found in the Virginia Range near the future Virginia City and prospectors came looking for an alternative to the Gold Rush. Samuel Clemens was one of them. And when his luck at finding precious ore proved lacking, he took a job at the local paper and adopted the name we all know him by today: Mark Twain. The richer men in the city wanted a place to call their own and the Washoe Club was built for those millionaires. It is the oldest saloon in the city. And it is one of the most haunted locations in a reputedly very haunted town. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Old Washoe Club. The Moment in Oddity features James Chaffin's ghost leading his family to a will and This Day in History is by Kristin Swintek and features the Black Sox Scandal. Our location was suggested by listeners Tara Williams-Case and Jeni Justine.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-140-washoe-club.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-140-washoe-club.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
