  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In November, seven states (both red and blue) had initiatives on their ballots to either decriminalize or legalize some drugs including marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and LSD. Every measure passed. As the U.S. continues to rapidly abandon its war on drugs, how should Christians respond? And if these addictive and dangerous substances are legalized, what happens next? Bonnie Kristian is back to talk about her recent op-ed arguing for an end to the drug war from an evangelical perspective. Also this week, another celebrity pastor has been removed from ministry causing Katelyn Beaty to ask, do we have a hot pastor problem? The crew debate why we want our church leaders to be attractive performers rather than spiritual leaders. A new study finds the U.S. is becoming more secular AND more religious at the same time. How do we bridge the divide? Plus, the Chinese pay $2 million for a Belgian pigeon.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/november-web-only/christians-believe-we-end-drug-war-to-win-it.html</p>",
