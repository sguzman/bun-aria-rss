  "description": "We revisit with  Kyle Henderson to talk about the past and current production of Angel's Envy with their new distillery and all the decisions and mistakes that came along with it. Kyle has a great excuse to build a bunker with \"competitive tasting\" that has amassed him over 1600 bottles of spirits and now he's getting into barrel aged beers and cigars. Kyle hints at a future of bottled-in-bond Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey and putting an end to their sourced whiskey years down the road. What else is in their future? Listen and find out!\nShow Notes:\n\nKyle, You haven’t been back on the show since  episode 13 back in May of 2015. Before we dive into what’s new, talk about you again for a moment.\n\nHow you came up in the ranks, became a part of the family lineage, etc?\n\nYou’re also not a newbie to the bourbon scene. I know you have quite a collection so talk about that too.\n\nHow has your role changed now that this distillery is up and running?\n\nNow that you have your own distillery, could we see an Angel's Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey?\n\nThat’s no where near the amount needed for sustaining supply of your product so sourcing is still a big means. Is there a future plan to cut off sourcing?\n\nWhat has it taken for you to get up to speed to now understand distillation as well as outgrowing the co-packer?\n\nDid you all have input on the design of your stills?\n\nTalk about on-boarding and finding the right people\n\nTalk about clocking barrels real quick\n\nWhat was the benefit of the  Bacardi buy out?\n\nHow many barrels are you pumping out a day?\n\nThat’s no where near the amount needed for sustaining supply of your product so sourcing is still a big means. Is there a future plan to cut off sourcing?",
