With the spookiest day of the year coming close, we’re going to tell you all our terrible real estate tales. Everyone on podcasts and YouTube wants to show you how easy it is to invest, how it’s an assured path to wealth, and rarely what <strong>type of mistakes you can make</strong>. But we’re flipping the script, bringing in some of the best and brightest in real estate to show that the grass is usually greener where the septic tank is.</p><p>Today’s guests, who have all collectively succeeded at failing, are <strong>Andrew Cushman</strong>, <strong>Jamil Damji</strong>, and <strong>Matt Faircloth</strong>.
