  "title": "Ep 93 | Why Eric Weinstein Is Finally Talking to Glenn Beck | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Eric Weinstein is not a conservative, but he talks to conservatives because he says, more often, they’re the ones who let him speak his mind without branding him (a Jew) a Nazi. He tells Glenn why, after many requests over the last few years, he finally agreed to this podcast. In the aftermath of the U.S. Capitol riot and President Trump’s second impeachment, Eric and Glenn probe the historical, economic, social, and even scientific reasons for the events of the last week. They also tackle some of the hardest questions our country faces: What do we do about a power-grabbing Big Tech, a dishonest media, Wokistan vs. MAGAstan, and the destruction of American culture? How do we restore civility between the Left and the Right? How do we save the UNITED States of America? In an honest conversation that will stretch your comfort zone, Glenn and Eric show us where to start.\n\t\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\n﻿Protecting his family is Glenn's No. 1 priority. But he wants to do it SAFELY. The people at Axon Taser believe that SAFER self-defense is BETTER self-defense. Use the promo code “BECK” at TASER.com. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
