    "media:description": "Thanks to PlayStation for the early Spider-Man Remastered review code.\n\nSupport the show on Patreon - http://patreon.com/writingongames\n\nPodcast - http://anchor.fm/writingongamescast\n\nSecond Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1xxfS_HILi09yaELQdmV1A\n\n---\n\nI recently got the chance to play through and analyse Spider-Man Remastered on PC, four years after the original PS4 release in 2018 blew me away with the focus of its open world design—a rarity in the genre. Not only was it a blast to play, but this focus meant that every single element of the game was used to convey some element of Spider-Man/Peter Parker's character, right down to the load screens—which now, thanks to SSDs and the PC release, some players might never see. Thankfully, as this analysis/review will go into, Spider-Man Remastered is so mechanically and narratively robust that, even four years later, it remains a high watermark for not just open world design, but Spider-Man as a whole.\n\nA WORD ON SPOILERS: This Spider-Man Remastered analysis discusses certain plot points and characters (including DLC), so viewer discretion is advised. Maybe play the game then come back if you want to go in blind.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:40 - Spider-Man Remastered Absolutely Rules\n3:34 - Completion\n5:48 - Storytelling Through Combat\n8:57 - The Crushing Inevitability of Doctor Octopus\n11:22 - The Emotional Rollercoaster of Act 3\n13:53 - Mary-Jane Watson\n14:25 - The Unbearable Stealth Missions\n15:46 - DLC: The Good!\n17:56 - DLC: The Bad!\n19:35 - Was Spider-Man Always Good?\n\n---\n\nThumbnail by HotCyder - http://twitter.com/hotcyder\nIntro text animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames",
