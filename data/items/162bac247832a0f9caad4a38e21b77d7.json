  "description": "<p>This week's show was inspired by a listener question about in situ apps. These are apps that allow you to place your artwork into rooms, so that buyers can see how your painting might look in a 'real world' setting. We share our experiences of using several of these apps - and talk about the pros and cons of each - but we also expand the discussion to encompass real-world settings as well as the importance of storytelling and copy in showcasing your work online. Louise proposes that the words you write about your work are just as important as the images you include, and we share some suggestions for how to approach that aspect of marketing. We also answer a fabulous question from Esther who wants to know whether her art needs to match her room decor.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><em>Smartist &nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://smartist.app/\"><u><em>https://smartist.app/</em></u></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>In Situ </em><a href=\"https://insituartroom.com/\"><u><em>https://insituartroom.com/</em></u></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Canvy online) &nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://canvy.com/pricing\"><u><em>https://canvy.com/pricing</em></u></a><em> &nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Alchemy by Rory Sutherland &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Alchemy-Audiobook/1473566800\"><u>https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Alchemy-Audiobook/1473566800</u></a></p>\n<p>June Shapter: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juneshapterart/?hl=en\"><u>https://www.instagram.com/juneshapterart/?hl=en</u></a><u><br>\n<br>\n</u>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
