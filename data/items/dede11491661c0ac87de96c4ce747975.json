  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about last night's preseason game between the Bears and the Seahawks, what we should expect from both teams, if the Bears are going to be better than everyone anticipates, some potential dark times on the horizon for all the 12's in Seattle, and the new secondary Monday Night Football booth consisting of Steve Levy, Louis Riddick, and Dan Orlovsky. Joining the progrum to chat about the rumors swirling about whether or not Jimmy G was a good teammate in San Francisco and why that may be why teams aren't all that interested in him is San Francisco 49ers beat writer for The Athletic, David Lombardi (43:04-54:06). Later, NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport joins the show from the side of a highway to chat more about Deshaun Watson's suspension and what it means, and anything else we should keep our eyes on this 2nd week of the NFL preseason (1:14:23-1:22:49).
