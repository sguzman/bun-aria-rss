  "description": "A few years back, the Ongoing History took a \"break\".\nIt's a long and somewhat complicated story, but we eventually picked up where we left off. \nThis episode is the start of OGH v2.0 and a catch up from Alan's \"Walk about\" in the 3 years between the original radio episodes 691 and 692 of which this Podcast is based on. \nSo please don't be confused if the radio episodes and podcast episode numbers don't add up. We're just digging into our vault to see what we can find and share. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
