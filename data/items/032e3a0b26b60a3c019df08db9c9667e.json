  "description": "<p>Some little girls dream of meeting a Care Bear or Barbie doll growing up, but not Bunnie. She dreamt of hanging out with today's guest - the bad ass legend, Air Force Amy. You don't really know Las Vegas until you know Amy, so Bunnie starts with how she went from serving in the Air Force to being a living legend in the industry and the top all-time earner at the Bunny Ranch. She and Amy also talk about the history of legal brothels, how her work has been affected during the pandemic, and the changing landscape of the industry to feature more collaboration than competition between girls. Amy also gives us a sneak peek into what we can expect from her tell-out book, out soon. </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Bunnie:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dumbblondeunrated.com\">www.dumbblondeunrated.com</a></span></p> <p><strong>Air Force Amy: <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/theairforceamy/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://onlyfans.com/airforceamy\">OnlyFans </a> | <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQuic3pPFTTs8kbM4v5JPOw\">YouTube</a> </strong></p> <div class=\"gmail_default\"><a href= \"https://chickenranchbrothel.com/\">The Chicken Ranch </a></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"><a href=\"https://redrooster.vegas/\">The Red Rooster</a></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"> </div> <ul> <li class=\"gmail_default\">\"What is too sexual to you?
