  "title": "PMS 2.0 438 - Two Great Conversations With Chris Long & Fred Taylor",
  "description": "<p>Today's show is anchored by two incredible conversations. First, Pat and the boys are joined by 2x Super Bowl Champion, #2 pick of the 2008 NFL Draft, 11 year NFL veteran, and host of the Green Light Pod, Chris Long to chat about his brother's injury, how he's enjoying life as a media member, what he likes about the daily media grind as opposed to the daily grind of the NFL, his thoughts on the Toradol situation and what other remedies he tried while playing in the league, and much more (20:00-48:49). Later, 13 year NFL RB, a man who holds nearly every Jacksonville Jaguars offensive record, future Hall of Famer, and co-host of the I Am Athlete Podcast, Fred Taylor joins the show to chat about his career, his thoughts about going into the Hall of Fame, his initial impressions of Urban Meyer, if the Tim Tebow legend is crazy down in Jacksonville, how he thought Ocho Cinco performed in his boxing match, and more (48:51-1:03:47). Pat and the boys also chat about the Madden 22 cover reveal, more drama in the Aaron Rodgers/Packers situation, Zion reportedly being unhappy in New Orleans, and more.
