  "description": "Food safety is a huge aspect of how Ghost Kitchen will control most of the digital landscape for the future and understanding the demand on a restaurant brand will be huge for both consumer awareness and brand impact. Maybe this is why we are seeing David Change make a quick exit from Reef Kitchens with reported food safety concerns.<br /><br />The issue stems from reports from Business Insider and Restaurant Dive that Reef's units served undercooked food and routinely failed safety inspections. Fuku has moved to Kitchen United according to a press release.<br /><br />Metaverse for restaurantsThis may be the new wild west for restaurants and how this integrates into brand building, digital payment, order placement, gamification and so much more. My deep-level reporting on my show Tech Path explores the Metaverse and the blockchain and how Web 3 could shift the sands of digital to a completely new understanding of how digital restaurants will be realized in the future. Applebees and McDonalds have tested the waters with the recent sale of NFT's and the entrance into a new creator-related Metaverse play. <br /><br />The biggest point to notice here is the massive lack of awareness to what is happening in this area for technology as related to the restaurant industry - though not a surprise when I look back on how restaurants were highly unprepared for social media in 2007, the early adopters will be the winners once again.<br /><br />Looking for Metaverse and Blockchain strategies for your restaurant?",
