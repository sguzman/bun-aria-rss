  "description": "Ruby Ridge. August 21, 1992. An isolated cabin in northern Idaho owned by Randy Weaver and his family is being monitored by US Marshals due to his missing a court date for a federal weapons violation charge. When the family's dog alerts them to danger, shots are fired leaving the man's son, his dog, & a Marshal dead. The government's response would be strong. 400+ officers, including snipers that were under rules to shoot armed adults on the property. Before the standoff ended, two more from the cabin would be injured and one more would die. How did the situation escalate so quickly? Was the government justified in changing the rules of engagement? Ruby Ridge was intended to provide an escape from tyrannical government, but for the Weavers it had the opposite effect.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
