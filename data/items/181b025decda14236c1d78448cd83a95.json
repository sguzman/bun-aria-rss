In the competition, users are given a limit of 140 characters to create the most incredible output, which is then judged blindly based on brevity, aesthetics and original use of Wolfram Language.<span id=\"more-86050\"></span></p>\n<p>This year, however, we decided to take it to the next level by including the very first Get Visual Competition. Users were encouraged to create the most visually stunning graphic output, without the character restriction.</p>\n<p>In both competitions, entries were judged blindly. Attendees of the conference and, for the first time, Wolfram employees were welcome to participate. Judging criteria were based on aesthetics, understanding of the output and original use of Wolfram Language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"one-liner-competition\">One-Liner Competition </h2>\n<p>The One-Liner Competition focused on the user’s ability to create a unique and stunning output in 140 characters or fewer without the use of 2D typesetting constructs or pulling linked data.</p>\n<h3>Honorable Mention</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:Bold\">Nikolay </span><span style=\"font-weight:Bold\">Murzin: </span><em>Ukraine </em>(140 characters)</p>\n<p>While this competition does not officially have an honorable mention placement, judges have awarded honorable mentions in previous competitions for exceptional submissions.
