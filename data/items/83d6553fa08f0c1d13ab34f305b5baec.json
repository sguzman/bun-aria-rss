  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, do you think that dating rules for seniors are different than those for younger people? I need to know cause I am trying to find love again and I’m over age 60. I'd like to think that a man aged 65 to 70 would think and act differently than he did when he was 25 to 30 years old, but that's not the case. When I meet men my age, they are still interested in the cookie and I need to know if I should still be using the 90 Day Rule at my age. Then there are the other men that I meet and they voluntarily tell me that the cookie is a non-issue for them now............</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
