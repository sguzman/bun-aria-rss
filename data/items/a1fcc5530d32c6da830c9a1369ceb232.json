Attorney Dick Harpootlian and attorney Jim Griffin filed a motion to compel prosecutors to reveal evidence. It's been more than a month since Murdaugh was indicted by a state grand jury of murdering is wife and son. Harpootlian said the motion asked Judge Clifton Newman to order that evidence be turned over to the defense “immediately without delay.”  Part of that evidence, according to FITSNews,  is high-velocity spatter found on a shirt worn by Murdaugh that may show he was present at the time his wife and son were murdered.    In the last days, Judge Clifton Newman ordered the evidence released, along with a temporary protective order in place, that is to ensure only lawyers and people testifying will be able to see the evidence.</p>\n<p>   </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Susan E.
