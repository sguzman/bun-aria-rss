  "description": "<p>Seeing Basic Goodness - Part 2 (2018-05-23) - Most of us long to trust our goodness, but get caught in stories of deficiency and striving to affirm we’re ok. These talks look at the block to realizing the loving awareness that is our essence, and the practices that help us see this essential goodness - in ourselves, dear ones and in those we might habitually consider different or “other.” Both talks include reflections that can help us appreciate the basic goodness that lives through these precious, changing forms.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p>",
