  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Owen Flanagan, Dr Céline Leboeuf, Dr Emily McRae, Professor Jesse J Prinz | Is anger sometimes a useful emotion? It is often suggested that we should try to suppress our anger. Perhaps passion is a virtue, but anger is simply unproductive. But might anger be useful for achieving positive social change? Can it help us make better moral judgments (or even form part of those judgements)? Can 'good' anger be distinguished in a principled way from 'bad' anger? How do different schools of thought answer these questions?",
