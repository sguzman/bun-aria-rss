  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, joins the show to give his first reaction to President Biden's 2nd press conference of his Presidency. Trump said he really wants Biden to do well if he can. Trump commented on Biden's weakness indicating that he expected Vladimir Putin to take advance into Ukraine. Trump also mentioned that there was no vaccine hesitancy during his Administration, surmising that the American people simply don't trust Biden because of his initial anti-vaccine rhetoric. Then, Trump said Biden's reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan is the lowest moment in the history of our country. Trump criticized the 2020 election as a third world election adding that Democrats must be stopped from conducting a federal takeover of US elections. Later, in breaking news, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has just issued a decision to deny Trump's request for executive privilege on records that might pertain to January 6th; Every justice except for Justice Clarence Thomas declined Trump's request. The politicized Court has now opened the door for every future former president to have their sealed records subpoenaed by congress. Afterward, Democrats insist on destroying the voting system in the name of voting rights. One more lie to gain political power under the guise of preventing, what they call, the death of democracy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
