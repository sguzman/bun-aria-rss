  "description": "<p>Just the mere mention of the name Bruce Lee conjures visions of martial arts fighting and movies. Bruce Lee fought discrimination to become the most famous American of Asian descent. He is considered the most influencial martial artist of all time. Fame was elusive and once found, it perhaps was not what Bruce Lee had dreamed it would be. His candle did not burn long as he died at the young age of 32. Some say it was a curse that took his life. A curse that carried over and took the life of his actor son Brandon Lee as well. Could it be the early deaths of these two young men that has led to their spirits being at unrest? Was it a curse that plagued the Lees? Come with us as we explore the life and afterlife of Bruce Lee. Moment in Oddity features strange German rules of the past and This Day in History features the Navy ending its use of flogging.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-72-life-and-afterlife-of.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-72-life-and-afterlife-of.html</a></p> <p>Love the show?
