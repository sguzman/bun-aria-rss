  "description": "<p>How do you raise your self-confidence and self-worth?</p> <p>Today, I want to talk about self-esteem and self-worth. This is a topic that comes up a lot in our Kwik Brain community. My goal is to communicate with you as these conversations come up to discuss them in-depth.</p> <p>Many of you know I had a head injury when I was a kid. That caused learning challenges, making me feel like I didn't fit in because I didn't know things. I think it's common to want not only to fit in but also to stand out.</p> <p>In my mind, self-esteem is your own perception of your self-worth. But what does it mean to truly believe in yourself? Listen in as I talk about two keys that helped me build my confidence.</p> <p>If you're inspired, I want to invite you to join me in my brand NEW 7-day course, specifically designed to boost your confidence. I know it sounds too good to be true, but I give you step-by-step guides using the accelerated learning model to make you unstoppable in a short time.
