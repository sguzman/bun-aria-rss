  "description": "<p>Theo Von is one of the most hilarious standup comedians to watch today. Check out his podcast The Past Weekend and his comedy special on Netflix. His conversation with Joe was silly and lots of fun. This is a great opportunity to learn about the ridiculous side of Theo. They both had a great time and I really enjoyed their podcast.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
