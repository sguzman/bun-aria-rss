  "title": "Ep 106 | Segregation Survivor: How to Counter BLM's FALSE Racial Narrative | Bob Woodson | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Civil rights activist and Woodson Center founder Bob Woodson has lived through segregation and been a victim of racism. But he doesn’t fit the Left’s mold. In fact, he’s providing an alternative narrative to their “equity.” With the Woodson Center and 1776 Unites, he is offering solutions that BLM rejects, but that are actually helping improve the lives of countless people trapped in poverty and inner-city violence. He goes through all of this and more in his latest book, “Red, White, and Black: Rescuing American History from Revisionists and Race Hustlers.” And he joins Glenn to make the case that the radical Left does not represent the majority of the black community. As leftist race-baiters make millions off branding the police as white supremacists while breaking the spirits of Americans of ALL races, Woodson calls out their moral treason, speaks truth to power, and denounces real racism for what it truly is: evil.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
