  "description": "The Last Master Outlaw. In 1971, a man boarded a plane and would demand $200k in cash. The flight crew believed that this man, whose name was given as Dan Cooper, had carried a bomb aboard the aircraft in a briefcase and the threat was taken seriously. Later, after acquiring the ransom money, he would parachute out of the plane with the money. His identity was never discovered. Many years later, a team of researchers led by Thomas J. Colbert would reveal the name of the man they discovered to be the hijacker of the Boeing 727. In 2016, a book was published with the title, 'The Last Master Outlaw' by Colbert who was also on the History Channel's documentary, 'D.B. Cooper: Case Closed?' released that same year. On this episode, Colbert explains the story behind the research that led he and his team to the most famous hijacker of all time. A man that will forever be known as D. B. Cooper.
