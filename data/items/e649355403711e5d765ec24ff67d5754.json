On today’s show, we’re giving some tips for finding a sewing charity to support and how to get involved this holiday season. We give an update on our own charity: the One Million Pillowcase Challenge. We also share some fun holiday programs we think you’ll love, and some items on our quilty wish list.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-488-sew-for-charity-well-get-you-started\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
