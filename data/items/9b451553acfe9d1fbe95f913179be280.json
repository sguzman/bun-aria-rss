  "description": "<p>Benjamin Gibbard may follow you in the dark, but he will not follow you in the trendy brunch spot in your neighborhood. On this episode on HOW DID WE GET WEIRD?, we catch up with the frontman for Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service to discuss 20 years of random Bayer hangouts ranging from breakfast to Bonnarroo, what being vegan was like during DCFC's early years and why he is unlikely to become the spokesman for Dunkin' Donuts anytime soon. We also discuss taping songs off the radio as a teenager, the enduring influence of Minor Threat and why \"ordering something for the table\" is the best way to get something indulgent without a side order of guilt.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
