  "description": "<p>The goal of this work is to localize sound sources in visual scenes with a\nself-supervised approach. Contrastive learning in the context of sound source\nlocalization leverages the natural correspondence between audio and visual\nsignals where the audio-visual pairs from the same source are assumed as\npositive, while randomly selected pairs are negatives. However, this approach\nbrings in noisy correspondences; for example, positive audio and visual pair\nsignals that may be unrelated to each other, or negative pairs that may contain\nsemantically similar samples to the positive one. Our key contribution in this\nwork is to show that using a less strict decision boundary in contrastive\nlearning can alleviate the effect of noisy correspondences in sound source\nlocalization. We propose a simple yet effective approach by slightly modifying\nthe contrastive loss with a negative margin. Extensive experimental results\nshow that our approach gives on-par or better performance than the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of\na negative margin to existing methods results in a consistent improvement in\nperformance.\n</p>",
