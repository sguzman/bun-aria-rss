  "description": "How many times will the press blow up a story with hand-wringing and fear-mongering and 24/7 coverage… only to drop it like a hot potato at the start of the next news cycle? Take Zika for example… The mosquito-borne virus causes mild (if any) symptoms, but it’s been linked to birth defects. And when the 2016 Summer Olympics were held in Rio de Janeiro, many athletes (and spectators) didn’t go due to widespread fears over the virus. Fast forward to today. There’s no epidemic… no panic… and no story. It’s no different with the constant headlines about tariffs… Except I’m going to tell you when (and why) to buy stocks on tariff news! Trust me… This is even better than a drinking game. I welcome back John Petrides, managing director and portfolio manager at  [19:38]. We cover an array of topics and, of course, John breaks down his favorite sectors and the stocks he likes right now. And you don’t want to miss my educational segment [48:41]. I divulge an investing secret—a lesson I’ve learned over my long career. This isn’t something you’ll read about in any books… but it’ll help you become a better investor for the long term. -------------------------------- P.S. I just released an incredible new report for  members. If you’re not yet a member, keep an eye on your inbox for how to access this name… It’s a tiny new company testing a game-changing device that could send the stock soaring 1,000% or more. And don’t miss the wild footage of me trying out the device.
