  "description": "We kick off this week's program with an update regarding Boko Haram in Nigeria. From there it is Estonia that had an interesting story on the topic of anti-spying tactics. Modi is the big winner in India, along with the BJP. Assad had his own election which when combined with other developments tell a significant story about Syria today. European Elections came and went, were things as dramatic as the press indicates? 25 years later, Tiananmen Square is remembered, particularly through photos.
