  "description": "After Thursday’s board of governors call with Adam Silver, the NBA has almost unanimously approved the league’s plan to return with eight regular-season games followed by a play-in tournament for the 8th seed in each conference. Now all that’s left is for the players union to approve the plan and for each team to get to Orlando and ramp up to play. We discuss potential challenges the teams will face getting ready to play competitively again (0:49), and then we open up the mailbag to answer your questions about the return plan, the league’s openness to potential player protests during games or the national anthem, and more (21:03).\n\nHosts: Chris Vernon and Kevin O’Connor\nLearn more about your ad choices.
