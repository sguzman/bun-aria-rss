  "description": "<p>On November 25, 2019, 29-year-old Daniel Reoch was in the custody of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Squamish, British Columbia. They picked Daniel up while walking along a rural road in temperatures just barely above freezing, and he was not dressed for the weather. Daniel called his uncle, but something didn’t seem right- his demeanor was off, he was in the midst of a crisis- and the police and Daniel’s family were concerned. But they couldn’t hold him, and he was released from custody that evening. Twelve hours later, he’d vanish into the dark of night, walking off into the darkness of another road in a rural part of the Squamish Valley, never to be seen again.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Daniel Reoch, please call the Squamish Royal Canadian Mounted Police at 604-892-6100. You may also call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-(TIPS).&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
