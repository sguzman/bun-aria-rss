  "description": "Santa is not the only one who knows whether you have been naughty or nice.  The rest of the Deep State knows too.  And by the rest of the Deep State, we mean...yes, Santa is one of us.  Of course.  On this episode, using our intelligence assets on the North Pole and elsewhere we pluck some thorns from the Crown of Entropy and distribute them to the people, ideas and events of 2018 that most deserve them.  Join Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, David Sanger of the New York Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times for this year-end round-up unlike any other.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
