  "description": "A bipartisan group of Senates say they have reached a deal on a package of safety and gun-related measures. The deal is not yet done, but lawmakers say they are closer than they've been in a long time. <br/><br/>The package includes measures to enhance background checks for gun buyers under 21, incentivize states to pass so-called \"red flag laws,\" and fund school safety and mental health initiatives. Is it enough? We put that question to Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who was injured in a 2011 shooting. Since then, Giffords has dedicated her life to calling for action on gun control, co-founding <a href=\"https://giffords.org/\">Giffords</a>, an advocacy group that promotes gun safety. The group's executive director, Peter Ambler, also spoke to NPR. <br/><br/>Help NPR improve podcasts by completing a short, anonymous survey at <a href=\"http://npr.org/podcastsurvey\">npr.org/podcastsurvey</a>. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
