  "description": "<p>The recording industry is in a bind, with the big money going to intermediaries like Spotify, with little idea of what makes a star these days, and with a critical culture that no longer knows what it's talking about. Meanwhile, industrial knowledge about how to record music in a room, or even how to play instruments, is lost and ignored in favor of computers and algorithms. Zach and Jessa discuss the real world effects of prioritizing the plastic over the human and why most music sounds flat these days.</p> <p>http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</p>",
