  "description": "<p>Work by scholars from the late 19th century had established that five sources lay behind the Pentateuch. They came to be known by letters: J, E, P, and D. These theories were a mainstay of biblical studies until recently.

I also find out why the Bible is divided into chapters and verses.</p>",
