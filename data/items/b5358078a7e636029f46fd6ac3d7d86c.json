  "description": "<p>In this fifty-sixth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, Anthony and Eric talk with Grace Cebrero, a rising star in philosophy, a graduate of Mount Saint Mary’s University, and an alumna of the Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute. We talk with Grace about “Inclusion and Philosophy.”</p> <p>Grace has worked as a research intern for a professor at MSMU and has been recognized a number of times in impressive ways. She was a leader on campus, furthermore, having revived Mount Saint Mary’s Philosophy Club known as “The Seekers.” She has been recognized as a University of Michigan Compass Scholar and as an Iris Marion Young Fellow in the PIKSI program at Penn State University. She received two Mount Saint Mary’s President’s Awards, including the Mother Margaret Mary Brady Founder’s Award and the Sister Dolorosa Alumnae Courage Award. She’s also won two awards from the Philosophy department. She is pursuing graduate study next and was greatly inspired and encouraged by her experience in the PIKSI program. We ask Grace about that, but also more generally about inclusion and exclusion in philosophy education.</p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href=\"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
