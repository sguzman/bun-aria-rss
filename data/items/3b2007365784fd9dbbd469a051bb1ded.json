  "description": "<p>What's keeping you back from living the life you want? For most of us, it's finances. In this episode, I get real with you. Money is the thing that's blocking most of us from having the freedom, education, wellness, travel experience, mental peace and opportunities we so badly desire. There is nothing \"unspiritual\" about talking about money-- in fact, in order to take care of ourselves and help others, we need it.</p> <p>I share: 1. Why financial self-care needs to be part of our self-care routine 2. Exercise to go back to your oldest memory with money 3. MY oldest memory with money and why I learned young that if you want to choose the ice-cream flavor, you need the dough 4. Why abundance is a mindset 5. The laws of money and the things we are doing that are holding back our flow 6. Why spiritual people need to get more comfortable with thinking about their finances-- and how that's the very thing holding many of us back 7. Why playing small is keeping your impact small 8. The very big thing I did to celebrate my abundance and how it has forever changed my life (and the lives of others) Take your notepads out-- this episode is one you will want to relisten to!</p> <p>Share your #financialselfcare practices on Instagram and tag @iamsahararose to be featured on my story!</p> <p>Be part of a community that supports you discovering your dharma in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood collective with community, content, creativity and so much more — learn more about rosegoldgoddesses.com.</p> <p>Sponsor a Cambodian child and make a life-changing difference in an entire family's life with cambodianchildrensfund.org<br /> <br /></p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Discover your Dharma with my free quiz at https://iamsahararose.com/</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at: Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books Eat Feel Fresh + Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda: https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
