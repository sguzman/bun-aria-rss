  "description": "Joined by her very own mother you would think some topics of conversation would be off limits. Nope! To get in the holiday spirit Sofia decided to spend some quality time with her mom, Lola. Together they recount some of their craziest memories together. Most notably when Lola walked in on a 17 year old Sofia seducing her boyfriend in a candlelit bathtub, or when she was mugged by a monkey in Thailand. It hasn’t always been the smoothest road raising Sofia, but it’s clear that this apple did not fall far from the tree, and the Mother Sloot tells us why. HAPPY THANKSGIVING SLOOTS! \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nEpisode promo codes: \nNDW Labs/DHM Detox: nodayswasted.co/SOFIA30\nShipstation: SOFIA\nJenni Kayne: SOFIA\nPurple Mattress: www.purple.com/SOFIA10\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
