We often experience shame because we often think that there must be something wrong with us, or we think that we always fail and are so bad at all this “life” stuff. But that’s not the case at all! So in this episode I share how to correctly rewire your brain to create sustainable habits, why positive affirmations are not sustainable solutions, why giving up on goals may actually be a good thing, and more!</p>\n<p>Show blog: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/are-new-year-s-resolutions-just-another-form-of-toxic-positivity-why-positive-affirmations-dont-work-in-the-long-run</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Blinkist, one of my favorite ways to pass the time while exercising and build my brain, which improves mental resilience!:&nbsp;</strong>To get your free week on&nbsp;Blinkist<strong> </strong>AND 25% off your subscription see:<a href=\"http://trk.klclick2.com/ls/click?upn=MmY-2FnptVtHRyKtjJtU1ebYGB2b0MH6ZDAiQvYe2VFPVDier3c20njxeoBjFALPivAHf0VRiaLg6kMH6sgTVImFoIVg-2BS6smq09RqS6ae0ojyWPPa6Gy5NOT0jUBBVXCaUe8w0it0dy4JgvYYDBLdc4Nzb7jnS8TP7mUKCBDXZPHkQeosb-2FdAOmEDif9DY2oUzZ6XFDD-2Bi3Md-2Bw4XJuh8pWHd3dy3wOcxaw2F7DH4mkg-3DkTEh_Ax-2FA2qB5XxIif0IVCV8oUyjHrcnlzjXWS7Y2GCv6POzseLtuqe0H-2FcSpDYs3C97YgpAAdPDsMI0A-2B6-2F8TslxOvq9jFwij60hLTpTGj92k-2B3uoe-2FJkQoT-2BfP3nqOKIy3PVrNqQeHI2yMtebygL7ReXD1-2BDBiDGSuR9ATDWl4K0RXTC8LRY-2BYayW1YQBcwQtuZFvgAJfF0M9LVSUNVonqQ-2B-2FHI-2BzrxmwcsfIGnD7Re1d6LslplYx2gt4jjUE3ak9rbZduFA0B1E9ifbwlzxgn-2F7dOoQjHVld9B5af3RT-2FcycnyEhmfc3W52rRfcR72DzhIa-2FOf7xwPTAIn2qnzTM1X5JrKY1MNIJ0fZk1iaiZ94-2BX38FIe2QHUPQK-2FQiftQhBkjUh5qHTAoDbL4lDkH9X9jg-3D-3D\">&nbsp;https://www.blinkist.com/nc/partners/cleaning-up-the-mental-mess</a></p>\n<p><strong>BiOptimizers’s Leaky Gut Guardian, which is a great way to heal your gut and improve your immune health!</strong> Use code DRLEAF10 for 10% off any order at&nbsp;https://www.bioptimizers.com/drleaf</p>\n<p><strong>Jenni Kayne, my favorite&nbsp;online store with a&nbsp;a beautiful selection of clothes and home&nbsp;goods.</strong>&nbsp;Get 15% off your first order when you use code DRLEAF at checkout: https://www.jennikayne.com</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>PODCAST HIGHLIGHTS:</p>\n<p><strong>1:49</strong> How New Year’s resolutions can be a form of toxic positivity</p>\n<p><strong>2:46</strong> It is okay to change or even not make a New Year’s resolution!</p>\n<p><strong>4:12</strong> Why it can be difficult to build a new mental habit and change your lifestyle</p>\n<p><strong>5:02</strong> How much time it really takes to change your mind</p>\n<p><strong>14:52</strong> Why shaming yourself for not keeping a resolution will damage your mental health</p>\n<p><strong>16:30</strong> Why failure is good for us and how we can learn from our experiences</p>\n<p><strong>19:47</strong> Keeping a resolution won’t make you happy all the time or take away all your issues</p>\n<p><strong>22:00 </strong>Why negative emotions and feelings are telling us something about ourselves</p>\n<p><strong>23:10</strong> Why “bad” emotions are a normal part of life, and why it is okay to be unhappy</p>\n<p><strong>26:00</strong> How to change your mind and keep your resolutions</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>-Visit my website at https://drleaf.com for more free resources</p>\n<p>-Instagram: @drcarolineleaf: https://www.instagram.com/drcarolineleaf/</p>\n<p>-Facebook: Dr. Caroline Leaf: https://www.facebook.com/drleaf</p>\n",
