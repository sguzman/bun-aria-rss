  "description": "<p>Episode 265 - A true gentleman is on the show this week in the form of an incredible drummer, Dave Lombardo. He plays in Slayer, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Cross and The Misfits. Needless to say, this dude has done a million interviews but he was more than willing to go down roads that he hadn’t before and we got in depth about playing in high pressure situations, being a dad and finding stillness. It’s a great look inside of the mind of a person who shows up to work every day behind his drum kit.
