  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Back in 2013 at the house we use to live on more than one occasion I heard what sounded like huge rocks being slammed on the ground the last time I heard it I got my gun and a spotlight shined up on the hillside and it sounded like a bulldozer was coming down the hill I was expecting maybe a bear but it stopped before it came out of the wood line but I didn’t see anything. A few weeks after that I walked outside one night and heard very heavy footsteps like someone was running beside the house. Whoever this was had to be huge because I tried running through the yard to see if it sounded the same and wasn’t even close and I’m 6’5 300+ lbs. After that I was watching something about Bigfoot on TV and the guy was talking about hearing them run by him so I started doing a little research and found a video on YouTube called Trent vocalizations and as I watched it the hair stood up on the back of my neck I said holy $h*# I’ve heard that my whole life but I thought Bigfoot was a West coast thing. So in 2014 I was laid off from my job so we had to move to a different county in the first couple months we had someone smacking the house had someone messing with the screen in the bathroom window and when my girlfriend looked out the window she said it looked like someone with a hood on was standing there it was dark and she couldn’t see detail but this guy was at least 7’5. I’ve heard the most fu#@$ up owl scream a few times, I’ve heard rocks clanging together, I have audio that I sent to Jim bear king and he said it’s a Sasquatch there’s a lot more that’s happened if you’re interested.”</p>",
