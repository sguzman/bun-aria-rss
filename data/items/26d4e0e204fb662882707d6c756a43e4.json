This time something very different, and unfortunately not quite as interesting. As it turns out it's mainly just a 75% hotswap with MX clones.... although it does have some features on it. Maybe I will end up reviewing this, maybe not. Another unboxing coming soon! :D\n\nIntro by Kyle Carter\nOutro by Facundo Cabanne\n\nMy keyboard reviews: http://bit.ly/1TbOtft\nMy switch teardowns: http://bit.ly/2C1QGHz\nMy TOP X videos: http://bit.ly/2FmpZfd\nMy XL typing demos: https://bit.ly/2OoAW3w\nMy tutorials and featurettes: https://bit.ly/2OrkLUh\nMy unboxing videos: https://bit.ly/2TSrr0m\n\nI'm Thomas and I do videos and reviews on mechanical keyboards ranging from the most sickening modern RGB gaming keyboards to vintage hardware relics, or sometimes keycaps or keyswitches ranging from Cherry MX to Alps SKCM to IBM buckling springs and anything in between.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates on my keyboard videos! https://twitter.com/chyrosran22v",
