  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #52</strong>, my guest is author, yoga teacher, mental strength coach, former pro-skater, and entrepreneur <strong>Cara Bradley</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Cara</strong> joined me for an inspirational conversation about her new book <em><strong>On the Verge: Wake Up, Show Up, and Shine</strong></em> and what it means to be \"On the Verge\": to show up in THIS exact moment and meet our potential to shine in all aspects of our lives. She empowers listeners to live from that place through practices and strategies designed to shift them out of their heads and fully into the present moment.</p> <p><em>“When you show up in this moment — when you are 100 percent engaged right here and right now — you arrive in a space where you are fully aware,” says Cara. “In this space, beyond your busy mind, you glimpse your naturally occurring state of being awake and fully alive. In this natural state your mind is clear, your body bright, and your heart open.”</em></p> <p>We also discuss the life-changing epiphany she had at her final college track race and how the question she asked then has shaped her life and work since.</p> <p>About: <strong>Cara Bradley</strong> is an author, yoga teacher, mental strength coach, former pro-skater for Team Rollerblade® and entrepreneur having devoted more than three decades to movement disciplines and personal transformation. She is the founder of Verge Yoga in Philadelphia and the cofounder of a non-profit Mindfulness Through Movement, providing full year mindfulness programs to more than a dozen schools in urban Philadelphia. She is the host of a podcast series for Women for One called Real Women, Courageous Wisdom. Her upcoming book, On The Verge: Wake Up, Show Up, and Shine (New World Library) will be available in April 2016.</p> <p><strong>Cara</strong> reaches a nationwide audience through her Verge On-Demand Classes, workshops and retreats, and talks on human potential and presents at national conferences, corporations and universities.</p> <p>Known as a mental strength coach to athletes, she has been training teams and elite athletes, including professional athletes, for over ten years with her unique Fierce Focus Mental Strength Training Program. Teams include Villanova Football, Lacrosse, Soccer and Basketball, Penn State Basketball, University of Pennsylvania Soccer, St. Joseph’s Soccer and Field Hockey, and the USYSA Olympic Development Program.</p> <p><strong>Cara</strong> competed as a figure skater and turned professional at the age of fifteen when she began teaching. As a pro skater for Team Rollerblade, a performance group for Rollerblade Inc., she performed shows in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. She created and starred in SkateFit: The Complete In-Line Skating Workout (ABA Productions, 1994) and co-authored In-Line Skate New England: The Complete Guide to 101 Tours (Countryman Press, 2003) with Cindy Copeland Lewis and Tom Lewis.</p> <p>She graduated Magna Cum Laude from New York University, B.S.
