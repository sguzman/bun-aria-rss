  "description": "<p>Super Soul listeners… we’d like to introduce you to our newest podcast: The SonRise Project. It’s created by Emmy Award-winning creative visionary, mother and wife Kelli Richardson Lawson. The weekly podcast is a resource for parents and families to engage and share personal experiences with children struggling with depression, anxiety and addiction issues. In this episode Kelli introduces Spirit, a licensed clinical psychotherapist, media personality, host of Love Goals on OWN, forensic evaluator, wife and mother of seven children. Spirit says so many of us struggle with painful and often unfulfilling relationships with those we love. She says what we need to understand is that these relationships act as a mirror and are a reflection of the way we  feel about ourselves. Spirit explains we often get stuck in the belief that life is something that is happening to us. She says what’s actually true - is everything we think and feel drives the way we show up in our lives. If we want change, then we must shift our relationship with ourselves. You can subscribe to The SonRise Project on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available.</p>\n",
