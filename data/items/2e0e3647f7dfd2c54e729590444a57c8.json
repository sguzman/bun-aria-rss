  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat joins AJ Hawk and the boys live from the set of College GameDay in Lawrence, Kansas to chat about last night's Thursday Night Football game between the Colts and Broncos that went to overtime and saw no touchdown's scored, why there isn't much to be excited about if you're a Colts fan, or a Broncos fan, if the Broncos can figure things out and why they seemingly seem broken with Russell Wilson, if we know who these teams are moving forward, and how that was possibly the most boring football game of all-time, before Pat and AJ go through the entire week 5 NFL slate and make their picks and predictions against the spread (1:25:36-1:42:03). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and tune in to ESPN tomorrow from 9-Noon Eastern for College GameDay. We appreciate the hell out of all you. See you on Overreaction Monday, cheers.</p>\n",
