  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We don’t even know, y’all, so this week, we’re doing a little bit of flailing and a lot of talking about books we found unputdownable when we read them the first time. We did our very best to avoid repeats — which is difficult this many episodes in! We talk about what makes a book unputdownable (we’ve got buckets!) and about other things too…like our annual reader survey and how skilled a musician Sarah is. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fated Mates Live, in person is happening — if you have tickets to the live show in Alexandria, VA on July 30th — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FatedMates/status/1537110494292676610\">let us know on our Twitter thread</a> (and find friends!). If you didn’t get a ticket, but want to join the wait list, you can do that at<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fated-mates-live-tickets-353944496517\"> Old Town Books</a>!

We are devastated and urge you to support <a href=\"https://abortionfunds.org\">the National Network of Abortion Funds</a>, which removes financial and logistical barriers to abortion access by centering people who have abortions and organizing at the intersections of racial, economic, and reproductive justice. They partner with organizations already in place on the ground in places where abortions are banned to do the work of helping people who need abortions. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’ve talked about <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/5/18/135-freewheeling-with-sarah-and-jen\">bodily autonomy in romance novels</a> before, and in <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/12/6/s0414-elda-minger-a-trailblazer-episode\">our trailblazer conversation with Elda Minger</a>, she spoke extensively about what birth control and abortion were like for people back in the 70s.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We remain Big Mad.
