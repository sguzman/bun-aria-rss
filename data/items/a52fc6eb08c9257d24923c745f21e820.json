  "description": "Nearly a year into the pandemic, the country still hasn’t quite figured out how to keep students and teachers safe at school. It’s largely been up to states, school districts, and teachers to figure out whether to keep schools open or switch to distance learning. Experts say measures like masks, ventilation, and testing can make schools safer — but those measures often require resources that schools don’t have. Vox’s Anna North explains what’s happening with schools during the pandemic, and whether the Biden administration can turn things around.\n\nReferences: \n\nAnna’s story about reopening schools.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
