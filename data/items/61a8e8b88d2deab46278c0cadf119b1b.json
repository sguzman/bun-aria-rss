  "description": "<p>Nikki and Andrew try talking slower for a change and reveal why they talk fast. Nikki does not want any sort of editing done on her photos and she likes a forced excuse. In the Besties Being Guesties Nikki reconnects with a long lost Spring Break buddy from the \"Alabama Boys\" Daniel Burson. They help each other fill in the gaps about meeting for the first time about 20 years ago. In the Final Thought, Nikki and Andrew discuss long term relationships, commitments and not wanting the party to end.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
