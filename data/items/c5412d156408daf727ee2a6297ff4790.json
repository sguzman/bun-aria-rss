  "description": "Hey HB's! This week we're FINALLY GETTING TO TANYA'S BOOK! Or rather, Part 1 of A Knight In Shining Armor by Jude Deveraux. It's a classic romance novel published in the 80's and it does not disappoint... if you're looking for rant-fodder from us! It involves a perpetually gaslit schoolteacher, a horrendous current beau, a hero from the 16th century who isn't much better, all the fat-shaming of children you've ever wished for, and time-travel via genital contact. \n Plus, Rooster the Dog had a lot to say about this book as well. She couldn't BELIEVE we didn't like it. \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n Erin - Don't think the self-love can't just be bath bombs and a little me time. Not all of us can be that blonde woman in stock photos with her arms outstretched in the sunset. We all try our best to create \"a life you don't have to escape from,\" but everyone needs to be a little selfless and do some dirty jobs for society to function. Trekking across the world or doing a job that \"serves you\" is all well and good, but it's not an achievement.  \n Also Erin - \"Yes To\" has a charcoal push-pop face mask that is SUBLIME. \nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
