We’re all image bearers of the Creator. In this episode, Emily and Laura interview Quina Aragon—a wife, mom, and artist—on creativity and the gospel. As God’s ambassadors, we’re called to cultivate the earth in order to proclaim his name. Whether we make a delicious meal, comb a child’s hair, or help paint watercolor masterpieces, our creativity fills our homes and communities with the knowledge of the glory of God.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"row sqs-row\"> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1540336660113_79838\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1540338275602_477\" class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1540338275602_476\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/show-archive/ep-110-creativity-and-motherhood-an-interview-with-quina-aragon#rm-apply\" data-initialized=\"true\">RM APPLY QUESTIONS</a></div> <div class=\"sqs-block-button-container--center\" data-alignment= \"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1540336660113_82447\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1540338275602_484\" class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1540338275602_483\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/transcriptions/ep-110-creativity-and-motherhood-an-interview-with-quina-aragon-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1540336660113_79907\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p><strong>Articles, Resources and Related Content:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://quinaaragon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Quina Aragon’s Website</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2N7k6tw\"><em>Love Made</em></a> <em>-</em> Quina’s New Book</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/blog/cultivating-a-healthy-marriage-as-new-parents?rq=quina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cultivating a Healthy Marriage as New Parents</a> - Quina Aragon for RM</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5wYDSio4eA\">“Listen & Live” Spoken Word for TGC</a> - by Quina Aragon, shot by Light Foster, & produced by The Gospel Coalition</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/erik-raymond/are-you-suffocating-your-creativity/\"> “Are You Suffocating Your Creativity?”</a> - Erik Raymond</p> <p><a href= \"https://ftc.co/resource-library/blog-entries/creativity-as-worship\"> “Creativity as Worship”</a> - Kelly Wolfe</p> <p><a href= \"https://ftc.co/resource-library/blog-entries/made-in-his-likeness\"> “Made in His Likeness”</a> - Jeanie Layne</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.fathommag.com/stories/the-foolishness-of-creativity\">“The Foolishness of Creativity”</a> - Tresta Payne</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>For More:</strong></p> <ul data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p><strong>To subscribe: </strong>on iOS, go to our <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-risen-motherhood-podcast/id1072833310?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iTunes page</a> and subscribe.
