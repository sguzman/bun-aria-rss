  "description": "I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 18\n\nBrandon Marshall and Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson welcome Chris Olave, Zamir White and David Bell to the show as they dive into the pre-draft process, future goals as well as hardships that they overcame that helped them grow as individuals.\n\nBrandon starts off by asking each guy what their pre-draft process looks like and some of the challenges that have come with it. David Bell explains how he needs to stay true to himself and follow his own path as he prepares for the draft. He talks about the differences between the level of focus here compared to the college level. He’s watching his diet more than ever because of the amount of money on the line. Chris Olave explains how there are some days you don’t want to get out of bed, but those end up being the best days for training. He admits to not having the best eating habits at the college level. Chad immediately backs Chris’ statement by explaining how what he has eaten has not affected his skill set or the level of production that he’s put on the field. Brandon shifts the conversation and asks Zamir about winning the national championship just a couple weeks ago. Zamir explains how “huge” it was to win that game after all the work he and his teammates put in through the off-season. \n\nChad asks the group what their future goals are for themselves as they prepare for the NFL. David explains how his short term individual goal is to win Rookie of the Year, while his team goal is to better their record compared to the previous year. Chris explains how he’s “all about the team” and talks about making the team better and winning as many games as possible. Zamir explains how he wants to “grind it out” and put the team and coaches first. Brandon jokes around saying “did they prep y’all to say that?” as their answers were very centered around the team. \n\nThe conversation takes a turn to hardships, as David explains losing a friend back in high school to gun violence. He talks about the effect that had on his school and all the students and staff. Brandon asks if there is anything he is focused on when it comes to gun violence. David wants to open a boys and girls club one day to help keep kids off the streets from an early age. Chris talks about how he slipped on a route during one of the biggest games of his career and the ball ended up getting intercepted by a Clemson player. He felt as if he was the reason for that loss. Zamir talks about how his toughest moment started from birth, having to overcome being “different” due to being born with a cleft lip, cleft palate and a leaky kidney. Brandon circles back around with the group to talk about overcoming these hardships and learning how to process them, and not let them haunt you for years until after you’re out of the league.  \n\n\nWATCH MORE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAaZmvZaF9i_MOW1SzmEqPYpKAC5sAsH\n\nSUBSCRIBE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/IAMATHLETE\n\nFollow I AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathlete/?hl=en\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/i-am-athlete\n\nFollow HOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/\nHoA Supplements: https://houseofathlete.com/supplements\n\n#IAMATHLETE #BiggerThanAPodcast #BrandonMarshall #ChadJohnson #OchoCinco #ChrisOlave #DavidBell #ZamirWhite\n\n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY)\n \n1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 1-877-770-STOP (7867) (LA), visit OPGR.org (OR), call/text TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA). 21+ (18+ NH/WY). \n\nPhysically present in AZ/CO/CT/IL/IN/IA/LA/MI/NH/NJ/NY/OR/PA/TN/VA/WV/WY only.
