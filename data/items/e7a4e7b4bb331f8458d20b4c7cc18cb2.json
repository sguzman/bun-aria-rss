  "title": "253: An Uncomfortable (But Meaningful) Conversation About Race | Lama Rod Owens",
  "description": "Many of us come to meditation for comfort. But, especially for white people, right now is a time to embrace our discomfort. Lama Rod Owens encourages me to step way out of my comfort zone in this conversation, and I am grateful to him for it. Owens is the author of the soon-to-be-released book, Love and Rage. As it says in the bio on his website, his story sits at the \"cross sections\" of so many aspects of American life \"as a Black, queer male, born and raised in the South.\" He was officially recognized by the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism after he completed a three-year silent retreat, during which time he says he dealt with years of past pain and trauma. As you will hear him say in this interview, he \"worked his butt off to feel ok.\" After retreat, he completed a Master of Divinity at Harvard. I hope you get as much out of this conversation as I did.
