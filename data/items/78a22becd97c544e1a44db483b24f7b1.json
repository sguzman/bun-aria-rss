We are all familiar with the fight or flight response, but there are actually four main trauma responses, which are categorized as “the four F’s of trauma”: <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addiction-and-recovery/202008/understanding-fight-flight-freeze-and-the-fawn-response\"><strong>fight, flight, freeze and fawn</strong></a>. In this podcast I will talk about these different trauma responses, and how to manage them in the moment using self-regulation and mind-management techniques. Although recent research indicates there may be two more trauma responses common to human beings, I am just going to concentrate on the main four for this podcast.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to bonus ad-free podcasts, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read the blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/the-different-types-of-trauma</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Apollo Neuroscience: Want to improve your sleep, relaxation, focus, recovery, and mindfulness habits?
