  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that WikiLeaks has dumped what it claims are CIA source code files. The leak seems to aim at raising suspicion that attacks attributed to foreign governments are in fact false-flag operations. The International Association of Athletics Federations says it was hacked by Fancy Bear. Two new RATs—remote access Trojans—are discovered in the wild. ISIS takes some cyber hits, and an investigator outlines the group's information operations manual. At the annual Women in Cyber Security Conference we catch up with US Naval Academy Midshipmen Svetla Walsh and Deja Baker. David Dufour from Webroot reviews their latest threat report.",
