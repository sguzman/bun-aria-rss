  "description": "<p>We show that Einstein's field equations with a negative cosmological constant\ncan admit black hole solutions whose thermodynamics coincides with that of\nlogotropic fluids, recently investigated to heal some cosmological and\nastrophysical issues. For this purpose, we adopt the Anton-Schmidt equation of\nstate, which represents a generalized version of logotropic fluids. We thus\npropose a general treatment to obtain an asymptotic anti-de Sitter metric,\nreproducing the thermodynamic properties of both Anton-Schmidt and logotropic\nfluids. Hence, we explore how to construct suitable spacetime functions,\ninvoking an event horizon and fulfilling the null, weak, strong and dominant\nenergy conditions. We further relax the strong energy condition to search for\npossible additional solutions. Finally, we discuss the optical properties\nrelated to a specific class of metrics and show how to construct an effective\nrefractive index depending on the spacetime functions and the thermodynamic\nquantities of the fluid under study. We also explore possible departures with\nrespect to the case without the fluid.\n</p>",
