  "description": "<p>EPISODE 45 - JAKE GYLLENHAAL - Actor</p> <p>Team Deakins had the opportunity to sit and talk with long time friend, actor Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, PRISONERS, NIGHTCRAWLER). Jake speaks about his relationship with directors and with cinematographers. We speak about his work in Donnie Darko and Prisoners, as well as Jarhead and Wildlife. He speaks about how, as an actor, the final result is always in other people’s hands. He also shares how important the collaboration between actor and cinematographer is and the importance of creating a “safe place” for the actor in front of the camera. Although we were hoping he would explain the end of the movie Enemy (and he said he would!), we finished the episode without knowing any more! And we also got into the craft of building sand castles! A really fun conversation that gave us an insight into the world of an actor! Don’t miss it!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Donnie Darko, Jarhead</p>",
