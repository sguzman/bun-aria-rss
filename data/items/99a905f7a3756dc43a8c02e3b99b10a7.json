The left calls for unity, while the AOC and media compile an enemies list. Democrats want to rush through the election process. The establishment's preferred candidate, \"Evan McMuffin,\" wasn't all that conservative, was he? Kristallnacht anniversary. Arizona secretary of state calls all Trump supporters Nazis. Expect far-left, Green New Deal radicalism from Biden.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Misinformation, disinformation, and suppression of voting. In 2016, Democrats said it wasn't possible to hack an election, until it was -- and now they're back to saying it can't be hacked! Remember: Hillary said don't concede the election under any circumstances. Obama still fundamentally wants to change this great nation. U.N. is full of bad actors who lecture America. We don't lock down over every virus! The Green New Deal is about redistributing your money. Woodrow Wilson laid out how our Constitution needed total rewriting to move us left.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>There are books the left wants to burn, but the NY Times is in love with Obama's third memoir. Trump isn't messianic like Obama and is comparatively humble. The job of court jesters in the GOP is just to lose. There are real stakes in politics. Why has lefty Los Angeles boarded up stores, because of Trump supporters? AOC thinks the Democrats lost the House majority -- if only! Sen. Ted Cruz, author of \"One Vote Away: How a Single Supreme Court Seat Can Change History\", discusses letting the election and legal processes play out in 2020, as we did in 2020.
