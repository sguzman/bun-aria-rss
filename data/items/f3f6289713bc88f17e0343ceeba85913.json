  "description": "<div>In early April, 2011—nobody knows the exact date—a prominent family vanished from their lavish townhome in Nantes, France. A few day later, close family members and friends of the family received a typewritten, unsigned letter from the mother and father stating that they had relocated to the Unitec States with their four children. They were now deep undercover working with the US government and would not be able to make further contact. Many accepted that it was possible, while others thought it was suspicious (BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY). After three weeks, when local police are convinced to take a closer look, a terrifying discovery is made that unlocks one of the WILDEST mysteries we’ve ever covered. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 140 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of \"<strong>I'll Be Gone in the Dark</strong>,\" \"<strong>Tiger King</strong>\" <strong>\"Don't F**K With Cats,\" \"The Menendez Murders,\" \"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">JOIN HERE!</a>\n</div>\n",
