  "description": "<p class=\"\">Kaytee and Meredith are ready to chat about all the books again this week. Hang on to your hats!</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll hear our combined “bookish moment of the week”: the Patron discussion with Diane Chamberlain about her book, and then a bit of getting vulnerable about the technological snafu that resulted.</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. These are six books that are all VERY different in content and tone and all the ways that books can be different. It’s a great ride.</p> <p class=\"\">Our Slow But Steady check in is short and sweet, just like you like it!</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are tackling the final category in the 2019 Reading Challenge: a book that is scary for some reason and we’re examining what makes us scared as readers. It might not be what you expect!</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands: a wonderful book that will make a favorite movie shine even more brightly and a beloved curmudgeon book with a young woman protagonist!</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode. If you’d like to listen first and not spoil the surprise, don’t scroll down! *Please note that all book titles linked above are Amazon affiliate links.
