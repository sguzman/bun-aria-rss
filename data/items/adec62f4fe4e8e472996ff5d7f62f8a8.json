  "description": "A bit of a different format this week but one that I think you will enjoy. I took a look at every full-length in Earth Crisis' catalog, brought the guitarist Scott Crouse onto the podcast and took a deep dive into the mentality of where the band was at, their process and other fun stories that surrounded each of the LP's. The result is what you hear and honestly, blew my mind. So many incredible stories and anecdotes were shared that even the super fan of Earth Crisis will have no idea about. I call it a \"Self Audit\" and I hope to do this more. <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
