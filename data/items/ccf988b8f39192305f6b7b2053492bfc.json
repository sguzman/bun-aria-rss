During a preliminary hearing, Chaffee County Sheriff’s Office Undersheriff Andy Rohrich testified that photos taken of Barry Morphew shortly after Suzanne’s disappearance showed numerous superficial injuries, including cuts and scrapes on his upper arms that may be fingernail scratches. Barry Morphew also had injuries on the outside of his hands, but it is unclear if investigators believe all of those injuries were recent.
