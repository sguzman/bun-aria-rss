  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys are joined by Head Coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers, one of the most inspirational humans on the planet, the creator of the Nekton mentality, PJ Fleck. They chat about what it's like being the Head Coach of a major college football program during this pandemic, what he's having his kids do to get better this offseason despite not being able to do a lot of the things they normally would be doing, how he's handling everything with his staff, and Coach Fleck gives an inspirational speech for everyone to find a little light in all of the darkness that we care currently facing (3:19-17:26). Later, AJ Hawk is back for another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as AJ and Pat chop it up about everything going on in the world, try to figure out where Cam Newton is going next and if he's going to have a major resurgence, they each talk about their recruiting process, and get into everything else you could imagine, whether&nbsp;it's related to football or general life stuff (18:55-1:42:59). Don't forget to tweet the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for a chance to win some free merch and keep an eye out for the Office Olympics on <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a>. Stay safe this weekend, we're all in this together. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
