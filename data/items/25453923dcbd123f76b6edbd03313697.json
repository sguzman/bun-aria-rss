    "media:description": "Congo is considering building the largest hydropower station in the world, the Grand Inga Dam. The project, which would cost $80 billion USD and generate 40 GW of power, would sit along the Congo river just 220 kilometers from Kinshasa. If built, it would provide green power to millions of Africans, increasing the standard of living and positively affecting the environment. However, there are several issues with its construction. Currently, infrastructure and demand issues make it very impractical to build. Nevertheless, a smaller project could benefit the region and be worth building. And eventually, once the demand is in place, a Grand Inga Dam could finally come to fruition.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more similar content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.hydropower.org/country-profiles/democratic-republic-of-the-congo\nhttps://archive.internationalrivers.org/resources/9034\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08bd940f0b652dd000f22/TI_UP_HD_Apr2007_Hydro_Potential_of_Congo_River.pdf\nhttps://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/democratic-republic-congo\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Inga_Dam\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inga_dams\nhttps://www.banktrack.org/project/grand_inga_dam\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=grand+inga+dam&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS942US942&oq=grand+&aqs=chrome.1.69i59l3j69i57j69i59j46i131i433i512j69i61j69i60.1900j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/australias-fortescue-talks-worlds-biggest-hydropower-project-congo-2021-06-15/\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/3/407\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nGoogle Earth\nStoryblocks\n\n----------Video Contents--------------------\n00:00 - Intro\n02:14 - Grand Inga\n03:19 - Project Benefits\n04:42 - Roadblocks\n06:18 - Inga 3",
