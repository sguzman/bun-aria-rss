  "description": "Matt visits Perth to meet with former rock star Pete Wishart, who's been an SNP MP since 2001. The seat is one of the most marginal in the UK and a top target for the Tories. Pete tells us what it's like to fight in a close campaign, the transition from rock star to politician, his changing use of social media and, of course, Scottish independence.
