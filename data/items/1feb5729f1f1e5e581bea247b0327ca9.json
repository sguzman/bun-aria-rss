While ants will apparently eat almost anything, I decided to use flowers to represent their food since pictures\nof decomposing fruit didn’t end up looking all that appealing.</p>\n\n<p>This post is a quick tutorial on how I generated these flowers using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise\">simplex noise</a>.\nThe code to generate this ended up being just a couple of lines of Typescript, and\na whole range of different abstract flowers can be generated by changing just a few parameters.\nI’ve included the code below along with an interactive visualization to explain how this all works.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/flowers-from-simplex-noise/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
