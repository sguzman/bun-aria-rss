  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, We honor the fallen men and women who fought for our principles this Memorial Day. Those that fought for our Declaration of Independence and for our Constitution. Yet we have a progressive movement that rejects all of it, natural law and unalienable rights from our Creator. Our first amendment ,religious liberties, freedom of speech, freedom association, and press. So what is meant by freedom of the press and what is its purpose? Is it to challenge public officials, protect the republic, or objectively report what they loosely call news? What if the press is contributing to the deterioration of liberty or the deterioration of a constitutional republic and the institutions that undergird it? You can’t possibly watch Jake Tapper, Don Lemon, Wolf Blitzer or Brian Stelter or virtually all of the hosts on CNN and draw the conclusion that these individuals have, as their purpose, to inform us as opposed to lecture us. Today's media has become a power unto itself, not offering much in the area of objectivity while lecturing us rather than informing us. Only giving voice to their own ideological positions. Also, Hollywood's former power-player and Democrat fundraiser, Harvey Weinstein, turns himself into police for sexual assault charges. Powerful producers, directors and studios in Hollywood covered up for Weinstein. This is an indictment of Weinstein and the culture in Hollywood. Finally, Mark reiterated his comments from March of 2017 questioning why and how they surveilled Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the spring of 2016.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
