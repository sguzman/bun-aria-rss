  "description": "From a New York Times best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed (HMH, 2019) is a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world-where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).\nOne day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.\nAs Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives-a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a 20-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys-she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.\nWith startling wisdom and humour, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.\nElizabeth Cronin, Psy.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and mindfulness meditation teacher with offices in Brookline and Norwood, MA.
