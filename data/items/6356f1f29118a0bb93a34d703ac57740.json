  "description": "<p>Socrates hangs out in the country flirting with his buddy Phaedrus. And what is this \"Platonic\" love? Using the enticement of desire not to rush toward fulfillment, but to get you all excited about talking philosophy. Socrates critiques a speech by renowned orator Lysias, who claimed that love is bad because it's a form of madness, where people do things they then regret after love fades. Socrates instead delivers a myth that shows the spiritual benefits of loving and being loved. With guest Adam Rose.</p> <p>End song: \"Summertime\" by <a href=\"http://www.newpeopleband.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New People</a>, from <em>Might Get It Right</em> (2013).</p>",
