  "description": "<p>In this episode Sal, Adam & Justin speak with economist, investor and best selling author, Jerry Robinson.</p> <p>While Mind Pump's focus is primarily on physical fitness, financial fitness is an area you should not ignore. There is a very good chance that much of what was discussed in this fascinating episode will be new information to you unless you pay attention to the world of finance. This could very well be the information you need to protect you and your family in the future.</p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book changed my life. Jerry shares his background, religious upbringing and the moment that sparked his passion. (4:44)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Economists rule the world. Where did his knowledge come from? (6:24)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gold Standard. He explains the concept in great detail and its impact on the US dollar. (9:14)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatic increase in demand for the US dollar. The golf ball scenario, creation of the petrodollar system and its connection to our allies. (18:15)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The death of Britain and rise of United States. The origin story of the Federal Reserve and how money is debt. (26:25)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaking free from the consumption trap. How the richer we get in America, the more we tend to buy not produce. (36:40)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faith in currency goes down, alternative methods go up. The recent rise of cryptocurrency/bitcoin, the pros/cons and should you invest in them. (40:38)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How economists lie with numbers. He explains the indicators to look at when it comes to how our economy is doing. (52:15)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student loans and interest rates bubble. He gives his opinion on the default mindset to go to college, in a market economy, and alternate methods to look at. (58:00)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way to pay it off is with more debt. The explanation of the US National Debt and who this money is owed to. (1:06:00)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to identify what cycle we are at. Does he believe we are due for a crash? (1:14:53)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of them are playing the rigged game. What Presidents, in his opinion, have contributed the most to our National Debt? (1:19:25)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot get away with not sacrificing. The greatest lessons we have learned. (1:21:53)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have got to have a plan; the government will not take care of you. The need to develop multiple streams of income and tips on how to prepare for the future. (1:33:24)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What companies fascinate/excite him? (1:45:00)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final thoughts and where does he see AI playing a part into the economy?
