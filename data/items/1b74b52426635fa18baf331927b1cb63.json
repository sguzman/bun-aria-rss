  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has been destroying the economy, women's sports, national security, and now the Supreme Court. The Democrat Party has had its way with the Court for 80 years and since they lost three cases they're calling the court rogue, extreme, illegitimate, and now they want to burn it down. For Democrats, this isn't about a women's rights to choose, it's about infanticide up to the last second and a woman's 'right' to execute her baby. Later, Biden has surrounded himself with Marxist fools at the EPA and they are sabotaging America's energy policies and production. The EPA doesn't have the authority to ban fracking, so they are pursuing a backdoor workaround. Then, Gov. Ron DeSantis is taking heat from critics upset over his law protecting children (kindergarten to third grade) from being taught sexualized materials in the public-school classroom.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
