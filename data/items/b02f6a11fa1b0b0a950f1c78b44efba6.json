    "media:description": "As hieroglyphic writing reached the end of its life, Egyptians didn't simplify it like the alphabets emerging all around. They made it even more complex. Meet what Egyptologists call \"enigmatic\" or \"cryptographic\" hieroglyphs.\n\nSubscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=NativLang\nBecome my patron: https://www.patreon.com/NativLang\n\n~ Briefly ~\n\nI'm following up on my tale of Egyptian phonology with this intriguing hieroglyphic shift. We'll contrast Egypt's developments with the alphabets emerging around the Mediterranean, revisit the basics of how hieroglyphs work, learn some of the readings and substitutions that drive cryptographic writing, and encounter examples of how sign choices relate to mythic context and content. At the end, we'll briefly wonder about the roles of temple, creativity, hybridity, and attrition in favor of alternative alphabets in the long twilight of the hieroglyphs.\n\n~ Credits ~\n\nArt, narration, animation and much of the music by Josh from NativLang.\n\nMy sources doc for claims and full credits for music, sfx, fonts and images:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfS3F-Z4YQ8Q33EpGUCNDYgxGgLRgVB9n44oROvqdKc/\n\nMusic not by me:\n\nPeace on the Water, Unlimited Potential\nby Darren Curtis (custom license: http://darrencurtismusic.com/)\n\nSilver Flame by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4362-silver-flame\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nThinking Music by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4522-thinking-music\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license",
