  "description": "<p>Dave Longstreth started making music under the name Dirty Projectors in 2002, while he was in college. Since then, he’s released seven albums and collaborated with Bjork, Solange, and Kanye West, Paul McCartney, and Rihanna. And Dirty Projectors went from a solo project to a full-band, performing on TV, and at Carnegie Hall. Dave and one of his bandmates were in a relationship for much of that time, but then that relationship and the band broke up. In February 2017, with Dirty Projectors as solo project once again, Dave released a self-titled album, a breakup album, looking back on those years. In this episode, Dave breaks down the song \"Up in Hudson,\" and the winding road he went down to create it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/dirty-projectors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/dirty-projectors</a></p>",
