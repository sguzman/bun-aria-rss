  "description": "Our audiobook this week is FIREMAN DADDY by USA Today Bestselling Author Taryn Quinn! \n\nNarrated by Lola James and Wesley Paul I got my happily-ever-after…except it wasn’t. \n\nMy HEA ended when my formerly star quarterback husband slept with—no, not our old head cheerleader. Someone else. Hello, this isn’t a Lifetime movie.\n\nSo, I left New York City and went home to small-town Crescent Cove. I’d inherited a bar that was apparently the watering hole for local firemen. Super hot firemen, namely one in particular.\n\nOkay, so maybe this is a Lifetime movie.\n\nEspecially since the fire code chief—and my ex’s high school friend—keeps hassling me about getting the bar up to code, when all I want to do is get the place fixed up so I can go back to the city.\n\nDon’t I?\n\nBut Jake is making me remember why I love my hometown. And it turns out he isn’t only good at preventing fires, he’s even better at starting them.\n\nAnd the one between us may just burn forever…\n\nAuthor’s note: Jake isn’t a daddy yet, but if he has his way, he’ll be knocking up Erica faster than you can say five-alarm blaze. Fireman Daddy is a 18K novella with no cliffhanger and a happily-ever-after.\n\nCEO DADDY: https://amzn.to/2w8RjNX\n\nMY EX’s BABY: https://amzn.to/2UYlcsG\n\nDADDY IN DISGUISE (AUDIO): https://adbl.co/3dQTpmP\n\nBEACH KINGDOM BUNDLE by Tessa Bailey: https://amzn.to/39HaewV\n\n$50 Amazon GC GIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
