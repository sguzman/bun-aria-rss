  "description": "My special guest tonight is author Barry Strohm who's here to discuss how he says he was able to channel the what Jesus and other disciples did in their lifetime.\nJesus Christ came to the world as the universal energy of God. For twenty-eight years he lived a normal life, experiencing emotions, observing the suffering of people, and even having a married life with children. He was sent to Earth to inform humanity of the one God—but was crucified. Here find in-depth commentary on the life of Christ through the channeled messages of Jesus, the Saints, disciples, and others of that volatile time. Find out how the gospels were selected and how and why the words of Jesus were altered by the church. Learn about soul families and those with his ancestry who are walking the Earth today. Hear warnings that reflect current and dangerous trends, including our political systems, religious beliefs, and interactions with each other. Jesus taught love, and through these messages, we find that his words are still vital to our personal and collective lives in the world today.\nWant more paranormal episodes?
