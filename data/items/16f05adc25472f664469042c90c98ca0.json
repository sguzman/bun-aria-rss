  "description": "You don’t need me to tell you that being a rock star isn’t a normal kind of job…you live in a bubble that’s as far removed from the regular 9-5, Monday-to-Friday thing…\n\nYou spend a lot of time living in hotel rooms…there’s a lot of downtime between gigs which can get really, really boring…and your working hours are almost completely opposite to your natural circadian rhythms…\n\nA lot of people will end up coping with bad food, drugs, alcohol and self-destructive behavior—anything to alleviate the boredom…or the pain…or the loneliness…or the insecurities…\n\nAnd because you’re a rock star, there aren’t many people who are going to tell you to smarten up and sort out your life…in fact, your bad behavior is more likely to be encouraged than police…\n\nAnd it can be even worse when you get off the road…suddenly, any day-to-day structure you had on tour is gone…and all that’s left you in your house with your bad habits…\n\nI bring all this up because this is where we’re going to pick up the story of Deryck Whibley and Sum 41…\n\nThe band burned very hot and very bright from 1996 through to 2005…and finally, something had to give…and it got real scary…\n\nThis is the Sum 41 story according to front man Deryck Whibley, part 2…\nLearn more about your ad choices.
