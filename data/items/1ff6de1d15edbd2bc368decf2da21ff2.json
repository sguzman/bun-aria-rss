  "description": "Carbon Queen: The Remarkable Life of Nanoscience Pioneer Mildred Dresselhaus (MIT Press, 2022) follows Mildred Dresselhaus (or Millie, as everyone calls her) from her childhood in New York City to her final years in Cambridge. It focuses on her scientific achievements, but also rightfully presents her as a multi-hyphenate: being a resilient student, an adaptive researcher, a professor, an administrator, an advocate, a fundraiser, a patent owner, a book author. The accolades are plentiful and her involvement in science seemingly boundless.\nMaia Weinstock masterfully blends anecdotes and scientific explanations into the life story of a truly phenomenal scientist.\nIn this episode of the podcast, we discuss Millie’s multifaceted career, as well as the process of putting the book together, and Maia’s history course on women in science.\nAna Georgescu studied astrophysics and physics at Harvard University and is now a science consultant and writer based in New York City.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
