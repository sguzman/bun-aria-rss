  "description": "<p>Imagine going to college and getting a minor in ‘you!’ Well, that’s just one of the semi-wild ideas that bubbled up during my conversation with week’s guest, Mark Groves. Mark describes himself as a Human Connection Specialist on a mission to help individuals step into their most authentic, effective, loving selves by way of a little bit of tough love and no-BS relationship guidance. Immersing himself and pursuing an education in the world of psychology after his model of life and relationships feel apart, he’s become a bridge between the academic and the human, inviting people to explore the good, bad, downright ugly, and beautiful sides of connection. And, given the state of the world these days, we could all use a bit more wisdom around how we show up and relate to others.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark shares insights, ideas, and strategies about being a better human, living a better life, and understanding how to craft relationships that are truly nourishing with a global community of over a million people on his Create the Love Instagram account, his eponymous podcast, and through a growing library of courses, and programs. What I’ve always found so powerful about Mark and his work is that he doesn’t pull punches. He doesn’t hide who he is, what he believes, his irreverence or willingness to poke fun at himself and, really, any other paradigm or system that just doesn’t make sense. He is, in many ways, a truth-teller, and we need more of that these days.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Mark at: <a href=\"https://createthelove.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/createthelove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>| <a href=\"https://pod.link/1282044290\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Groves Podcast</a></p><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/4c14e097c693d2337475dab6bd13fadc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Diego Perez who uses the name Yung Pueblo</a> online about finding peace and clarity in an upside-down world.</p><p><strong>My new book</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a>.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Bean Box:</strong> Give the coffee fanatic in your life an unforgettable coffee-tasting experience with Bean Box.
