  "description": "The much-loved food TV chef and cookbook author Sara Moulton is back on Radio Cherry Bombe! Sara stopped by to chat with guest host V Spehar about the incredible career that has taken her from culinary school to restaurant kitchens (at a time when women were not welcome) to \"Good Morning America,\" Gourmet magazine, the Food Network, PBS, and Milk Street Radio. Sara also shares how she snagged her job as Julia Child’s assistant and what it was like working with the culinary icon. Of course, we couldn’t let Sara stop by without getting a few cooking tips and tricks, so she and V talk about her favorite summer produce and just what to do with it. \n\nThank you to Free People for supporting this episode and thank you to V Spehar of \"Under The Desk News\" on TikTok for guest hosting. \n\nRadio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
