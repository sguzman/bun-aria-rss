I'm working for me.”</p><p>David Bowie</p><br><p>Technically this is another episode of&nbsp;Ask Me Anything.&nbsp;But this week we don't actually answer listener questions. This week we riff.</p><p>This is a conversation about embracing the journey of becoming more of who you truly are. It's about the commitment to evolve into your most authentic expression. It's about the beauty and power of living an uncompromising, expansive, creative existence.</p><p>There was a man who exemplified this ethos like no other. A man who never compromised. A man who expressed his creative truth with every fiber of his being, all the way down to his final breath.</p><p>That man is the singular David Bowie. May you rest in peace, Ziggy Stardust.</p><p>Today we reflect back on a remarkable life. From his example we mine the path to unlocking your own personal truth. And we weave our way back to one immutable truth —&nbsp;all roads to personal growth lead back to your commitment to you.</p><p>As a related aside, and in case you missed it, enjoy this short movie about my recent visit to Beirut, Lebanon to run the marathon. I didn't run for time. I ran for peace. An experience that uplifted me, then broke my heart. That's what travel does — it breeds empathy.</p><br><p>2016 is all about video for me.
