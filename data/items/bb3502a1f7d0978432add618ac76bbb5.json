I’m honored to share with you my interview with one of the world’s leading enlightened spiritualists, Indian yogi Sadhguru. Sadhguru’s perceptions transcend time and culture. They are universal and simple, yet they are also profound in their clarity. You will hear KARMA defined in a way you’ve never heard before. Sadhguru challenges the fundamental concept of karma found in the identity and memory of our human condition, and the role karma plays in defining our personal being. One of Sadhguru’s important insights touches upon the right way to contemplate our limited time on earth and how doing so can add more bliss by living in the moment.
