  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP causes one of her managers to get fired. This leads to all of the other managers retaliating against her by constantly subjecting her to \"random\" locker searches. You wanna search OP's locker? No problem! OP makes sure that they are really going to regret searching through her locker. First, she stores thousands of pennies in her locker, which the manager has to count out to make sure she isn't stealing. When that doesn't work, she ups the stakes by keeping her dirtiest of dirty laundry in her locker.</p>\n",
