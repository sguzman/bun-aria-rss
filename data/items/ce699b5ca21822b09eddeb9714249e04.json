We check in on a HUGE line to get into the Birkenstock store. WHY. Christina shares some on-topic TikToks about mom hacks, models, and cool skater boys. We hear some follow up emails from alive humans who were left alone with strangers, dad hacks, and a whole bunch of questions for \"What Would Christina P Do?!\"</p> <p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Mom Fail\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p>\n",
