  "description": "<p><strong>As an exemplary member of the clergy for 29 years, you'd think honesty to your superiors would be rewarded unconditionally.</strong> Alas, when you disclosed a need to seek counseling during a rough patch between you and your spouse (which resulted in a stronger relationship), you were unceremoniously booted from your position. Now you can't find work at another church because you've been unfairly branded a pariah among those of your faith, and you can't find a job among the secular because your clerical past seems to be a turn-off to potential employers. What can you do?
