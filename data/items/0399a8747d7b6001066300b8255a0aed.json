  "description": "This episode explains what stress is, and how it recruits our brain and body to react in specific ways. I describe the three main types of stress, and how two of them actually enhance the function of our immune system making us less vulnerable to infections. I review tools that allow us to control our stress in real-time, as well as tools to prevent long-term stress, burnout and stress-induced illness and anxiety. As always, we cover behavioral tools and supplements that can assist or hinder stress control.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:04:41) Emotions: A Logical Framework of Brain-Body Loops\n(00:10:29) Stress: The (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative\n(00:14:31) The Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action\n(00:21:08) Tools to Actually Control Stress: Reduce Alertness or Increase Calm\n(00:24:15) The Fastest Way to Reduce Stress In Real Time: “Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia”\n(00:29:45) The Fastlane to Calm\n(00:34:53) Important Notes About Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso-vagal Lag\n(00:36:50) Cyclic Sighing For Calm and Sleep Induction\n(00:37:57) Nasal Breathing For Cosmetic, Immune and Performance Enhancement\n(00:38:46) Two Breathing Centers In The Brain\n(00:39:45) Breathing For Speaking Clearly\n(00:40:39) The 3 Types of Stress: Short, Medium and Long-Term\n(00:42:10) Positive Effects of Short-Term Stress: Immunity and Focus\n(00:45:32) Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells\n(00:46:40) Cyclic Deep Breathing IS Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super-Oxygenation\n(00:50:58) Inflammation Is Useful and Good, In the Short Term\n(00:52:02) Procrastination and Self-Manufactured Nootropics\n(00:53:00) Relaxation Can Causes Illness\n(00:54:30) Immune Activation Protocol\n(00:55:20) Medium Term Stress: A Clear Definition\n(00:56:07) Stress Threshold\n(00:57:10) Stress Inoculation Tools: Separating Mind & Body, On Purpose\n(00:59:50) Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated\n(01:02:36) Beyond NSDR\n(01:04:36) Long Term Stress: Definition, Measurement, Cardiovascular Risks\n(01:06:30) Tools for Dealing With Long Term Stress\n(01:08:20) The Oxytocin Myth\n(01:09:15) Serotonin: Satiety, Safety\n(01:12:00) Delight and Flexibility\n(01:13:30) Chemical Irritants We Make But Can Control: Tackykinin\n(01:15:40) Impactful Gratitude\n(01:16:25) Non-Prescription Chemical Compounds For Additional Anti-Stress Support\n(01:18:04) Melatonin: Cautionary Note About Adrenal Suppression\n(01:19:15) Adrenal Burnout Is A Myth… But Why You Need to Know About It Anyway\n(01:21:10) L-Theanine For Stress Reduction and Task Completion Anxiety\n(01:23:00) Beware Taurine and Energy Drinks With Taurine\n(01:23:30) Ashwagandha: Can Powerfully Lower Anxiety And Cortisol\n(01:25:50) Examine.com Is An Amazing Free Resource\n(01:26:20) How This All Relates to Emotions: State Versus Demand = Valence\n(01:32:00) Modulating Reactivity, Mindfulness, & Functionality With Objective Tools\n(01:34:00) Next Steps\n(01:35:40) Topic Suggestions, Subscriptions and Reviews Please\n(01:37:40) Additional Resources, Synthesis\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
