  "description": "\"An Apple archivist has had his YouTube account disabled after Apple filed multiple takedown requests against his account,\" reports the blog Apple Insider:\n\nBrendan Shanks, owner of the Apple WWDC Videos channel on YouTube, tweeted that Apple had filed a series of copyright removal requests against his channel. The videos in question were decades-old recordings of WWDC events. \n\n\"I still have all the original files (and descriptions, which were a lot of work!), and I'll be moving things over to the Internet Archive,\" Shanks posted on Twitter. \"It'll take time though, and unfortunately videos get a lot less visibility when you're not on YouTube. \n\n\"I wasn't super surprised this happened (there were a few takedowns a couple years ago),\" Shanks mused in an earlier tweet. \"I'm honestly more annoyed that it wiped out my personal YoutTube account and even YouTube TV, which I was just billed real money for. \n\n\"A cease and desist in the mail would be much friendlier.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Apple+Kills+Fan's+Long-Time+Archive+of+WWDC+Videos+on+YouTube%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3fGHTjp\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F11%2F05%2F2019204%2Fapple-kills-fans-long-time-archive-of-wwdc-videos-on-youtube%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://apple.slashdot.org/story/22/11/05/2019204/apple-kills-fans-long-time-archive-of-wwdc-videos-on-youtube?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=22337929&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
