  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Hate wasting food at a restaurant? Me too, but we gotta stop feeling wasteful if we're going to lose weight.</p> <p>I grew up poor, eating at buffets, and my momma saying, \"Eat all you can because I don't know when the next meal will be.\"</p> <p>This led to a lifelong problem of overeating. I'd go out to eat. A big ass heaping of food would arrive that's tasty AF.</p> <p>As I ate and hit the point where I've had just enough knowing anymore and it's time to unbutton the pants, my brain lights up like a firecracker thinking...</p> <p>\"I don't want to waste it. I need to get my money's worth.\"</p> <p>Sure I can get a to-go box but in the moment I don't want a damn box. I want another fork load of steak dipped in mashed potatoes.</p> <p>Then I was losing my 100lbs. I knew had to solve this. I had to learn how to stop eating and actually WANT to do it.</p> <p>I didn't want to just learn how to stop eating and feel bad about it. I wanted to stop eating and feel GOOD about it.</p> <p>I was ready to stop wasting my LIFE overeating food.</p> <p>Today's podcast is FOR YOU if you are ready to learn...</p> <p>The self-talk you need in the moment food tastes so good and you don't want to stop.</p> <p>How to quit wasting time in regret, shame, and quitting on your weightloss goals over a few more bites of food.</p> <p>What it takes to leave food behind AND still have a good time (instead of sitting there feeling punished or wasteful).</p> <p>P.S. Today's podcast came from a recording in the new app Clubhouse. You can catch me every Friday at 7:30am CST LIVE answering questions.
