  "description": "<p>In the deep woods of Wisconsin, about an hour outside of Madison, sits one incredible house.  If you didn't know otherwise, you'd be sure it was a Frank Lloyd Wright design.  And you'd be close.  It was designed by his son-in-law, William Wesley Peters.  The place has been immaculately maintained and restored by a loving couple who are looking to downsize.  You'll hear from those owners, their realtor Aaron Weber, and the challenges of selling one of the state's architecture masterpieces.  It's at 4212 CO Road JJ, Black Earth, WI.  Somebody's dream house is waiting for them!</p>",
