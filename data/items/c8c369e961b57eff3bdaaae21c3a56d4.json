Emerging two years later, Power Pop was an attempt to resurrect the Fab Four’s early days. What did it sound like? Impossibly catchy tunes with attitude, taking the contagious harmonies, jangly guitars and la la las of the British Invasion groups, and making them punchier, sometimes heavier. Pop music but powerful. Key bands like Raspberries, Big Star, The Flamin Groovies and Cheap Trick lamenting, yearning and crying about young love in a way that you couldn’t help but sing along to. \n\nThe genre would hit its commercial peak at the end of the 70s. But what were the essential steps along the way, the key tracks and influencers? And how did it get to the point where “My Sharona” could become the biggest-selling US single of 1979. This is how Power Pop became Power Pop.\n\n#powerpop #bigstar #musicdocumentary \n\nThis video is sponsored by Surfshark.\n\nAdditional Writing by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:53 Ad Time\n02:03 The Beatles & The British Invasion\n08:16 The Other Side of the Atlantic\n11:34 Sugar, Sugar & The Rise of Bubblegum Pop\n15:12 Badfinger: The New Fab Four?\n16:55 Raspberries: The First Power Pop Band\n19:39 Big Star: December Boys Got It Bad\n22:09 Todd Rundgren: And Make It Loud and Clear\n23:34 The Return of US Power Pop\n28:54 Glam Rock & The Bay City Rollers\n31:23 Stiff Records & The Outcasts of Pub Rock\n34:09 When Power Pop & Pop Punk Collide\n36:56 The Records: The Writ Has Hit The Fan\n38:41 Cheap Trick: Didn't I, Didn't I, Didn't I...\n40:52 The New Wave-ification of US Power Pop\n45:22 The Knack: ...My Thighs, Sharona\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
