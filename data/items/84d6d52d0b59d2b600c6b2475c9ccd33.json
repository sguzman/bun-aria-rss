  "title": "12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos by Jordan.B.Peterson",
  "description": "Dr Peterson presents 12 principles that we should all be aware of in this book. The rules vary widely. However, the complexity and depth of his arguments remain constant throughout the book. From developing on the thoughts of famous psychologists such as Freud and Jung, to explaining the moral virtues within a myriad of different religions. This book prepares the reader for the challenges that will inevitably come during this life. The impact of this book comes from its directness towards the reader. We are left exhausted but enlightened after reading it. Why I think this book is so impactful is because of the demographic it targets. Peterson makes sure to leave this book available for anyone willing to read it regardless of their background. It's a book that I will continue to revisit as the years go by and in my mind is a modern-day classic. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
