  "description": "Today’s show is a great one. First, Pro Bowler, 2001 AFC Offensive Player of the Year, former 2nd round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Colorado, Kordell “Slash” Stewart joins the program. Pat and Kordell chat about if he ever thinks he was before his time as a quarterback when he see’s what the current NFL QB’s are doing, why the stigma of being an athletic quarterback always bothered him, Kordell tells some hilarious stories about his time in Pittsburgh, and chats about his son carrying on his legacy (1:01-26:47). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ are joined in studio by Super Bowl Champion, 5x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, 2013 AFC Defensive Player of the Year, member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and future Hall of Famer, Robert Mathis. Pat, AJ, and Robert chat about his time with the Colts, and why the changing of the culture was what killed the team, Robert breaks down the art of pass rushing and the different techniques he used to become one of the most feared pass rushers in NFL history, he chats about what Pat was like as a teammate and how he tried to buy stock in him early, his time at Alabama A&M and what being in the HBCU Hall of Fame means, and what he’s been doing now with his Gridiron Gang camps trying to teach players how to correctly pass rush in an incredible conversation (28:43-1:38:44). Lastly, former Green Bay Packers VP of Finance, Executive VP at Vayner Sports, host of the Business of Sports podcast, and friend of the show, Andrew Brandt joins the program. Pat and Andrew discuss the business of baseball and how he’s not sure if the result of the proposal is good lawyering or bad lawyering, why he and Pat both agree that the NFL will probably go off without a hitch given some sort of waiver that players will have to sign, they discuss how the salary cap will be affected by everything happening with Covid, and if that is why Dak Prescott is ultimately agreeing to the franchise tender, and why with the current climate of things, Andrew would not negotiate extensions with big name players like Patrick Mahomes because of all the variables (1:41:55-1:57:34). Don’t forget to send in your pictures of where you’re watching the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
