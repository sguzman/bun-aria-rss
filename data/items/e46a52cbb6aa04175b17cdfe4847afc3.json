  "description": "In Revelation 21–22, John offered a resplendent portrayal of a new Jerusalem without a temple, in which he seemed to reference the final chapters of Ezekiel. The puzzling issue for interpreters is why John chose to utilize Ezekiel’s temple vision if he wanted to dispense with the temple.\nIn Temple of Presence: The Christological Fulfillment of Ezekiel 40-48 in Revelation 21:1-22:5 (Wipf & Stock, 2019) Andrea Robinson delves into the complex relationship between these two visions of heaven and earth, examining parallels between Revelation 21–22 and Ezekiel 40–48. In the process, Robinson also explores a variety of apocalyptic works from the Second Temple period to determine the tenor of thought in regard to the concepts of the temple and the messiah in John’s day. Ultimately, she helps readers understand how John utilizes Ezekiel’s imagery to portray Jesus Christ as the eschatological temple—the place where heaven and earth unite. By uncovering how original hearers would have understood John’s visions, Robinson’s insightful study helps modern readers appropriate the same hope of a glorious future with the Messiah.\nAndrea L. Robinson is an adjunct professor at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in New Orleans, where she completed her PhD in 2018. She is also associate pastor at Building Church in Madison, Alabama.\nJonathan Wright is a PhD student in New Testament at Midwestern Baptist theological seminary. He holds an MDiv from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a ThM from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and can be reached at jonrichwright@gmail.com, on Twitter @jonrichwright, or jonathanrichardwright.com.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
