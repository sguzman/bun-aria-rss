  "description": "In life, there will always be people with their hands out looking for what they can get.  What they can take for themselves without a thought for someone else.  And, there are others who live their lives working to make the lives of others, better.  Chris Daniel was that guy.  When I tell you that Chris changed my life, E’s life, Karl’s life and everybody at ETA, Breathe University, Gamechangers and beyond, believe me, Chris’s life and example, made a difference! When Chris came onboard and introduced us all to his 4Animals personality assessment, he turned everything we thought we knew about ourselves upside down. Professionally, Chris was in a class all by himself.  He was honestly,  the best of the best of the best.  Personally, he was no different. Chris was my dude. Just a solid human being, he went through enormous personal tragedy but bounced back,  spending the rest of his life pouring into everyone he met and worked with. Chris believed in us, showed us, mad love, and by just being around him, hearing his critiques, watching him teach, seeing the passion he poured into every exchange whether he was in front of an audience or those moments backstage, or privately,  he made us all stand up a little taller in everything we do.  Chris was a friend who became my brother, and I am going to miss him terribly. That having been said, I will live the rest of my life in a way that best mirrors the life Chris taught me to live, and I would encourage you to do the same.  Take inventory of your life. Make it right with whomever you have beef with.  Don't waste another day building someone else's future without laying away things for the legacy you wish to leave behind. Be honest and live and love fully. Good night my friend.  I'll see you in the morning. -CJ",
