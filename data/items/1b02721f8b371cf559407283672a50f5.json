  "description": "<p>Public and commercial companies extensively share cyber threat intelligence\n(CTI) to prepare systems to defend against emerging cyberattacks. Most used\nintelligence thus far has been limited to tracking known threat indicators such\nas IP addresses and domain names as they are easier to extract using regular\nexpressions. Due to the limited long-term usage and difficulty of performing a\nlong-term analysis on indicators, we propose using significantly more robust\nthreat intelligence signals called attack patterns. However, extracting attack\npatterns at scale is a challenging task. In this paper, we present LADDER, a\nknowledge extraction framework that can extract text-based attack patterns from\nCTI reports at scale. The model characterizes attack patterns by capturing\nphases of an attack in android and enterprise networks. It then systematically\nmaps them to the MITRE ATT\\&amp;CK pattern framework. We present several use cases\nto demonstrate the application of LADDER for SOC analysts in determining the\npresence of attack vectors belonging to emerging attacks in preparation for\ndefenses in advance.\n</p>",
