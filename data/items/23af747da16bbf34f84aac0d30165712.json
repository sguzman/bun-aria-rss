[05:24]</p><p>My first impressions upon hearing Tom’s work in Rage Against the Machine. [09:16]</p><p>Where did Tom’s parents meet, and what was it like to grow up as an interracial child with a single mother in Libertyville, Illinois during the mid-1960s when they parted? [09:49]</p><p>How did Tom’s mother encourage him to respond to the racism he would sometimes encounter in this otherwise idyllic Midwestern suburb? [12:46]</p><p>What politicized Tom even more than reading Noam Chomsky in high school? [14:54]</p><p>When did music enter the picture for Tom, and what precipitated his first band coming together? What experience really drove home the fact that making music was an accessible goal? [16:32]</p><p>How did Tom learn guitar? [20:59]</p><p>How did Tom become the first person from Libertyville, Illinois to ever go to Harvard, and what did he take away from his experience there? [22:24]</p><p>After graduation, Tom drove his Chevy Astro van west to Hollywood with a thousand dollars and a dream. How long did the money last, how supportive was his mom of this endeavor, and what was his plan B if things didn’t go as intended? For that matter, how thought-out was plan A? [23:36]</p><p>Exotic dancing as a makeshift plan B. [25:32]</p><p>How did Tom become involved in the band Lock Up, and why was getting signed to a major record label more of a curse than a blessing? [26:32]</p><p>How did Rage Against the Machine come together, and what kind of experimentalism did Tom bring to the band? [28:27]</p><p>When did Tom know Rage Against the Machine was working, and how did his experience with Locked Up inform his approach to dealing with the music industry when it came knocking this time around? [30:51]</p><p>Who finally succeeded in signing Rage Against the Machine, and to what does Tom credit the enthusiastic response of the fandom to the band’s live performances? [33:17]</p><p>How performing as a solo acoustic act in front of eight people in a coffee shop can be a more vulnerable experience than playing as part of a band live on television for millions. [36:26]</p><p>How Tom prepares for a gig. [39:01]</p><p>What factors contributed to the end of Rage Against the Machine? [40:40]</p><p>How did Tom’s father come back into his life? [41:42]</p><p>If Tom weren’t a guitar player, what would he do for a living? [47:23]</p><p>If Tom had to teach someone guitar in three months, what would the curriculum be? [47:44]</p><p>What are the biggest wastes of time Tom sees novice musicians making? What are the wrong things to focus on? [48:58]</p><p>As a teacher, what advice might Tom have for an aspiring young artist who can’t seem to make a connection with their audience? [50:14]</p><p>What book has Tom gifted most? [51:12]</p><p>An inspiring quote Tom ponders often. [51:56]</p><p>An inexpensive purchase that has had a positive impact on Tom’s life. [52:44]</p><p>How did Prophets of Rage come together? [53:30]</p><p>What would Tom’s billboard say? [55:54]</p><p>Advice for artists who might feel too intimidated to try changing the world.
