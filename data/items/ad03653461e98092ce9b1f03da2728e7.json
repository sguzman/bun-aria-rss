  "description": "Today, instead of listening to our usual 45-minute episode, we’re asking you to take that time to listen, read, or watch content that elevates black voices, black stories, and black-owned businesses.\n\nPodcasts:\n\n\nThe 1619 Project from the New York Times Magazine is a multimedia initiative that began last August to mark the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It reframes American history by exploring the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans. Check out the entire project on the Times’s site, and listen to the podcast portion, simply called 1619.\n\nWe’re also huge fans of NPR’s Code Switch. The podcast covers what they call “overlapping themes of race, ethnicity and culture, how they play out in our lives and communities, and how all of this is shifting.”\n\nThe Ringer’s show Higher Learning has an episode titled “The Importance of the Nationwide Protests Over George Floyd’s Death.” If you want insight on where we go from here, this has it.\n\n\nBooks:\n\n\nWhite Fragility by Robin DiAngelo has been recommended online endlessly over the last several days, and there’s a reason for that. The book explores why white people feel so uncomfortable talking about race.\n\nFor a better understanding of the historical challenges of being black and doing business, read Hannibal Johnson’s Black Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa's Historic Greenwood District.\n\nRead some of the classics by black authors including Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, and Maya Angelou.\n\n\nVideos:\n\nRachel Cargle’s YouTube video titled “Public Address On Revolution: Revolution Now” is a moving assessment of today’s reality. \n\nOn Netflix, check out 13th from Ava Duvernay to understand the U.S. prison system’s history of racial inequality.\n\n\nYou can also support black businesses. Find great compilations of those businesses on WeBuyBlack, The Black Wallet, and Official Black Wall Street.\n\nFinally, if you’re in the position to give, consider donating to one of the many reputable organizations helping further anti-racism causes.\n\nFor more information about anti-racism or resources for further learning, look here, here, and here.",
