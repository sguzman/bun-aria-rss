  "description": "There are currently seven criminal investigations related to Alex Murdaugh and we'll review the salient points in each to capture a bird's eye view of this heinous saga. The Murdaugh name appears repeatedly in police interviews during the investigation of Stephen Smith's murder, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. In this episode, we'll review the funds Alex is alleged to have stolen from the Satterfield estate by false pretense, an obstruction of justice allegation stemming from the criminal investigation of Mallory Beach's death, his identification as a person of interest in the brutal murders of his wife and son, the alleged \"suicide for hire\" plot and resulting criminal charges, and the new reports of alleged ties to drug gangs, smugglers and perhaps beyond.\nFor more details on these seven investigations, we encourage you to listen to the following episodes:\n\nWho Killed Stephen Smith? Episodes 2, 4, 9, 17\n\nWhat Happened To Gloria Satterfield? Episodes 10, 12, 13, 14\n\nWho Killed Mallory Beach? Episodes 3, 5, 7\n\nWho Killed Maggie & Paul?
