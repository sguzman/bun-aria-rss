  "description": "<p>This week, we're diving into the world of Instagram. This is perhaps the most popular social media platform for artists, but it can feel overwhelming, confusing or just downright frustrating. What are the right hashtags? Why do some posts do better than others? How can you increase your following? Do your clothes have to match your paintings? And what on earth is a reel? In this wide-ranging discussion, we share our own strategies for success on Instagram and explain how we have built up a following over time. Our tips include taking things slowly, considering your grid, having conversations, and only using extra features such as stories, reels and IGTV if they really appeal to you. We also discuss the dreaded algorithm and explain the simple secret to making it work for you. This might not be the definitive guide to Instagram - we'd need more time for that! - but we hope it sparks some ideas, eliminates some fears, or inspires you to get more active on the platform. Instagram really can be fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Heavyweight podcast: <a href=\"//\">https://gimletmedia.com/shows/heavyweight</a></p>\n<p>Bibby G: <a href=\"//\">www.bibbyart.com</a></p>\n<p>Word Hippo <a href=\"//\">https://www.wordhippo.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/\"><u>www.alicesheridan.com</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
