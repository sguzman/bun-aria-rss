    "media:description": "Who were the Mughals exactly and what on Earth happened to this civilization and empire? The Mughals were one of the biggest empires to ever encompass South Asia, at one point nearly spanning the entirety of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Islam has a long history in India and South Asia that can be tied to many different empires and dynasties, although the Mughals are probably the most well known.\n\nProcrastination sucks doesn't it? In today's video we're going to be taking a brief look at the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire and discuss just where they came from and where they went since very few to none identify as Mughals in the present day. Yes, I realize a lot of Indians really don't like the Mughals, just chill out for a minute. Thanks for watching!",
