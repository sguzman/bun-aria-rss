  "description": "<p>My #HoneyDew this week is Maronzio Vance! Maronzio goes deep into his past and openly discusses the trauma he suffered from being molested and how that has played a role in his relationships and his life. Trauma isn't an easy thing to open up about and it's definitely not something that's easy to laugh about. The HoneyDew is a safe space to dive into the darkness and find that light and laughter and we go there! I can't thank Maronzio enough for being so honest! Subscribe, download & review!</p>",
