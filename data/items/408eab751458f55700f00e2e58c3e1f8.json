  "description": "Emily Wakild and Michelle K. Berry have written a practical, informative, and inspiring guide to teaching environmental history. It also happens to be fun. A Primer for Teaching Environmental History: Ten Design Principles (Duke University Press, 2018) offers strategies and approaches that educators can apply in a variety of settings: from high school classrooms to college courses, and from environmental history and environmental studies courses to US and world history surveys. Wakild and Berry draw on their years of experience in the classroom to describe not only the how, but also the why of effective teaching. They thereby empower readers to take these principles and make them their own. “Pedagogy is a process or shared endeavor,” write Wakild and Berry. With this book, they welcome educators from various backgrounds into this collaborative undertaking.\nEmily Wakild is Professor of History and Director of Environmental Studies at Boise State University. Michelle K. Berry is Assistant Professor of Practice in the Department of Gender & Women’s Studies and a lecturer in the History Department at the University of Arizona.\nJosh Nygren is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Central Missouri.
