  "content:encoded": "\n                            <p><strong>The country won its freedom 43 years ago, President Ebrahim Raisi said</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>In a televised speech on Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi dismissed US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s promise to <em>&ldquo;free Iran,&rdquo;</em> telling his American counterpart that the country secured its freedom when the pro-Western Shah was deposed in 1979. Tehran has accused the US and its allies of instigating a wave of anti-government protests in recent months.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo;</em> Biden told supporters at a rally in California on Thursday, <em>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re gonna free Iran. They&rsquo;re gonna free themselves pretty soon.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Biden did not elaborate on what the US would do to <em>&ldquo;free Iran,&rdquo;</em> but the White House and lawmakers from both parties in Washington have previously made statements in support of anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and the US has imposed two rounds of sanctions on the Iranian government in response. The protests broke out after a 22-year-old woman died in police custody following her arrest for wearing an <em>&ldquo;improper&rdquo;</em> hijab.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/6362c41e85f54005914ce3ec.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565835-us-not-invincible-iran/\">US is not invincible – Iran</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling Biden that Iran was freed 43 years ago,&rdquo;</em> Raisi declared, addressing Biden&rsquo;s comments. He referred to the revolution that ousted the American-backed Shah and led to the formation of the country&rsquo;s current Islamist government.</p>\n<p>Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian called on Biden to <em>&ldquo;stop [his] hypocritical behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>\"The White House has increasingly promoted violence and terror in the recent riots in Iran, while at the same time it is trying to reach a nuclear agreement,&rdquo;</em> he wrote on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Iranian officials have accused the US, as well as Saudi Arabia and Israel, of fomenting the ongoing protests and riots. Raisi has claimed that <em>&ldquo;these riots pave the ground for terrorist attacks,&rdquo;</em> referring to a mass shooting at a shrine last week that left 15 people dead.</p>",
