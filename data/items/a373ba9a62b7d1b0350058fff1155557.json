    "media:description": "When DaddyOFive first began their channel back in 2015, the goal was simple: play some light hearted pranks in order to generate views. In the beginning, the Daddy'O'Five channel was fun, however as time progressed, it would steadily descend into an increasingly tragic tale. Eventually, DaddyOFive would lose custody over part of his family, have his channel deleted, and completely steamroll his reputation in the process.\n\nThis is, The Tragedy Of YouTube's Saddest Family Channel: DaddyOFive.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§\n\nThe idea for this video was partially inspired by \"InternetAjay\" who posted a video on a similar topic in August 2021 titled \"The Rise And Fall Of DaddyOFive: From Family Prank Channel To Deleted\" You can watch his version here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuT98suaoc",
