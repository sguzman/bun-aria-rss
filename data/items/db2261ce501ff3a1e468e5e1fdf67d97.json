  "description": "<p>In this 91st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss co-morbidities that are associated with bad outcomes from Covid (e.g. obesity, anxiety), and how to take control of your own health. We discuss Joe Rogan and his detractors. The “Central Park Karen” story from May 2020 is revealed as something most people don’t know, by Bari Weiss and Kmele Foster in a recent episode of Honestly (Bari’s podcast). It is an amazing story—well worth listening to—and one lesson of it is that we are living in a conclusion-driven world—journalism, science, and justice are all succumbing. We discuss how (other) liberals are beginning to see the mainstream narrative as incoherent and dangerous. And we discuss plans to bike a century. Chapter 8 of A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, our forthcoming book, is “Parenthood and Relationship.” We read an excerpt on pets and love and also grief, and discuss the value of sitting with the body of your loved one after they die. And finally, we discuss why breast is best, despite what manufacturers of formula would have you believe.
