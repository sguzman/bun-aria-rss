  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony and Sage sit down for an intimate fireside chat to unpack the stress many of us feel around the holidays. We all have rules and beliefs about how things are supposed to be or how people are supposed to be. And when they do not meet our expectations, we suffer. The holidays can hold a magnifying glass over these expectations, whether that be family dynamics, budgets, or how well the turkey turned out.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen as Tony and Sage suggest a new approach: To replace expectation with appreciation, to lead with gratitude and thanksgiving instead of worry, fear or anger. Sage eloquently calls us to take pause on the list-making and to-do’s associated with getting ready for the holidays. And Tony provides us with an invaluable tool for how to get more joy out of each individual moment and experience.
