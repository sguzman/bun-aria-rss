  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, revolutionaries are pulling down statues of any founding father or historical figure that has a link to slave ownership. Taking this knee jerk reaction to its logical extreme would suggest that the Declaration of Independence and the U.S Constitution should no longer apply to them. This would eliminate the very right to protest that the agitators are actively using. Due process, speedy trials, and all other liberties afforded to all Americans was drafted and ratified by two-thirds of Congress. A legislative body made up of slave-owners and free men, from slave states and free states alike. By asserting these documents, movements like Black Lives Matters are tacitly accepting America's history of laws written by White males. This logic is inconsistent with the rhetoric espoused by these movements. Then, liberty wasn't intended to destroy liberty; Americans must never use the Constitution to destroy the Constitution. Law enforcement and intelligence apparatchiks must never be used to stop a political rival. This rejection of the peaceful transition of power breads violence and now it’s metastasizing. Later, Joe Biden and the new left continue the push for free college because most campuses are Marxist training grounds. Interestingly President Trump has done more to provide funding for historically Black Colleges and Universities than any other U.S President. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
