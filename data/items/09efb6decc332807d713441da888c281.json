Fresh, fruity.</li> <li><strong>Crianza wines:</strong> Minimum of 1 year in casks/oak, 1 year in bottle. For white wines, the minimum cask ageing period is 6 mo</li> <li><strong>Reserva wines: </strong>Selected wines of the best vintages with an excellent potential. Aged a minimum of 3 years -- 1 in cask, at least 6 months in bottle. For whites, the minimum ageing period is 2 years, with at least 6 months in casks.</li> <li><strong>Gran Reserva wines: </strong>Selected wines from exceptional vintages.
