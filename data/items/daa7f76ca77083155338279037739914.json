    "media:description": "This keynote was presented by Em Grasmeder at Lambda World 2019. \n\nFull Presentation Description:\n\nThe field of data science, which has an increasingly profound impact on our lives, is meanwhile in the middle of an identity crisis. The fundamental questions of what data science is, who is a data scientist, and how do we best do data science to serve society, remain largely undecided. Regardless of where the answers will fall, there are a number of tools, techniques, and ways of thinking that every data scientist should have in their toolbelt. Although the software languages, frameworks, and algorithms will come in and out of fashion, the fundamentals behind the trade have existed for centuries and will continue to be used for ages to come.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/emgrasmeder\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
