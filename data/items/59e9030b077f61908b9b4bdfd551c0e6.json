So, questions about what it really means in practice to kind of export a particular cultural framework like Wahhabism. To kind of pick it up and move it to another location, and what that really looks like in practice. And questions about how ideas -- religious ideas -- can perhaps transform as they cross borders, and can perhaps be put to new uses and new contexts.\"\n\nMichael Farquhar is a lecturer in Middle East politics at King's College London. His new book is from Stanford University Press and called Circuits of Faith: Migration, Education and the Wahhabi Mission.",
