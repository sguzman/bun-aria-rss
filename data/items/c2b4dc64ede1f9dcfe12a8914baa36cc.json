  "title": "PODCAST 7-24-2018: Trump in Europe with Branko Marcetic",
  "description": "Here's that interview I promised you all last week. I'm speaking with writer Branko Marcetic, who has been covering Donald Trump's trip to the NATO summit and his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki for Jacobin and In These Times. He's been doing some great work countering the overwrought conventional narratives about both events. We discuss what really happened in Brussels and Helsinki and talk about NATO's superfluous post-Cold War existence. This one is open to the public.
