  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’re talking whitetailed deer, but this isn’t the typical tips, tactics and biology that we hear so much about.  That stuff is useful, and we love it, but the foundation of why that knowledge is even desirable is found in the onion a layer deeper. We want the knowledge because of how valuable whitetails are to us. Whitetail deer hunting culture in this country is uniquely Americana, there’s nothing else like in the world. The sheer number of whitetails, their wide geographic distribution, the liberal seasons coupled with the rich and unique heritage we have is unapparelled.  We’ve got a compilation of storytellers on this episode, many are familiar voices in the Bear Grease stratosphere and a few are new. We'll hear stories from Gary \"Believer\" Newcomb, Andy Brown, Steve Rinella, James Lawrence, Mark Kenyon of the Wired to Hunt Podcast and Tony Peterson. We’ve got big bucks, little bucks, missed bucks, bristled gruntin’-runnin’ bucks, clickin’ bucks and bucks falling in holes, but one thing is for sure you’re not going to want to miss this one.</p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
