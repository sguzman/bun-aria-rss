  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Democrats want big, bold, fast change so they can re-make the country. They will label all who oppose eliminating the filibuster rule as racists. Yet it's the Democrats that are the party of racism, Jim Crow, and the KKK. The filibuster rule is a bulwark for liberty and is used by politicians on both sides for the purpose of debate. Democrats want to end this so they can make power-grabs in Congress and not have to explain themselves to anyone. Then, the real pandemic is the Democrat Party. Chuck Schumer aims to bring legislation to require background checks for the loaning of firearms. This is in addition to the federal background check that is imposed at the purchase of the firearm. Later, artifacts found in Israel, and in what the media erroneously calls \"the occupied West Bank\" show that coins and other items date back to ancient Israel. This discovery proves this land is not occupied. Afterward, Sen. Ted Cruz calls in to discuss Biden's border crisis which now has more unaccompanied minors in federal government custody than ever before. This dangerous border crisis falls squarely on the shoulders of Biden. Cruz also mentioned that the US needs to go to the next Olympics in China and kick some butt!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
