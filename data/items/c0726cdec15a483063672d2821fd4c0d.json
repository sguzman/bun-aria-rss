  "description": "Donald Trump has taken establishing foolish redlines into the 21st Century with the use of social media.  In the case of North Korea, he is threatening devastating outcomes if they go one inch further…and then they do…and do it again…and he doesn’t act.  Is he all talk?  Or is he the irrational maniac he seems to be, the kind who could trigger a catastrophe on the Korean Peninsula?  Our loyal band of deep staters—Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Colin Kahl—discuss and lament the current state of play of this most serious crisis of the young Trump administration.  Join them for this special back-to-school episode of Deep State Radio…and the most rational discussion of the North Korea crisis you will hear anywhere!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
