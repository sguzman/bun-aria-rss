In particular, seeing LGBTQ+ people depicted in art and media who were thriving gave me confidence to be who I am. Artistic expression, from people like <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/keith-haring/m01sl6w?hl=en\">Keith Haring</a> and <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/frida-kahlo%E2%80%99s-lasting-impact-on-lgbtq-artists/CgISm6mFqz2HIQ\">Frida Kahlo</a>, has been crucial for LGBTQ+ people throughout history for telling our stories and securing equal rights.</p><p data-block-key=\"biuht\">To celebrate the next generation of LGBTQ+ artists this Pride month, Chrome commissioned five LGBTQ+ artists to create themes you can select to personalize your Chrome browser and Chromebook. Available globally starting today with more options coming soon, these themes reflect the unique points of view of each individual artist. Here’s how some of the artists describe their work:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\" data-component=\"uni-image-carousel\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"Chrome browser theme with one person in a purple shirt facing another person in a green shirt looking out into the world.\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" data-loading='{\n                      \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/world_view_1280x800.max-800x800.png\",\n                      \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/world_view_1280x800.max-800x800.png\"\n                    }' style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/world_view_1280x800.max-200x200.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Chrome browser theme with one person in a purple shirt facing another person in a green shirt looking out into the world.</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"p89a8\">Derek Abella: “This theme was inspired by the special feeling of finding someone who sees life in the same way. Oftentimes, people in our community feel misunderstood and grow to be observers, but we’re never totally alone in this world.”</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"Chrome browser theme with a person in pink tank top depicted having glasses with multiple eyes.\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/saint_screenshot_1280x800.max-800x800.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Chrome browser theme with a person in pink tank top depicted having glasses with multiple eyes.</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"momrx\">Carlos Aponte: “All the pieces are autobiographical; I can only speak from my own experiences.

They’re two of the more unambiguously queer characters in Greek mythology.”</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"Chrome browser theme featuring a person with multi-colored hair flowing across the frame in all directions.\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ultimate_self_1280x800.max-800x800.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Chrome browser theme featuring a person with multi-colored hair flowing across the frame in all directions.</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"5ei03\">Ohni Lisle: “LGBT+ people often go from hating their inability to fit in, to relishing it as a beautiful character building experience. The joy of self exploration and presentation is reflected in this theme — someone completely letting their freak flag fly.” (Note: this theme will be available on Chromebooks starting today and in Chrome browser later this month)</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure class=\"h-c-grid\"><div aria-label=\"Chrome browser theme with two people wearing cowboy hats with their arms around one another looking at fireworks.\" class=\"article-carousel__slide-img h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/cowboys.max-600x600.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Chrome browser theme with two people wearing cowboy hats with their arms around one another looking at fireworks.</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col-l--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"5ei03\">Tallulah Fontaine: “I wanted to create a scene that reflected the place I grew up — the prairies — and the idea of finding love in unexpected places.
