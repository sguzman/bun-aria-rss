  "description": "<p>THE GAMES ARE FINALLY HERE! Yes that's right, after an extra year of waiting we are finally about to celebrate the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and make ourselves very busy and excited for the next two weeks! And with that in mind, it's time to bring you a full preview episode of everything you need to know ahead of the Olympics and just what to expect when you're glued to your screens over the next 16 days. We go over the big medal hopes for both Australia and Canada and talk up some of the events we are most excited for, as well as the ones we're maybe not that excited for as well. We also go over which athletes we have probably jinxed a lot by them appearing on our show, as well as trying to talk up the mascot (and pronounce it correctly), trying to talk up Channel 7 and CBC and trying to talk up anything to do with dressage and rhythmic gymnastics. It's all together in one massive preview episode for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics that any Olympic fan simply can't miss!</p>",
