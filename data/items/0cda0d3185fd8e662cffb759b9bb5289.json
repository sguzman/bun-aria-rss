  "title": "Alisha Brosse, “End the Insomnia Struggle” (New Harbinger, 2016)",
  "description": "Every night around the world, millions of people lie in bed at night, struggling to fall asleep. Experts suggest that about one in three people struggle with at least mild insomnia. Paradoxically, their efforts to control their sleep may actually result in digging them in even deeper into insomnia. Fortunately for people with insomnia, and the therapists and medical professionals who treat them, some behavioral interventions are helping many people to end the pattern of sleeplessness.\n\nIn this interview, cross-posted from the new podcast Psychologists Off The Clock, Dr. Diana Hill interviews Dr. Alisha Brosse, who co-authored the book End the Insomnia Struggle: A Step by Step Guide to Get to Sleep and Stay Asleep (New Harbinger Publications, 2016) with Dr. Colleen Ehrnstrom. Dr. Brosse is a specialist in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), which is considered the best treatment for chronic insomnia. Dr. Brosse is also the Associate Director of the Robert D. Sutherland Center for the Evaluation and Treatment of Bipolar Disorder, provides evidence-based treatment for a variety of mental health concerns and offers training for mental health professionals.\n\nDr. Brosse explains how the cycle of insomnia develops and why our efforts to control sleep have paradoxical effects. Dr. Brosse then describes cognitive, behavioral and acceptance-based strategies in insomnia treatment. Specifically, Dr. Brosse explains two behavioral approaches that are key to CBT-Is effectiveness: Stimulus Control Therapy and Sleep Restriction Therapy. Dr. Brosse also shares how willingness is an important component to successful insomnia treatment.\n\nRead an excerpt from End the Insomnia Struggle here!\n\n\n\nDiana Hill, Ph.D. is a licensed psychologist practicing in Santa Barbara, California, and a co-host of the podcast Psychologists Off The Clock.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
