Residents of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and 11 other states must be registered <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-deadlines.aspx\">28 to 30 days before an election</a>, while people who live in 18 states including Colorado, California and Michigan can register through Election Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other limits on voting, younger and lower-income voters and people of color are disproportionately disenfranchised by lengthy advance deadlines for registering to vote, strict documentation requirements and lack of flexibility for registering online or by mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in states with strict documentation requirements or without online registration or the ability to register and vote on the same day, there can be disproportionate barriers in access for people of color, elderly voters and rural voters who live far from a local election office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Registering to vote and being on the voter rolls is a prerequisite to exercising the fundamental right to vote, and anything that’s a barrier to getting on, and staying on, the registration lists can act as a barrier to enfranchise,” said <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/about-us/staff/steven-lance/\">Steven Lance</a>, a policy counsel at the Legal Defense Fund.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can include having “unnecessarily long deadlines” ahead of an election, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A lot of us aren&#8217;t actually thinking about an election more than a month before it,” Lance said. “If people aren’t registered in some of these states a full month before, by the time the election is on their radar and they’re ready to vote, it’s too late for their registration to become active so they can participate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-registration-is-a-key-factor-in-access-to-voting\">Registration is a key factor in access to voting</h2>\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://newsroom.niu.edu/how-hard-is-it-to-vote-in-your-state/\">2020 study from Northern Illinois University</a> found that three registration-related factors significantly help break down barriers to casting a ballot: online voter registration, Election Day (or same-day) registration and automatic voter registration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texas makes it <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/elj.2020.0666\">harder</a> than any other state, forcing voters to register over a month before Election Day and lacking an online registration system. And four other states – Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma and South Dakota – also hit the trifecta, currently without <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx\">online</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx\">automatic</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">same-day</a> voter registration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automatic voter registration</strong> adds eligible voters to voter rolls whenever they interact with statewide databases. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/23/voter-registration-fraud-suppression/\">For example</a>, if you renew a driver’s license as a U.S. citizen, the computer checks if your name, address and age are in the voter rolls already. If they’re not, you’ll be added automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In California, voter registration had been long available at the Department of Motor Vehicles. But when registration became automatic in 2018, registrations through the DMV <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57b8c7ce15d5dbf599fb46ab/t/5eb8fafa0e4d61663a1833f4/1589181180589/USC+CCEP+Summary+Brief+-+Effects+of+AVR+in+the+U.S.+FINAL.pdf\">more than doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:38% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"780\" height=\"829\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=780%2C829&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-115659 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=963%2C1024&ssl=1 963w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=282%2C300&ssl=1 282w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=768%2C817&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=1444%2C1536&ssl=1 1444w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C1276&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=1568%2C1668&ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=400%2C425&ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C160&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-counts-logo.jpg?w=1682&ssl=1 1682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-color\" id=\"h-about-this-series\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:32px\"><strong>About this series</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:17px\">This project looks at the state of voting access, voting rights and inequities in political representation in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-fill\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/who-counts/who-counts-in-voting/\">Read more</a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Same-day registration</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/news/article/new-study-finds-states-same-day-voter-registration-have-higher-black-and-latinx\">proven</a> to boost turnout across all voters, but it especially drives higher turnout among Black and Latino communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online voter registration</strong> has exponentially boosted registration rates. South Dakota’s voter registration rate increased over 500% after implementing online registration, according to <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/naacp-publications/ldf-blog/online-voter-registration-good-for-states-good-for-voters/\">the Legal Defense Fund</a>. Washington and Kansas also saw registration rates through DMVs double after creating online systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-it-s-harder-to-register-here\">It’s harder to register here</h2>\n\n\n<p>Since the 2020 presidential elections, these states have made it harder to register to vote:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: A <a href=\"https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AZ2022000H2492&ciq=ncsl15&client_md=c758d8b6359adbd07385669f26c771af&mode=current_text\">new state law,</a> which is being challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice, requires residents to show proof of citizenship to register to vote, something that advocates say could <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/who-counts/arizona-sued-by-doj-over-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-to-register-to-vote/\">disenfranchise elderly Indigenous residents</a> who are less likely to even have a birth certificate or similar documents used to prove it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Georgia</strong>: A <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-house-to-vote-on-election-restrictions-amid-staunch-opposition/46SNHMIYGZGMZDG5KLGHAB6NQ4/\">2021 law</a> restricted the number of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/us/politics/churches-black-voters-georgia.html\">Sundays</a> where people can register to vote. Sunday was traditionally a time when Black congregations would register to vote together after church services wrapped up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: A 2021 law made the League of Women Voters of Kansas and other nonprofits <a href=\"https://lawrencekstimes.com/2021/07/01/ks-groups-halt-voter-reg/\">suspend voter registration drives</a>. One of the provisions of this new law makes it a crime to engage in activity that “gives the appearance of being an election official.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kansans miss the opportunity to be engaged, our team misses its right to exercise free speech, and our democracy is undermined,” Davis Hammet, president of social justice group Loud Light, <a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2021/07/01/kansas-groups-halt-voter-registration-drives-to-avoid-being-jailed-under-new-law/\">told the Kansas Reflector</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations argue in court filings that there’s a “serious risk” someone will mistake people hoping to help with voter registration as election officials. As a result, organizations traditionally responsible for managing a large portion of the state’s voter registration efforts have stopped.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hammet <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/who-counts/in-kansas-inequality-in-voting-widens-with-new-limits/\">told Public Integrity earlier this fall</a> that his organization registered more than 10,000 new voters prior to the 2020 election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Montana</strong>: <a href=\"https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:MT2021000H176&ciq=ncsl15&client_md=b7c6c0a2eb7e3f65a0290b0b30837c64&mode=current_text\">HB 176</a>, passed last year, repealed the state&#8217;s Election Day registration law and moved the registration deadline to the day before Election Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Montana Supreme Court <a href=\"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/09/21/montana-election-day-registration-back-on-per-supreme-court-ruling/\">blocked</a> the law repealing Election Day registration in September, though a final ruling is still to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Texas</strong>: Voter roll purges are common practice in Texas. Just last year, the state tracked down and removed voters from voting rolls, flagging them as noncitizens. County workers found up to 17% of those individuals had legally registered to vote at their naturalization ceremonies, the Texas Tribune <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/17/texas-voter-roll-review/\">reported</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-but-it-s-easier-to-register-here\">But it’s easier to register here</h2>\n\n\n<p>These states have <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/these-24-states-improved-access-to-voting-this-year/\">made it easier</a> to register to vote since 2020:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>California</strong>:&nbsp; A <a href=\"https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/AB796/#:~:text=The%20bill%20would%20require%20the%20Department%20of%20Motor%20Vehicles%20and,the%20National%20Voter%20Registration%20Act.\">new “motor voter” law</a>, passed in 2021, is improving the automatic voter registration process at the Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automatic voter registration through the DMV (passed in <a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2015-news-releases-and-advisories/california-new-motor-voter-act-passed-legislature\">2015</a>) has <a href=\"https://www.ppic.org/blog/improving-californias-automatic-voter-registration/\">significantly increased</a> the state’s registration rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: Senate Bill 250, passed last summer, made registering to vote <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/colorado-gov-jared-polis-d-signs-voting-expansion-law/\">easier</a> in a few ways: Automatic voter registration was expanded to Medicaid and other state agencies. Voters became eligible to register online using their social security number.
