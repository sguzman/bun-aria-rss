  "description": "When people told Gary Davis that he would never become the first Native American rapper, he created his own record label and signed himself as an artist. Since then he’s recorded 11 albums and performed hundreds of concerts all around the world. Gary has also starred in feature films The Indian in the Cupboard, Mortal Kombat, and Kull the Conqueror as well as hit TV shows. As a prominent political figure and an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, he’s a vocal proponent and lobbyist for Native American issues. His deep desire to give back was the catalyst for his 54,000 mile tour across North America, bringing hope to people living on reservations.
