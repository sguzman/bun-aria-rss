  "description": "<p>To follow up on the Virginia wine podcast, conversations with Luca Paschina of Barboursville Vineyards, who has been making wine in Charlottesville for 25 years, and a quick snippet of Kelly White of Glen Manor. Both will highlight why VA wine is so unique.</p> <p>A few things on the podcast: </p> <p>1. The recordings were in tasting rooms. If you don't like ambient noise, skip this one.</p> <p>2. You'll hear my dad and Frank Morgan of Drink What You Like blog and Virginia wine expert asking questions as well. I travelled heavy this time! </p> <p>Most of the podcast is a conversation with Luca Paschina of Barboursville Vineyards in Charlottesville, Virginia. They are a standard-bearer for quality in the region, as one of the oldest and finest producers:</p> <ul> <li>We discuss Luca's background -- his schooling in the Piedmont of Italy, his experiences, and how he wound up in Charlottesville working for the Zonin family at Barboursville in 1990</li> <li>Luca explains the improving reputation of Virginia and how Barboursville works to promote the region by making excellent wine</li> <li>We get NERDY -- talking about everything from vineyard management, to diseases that California nurseries have been sending their way and the economics of that, to use of oak, yeast, and wine fads.</li> <li>Then we talk about grapes, and there is some tasting of the Vermentino and the Bordeaux blend, Octagon (at one point I say \"Sauvignon\" and I'm talking about Cabernet Sauvignon, BTW). </li> </ul> <p>Next we have a 5 minute snippet of a conversation with Kelly White of Glen Manor. </p> <ul> <li>Kelly gives us specifics on vintage, how it works for them, and some examples of extreme vineyard management</li> <li> <div>Then she discusses how they make wine and their philosophy and work ethic. These wines are top notch, and much of the magic comes from their orientation and ideas about great wine.</div> </li> </ul> <p>Then we wrap!
