I wanted to make a huge edit of every House Flipper stream Jerma's done, and I started working on editing the first House Flipper stream around October or November of 2021. However, I kept losing interest or wanting to work on other projects, so I didn't have it finished until December 8, 2021. I finished editing about half of the second stream before I got distracted by other projects again, until February 24, 2022, when I talked to some other independent Jerma editors and suggested collaborating on editing all of Jerma's House Flipper streams, because at the rate I was working, I was never going to finish. They liked the idea, so we chose which streams we were interested in editing. I had already finished working on stream #1 and was halfway through stream #2, and I decided to also edit stream #5. I promise you'll see a lot less of me in the second part.\n\n3:05:27 Stream #2 (7/18/2018): https://youtu.be/X5zOQL1eDAw (Prototype for 8 minutes) / https://youtu.be/X5zOQL1eDAw (House Flipper)\nEdited by Skye4\nTransition Music: watson - 砂に埋もれたラジオ https://youtu.be/91_IqsSnPAM\nEditor's Commentary: I decided to include the Prototype segment because why not.\n\n5:17:19 Stream #3 (7/24/2018): https://youtu.be/gEdjzKOeLao\nEdited by Pythanoc (https://www.youtube.com/c/Pythanoc)\nPythanoc's Tip Jar: https://ko-fi.com/pythanoc\nTransition Music: watson - 電脳漂流記 https://youtu.be/sqG_a1-c8f4\nEditor's Commentary: This guy is a psychopath\n\n7:10:47 Stream #4 (5/23/2019): https://youtu.be/C5WE8-464vk\nEdited by Josho (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8N12GFx55u-PUfaiC9MRw)\nJosho's Tip Jar: https://ko-fi.com/joshoeditsjerma\nTransition Music: watson - ヴァニラ https://youtu.be/-sE-5_Fs3bE\nEditor's Commentary: old man yells at cloud\n\n8:07:50 Stream #5 (5/24/2019): https://youtu.be/E6vQYnvknjU\nEdited by Skye4\nTransition Music: watson - Sweet vermouth https://youtu.be/zqYxPCXLH9o\nEditor's Commentary: I'm running out of interesting things to say.",
