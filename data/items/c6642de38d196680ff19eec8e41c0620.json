  "description": "What do you do when you can’t hear God? What happens when we reach out to Him, and He’s silent? Sometimes we can be in a season where we’re asking God for answers, and we hear nothing back. Many of us see God's silence as a punishment. But maybe it's actually a sign of intimacy. In week 3 of our series What I’m Hearing Here, executive pastor Amberly Bell shares with us that when God is silent, He’s never absent. If you're trying to hear from God, this message is for you. Check it out and share it with someone in your life who needs to hear it! <br /><br />#WhatImHearingHere #HereIsHoly #TheSilentSetup #AmberlyBell<br /><br />Join us for service every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST).<br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
