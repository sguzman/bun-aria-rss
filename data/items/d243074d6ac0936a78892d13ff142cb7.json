  "description": "<p><p>Big Cat joins the Kirk Minihane Show in an attempt to heal the multiple divides between Kirk Minihane and the Barstool world. Steven Cheah, Chaps, Kmarko -- Big Cat insists they're all great guys, Minifans in the making. But no one thinks the Willie Colon relationship will ever mend. Minihane probes Big Cat on his podcasting success, how many downloads Pardon My Take gets, and how much money he makes. The two also talk fatherhood, death, fame and fortune.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
