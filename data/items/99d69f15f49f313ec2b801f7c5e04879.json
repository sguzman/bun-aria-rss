  "description": "<p>What if I told you, your camera is a waste of money, and spending more money on a better camera will never make you a better photographer?</p><p>Well it is all true and today I’m going to prove it to you.</p><p>Let’s talk about your camera, your baby. The thing that will unlock doors for you. Lets you explore your creativity, bring smiles to the faces of so many. The thing you treat like a baby. So precious you must protect it.</p><p>Yet at the same time... you want to get rid of it. You would throw your camera away in a HEARTBEAT if it meant you could upgrade to a flagship professional grade camera body.</p><p>Why you ask?</p><p>Oh man, where to start, Its full frame, it can shoot 15fps, max shutter speed of 1/8000th (think of all the humming bird shots you could take!) its weather proof, can survive a bomb explosion, and will SURELY elevate you as a better photographer!</p><p>That sounds incredible.</p><p>However it is completely false.</p><p>A new fancy camera will not improve your photos. It will not win you any awards. No one will come throwing money at you because of the camera you own. Why? No one cares but you. Why? Because the camera does not influence a photo as much as the person holding the camera does.</p><p>Plain and simple.</p><p>A professional camera does have its advantages sure. The rugged body, faster autofocus, and larger sensor. But which of those will make your photo stand out? None.</p><p>Every camera ever has used just 3 settings to expose an image.</p><p>Aperture, which is in the lens and not the camera.</p><p>ISO which is the cameras sensitivity to light</p><p>And Shutter speed.</p><p>The cameras sensitivity to light or ISO is determined by the cameras sensor. With the speed at which technology advances, $500 entry level cameras have the same ISO performance as $5000 flagship cameras did just a few short years ago. Where we are at right now, flagship cameras can pretty much shoot in the dark, which is awesome... but its not that practical. You would never really want to use a photo that you shot in the dark.</p><p>I still get the allure. When I was shooting with a 8mp canon XT I lusted after the 5dmk2. Now I would rather have a new entry level camera rather than a 5dmk2. And you know what, an entry level camera today STILL cost less than a used 5dmk2.</p><p>So what does that mean? It means you are lucky. You are fortunate to live in a time where it is cheaper and easier than ever to take amazing photographs.</p><p>Now I know what you’re saying. If its easier than ever to take amazing photographs, how come my camera does not take amazing photographs?</p><p>Its because YOU dont take amazing photographs.</p><p>Now that was not a personal attack and I’m sure it was an incredibly hard pill to swallow.</p><p>What I mean by that is simply that while the camera has some effect on the final image it is YOU who tells the camera how to take a photo. And if you dont know how a camera sees light, and you don’t which setting to change to get the photo you want, and you look at the photos you have taken on the computer wonder why they dont look like the photos you see online or in magazines, then the problem is you and not the camera.</p><p>If you don’t believe me, rent your dream camera body. I rent all of my gear from <a href='http://bit.ly/CameraLensRentals'><b>CameraLensRentals.com</b></a> and you can even get 20% off your order by using the promo code “<b>BeginnerPhotography</b>”</p><p>What you will find after spending a few days with your dream camera is that you photos don’t look all that different from the photos you took with your entry level camera.
