  "description": "On Thursdays Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd from WJNO fills in. The bad circus freaks of the Washington swamp are at it again pushing the Russian collusion narrative after the Michael Cohen's sentencing. Meanwhile, the Clinton's are still free to go on tour despite suspicions that Hillary Clinton used her influence as Secretary of State to encourage the sale of Uranium mining rights in the U.S. to a Canadian Company called Uranium One with ties to Russian nationals. Yet, Special Counsel Robert Mueller continues to go after President Trump. Hillary Clinton is the closest conspirator to Russia having surreptitiously paid for the dossier from Christopher Steele which included defamatory info on Trump provided by the Russians. But the real Russian collusion was James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and the others that are pushing this witch hunt. The real collusion was between the Clintons and Uranium One. Then, the Democrats have moved so far to the left that Chuck Schumer has completely reversed his position on a border wall that he once supported in 2006.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
