  "description": "The Civil War is called the war in which brother fought against brother. But few knew of the<br /><br />“Gettysburg Rebels”: the five privates from that very town who moved south to Virginia in the 1850s,<br /><br />joined the Confederate army, and returned home as foreign invaders for the great battle in July 1863.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I talk about this story with Tom McMillan, author of Gettysburg Rebels: Five Native Sons Who Came<br /><br />Home to Fight as Confederate Soldiers. It is the story of Gettysburg’s five native sons who abandoned<br /><br />their hometown ties to join the Southern cause. But that's not to say they forgot their families<br /><br />altogether. At least one of these soldiers receive a leave of absence to cross enemy lines at night and<br /><br />visit his family...while in full Confederate uniform.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Willing to relinquish familial ties, Henry Wentz, Wesley Culp, and the three Hoffman brothers kept<br /><br />their hometown connections hidden from Confederate leaders—a decision that would ultimately<br /><br />determine the fate of the Confederacy.",
