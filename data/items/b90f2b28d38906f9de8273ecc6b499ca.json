Kevin is the former benevolent dictator (CEO) of Gitcoin and a General in the war against Moloch (human coordination failure).</p> <p>The purpose of Gitcoin is to provide a platform for open-source software developers to acquire funding for their projects. Kevin mentions that open-source creates $500B in economic value yearly. In the crypto space, and on the internet at large, open-source development means that something is free to use, fork, or build on. This accessibility has been a driving force behind web development, and Gitcoin's mission is to create a business model for open-source software developers. Gitcoin has raised around $20M since its initial launch in November 2017.</p> <p>Gitcoin DAO is seeking to meme itself into the Quadratic Lands, where public goods are well-funded and digital democracy reigns. As Gitcoin has grown, it has come to the point in which a DAO is more well-served for Gitcoin's goals of activism and open-source development. Anti-fragility and distributing points-of-failure are key benefits of transitioning into a DAO. The alignment of incentives between the individual and society is crucial for optimizing capital efficiency and organically generating a better society.</p> <p>GTC = Grow The Community</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Coordination Failures<br /> <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/know-thy-enemy-coordination-failures\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/know-thy-enemy-coordination-failures</a> </p> <p>Claim GTC<br /> <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-alpha-alert-claim-gitcoin-token\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-alpha-alert-claim-gitcoin-token</a> </p> <p>Gitcoin<br /> <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/\">https://gitcoin.co/</a> </p> <p>Quadratic Lands<br /> <a href= \"https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/\">https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/</a> </p> <p>Kevin on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/owocki?s=20\">https://twitter.com/owocki?s=20</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
