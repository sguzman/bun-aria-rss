  "description": "<p>Wow. This is a really, really crazy tale. Sacramento's Richard chase was very mentally ill. He was a paranoid schizophrenic who did not do well when he was off his meds. He was also a sadistic monster and its hard to give him a pass on the heinous acts he committed because of his psychological state. He brutally killed strangers and desecrated their bodies. He killed men, women, and children. He literally ate a baby. If you don't like the darker episodes, be sure to sit this one out. Not a tale for the squeamish! </p>\n<p><strong>Donated $6600 to the YWCA's Idaho County Fund!</strong> <br /><br />To donate yourself to this important cause, go to <strong><a href=\"http://ywcaidaho.org\">ywcaidaho.org</a> </strong>and earmark your donation to “General Fund Idaho County” by typing that in the comments section of the online donation form.
