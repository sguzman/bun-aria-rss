  "description": "<p>You know that little voice in your head? The one that pipes up when you feel guilt over letting your kids eat too many cookies or sets off an internal alarm when you watch something questionable? All of us have one, but it’s not necessarily the Holy Spirit. What is it exactly? In this episode, Emily and Laura explore the topic of personal conscience. God gave us a conscience to help discern what’s right and wrong in the everyday “gray” areas of life. While it can be dulled by sin, God can recalibrate our consciences through the study of his word and fellowship with believers, so we can do all things in faith with love.</p> <p>We’re grateful to singer-songwriter Janet Blair for making this week’s show possible. She is looking for inspiration for future music and wants to tell <em>your</em> story through song.
