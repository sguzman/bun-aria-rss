  "description": "<p>Friday 8/17 - They say he wouldn't be back, but Lil Duval is back, and letting everyone know he got a lot to be smiling for! He discussed his new single \"Smile Bitch\", selling vibes not music and more. Also it is Freaky Freaky Friday, and after Kanye West made a comment on his song “XTCY” about fantasizing about his sister in laws, we opened up the phone lines to see if any of out listeners had the same thought. Also, Charlamagne gives \"Donkey of the Day\" to Fox news for paying homage to the late Aretha Franklin, but the only thing was they were getting her confused with Patti LaBelle. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
