Every year, we gather every Captain (Manager) from every Trader Joe’s across the country together, in one place, to let them know where we’re going, say thanks for all the great things that have happened over the last year, and to give them some useful information to bring back to their stores. We’ll hear about some delicious new products (even for pets!) coming soon to a Trader Joe’s near you, and we’ll have a little fun with our Captains along the way.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\"><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode17-Transcript.pdf\"> <span style= \"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\"> Episode 17 Transcript (PDF)</span></a></span></p>",
