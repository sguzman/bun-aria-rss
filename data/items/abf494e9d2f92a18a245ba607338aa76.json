  "description": "<p>2015-04-08 - Three Liberating Gifts: Part 3 - Looking in the Mirror - This 3 part series is based on a teaching story from the Upanishads that shows our potential to awaken from an ego-based trance and discover the full luminosity and freedom of our natural awareness.  In each class we'll explore one of the three gifts considered as essential on the spiritual path.  The first is the capacity to forgive, to let go of the blame and resentment that prevents our hearts from being open and free.  The second gift is \"inner fire,\" the capacity to devote ourselves wholeheartedly to what we most cherish.  The third gift is a \"mirror\" or the capacity to look deeply into our own hearts and minds and realize the truth of who we are. Each class includes guided meditations that explore how these gifts can be nourished right here and now in our lives.</p>\n<p>Please support this podcast by donating at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donate.html\">www.tarabrach.com</a> or <a href=\"http://imcw.org/Giving.aspx\">www.imcw.org</a>.
