  "description": "<p>In motherhood, we all value different things. Whether it's a clean house, a well-kept schedule, a rockin' postpartum body, a perfectly balanced work/home life, an easy day, an obedient child, a certain type of diet, a frugal budget, or praise for your hard work, all moms have preferences and desires. The problem isn't necessarily with our ideals, but with our hearts. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the common idols in motherhood (including their own). While we can sometimes be guilty of making good things too important, in Christ we are cleansed from all of our idols, and are set free to worship God.</p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
