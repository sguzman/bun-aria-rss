At my home in CT. At the time I reached out to the BFRO and reported them. Eventually after years it was posted on their site as a class A sighting but after trying to get back in touch with them it's been radio silence. I love your show and have a few encounters I'd be like to share!. Let me know if you are interested in some more info!\"</p>",
