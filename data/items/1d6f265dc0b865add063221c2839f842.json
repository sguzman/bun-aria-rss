The time dimension is extremely important to me &#8211; I&#8217;d like to spent as little time as possible in front of TWS. More importantly, since I am working full-time elsewhere, often I cannot show up at the precise time when I want to trade (often that&#8217;s 3:55-4pm EST, when the stock market closes). Fortunately, IB has the conditional orders, and time is one of the possible conditions:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"561\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3262\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time.png 624w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/time-240x216.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>The above screenshot shows how to add a time condition to execute the order only after 15:55 EST. For more details see TWS&#8217;s documentation.</p>\n<p>Setting the time component is pretty much sufficient if trading highly liquid instruments. Set the order type to market and I am done.</p>\n<p>For less liquid assets, I usually exploit the <a href=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5934\">SNAP to MID order type</a>. These are amazing &#8211; they are pretty much what I would have done manually using TWS. I&#8217;d look at the bid and the ask, and kind of mentally determine the middle point. Then, I will put a limit order using either the middle point directly, or subtracting (adding) some amount to it. That&#8217;s exactly what the SNAP to MID implements, and, when combined with a conditional I can simulate the trading as I want it, without being present.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/order.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/order.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3269\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/order.png 626w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/order-240x215.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/2018/01/03/interactive-brokers-snap-orders-delayed-trading/\">Interactive Broker&#8217;s SNAP Orders for Delayed Trading</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com\">Quintuitive</a>.</p>\n",
