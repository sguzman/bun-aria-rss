An update on BadRabbit—which for some reason seems to have hopped quietly away from its infrastructure. Other forms of more conventional ransomware, however, remain in circulation, in the wild. It looks as if Kaspersky software might have stumbled across NSA files after all. The US Senate Intelligence Committee has voted to reauthorize Section 702 surveillance authorities through the end of 2025. Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS on states' funding challenges when trying to sure up the security of their voting systems. Bob Ackerman and Dave DeWalt from AllegisCyber, on the occasion of their business announcements, discussing the investment climate for cyber security. And we have notes on ICS from Atlanta.",
