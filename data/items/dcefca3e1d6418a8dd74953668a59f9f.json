  "description": "Excited to bring you another special interview episode of Off The Podium as we talk to one of Australia's most successful Winter Olympians in Lydia Lassila. The 2010 Olympic Gold medalist in the women's aerials, Lydia backed it up in 2014 with a bronze medal after becoming the first women in history to do the quad-twisting triple somersault. After a 'mini-retirement' post 2014, Lydia has returned to aerials in a push to become the first ever Australian female to compete in 5 Winter Olympics, as well as become the first ever Australian to win more than 2 Winter Olympic medals in their career. We speak to Lydia about her goals for 2018 and find out just how her comeback is going with only 12 months to the Olympics.",
