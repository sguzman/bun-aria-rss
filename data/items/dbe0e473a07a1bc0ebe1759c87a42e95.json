  "description": "Born into an aristocratic family, Russian author Leo Tolstoy’s life was forever changed when he served as an officer in the Crimean War. The brutality he witnessed during the war transformed him from a privileged, aristocratic author to a non-violent anarchist. War and Peace explores the brutal reality of what happens when we make war more humane. Tolstoy’s work has inspired nonviolent pacifist movements across the globe and influenced leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Samuel Moyn is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Jurisprudence at Yale Law School and Professor of History at Yale University. He is the author of Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World, The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History, and more.
