  "description": "<p>A juror in Scott Peterson’s murder trial granted immunity to testify in a San Mateo County courtroom. Richelle Nice is accused of lying on her juror questionnaire for Peterson's 2004 trial. Nice has been accused of lying, by not disclosing that she had filed for a protective order against her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend whom Nice said was stalking her. Nice also did not disclose she had been a victim of domestic violence. Peterson's attorney accused Nice of intentionally lying to get on the jury to convict the accused husband.  After more than five and a half hours, proceedings closed. The judge tells both sides to submit memorandums, if they like, by mid-September. The jurist has up to 90 days to release a decision. </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dale Carson - High Profile Attorney (Jacksonville), Former FBI Agent, Former Police Officer, Author: \"Arrest-Proof Yourself, DaleCarsonLaw.com</li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\" </li>\n<li>Greg Smith - Special Deputy Sheriff, Johnson County Sheriff's Office (Kansas), Executive Director of the Kelsey Smith Foundation, www.kelseysarmy.com, Twitter: @KSFTIPS </li>\n<li>Dr. Michelle DuPre - Former Forensic Pathologist, Medical Examiner and Detective: Lexington County Sheriff's Department, Author: \"Homicide Investigation Field Guide\" & \"Investigating Child Abuse Field Guide\", Forensic Consultant DMichelleDupreMD.com</li>\n<li>Alexis Tereszcuk - CrimeOnline.com Investigative Reporter, Writer/Fact Checker, Lead Stories dot Com, Twitter: @swimmie2009 </li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
