None of the events depicted in this video actually happened, and are merely for entertainment purposes.\n\n[SGI Mario model by the Render96 team]\nhttps://linktr.ee/Render96\n[Original floor 2B idea by Blackjoystick and Razer Bloxy]\n\nCancelled pilot for a gaming news show titled \"Nintendo Mania\" (possibly linked to the Mexican-produced show of the same name). The show is comprised of animated segments where a 3D model of Mario announces the latest gaming news, before transitioning into long stretches of gameplay.\n\nThis first episode features a pre-E3 1996 build of Super Mario 64, offering footage of cut areas in Peach's castle, as well as a playable Luigi.\n\nThe pilot was cancelled after test audiences reacted negatively to the crude humor and bad animation. 2 other episodes were reportedly written.\n\nVery little is known of its production, apart from a writing credit attributed to a \"Jim\". Mario's voice actor remains unknown, though it is likely that these were simply placeholder recordings.\n\nNintendo's fun is eternal.\n\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/greenio64\nDeviantArt | https://www.deviantart.com/greenhat64",
