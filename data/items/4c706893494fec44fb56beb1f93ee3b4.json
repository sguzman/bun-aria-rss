  "description": "It's another day of the 2018 Winter Olympics and what better way to kick off our coverage than with some epic commentary of the Women's Moguls final to go alongside with all the news of the day?! With Mallory returning, you know we're in for a fun (and long) episode, featuring some (sort of) golden moments for New Zealand, a day of medals for Canada, more bloody medals for Norway and a first ever medal for a 12 year old kid. There is also some exciting Canadian profiles to be heard, more Aussie athlete fan messages (featuring extra schnitzel) and more laughter than you can poke a before and after picture at! It has it all, so make sure you get into it and mogul mogul mogul it all the way down!",
