  "description": "Hi Amicus listeners. Some of you might be familiar with The Waves, Slate’s podcast about feminism and gender, which has been around for years in various forms. The Waves went on hiatus at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, but I’m glad to say that it is back. Every Thursday, you’ll find a new episode in your feed, looking at the news and culture through the lens of gender. We thought Amicus listeners would enjoy this week’s episode, featuring a conversation between Slate's Christina Cauterucci and Robin Marty, author of The New Handbook for a Post-Roe America, gaming out the potential post-Roe future. If you like it, please subscribe to The Waves wherever you get your podcasts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
