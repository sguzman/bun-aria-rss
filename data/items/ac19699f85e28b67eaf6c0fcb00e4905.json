  "description": "Cindy Couyoumjian--founder of Cinergy Financial, with over thirty-six years of experience--is on a mission to empower women to stop being spectators and enter the financial arena; to stand up and assert their inalienable right to financial self-determination. Although today in the US, women are making gains in higher education, hold corporate positions, and are successful leaders, men still control most of the household wealth.\nYet women are powerful agents of change with boundless potential in the financial realm. In The Rise of Women and Wealth: Our Fight for Freedom, Equality, and Control of Our Financial Future (Greenleaf, 2022), Cindy shows that by confronting America's patriarchal past, women can become financially literate; reclaim the power and liberty that have been taken away; embrace a financial future filled with endless possibilities; strongly affirm, \"Yes, I can.\"\nWomen everywhere must find the courage, strength, and inspiration to move forward by understanding the past. Cindy's message is a hopeful one, filled with intuitive truths about a brighter tomorrow for women and their financial power and freedom.\nCindy Couyoumjian is a Registered Representative offering securities and advisory services through Independent Financial Group LLC (IFG), a Registered Investment Adviser. Member FINRA/SIPC. Cinergy Financial and IFG are unaffiliated.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
