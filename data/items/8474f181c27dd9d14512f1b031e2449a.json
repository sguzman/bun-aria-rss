I thought I knew the whole shebang but turns out I sure did not! Such awful, terrible people, and I believe Karla got off way too easy! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day ahead and I hope to be seeing you very soon. Love and appreciate you so much!! <br>\nx o<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nCheck out the original video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cMBrvHsFD_8\">here</a><br>\n<br>\nMake sure you subscribe to my YouTube @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BaileySarian\">BaileySarian</a>!</div>\n",
