  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Washington Post and has done its best to downplay the Holocaust yet they were quick to attack Glenn Youngkin as an anti-Semite for criticizing George Soros' political influence on public education. Soros has promoted radical left-wing policies for decades. Then, the border is in the worst condition it's ever been in! Despite being the most tolerant and beneficent nation, the left insists on expanding immigration with an open border. Despite welcoming the downtrodden, Democrat policies like these welcome drug traffickers, human smugglers, and murderers - a policy like this is not safe or sustainable. Later, blue-collar, first responders, truckers, and grocery store staff deserve our thanks. As do the men and women of the border patrol who protect us from MS-13 gangs yet President Biden is willing to fire them all over a vaccine mandate. What happens when a citizen has an emergency and calls 911 but the first responders have been laid off because of Biden's mandate? Afterward, Biden's not a union man. Driving up the cost of food and gas while mismanaging the supply chain isn't a union issue. Allowing hundreds of thousands of people to illegally cross the border into the United States is not a union issue. This is a Democrat issue that Joe Biden and Terry McAuliffe support, as is the push for transgenderism and racism in the classroom.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
