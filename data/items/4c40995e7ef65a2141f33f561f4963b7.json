  "description": "<p>The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that\nincludes a range of important problems in computer science. We point out that\nfundamental concepts of the CSP, such as the solution set of an instance and\npolymorphisms, can be formulated abstractly inside the 2-category PFinSet of\nfinite sets and sets of functions between them. The 2-category PFinSet is a\nquantaloid, and the formulation relies mainly on structure available in any\nquantaloid. This observation suggests a formal development of generalisations\nof the CSP and concomitant notions of polymorphism in a large class of\nquantaloids. We extract a class of optimisation problems as a special case, and\nshow that their computational complexity can be classified by the associated\nnotion of polymorphism.\n</p>",
