I talk a lot about how the food we eat, and our current food system as a whole, promotes inflammation and leads to chronic disease. But it’s not just our bodies that are inflamed, it’s also our societies and our planet. Covid has only made racial disparities even more apparent, while the disasters that result from climate change continue to climb in frequency and severity as well. It’s all connected. I can’t tell you how excited I was to host Dr. Rupa Marya and Raj Patel on this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, to dig into decolonizing the food system to address the inflammatory state of our world and our bodies.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Rupa Marya is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco where she practices and teaches Internal Medicine. Her research examines the health impacts of social systems, from agriculture to policing. She is a co-founder of the Do No Harm Coalition, a collective of health workers committed to addressing disease through structural change. Raj Patel is a Research Professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs, a professor in the University’s department of nutrition, and a Research Associate at Rhodes University, South Africa. He is the author of <em>Stuffed and Starved</em>, the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling <em>The Value of Nothing</em>, co-author of <em>A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things</em>. A James Beard Leadership Award winner, he is the co-director of the award-winning documentary about climate change and the food system, <em>The Ants & The Grasshopper.</em> He serves on the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, and has advised governments on causes and solutions to crises of sustainability worldwide.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market, Athletic Greens, and Pique Tea.</p><br><p>Thrive Market is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an extra 25% off your first purchase and a free gift when you sign up for Thrive Market.
