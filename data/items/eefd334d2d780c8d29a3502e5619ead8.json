  "description": "<p>Jenny Mollen is the author of <em>City of Likes</em>, a fictional comedy about mommy influencer culture and the intensity of female friendships – especially when one of them is a narcissist. Are they obsessed with each other? Do they want to have sex with each other? And what do you do when someone’s perfectly-curated facade finally cracks?&nbsp;</p><br><p>Jenny and I met years ago, and I know you’ll love her just as much as I do. Besides being a bestselling author, she’s also an actor, host of the hilarious “Third Wheel with Jenny Mollen” podcast, a mom, and wife to actor Jason Biggs. On this episode, she talks about the personal experiences with social media that inspired her book, why she wants to see a sex therapist, and helps me answer your sex and relationship questions. For example, if you’re in a relationship, is it ok to comment on someone else’s Instagram telling them how attractive they are? Jenny and I give it to you straight.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>For More Jenny Mollen: <a href=\"https://jennymollen.com/third-wheel-podcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jennymollen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennyandteets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mollenjenny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://jennymollen.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li><li>Her New Book: <a href=\"https://jennymollen.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>City of Likes</em></a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/overcoming-4-common-sex-fears/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Overcoming 4 Common Sex Fears</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/am-i-dating-a-narcissist-w-dr-ramani/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Am I Dating a Narcissist?
