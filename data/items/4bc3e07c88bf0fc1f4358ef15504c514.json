  "description": "A story about a king and his garden...that somehow turns into a story with genies, witches, boats full of male models, guys getting boiled alive, angry kitties, and secret agent mice. It's the story of the bronze ring, as collected by Scottish writer Andrew Lang. The creature this time just wants to pop on by your hut for a beer and maybe turn you into an undying goblin.
