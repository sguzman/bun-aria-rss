  "description": "<p>We consider the problem of finding decentralized strategies for multi-agent\nperimeter defense games. In this work, we design a graph neural network-based\nlearning framework to learn a mapping from defenders' local perceptions and the\ncommunication graph to defenders' actions such that the learned actions are\nclose to that generated by a centralized expert algorithm. We demonstrate that\nour proposed networks stay closer to the expert policy and are superior to\nother baseline algorithms by capturing more intruders. Our GNN-based networks\nare trained at a small scale and can generalize to large scales. To validate\nour results, we run perimeter defense games in scenarios with different team\nsizes and initial configurations to evaluate the performance of the learned\nnetworks.\n</p>",
