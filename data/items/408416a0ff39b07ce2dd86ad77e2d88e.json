  "description": "Today's NEWZ of the World comes to you on the first morning of a new government in Egypt as Morsi is removed by the military. While in Europe the big news has been Snowden's flight plans and the NSA's EU spying practices. In Turkey a court has ruled to stop the development plans for Gezi park. Over in Iraq there has been a wave of violent attacks this week, some of the worst in recent history. And finally, in space news, the Russian Proton-M rocket crashed during takeoff calling into question the future of the Russian space program.  This week's NEWZ Source is the Columbia Journalism Review.",
