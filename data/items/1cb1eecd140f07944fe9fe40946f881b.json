  "description": "Phil is joined in the studio by three of his sons to discuss their ministries, and Willie tells a hilarious story of when he cast a large shadow on a stage where a man was attempting to speak to an audience ... and what he did next. Al explains that Phil never would have walked into a church building had a Christian not ventured outside the church walls to find him. Willie asks what God's ambassadors are doing if we cannot interact with the world and instead hide behind the structures we confuse for the church. Phil encourages those who speak about Jesus to the world to be patient and reminds them that the power is in the message they speak and not in their own strength. And Willie tells about a girl he encouraged to speak on Jesus and share the fruit that came from her desire to know God.\n\nWatch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed\n\nVisit https://ScoreMaster.com/PHIL and see how many points you can add today\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
