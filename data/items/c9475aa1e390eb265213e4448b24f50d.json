  "description": "<p>“<em>Adventure and awe are key to the perpetuation of vibrant, evolving lives, and in combination with technological advances may bring marvels to our emerging repertoires.</em>” — Kirk Schneider</p>\n<p>Kirk Schneider is a psychotherapist who has taken a leading role in the advancement of existential-humanistic therapy and existential-integrative therapy. He has authored or coauthored ten books, including <em>The Paradoxical Self</em>, <em>Humanity’s Dark Side</em>, <em>Existential-Integrative Psychotherapy</em>, <em>The Psychology of Existence</em> (with Rollo May), <em>The Polarized Mind</em>, <em>The Handbook of Humanistic Psychology</em>, and <em>Awakening to Awe</em>. Dr. Schneider is the 2004 recipient of the Rollo May award for “outstanding and independent pursuit of new frontiers in humanistic psychology” from the Humanistic Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Kirk teaches us how we can connect with the mystery and discovery in our daily lives in a way that allows us to feel, sense, imagine, create, wonder, and to feel the dysphoric feelings as well, the poignancy of sadness of hurt or anger, and in essence, experience a larger sense of life and of creative work. Kirk's seminal work in existential-humanistic therapy has helped many people be more open to new possibilities and sensitivities to oneself as well as other people, other species, and have a more profound appreciation of our fleeting time in space.
