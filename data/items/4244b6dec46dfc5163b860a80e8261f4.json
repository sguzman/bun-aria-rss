  "description": "<p>Choices! Trade-offs! Money! How much should you save? And how much should stimulus checks be? Don’t be scared by the term “economics,” especially since it doesn’t end in -ology. This 2-part Economic Sociology bonanza addresses the behavior that motivates the fiscal systems of the world, from avocado toast to retirement funds. Economist, professor and “Freakonomics” co-author Steven Levitt joins to chat about why we learn too much of the wrong math and how everything from marriage to dinner parties involves little choices rooted in economic principles. Rising economics star and Harvard Fellow Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman graces us with her thoughts on macroeconomics, human capital, when to outsource your work and how she realized she loved Econ. Also: how these interviews helped me make one of my life’s biggest decisions. </p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://www.annagifty.com/\">Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsafronomics\">Twitter.com/itsafronomics</a> and <a href=\"Instagram.com/itsafronomics\">Instagram.com/itsafronomics</a></p>\n<p>Follow Steven Levitt at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevendlevitt\">Twitter.com/stevendlevitt</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wmra.org/programs/freakonomics-radio\">Twitter.com/Freakonomics</a></p>\n<p>A donation was made to: <a href=\"https://www.sadiecollective.org/\">https://www.sadiecollective.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Steven’s podcast is People I (Mostly) Admire: <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/pima/\">https://freakonomics.com/pima/</a></p>\n<p>Sponsor links:<a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\"> www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors</a></p>\n<p>More links and info at<a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/economicsociology\"> alieward.com/ologies/economicsociology</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
