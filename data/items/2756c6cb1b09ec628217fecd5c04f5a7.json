  "title": "204 - Walt Disney: How a Media Empire Was Built",
  "description": "<p>Walt Disney! How much do you know about the mind and the man that built one of the ten biggest media empires in the world? How did the production company behind some animated short films in the 1920s morph and evolve into the media behemoth Disney is today? Did Walt come from money? Did he luck into a few amazing opportunities? When did Disneyland open? Was it successful early on? Are a variety of conspiracies about it true? Had a lot of fun working on this Suck - hope it shows when you hear it! Hail Nimrod and Hail Walt Disney. </p>\n<p><strong>Donating $6600 to the YWCA's Idaho County Fund!</strong> <br /><br />My childhood friend and former classmate Kristy Dewitt-Beckstead has been a YWCA advocate for the past nine years. She helps victims of domestic violence, who are almost always women who have been isolated in the extremely rural area I grew up, where they feel trapped by abusive partners.
