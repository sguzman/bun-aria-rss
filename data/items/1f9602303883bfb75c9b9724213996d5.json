  "description": "<p>Earning his living in a past life as a fashion model, Light Watkins, began yoga and meditation in-between casting calls in New York City during the late nineties. Something he never saw coming happened. It opened him to a different worldview and set of practices that would change not only the trajectory of his career, but also his path in life. Deepening his practice, traveling and spending time in India and then apprenticing with his Vedic Meditation teacher, Light became, well, Light. He actually changed his name to better reflect his emerging identity. He then became a full-time Vedic Meditation teacher in 2007. Light now travels the world, albeit virtually these days, speaking on happiness, mindfulness, inspiration, and meditation. His most recent book,<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2qvpXvj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Bliss More: How to Succeed in Meditation Without Really Trying</em></a> (https://amzn.to/2qvpXvj) invites people into meditation in a very accessible way. In Before Times, he also produced a global pop-up inspirational variety show called The Shine, with a mission to inspire that actually started as a local dinner gathering. We figured, right about now, we all need a little Light, so I’m excited to share this moving Best Of conversation with you this week.</p><p>And, be sure you’re subscribed because part 2 of our special guest-storytelling series, The Hug, about moments that remind you of the goodness in people will be dropping next week.
