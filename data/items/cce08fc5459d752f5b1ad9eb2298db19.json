  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the early testing failures could have been prevented by Dr. Anthony Fauci but he didn't — he and the CDC got it wrong. Yet the media insists that we follow Fauci despite his horrific record. The media ignores other experts with a superior pedigree that have deduced that any recurrence of this virus in the fall is almost certainly the result of Fauci's stay-at-home quarantine approach to mitigation (as opposed to herd immunity). This will kill the economy and the liberty the United States was founded on faster than it kills anything else. Later, the economic divide between those that earn their living in the private sector and those that earn their living from taxpayer-funded government jobs is more evident than ever. The fastest way to open schools and local governments would be to furlough teachers and government employees. Once they feel what the rest of America is feeling things would change very quickly. Then, Judge Emmett Sullivan is conducting his courtroom way outside of normal judicial bounds. Early on, this judge basically accused General Mike Flynn of treason and that was out of line.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
