  "title": "271: The Antidote to Burnout | Leah Weiss",
  "description": "At a time when work has become more challenging than ever, we’re going to explore one myth and one revelation. The myth -- which many of us, myself included, have consciously or subconsciously incorporated into our lives — is that we need to grind ourselves into dust through faux “productivity” in order to achieve professional success. The revelation is that the more effective -- and cleaner burning -- fuel is that potentially sappy notion of finding your purpose. My guest is Leah Weiss, who has impressive bona fides on both the professional and contemplative fronts. She teaches Compassionate Leadership at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and she wrote a book called How We Work. She’s also done four 100-day retreats and one 6-month retreat. This conversion was recorded pre-pandemic, but is deeply relevant nonetheless. And toward the end of the conversation, she drops some words that have been rattling around in my head for months.\nWhere to find Leah Weiss online: \nWebsite: https://leahweissphd.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/leahweissphd\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/leahweissphd/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/leahweissphd/\nYou can always get started with the Ten Percent Happier app with our flagship course, The Basics.
