  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 10/3/22",
  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Americans of all races, creeds, and color united to help save one another during times of natural distance like a hurricane. Still, if you watch the media, they pretend to be for the people, but their actions prove the opposite. VP Kamala Harris suggests that disaster relief should be based on race. Progressivism and racism go hand in hand. Then, Judge Silberman who recently passed away was ahead of his time when he held that the Special Counsel statute was out of step with the Constitution. He maintained that judges should not be activists on the bench. Later, Latino voters told MSNBC that they don't like racism, crime, or rising prices. Hispanics care about the issues that affect their faith, their family, and their communities. If Republicans hold on to their conservative values Hispanics will naturally continue gravitating toward the Republican Party. Afterward, Stephen A Smith joins the show to discuss new non-sports show he's hosting to discuss critical issues facing society. Smith also noted that the government can't just print money with impunity because it will cause inflation and devalue the dollar, reiterating that there is no such thing as a free lunch. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
