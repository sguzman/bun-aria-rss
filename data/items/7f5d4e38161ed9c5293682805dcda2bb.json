  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Ted Kennedy made a major effort to interfere in the election of Ronald Reagan with help from the Soviet Union's Communist Party and KGB. Professor Paul Kengor calls in to discuss documents that prove this foreign interference. These documents have been out since before Kennedy’s death and the media has remained silent. Not a single hearing was ever held by our Congress to expose Kennedy's collusion with the Soviets to defeat Reagan. Then, imagine destroying evidence being asked for by a federal investigation like Hillary Clinton did. The came Hillary that asked China if you're listening, how about getting us Trump's tax returns. Just like Adam Schiff, they sought foreign interference. Later, the whistleblower did not disclose his/her contact with Schiff’s committee to the inspector general, when making complaint. Moreover, the texts and testimony from Kurt Volker directly contradict whistleblower claims. After, the subpoenas served on the White House and on Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo, and White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney are done with the express purpose of crippling this Administration. Finally, Peter Flaherty, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center calls in to discuss legal papers regarding an organization led by Rep Elijah Cummings’ wife and a look at her potential double-dipping.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
