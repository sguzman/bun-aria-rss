  "description": "<p>Our friend and most requested guest to have back on the show, Dan Cummins was our guest for this episode. The greatest thing about Dan is he just loves shooting the shit and letting it rip and that's what this podcast is all about. If you're not familiar with Dan Cummins, he's an incredibly talented standup comedian who's appeared on Comedy Central, Conan, The Tonight Show and The Late Late Show. He's best known for his hit podcast \"Timesuck\" where Dan dives deep into serial killers, cults, conspiracies, history, and the paranormal in a way that's both educational and hysterical. He also just launched a new podcast called \"Scared to Death\" where Dan terrifies his wife with alleged-to-be-true horror stories about Demonic possession, poltergeists, shadow people and more. See why we love him?</p>\n",
