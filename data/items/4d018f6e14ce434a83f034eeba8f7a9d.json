  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the media spreads the propaganda of the left when their news anchors become opinion commentators. They are simply wrong that payments made by someone in connection with a non-disclosure agreement are illegal; this is an everyday practice that is completely legal.  Unless an expense is directly related to the operation of a campaign it’s not a campaign expense, especially if it wasn't paid for by the campaign.  Paying someone to be quiet regarding a personal matter, to avoid distracting negative press, and hardship to your family is completely legal.  The real crime here is the roving all-powerful prosecutor known as the Special Counsel who hasn't laid a finger on the president or his family, despite the unconstitutional power he has, which is more than any Assistant US Attorney as we've been led to believe.  Then, as predicted on this program on 11/9/2016 the Democrats are desperately trying to impeach Trump. Congress makes cash payoffs to settle sexual harassment cases all the time, yet no one ever questions those.  The DOJ memos are clear that prosecuting a sitting president would impede any presidency from succeeding.  As the French Judge and political philosopher Montesquieu said: “There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of the law and in the name of justice.”  Afterwards, we couldn't shut down the federal government if we wanted to, yet you don't hear that from the disingenuous media. It’s a lie, the government never shuts unless there's a financial collapse. If we look back at more than 20 previous federal government shut-downs, that lasted up to 21 days, they're not even a distant memory to us. The real story the media should be reporting is that the Democrats are destroying this country from within;  perverting our colleges, media, government, and our culture overall. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
