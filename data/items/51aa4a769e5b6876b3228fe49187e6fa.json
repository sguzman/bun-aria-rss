    "media:description": "My guest today is Ted Gioia. Ted is a musician and an author. He's written 11 books including his latest, which is called \"Music: A Subversive History\". He's been on the faculty at Stanford, and he's been published in the New York Times, the LA Times, the Wall Street Journal, and many other newspapers.\n\nIn this episode, Ted and I talk about why human beings enjoy music from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss the evolution of recorded music from the analog age to the present. We talk about Ted's unique approach to music history. We talk about the increasing market share of older music compared to newer music. We talk about the current state of music criticism and music writing. We discuss how the streaming model has affected the music industry and the strange phenomenon of fake artists on Spotify. We also talk about Hollywood's shift towards doing remakes and sequels and brand extensions as opposed to new stories, and much more.\n\n#ColemanUnfiltered\nColeman Unfiltered addresses topics that have been on mute through the ages with silent shifts into polarities, by relentless questioning and observations in coordination with some of the brightest intellectuals of our generation.\nThe Unfiltered Community is an ode to the fans; an environment promoting sound tolerance of ideas to solidify the meaning of liberalism in a changing world.\nIt’s a concrete effort to have open, honest conversations on the most difficult social and political issues we’re surrounded with.\nFor in-depth discussions, unaired/unseen episodes, and bonus content on Conversations With Coleman, participate via a membership and gain access to raw, powerful human ideology.\nWelcome to the new age’s most original intellectual revolution; let’s change the world, one conversation at a time.\nSign up Today  - https://bit.ly/3B1GAlS\n\n#QUALIA\nPresenting ‘The Life Of The Mind’, the latest podcast by renowned cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker.\nThis new podcast discusses an array of fascinating topics about the most powerful tool we own, the human mind.\n‘The Life Of The Mind’ takes us on a psychological journey, unearthing truths about our own complex minds while shaping our understanding of how the mind perceives what we see and feel when we try to understand the world around us.\nIt’s now available on YouTube and your favorite podcast platform.\nCheck it out now - https://bit.ly/3TBO6MI\n\n\nFOLLOW COLEMAN \n\nYouTube - http://bit.ly/38kzium \nTwitter - http://bit.ly/2rbAJue \nFacebook - http://bit.ly/2LiAXH3 \nInstagram - http://bit.ly/2SDGo6o \nPodcast -https://bit.ly/3oQvNUL \nWebsite - https://colemanhughes.org/ \nLimited Edition Merch - https://bit.ly/CWCMerch",
