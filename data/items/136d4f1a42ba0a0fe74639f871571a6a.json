  "description": "<p>Paris is the City of Lights, but deep in the darkness, beneath the streets, in the underground, lie hundreds of miles of tunnels that make up a vast ossuary for the dead. These tunnels are dangerous and largely unmapped, with pitfalls and areas filled with water and discarded remnants of the dead. One could easily become lost in the maze of stones and bones. These areas are restricted from public access for good reason. Could there be something down there in the Catacombs that is unseen? Are the spirits of the displaced bones now residing within the stones? Is there something evil down in those tunnels? Join us as we share the history and hauntings of the Catacombs of Paris! The Moment in Oddity features cryotherapy killing someone and This Day in History features the publication of Three Blind Mice. Our location was suggested by Bob Sherfield. We also have the fourth installment of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition!</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-154-catacombs-of-paris.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-154-catacombs-of-paris.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
