That’s the training process.”</p><p>Chris Hauth</p><br><p><br></p><p>Making his latest appearance in our ongoing Coach’s Corner&nbsp;series is none other than&nbsp;Chris Hauth, one of the world’s most respected endurance and ultra-endurance coaches.</p><p>A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AIMPCoach\" target=\"_blank\">@AIMPCoach</a>) is a former professional triathlete, Age Group Ironman World Champion, and 2-time Olympic Swimmer.&nbsp;In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.</p><p>When he’s not training and racing, Chris hosts the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/hauthpod\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Word Podcast</a>&nbsp;and runs <a href=\"http://www.aimpcoaching.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AIMP Coaching,</a>&nbsp;mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.</p><br><p>Whether you are an elite athlete or just starting out, Chris knows how to get the best out of athletes the right way. A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me&nbsp;through three <a href=\"http://ultramanlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a> (’08, ’09 & ’11),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.epic5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EPIC5</a> in 2010 and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://otilloswimrun.com/races/otillo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ötillö Swimrun World Championships</a> in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.</p><p>I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel,&nbsp;so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom&nbsp;with you today.</p><p>As we put the cold winter months behind us, today's conversation focuses on&nbsp;balancing your fitness goals against life's demands as we welcome warmer days. As always,&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;drops knowledge applicable whether you are a professional athlete or a cubicle warrior just looking to improve the quality of your day to day.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific topics discussed include:</p><br><p>* optimizing fitness as we transition from winter to spring;</p><p>* scheduling training in balance with real-life pressures and expectations;</p><p>* when to hold back & how to avoid doing too much;</p><p>* experimenting with race nutrition during training;</p><p>* tips to develop the nuances of swimming technique; and</p><p>* finding joy in the training process</p><br><p>DK Goals!&nbsp;In addition, my man ‘DK' David Kahn joins me for the introduction to talk 2019 goals.

Due to scheduling it got pushed to late April. So please disregard the audible references to March.
