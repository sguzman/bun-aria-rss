  "description": "<p>Benchmark Capital. We tell the tale of the legendary equal partnership that accomplished something no other venture firm can claim: twice it has produced the highest returning fund of its cycle, each time with a 100% different GP lineup. If ever there were a playbook for successful generational transfer of a generational-defining venture firm, this is it. We spend 3.5+ hours digging into how the dotcom “eBay eBoys” transformed into the rockstar Fab Four of the Uber, Instagram and Snap mobile gold rush (spoiler: not by a straight line!), and what the future holds for Benchmark’s next GP generation. If you’re a student of the venture game from any angle — founder, GP, LP, etc — this is a story you need to tune in for!<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href= \"http://pod.link/acquiredlp\">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!).<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thank you to our presenting sponsor for all of Season 11, Fundrise!
