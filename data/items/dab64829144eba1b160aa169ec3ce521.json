  "description": "<p>Sir David Adjaye is the architect behind some of the most interesting buildings of our times, from national museums to social housing. He has described the fraught political process of designing the prize-winning National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington, D.C. in 2016, as eight years of pain. But “these buildings are long overdue,” Adjaye says, “There’s a language they need to bring, which is about the reality rather than the fiction of nation imagery.”</p> <p>In this podcast with Amy Cappellazzo (co-founder of AAP and a chairman of Sotheby's) and host Charlotte Burns (executive editor, <em>In Other Words</em>), Adjaye—who has designed the forthcoming expansion of the Studio Museum as well as the plans for the National Cathedral of Ghana—talks about how space can change the way we think about our own histories. “We’ve all been numbed into never dealing with big questions,” he says, asking: “Then what the hell are we all doing here?”</p> <p>For this and more, tune in today.</p> <p>Transcript: <a href= \"https://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-61-remaking-the-imagination-with-architect-david-adjaye/\"> https://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-61-remaking-the-imagination-with-architect-david-adjaye/</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
