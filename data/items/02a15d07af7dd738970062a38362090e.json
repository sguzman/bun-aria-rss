  "title": "A Higher Loyalty by James Comey",
  "description": "'A Higher Loyalty' describes what it means to be an ethical, truthful and effective leader through the eyes of former FBI director James Comey. Recalling his journey through the ranks of government, Comey gives an honest account of the characteristics of both effective and ineffective leaders. The latter part of the book delves into Comey's decision making during the controversial events before and after the 2016 Presidential Election. Seeing the events that unfolded which led to Comey's firing, I was excited to read this book to understand what indeed happened. The book felt honest. From Comey's honest descriptions of his family tragedies, to how he conducted himself after being fired, the book felt truthful where many books in the current affairs genre are not. The book does not list ways to be a better leader, but instead gives examples of some of the characteristics that make one. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
