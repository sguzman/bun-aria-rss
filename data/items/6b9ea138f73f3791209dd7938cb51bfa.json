  "description": "The desolate Alaskan tundra - a landscape that has literally been frozen solid for thousands of years - is suddenly caving in on itself. Colonizing beavers are engineering new wetlands that thaw the soil, rapidly releasing greenhouse methane into the atmosphere. Beavers can survive in the arctic because - like people - they change the environment to make homes for themselves, and their carbon footprint can be seen from space.

Check out pictures of some drunken forests.\nBen Goldfarb believes that beavers aren't only not to blame for climate change, they're actually helping fight against it.\n\nAlso explore:\nNot only is methane a greenhouse gas, it's also flammable. Watch Katey Walter Anthony set frozen lakes on fire.\nEver wonder why beavers make such great hats?
