  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Radio Host Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. The Left’s shaming of Kanye West, including claiming that he is mentally unwell because he supports the president, is real racism. If you are African American and praise President Trump the Democrats will attack you, shame you, say you’re not black enough or not sane enough. This is the same Democratic Party that says we shouldn’t shame people, and we need to let people be open about mental illness, are the same exact people today that are shaming Kanye because he didn’t do what they told him to do. CNN commentator Bakari Sellers even went as far as saying Kanye West is “what happens when Negro's don't read.\" How is that not a racist statement? Is it not racist because it’s supported by all Democrats? Then Valerie Jarrett has phony outrage over Kanye dropping the F-bomb at the White House, yet she must have forgotten when sitting Vice President Biden told President Obama that the signing of Obamacare was a \"big F-ing deal\" while at the White House.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
