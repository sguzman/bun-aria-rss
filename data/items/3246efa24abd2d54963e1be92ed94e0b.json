  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has bitten off more than he can chew. McConnell's political power must be eviscerated because he's clawed his way to the top and has held on by scheming and destroying those that oppose him. In a statement released today, Donald Trump blasted McConnell. If McConnell had his way, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Mike Lee, would not be in the Senate today because McConnell attacked all of these tea party candidates. If McConnell were around in 1860 he would have opposed Abraham Lincoln. If McConnell wants a criminal investigation, perhaps he should be the one facing it. Afterward, Peter Schweizer joins the show to discuss Mitch McConnell's wife's ties to the communist Chinese government through her family's shipping business which has earned them millions of dollars. One particular deal quadrupled their net worth and explains why McConnell has never taken a strong position against Beijing. Then, Anthony Fauci is a liar! He now defends Kamala Harris when she says the Biden team was starting from scratch on the stockpile of vaccines. Should he be fired for failing the Trump administration? After all, the Biden Administration says that there was no plan in place, wasn't it Fauci's job? Later, President Biden wants to be greater than FDR and has become the leader of Marcuse's Critical Race Theory movement. Biden is leading the charge on controlling the economy and natural resources through industrial unions embracing the European Marxist idea of climate change known as the Green New Deal. Biden's also destroyed women's sports for America's daughters by allowing more than biological girls to compete in them.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
