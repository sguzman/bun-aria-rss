  "description": "Amid reports of ill-equipped troops quitting the fight, the Russian military continues to target civilians in Ukraine while the U.S. and other countries move to seize superyachts belonging to Putin’s oligarch cronies. Next, Sara Bareilles & Josh Groban help celebrate a milestone in frozen dairy history, as Stephen Colbert’s signature flavor of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream \"Americone Dream\" celebrates 15 delicious years of fudge-covered waffle cone and caramel swirl goodness. Then, one of Stephen’s favorite actors, Andy Serkis, returns to The Late Show with a preview of his new film, “The Batman,” where he plays Alfred alongside Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne. And Fiona Hill advised three American presidents on Russian policy and has spent time in close proximity to Vladimir Putin, so she is uniquely qualified to talk about the man’s strengths, his weak spots, and the things we misunderstand about him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
