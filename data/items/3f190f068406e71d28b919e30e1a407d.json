  "title": "Patriots-Jets MNF Recap: New England isn't tanking, they're just not very good (Football 11/10)",
  "description": "Somehow, the Patriots won on Monday night. Actually, we shouldn't express too much surprise...the Jets snapping their winless season was too good to be true for that franchise. To break down all the action, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Tyler Sullivan. The guys analyze how New England managed to win this particular game, but also spend a large chunk of time evaluating the state of the organization during this turbulent year. Bill Belichick definitely isn't tanking, he simply just doesn't have enough talent to be truly competitive. Quarterback questions will press into the second straight offseason for the Pats, as we examine potential names that could fare better than Cam Newton. Of course, we have to devote some attention to the losing team too, and we do that by speculating Sam Darnold's trade value, when Adam Gase's impending job termination could come and the odds the Jets go 0-16.
