  "description": "At the dawn of the digital era in the final decades of the twentieth century, film and media studies scholars grappled with the prospective end of what was deemed cinema: analog celluloid production, darkened public movie theaters, festival culture. The notion of the “end of cinema” had already been broached repeatedly over the course of the twentieth century—from the introduction of sound and color to the advent of television and video—and in Ends of Cinema (U Minnesota Press, 2020), contributors reinvigorate this debate to contemplate the ends, as well as directions and new beginnings, of cinema in the twenty-first century.\nIn this volume, scholars at the forefront of film and media studies interrogate multiple potential “ends” of cinema: its goals and spaces, its relationship to postcinema, its racial dynamics and environmental implications, and its theoretical and historical conclusions. Moving beyond the predictable question of digital versus analog, the scholars gathered here rely on critical theory and historical research to consider cinema alongside its media companions: television, the gallery space, digital media, and theatrical environments. Ends of Cinema underscores the shared project of film and media studies to open up what seems closed off, and to continually reinvent approaches that seem unresponsive.\nRichard Grusin is director of the Center for 21st Century Studies and distinguished professor of English at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. He is editor of The Nonhuman Turn, Anthropocene Feminism, and After Extinction, all published by the University of Minnesota Press.\nJocelyn Szczepaniak-Gillece is associate professor of English and film studies at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and author of The Optical Vacuum: Spectatorship and Modernized American Theater Architecture.\nGustavo E. Gutiérrez Suárez is a MSc. in Anthropology, and BA. in Social Communication. His areas of interest include Film theory and aesthetics.
