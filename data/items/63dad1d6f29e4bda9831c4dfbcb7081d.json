  "description": "<p>This week we bring you an onslaught of automotive industry asshattery, with too many damned people in the room.  We're joined by Mike Spinelli, Travis Okulski, Brendan McAleer and Austin Cabot. Mike gives us his take on on the Porsche GT3 RS as well as an overview of the soundtrack to Dante's Peak, Stevee Nicks encounters and a young boy's take on Burt Monroe.  Travis gives us some insight into the Ferrari F12 TDF as well as his take on unnecessarily ostentatious german press tours. Whilst Brendan and Austin take a far more measured approach jabbing with the occassional one-liner or groan inducing pun as we power our way through two power outages mid show.</p>\n",
