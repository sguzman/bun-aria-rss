  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin, as fuel prices have doubled, they will continue to go even higher because that’s what Barack Obama and President Biden have told us. Their plan has always been to drive up fuel and electricity costs. Barack Obama admitted that costs would skyrocket, and President Biden has admitted to ending fossil fuels. Biden's first week in office he issued an executive order to stop any new leases for domestic energy production inside of the United States. Now he wants to use the Defense Production Act to mass-produce solar panels, where most of the materials made are in China. The high cost of fuel cannot be blamed on Vladimir Putin, loathsome as he is. Then, news reports indicate that a former employee of Media Matters for America, Timothy Johnson, tweeted that higher-ups knew that their colleague Ben Dimiero was a sexual predator who went after other employees. This program has invited Media Matters to respond to these allegations on the air. Later, former White House Trade Advisor, Peter Navarro, joins the show to discuss his aggressive arrest for being held in contempt of Congress and was punitively held by the FBI for three hours with no food. Navarro opted to respect President Trump's presidential privilege. Navarro has filed a civil suit against the January 6th Committee for violating his Constitutional rights. Such a show trial with committee members hand-picked by Speaker Pelosi should never happen again. If and when Republicans gain control, they must investigate this committee and determine who can be legally held accountable. Afterward, Sen. Mike Lee calls in to discuss his reelection campaign potentially against a flip-flopping Republican-turned-Democrat and his new book \"Saving Nine: The Fight Against the Left’s Audacious Plan to Pack the Supreme Court and Destroy American Liberty.\"  https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Nine-Against-Audacious-American/dp/1546002200\nLearn more about your ad choices.
