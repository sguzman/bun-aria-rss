    "media:description": "What would the world look like if I could redraw the countries? Ever since I was a young boy, I dreamed of reshaping the nations of the Earth for my own amusement. What if this country existed? What about that? Little did I know that the alternate history genre was already well under way.\n\nIn today's video, I will be discussing some potential countries that I would create if I had the power to redraw the world's borders (without cutting through existing nations). I will be going over the reasons why I think a union or unification would be beneficial to the various territories and the demographic ramifications of such countries existing. This is 100% for fun and some minor education as well, so please don't take anything here personally. Happy New Year and thanks for watching!",
