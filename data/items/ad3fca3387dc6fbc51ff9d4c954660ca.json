  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys react to Motor City Dan Campbell's introductory press conference in Detroit, look at Tom Brady's success from age 37 on and compare it to other elite Quarterback's entire careers, and look ahead to the Conference Championships. Joining the program is NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero to catch us up on everything going on in the NFL including Dan Campbell, Antonio Brown's health status, coaching openings, the DeShaun Watson situation, and much more (19:07-41:06). Next 2x All-Pro, Walter Payton Man of the Year Award Nominee, and current LB for the New Orleans Saints, Demario Davis joins the program to recap the Saints season, chat about the team and how close they were, if they could sense it was Drew Brees' last year, CJGJ being an elite trash talker, and playing against Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers (42:38-1:04:09). Later, 9 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of the Man-To-Man pod, Everything DB, friend of the program, Darius Butler joins the show to chat about the Dan Campbell press conference and who he likes this weekend in the Conference Championship games (1:04:11-1:23:53). To close out the show, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about the beginning of the Motor City Dan Campbell era, and wonder who would win in a fight, him or Mike Vrabel (1:26:41-1:41:59).
