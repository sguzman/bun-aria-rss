  "description": "<p>Friday 12/29 - Today on the show we flashed back to when Gary Owen stopped by to speak on new projects and he made one thing clear, which was that Kevin Hart owed him some money, despite the cheating scandal Kevin was going through at the time. Speaking of Kevin Hart, we also flashed back to when he stopped by and opened up about the cheating scandal, new stand up material, and even threw some shade towards Michael Blackson. Moreover, we flashed back to when Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Quantasia Sharpton for holding a press conference just to say she did not get herpes from Usher. Also, it is still Freaky Freaky Friday, so we flashed back to when listeners called up to have phone sex with \"The Breakfast Club\". </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
