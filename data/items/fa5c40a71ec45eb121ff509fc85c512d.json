  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.bunniestudios.com/\">Andrew Huang</a>, known as \"bunnie\" (lowercase) to his friends, first came to the public eye when, while a graduate computer-science student at MIT, he cracked the proprietary wrapper around Microsoft's Xbox operating system in 2002, which allowed it then to run any software of his choosing. Microsoft didn't like this and MIT told him it wouldn't provide any support if a legal defense were needed. Fortunately, Microsoft quickly realized how embarrassing the situation could be, never pursued legal action, and bunnie published a book on the topic. He went on to design the Chumby, a squeezable interactive personal app device, and now works on a variety of projects for the public good, including an <a href=\"http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3265\">open laptop design</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2218\">an open design for a radiation detector</a> in the wake of the nuclear plant disasters in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://aneventapart.com/newdisruptors\">An Event Apart</a>, the design conference for people who make websites.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://onepagerapp.com/disruptors\">Onepager</a> helps you build a beautiful, single-page website for your small business.</p>\n\n\n",
