  "description": "I’ve love Janet Wecker Frisch of Joy Studio’s work. She creates with an underlying theme of sewing in many of her pieces. I also adore her Halloween things! She shares lots of inspiring photos taken in her amazing studio. And she is now learning to quilt.\n-----\nI have been following Nicole Volgelsinger of Wild Boho for awhile. Her newest book is Boho embroidery, full amazing ideas for new motifs and how to use them with applique. I love the whole concept!\n------\nI recently heard about a wonderful organization called Help Heal Veterans. They help our Veterans by using craft therapy. For 45 year their mission has been to provide therapeutic craft kits to every veteran who wants them. I asked the current CEO Joe McClain to join me for the 2nd half of my show to tell us about this organization how how we can help. Joe is retired USN and has held many leadership positions. Including currently on the board of the Association of Creative Industries.\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
