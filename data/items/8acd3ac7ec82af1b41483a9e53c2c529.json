  "title": "Jon Lindsay, \"Information Technology and Military Power\" (Cornell UP, 2020)",
  "description": "Many assume that information technology will one day clear away the “fog of war.” But as Jon Lindsay shows in Information Technology and Military Power (Cornell UP, 2020), the digitization of warfare can also increase confusion and misunderstanding. To understand why, it is important to understand the micro-foundations of military power in the information age, where computers mediate almost every effort to gather, store, display, analyze, and communicate information.\nOn this episode, I talked with Dr. Lindsay about why he wrote the book, what the digital revolution means for modern warfare, and what we can learn from history about good and bad information practice.\nJohn Sakellariadis is a 2020-2021 Fulbright US Student Research Grantee. He holds a Master’s degree in public policy from the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia and a Bachelor’s degree in History & Literature from Harvard University.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
