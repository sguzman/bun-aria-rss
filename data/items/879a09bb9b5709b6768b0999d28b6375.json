I think this has really hurt us in multiple ways, some of which we are still figuring out, but especially in the way it’s allowed people to desecrate the land, air, and water we rely on for life. Yet people are so resistant to acknowledging climate change and what needs to be done. This could be because of the doom-and-gloom approach many folks take that can be outright depressing or the overwhelming amount of inputs that cause people to simply shut down. It might also just be hard to wrap our heads around how it’s possible to destroy something as vast as the ocean and sky.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m hoping to provide you with a different perspective on climate change revolving around hope and positivity. Yes, we still have a long way to go, but we’re seeing some great initiatives and outcomes in places like California where the climate and environment are deemed worthy investments. My guest today is the perfect person to share about those projects, challenges, and victories. Jared Blumenfeld is California’s Secretary for Environmental Protection. Appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom in January, he is one of America’s most innovative environmental leaders, with more than 25 years of environmental policy and management experience at the local, national and international levels.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by BiOptimizers, Thrive Market, and Beekeepers Naturals.</p><br><p>Right now, BiOptimizers is offering my community 10% off their CogniBiotics, a brain and mood-enhancing probiotic that contains specifically chosen strains with a high level of research supporting mental health and performance.
