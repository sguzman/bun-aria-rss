  "description": "What a story this is, guys. Lori Vallow's saga is still going on and we seem to be no closer to answers than where it all started. In Part 2 of this crazy tale, we meet her husband Chad, we hear about his shady past and we wonder where the hell her children Tylee and JJ could be. Why is it that people around this couple tend to die or disappear? Is it bad luck or is a death cult? The questions keep piling up while the answer pile stays thin. Hopefully we will be able to update this episode soon with some good news or at least some closure. Step into Lori Vallow's world on mayhem, but don't say we didn't warn you. <br>\n<br>\nThanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Best Fiends<br>\n</strong>Best Fiends has thousands of levels already, with new levels, events, and characters added every month.
