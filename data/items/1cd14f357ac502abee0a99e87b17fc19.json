As technology advances, biologists such as the Chief Science Officer of the SENS Research Foundation, Aubrey de Grey, is leading the way to pioneering tech that will allow you to choose how long you want to live. For years scientists have been trying to find a way to slow down the aging process, but Aubrey introduces the idea of repairing the damage that aging does on the body to theoretically restore the body’s biological age to maybe 30 years younger. If you are familiar with the obsession I’ve had with living forever, you already know how much this excites me.   SHOW NOTES: Quality of Life | Aubrey on why a long life depends on the quality and being invested in choice [0:58] Reverse Aging | Why damage repair could be easier than slowing aging & the push back met [4:40] Indefinite Life | Aubrey on why the result of expected life for reversed aging could be indefinite [8:08] Structure Repair | Landing on the idea of repairing structure to restore cellular level function [9:32] Pushback | Aubrey on pushback among scientists about reverse aging in biology [11:17] Body Damage | Aubrey on self-inflicted damage being reversed to same level 30 years prior [14:13] Longevity Escape Velocity | Aubrey on his theory how to reverse biological age 30 years [16:26] Types of Damage | 7 categories of damage that correspond to therapeutic methods of repair [21:18] Stem Cell Therapy | Aubrey explains how stem cells could treat loss of cell problems [22:17] Cancer Treatments | Aubrey gives category of damage due to too many cells [23:26] Senescent Cells | Aubrey explains how these cells can promote cancer [26:53] Mitochondrial Mutations | Aubrey explains problems at the molecular level inside cells [28:53] Cellular Waste | Aubrey breaks down how cellular waste over years impacts old age [33:35] Macular Degeneration | Aubrey explains specific enzymes that could prevent blindness  [35:24] Excretion | Aubrey explains diseases that could be resolved by breaking down waste [37:50] Alzheimer’s | Breaking down amyloid as extracellular waste and modest benefit [39:22] Advancing Therapies | Aubrey gives sobering guess how close effective therapies are [44:07]     QUOTES: “I want to make sure that my choice about how long to live, and, of course, how high quality that life will be, is not progressively taken away from me by aging.” [2:24]   “Old age is something that evolution doesn't care about at all. Evolution only cares about the propagation of genetic information.” [34:41]   “you've got to fix them all. You haven't got to fix any of them perfectly. But you've got to fix them all pretty well.” [43:28]   “what excites me is typically the breakthroughs that would take me half an hour background to describe why it's even important.” [46:16]   Guest Bio: Dr. de Grey is the biomedical gerontologist who devised the SENS platform and established SENS Research Foundation to implement it. He received his BA in Computer Science and Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Cambridge in 1985 and 2000, respectively.
