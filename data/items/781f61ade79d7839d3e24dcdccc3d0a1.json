  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Freedom of the Press is an extension of free speech which was revolutionized by the printing press. Printers were suppressed by the colonial governments through restrictive regulation on critical speech and matters of religion. As James Madison contemplated the revolution and America's founding and came up with 12 Amendments to the new Constitution, of which 10 were ratified—becoming the Bill of Rights. These amendments only applied to the new centralized federal government, not the states. Jefferson disagreed with how libel laws would be upheld and prosecuted at the state level. The Supreme Court eventually ruled on this creating a test for libel laws that opened Pandora’s box. The Supreme Court's test has limited public officials from virtually any protection or relief from a dishonest media with no checks and balances. In effect, this creates a monopoly on truth in the media because they cannot be held accountable for lying. Quite simply this rejects the notion of liberty found in the other amendments of our Constitution. Then, why should America strive to be more like Scandinavia? Leftists like Sen Bernie Sanders point to European socialism as an example of success because they have no success to point to here in the U.S. America is the most successful country on the face of the earth in spite of the left. Sanders said that breadlines are a good thing because it means that there's actually food for poor people. Afterwards, President Trump calls the New York Times the real enemy of the people and their publisher denies it. Meanwhile, the media continues to focus on the Robert Mueller report despite no charges being filed against the president despite FBI agents like Andrew McCabe are jobless because of the mere existence of this report—which in and of itself is the problem.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
