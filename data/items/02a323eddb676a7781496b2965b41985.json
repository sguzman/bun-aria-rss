  "description": "<p>In this episode we have the honor of speaking with Richard Cordray, who served for six years as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. Since his time at the CFPB, he has written a book, WATCHDOG: How Protecting Consumers Can Save Our Families, Our Economy, and Our Democracy. In his book, Richard shares stories of individual consumers in order to show how the Bureau quickly became a powerful force for good. WATCHDOG tells a hopeful story of how our system can be reformed by putting government back on the side of the people. And we don’t just stop at government help, we also dive into how we as individual consumers can take steps to remain vigilant, especially during this modern pandemic.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Von Pilsner by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the show!
