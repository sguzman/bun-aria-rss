  "description": "<p>In this study, we use archival data from HST, Chandra, XMM-Newton, and\nSwift-XRT, to probe the nature of 9 (X1-X9) candidate ULXs in NGC 1672. Our\nstudy focuses on using the precise source positions obtained via improved\nastrometry based on {\\it Chandra} and HST observations to search for and\nidentify optical counterparts for these ULXs.Unique optical counterparts are\nidentified for X2 an{d X6; two potential counterparts were determined for X1,\nX5 and X7 within the respective error radii while no optical counterparts were\nfound for the remaining four sources. Based on spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs), X-ray and optical temporal analyses, some evidences about the nature of\nX1 and X2 were obtained.\n</p>",
