  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, democrats do have a plan to get President Trump out of office, and this is why they support the Robert Mueller probe. But it takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove a president, which won’t happen. The objective of Mueller’s investigation is to indict the president, humiliate him by dragging him to court and then get him to resign. The framers wanted a mechanism to remove a president if necessary, but not to have a president threatened day in and day out with impeachment, which is what’s happening today. Also, the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly Strassel calls in to discuss her reporting that there may have been an FBI spy interacting with the Trump campaign in 2016. The DOJ and FBI outright hid this critical information from a congressional investigation last year. Are we living in Venezuela or Cuba now? Finally, Matt McCall calls in to discuss his run for the 21st Congressional District of Texas against Chip Roy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
