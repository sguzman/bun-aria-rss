  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecommerce, production design, marketing–there’s a lot that goes into a successful apparel brand. The question Ryan wants you to consider is, what is your target audience actually wearing, and how can you create a brand that they’ll want to wear? </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryan Williams is an entrepreneur and a former Navy SEAL. He  founded Industry Threadworks as a response to the poor communication and unfulfilled promises he found from other apparel sourcing companies. Now, he prioritizes accuracy and reliability in his quickly growing Private Label service.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, follow along with Ryan’s journey, from his work as a SEAL to the foundation of his entrepreneurial career. He knows what it means to understand, visualize, and produce high-quality apparel for businesses. He loves his job, not just because he’s making tons of money and helping others do the same, but because he gets to bring his passion and energy to every project he works on. Every day, he solves problems, seeks alternative perspectives, and works to help businesses evolve.</span></p> <div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Show Notes:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" title= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/ryan-williams\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/ryan-williams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-target-href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison\">https://underdogempowerment.com/ryan-williams</a></span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <ol class=\"listtype-number listindent1 list-number1\" start=\"1\"> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" data-target-href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol> <p> </p>",
