  "description": "Phil and Jase talk about creative (and delicious!) ways to cook deer, why eating game is biblical, and why young deer are way better than big bucks. Phil likes to eat wild game, but mounting it on the wall isn't really his thing. Jase explains the concept of email to Phil. The guys respond to a question that comes up when we go public about the Gospel: \"Who do you think you are?\" And Phil laments that in today's culture, the \"truth\" doesn't include Jesus.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
