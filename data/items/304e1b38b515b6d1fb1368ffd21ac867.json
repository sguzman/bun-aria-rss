  "description": "Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm \n\nToday on the Matt Walsh Show, one \"all ages\" drag show was shut down in Tennessee over the weekend, but another one was still held and it's the worst we've seen yet. Also, Italy elects its first female prime minister but the media sadly cannot celebrate because she has the wrong opinions. Plus, the FBI sends 30 agents to raid a pro-life activist's home, despite the fact that he broke no laws at all. The former mayor of Atlanta who let BLM burn her city to the ground has now repositioned herself as an advocate of law and order. And in our Daily Cancellation, a TikTok feminist laughs at 1950s dating advice. But the advice is way better than anything you'll hear from a TikTok feminist.\n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nJoin the Jeremy’s Razors Contest For The Car at https://www.jeremysrazors.com/play.
