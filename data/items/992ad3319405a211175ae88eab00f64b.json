  "description": "<p>This week, in Stanford, Montana, a family falls apart around the treatment of an elderly stepfather, until murder seems like the only solution. The crime was just plain vicious, and the perpetrators were some of the last people you'd expect to do such a thing... until you find out a little more about them. Not to mention the criminal justice system failing so completely, in this case, that you sort of root for a murderer. It's a wild ride!! Along the way, we find out that people used to throw valuable gems in the garbage, how someone can explain being awoken by a smoke alarm with no battery, and just how bad a lawyer has to be before you prefer the murderer!! </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Small Town Murder!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Crime in Sports</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/smalltownpod\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/smalltownpod</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/MurderSmall\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p><br></p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
