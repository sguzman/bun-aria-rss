  "title": "How to begin unwiring racism from our brains and society: a conversation with my two African American sons-in-law",
  "description": "<p>Racial prejudice doesn't just hurt the person who is victimized by it, it also impacts the person who inflicts the pain, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Toxic, biased mindsets are real things: they are built into the structures of brain, affecting how we see and interact with the world, which can affect our mental and physical health. Thankfully, we can rewire these mindsets and start changing the way we live, and the way we participate in society. But that's only if we are willing to put in the work to do so.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Unwiring prejudice and racial bias from our brains and societies begins with deep, honest conversations, and I hope that this discussion with my two wonderful sons-in-law will impact you as much as it did me. &nbsp;In this episode we discuss what it is like to be a black man in America, why we are talking about black lives matter and what does it really mean, police brutality and what we can do to change the system, how racism affects our mental health, dealing with trauma, what is going on with the current protests, what is privilege, racism in the church, how to empathize with people whose experiences are different to ours, and some things we can start doing now to end systematic racial bias and its effects. &nbsp;I hope you will watch or listen with an open mind and an open heart. We are not trying to deny anyone's experiences, judge anyone or silence anyone. We are just trying to focus on what we can do to change something that has gone on way too long, at too great a cost. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read Jay's blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/can-i-switch-off-my-brain-being-black-in-america-is-tiring-even-during-a-pandemic?_ke= &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read Eli's blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-money-fuels-police-brutality-against-people-of-color-and-how-we-can-fight-back?_ke= &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read a personal letter from me here: &nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/a-personal-letter-from-me?_ke= &nbsp;Additional stories and blogs worth reading: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Where you can donate today: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Equal Justice Initiative: https://eji.org/?_ke&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Minnesota Freedom Fund: https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/?_ke=&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-George Floyd Memorial Fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd?_ke=&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Campaign Zero: https://www.joincampaignzero.org/?_ke=&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Reclaim the Block: https://www.reclaimtheblock.org/home?_ke=&nbsp;</p>\n<p>--NAACP: https://www.naacp.org&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additional mental health resources and counseling options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Free therapy for communities of color Text NOSTIGMA to 707070&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-BetterHelp online therapy: https://trybetterhelp.com/drleaf -Inclusive Therapists: https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/?_ke=</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Alyssa Marie Wellness: https://www.alyssamariewellness.com/?_ke=&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Full Circle Therapy Services: https://www.fullcircletherapyservices.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Crisis text hotline: Text SHARE to 741741 for free, fast, and confidential crisis counseling</p>\n<p>-Melanin And Mental Health: -https://www.melaninandmentalhealth.com/?_ke</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additional reading materials: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/books/review/antiracist-reading-list-ibram-x-kendi.html&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jun/03/do-the-work-an-anti-racist-reading-list-layla-f-saad</p>\n<p>Helpful podcasts to listen to: https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/g32732684/anti-racism-podcasts/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode was made possible by our sponsor Feals CBD&nbsp;(the best CBD out there!):&nbsp;To get 50% off your&nbsp;Feals CBD&nbsp;order and free shipping see&nbsp;https://feals.com/drleaf. &nbsp;Have questions about CBD?
