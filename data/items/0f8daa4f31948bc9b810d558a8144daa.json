Al's wife, Lisa, is back for more tales of family antics and high jinks, including how Phil dealt with a rodent infestation in the walls. (Hint: Fire was involved.) Missy finally tells her side of some of Jase's stories, and they get into her dad's feelings about Jase, her bug phobia, why she spent their Hawaiian honeymoon crying, how they brought hundreds of people to Jesus early in their marriage, and how Al and Lisa were there for her when she faced marital challenges.
