  "description": "Today’s show is a fun one – we’re sharing how to commit a random act of quiltiness during these times. Now only will it bring joy to those around you, but it’ll also bring immense happiness to yourself, too. We’re giving a few ideas for how to get some basics organized and clean in your sewing space – especially if you’re spending more time quilting these days. We share a few stories of quilters making a difference in their communities, as well as how you can get involved in our own One Million Pillowcase Challenge. We end the episode with our staff and some readers sharing how quilting is helping them through this time. \nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
