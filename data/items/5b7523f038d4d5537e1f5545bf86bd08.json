  "description": "Yes, we are in the midst of a global crisis. For many people, life is incredibly challenging right now. It is easy to lose hope, and fear what will happen in the future. But did you know that you can also use this time to grow as a person, learn how to make the most of living in the moment and discover the opportunities that present themselves? \nIt is often the case in life that something good is birthed out of something bad. Crises can be watershed moments, compelling us to get out of our comfort zone, teaching us to embrace our fears and helping us make the most of living in the moment, as I discuss in this podcast with leadership expert and best-selling author John Maxwell. Even though events like the current COVID-19 pandemic can disrupt our schedules and plans, we can still find clarity in the present, and make the most of the only time we know we have: right now. \n \nPodcast Time Stamps\n7:29 Why leaders have to lead differently in times of crisis\n9:00 The power of living in the moment \n14:10 The scientific value of living in the moment\n16:30 If we prepare today, we don’t have to repair tomorrow\n21:00 How to use fear to your advantage \n29:22 The cycle of success\n42:29 Uncertainty as an opportunity \n46:30 The secret power of creativity\n \nRead the podcast blog and transcript here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/interview-with-john-maxwell-on-the-neuroscience-of-leadership-tips-on-how-to-lead-during-a-crisis-and-why-we-need-to-fail-more\n \nFore more info on John and to get his books visit: www.johnmaxwell.com\nwww.johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com\n \nAnd follow John on social media:\nJohnCMaxwell – Twitter\njohncmaxwell – Instagram\nJohnCMaxwell – Facebook\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \n-Join my text group for more tips, notifications of sales, and more!
