  "title": "Ep. 481 - Shooting Down The Narrative",
  "description": "Yesterday, white supremacist Hitler-loving neo-Nazis wearing Make America Great Again hats and toting fully semi-automatic double-barreled AR-47 assault rifles descended on the Virginia statehouse to take over the government and establish a Prussian ethnostate in the fevered imagination of the mainstream media. In reality, law-abiding gun owners of all colors and backgrounds showed up on Lobby Day to defend their constitutionally protected civil rights, and there was no violence whatsoever, and they cleaned up after themselves when they left. We will examine how Virginia gun owners shot down the leftist narrative on our Second Amendment rights. Then, AOC has the dumbest conversation I’ve ever heard with leftist journalist Ta Nehisi Coates, Trump’s impeachment trial kicks off, and some great news for the pro-life cause ahead of the March for Life.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
