  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we often hear, especially from the Left, that slavery is America’s “original sin.” It is the reason why we are supposed to be overcome with guilt as Americans. But today I want talk about this idea of slavery as original sin and explain why it’s totally wrong. Also our Five Headlines, including Biden’s move to ban menthol cigarettes. The Democrats want to defund the police, while also passing more petty laws for the police to enforce. Speaking of the police, a teacher in a zoom call berates a student for saying that police are heroes. We’ll play that for you. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the truly insane and almost unbelievable story of the Jeopardy contestant who issues a public apology after being accused of racism for holding up three fingers.  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
