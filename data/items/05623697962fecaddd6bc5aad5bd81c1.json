  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Why are fewer people getting married? One study says it’s because weddings have become too expensive. Skye isn’t buying it. Phil explains why dads are responsible for our large brains, and gives ammo to social conservatives in the process. And Christian’s back! (Sort of.) In a special segment of “Christian Asks,” she talks with Skye about his recent devotional series about idols. That leads to a conversation about the right and wrong way to read the Bible, the concept of narrative fallacy, and slaughtering turkeys.</p>",
