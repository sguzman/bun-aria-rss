  "description": "<p>We all mess up. Sometimes in small ways, but other times big ones. Sometimes privately, other times publicly. We don’t mean to - or maybe we do in the momentum, but feel remorse after the fact. Either way, we all will, at some point, hurt someone. And we may also suffer repercussions. Whether personal, communal, or societal. Question is, what do we do after that? How do we repair the harm, and make amends? How do we find a way back to grace, connection, community, redemption and repair? Is that even possible in all cases? And if so, what are the steps? And what about forgiveness? Does that, and should it, be a part of the process?&nbsp;</p><br><p>Turns out, there is a well-defined set of steps, a path, that very few know about. </p><br><p>Today, we explore a practical, though not always easy, 5-step path to repair, reconciliation, and redemption based on ancient, universal wisdom, that she details in her newest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fFLQVq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>On Repentance and Repair: Making Amends in an Unapologetic World</em></a>.
