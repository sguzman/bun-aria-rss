  "description": "<p>Every life is worth remembering. And that is what cemeteries are all about. Remembering those who have lived. Some of those people in graveyards were famous, some were powerful, but most are just like us. A mom or dad, sister or brother or perhaps a friend. Some of those who are buried have chosen to stay with their bodies. Their spirits glide through the tombstones. Other haunting activity in cemeteries seems to feed off the legends told or the rituals held. Join us on Haunted Cemeteries 22 as we share haunted cemeteries in Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by John Michaels and features Jack Daniels dying from a stubbed toe and This Month in History features \"Oklahoma\" debuting on Broadway.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
