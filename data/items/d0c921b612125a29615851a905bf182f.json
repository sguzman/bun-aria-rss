  "title": "Trumpworld Subpoenas & the Midterms (with Astead Herndon)",
  "description": "Astead Herndon is a national political reporter for The New York Times and the host of a new podcast, “The Run-Up,” which looks ahead to November’s midterm elections, largely through the voice of the voters themselves. Herndon and Preet discuss whether we should trust the polls that show Democrats in a stronger position than previously anticipated heading into the midterms. They also talk about the kinds of voters that the Democrats must persuade in order to keep their majority in Congress and how podcasting is different from print journalism.\nPlus, DOJ issues dozens of new subpoenas in a substantial move related to the January 6th investigation. \nIn the bonus for CAFE Insiders, Herndon breaks down whether cultural or policy preferences are more motivating for voters. He also discusses the viability of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a potential presidential candidate. To listen, try the membership for just $1 for one month: cafe.com/insider. \nFor show notes and a transcript of the episode, head to: link: https://cafe.com/stay-tuned/trumpworld-subpoenas-the-midterms-with-astead-herndon/\n\nTweet your questions to @PreetBharara with hashtag #askpreet, email us at staytuned@cafe.com, or call 669-247-7338 to leave a voicemail.\n\nStay Tuned with Preet is brought to you by CAFE and the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
