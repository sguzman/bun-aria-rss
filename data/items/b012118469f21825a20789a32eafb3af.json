  "description": "Two love stories from Greek mythology...because those go so well. The first is the story of Narcissus and Echo, which was doomed from the moment one jumped out of the bushes at the other for a non-consensual hug. The second story is of Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus takes the (non-death) early retirement option from his heroics and just when he thought he was out...they pull him back in. DO NOT LOOK THE CREATURE THIS WEEK IN THE EYE.
