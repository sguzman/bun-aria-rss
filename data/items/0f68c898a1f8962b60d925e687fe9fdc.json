  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, what started as the ozone layer and global warming is now climate change - the new codeword for inviting the government into our lives and businesses to destroy them. We The People have a rendezvous with history and we must take action. Democrats will harm industry, education, and the economy with capital gains taxes that are above 50%. Punitive taxation on food could limit some American families to only consuming one (red meat) hamburger per month. Then, the outcome of the industrial revolution proved that Karl Marx was wrong and the proletariat army never overthrew anything. Instead, it created the strongest \"middle class\" known to man and provided a comfortable lifestyle. President Biden's energy plan is the biggest blow to the American economy the country has seen. Later, the state of Virginia is now keeping higher achieving students from advancing by eliminating advanced courses in an effort toward equity. Speaking of dumb, a CNN host spars with a State Representative over strengthening voter lists by removing voters that have moved or that have died from the rolls. Afterward, retired football star and sports broadcaster Marcellus Wiley corrected Lebron James on live television for his remarks and admonished him to just be quiet. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
