Also, after the Amara Le Negra interview from Love and Hip Hop Miami went viral, The Breakfast Club addressed the backlash that came from it. Afterwards we switched gears and turned the attention to the listeners for their chance to shoot their shot at a crush, and this time Maury should have been in the building as well! </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
