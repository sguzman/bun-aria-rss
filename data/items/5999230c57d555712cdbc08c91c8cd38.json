  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat wraps up the week from above 30,000 feet on the fastest bird in the sky on the way back from Houston to Indianapolis. Included in today’s show are a couple of incredible interviews. First, Pro Bowler/Super Bowl Champion, and now analyst on ESPN, Ryan Clark, who covers all the big news happening in the NFL right now including Tom Brady potentially playing for a new team next year, Emmanuel Sanders and John Elway’s beef, and who his Super Bowl Contenders are in the AFC and the NFC (2:22-17:00). Next, All-Pro Linebacker and reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year, Colts standout, Darius Leonard joins the show. They chat about why this Colts team is clicking on all cylinders, what it’s like playing for Frank Reich, how Jacoby Brissett has performed so far, and what the expectations are for the Colts moving forward (20:32-32:44). Lastly, former All-Pro and Pro Bowl guard and friend of the show, Josh Sitton, stops by. They chat about the Packers success and if this is the happiest he’s ever seen Aaron Rodgers, whether or not the 49ers are for real, and his thoughts on Drew Brees potentially coming back from injury early (34:45-46:24). Also included is the wild story about how Pat and the boys were stranded outside of Minute Maid Park in Houston while trying to access their tickets for Game 2 of the World Series. It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
