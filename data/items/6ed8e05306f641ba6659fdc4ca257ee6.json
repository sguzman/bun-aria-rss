  "description": "<p>Is setting goals the best way to unlock your true potential?</p> <p>We talk a lot about the importance of goal setting and how to set smart goals. But sometimes fear of failure can create unintentional limits within your goals, and that can actually end up holding you back. What if there was a better way to look at your goals so that you don’t just reach them, but achieve so much more?</p> <p>I’m thrilled to have Emmanuel Acho on our show today to talk more in-depth about this topic. Emmanuel is a former NFL player who earned his Master’s Degree in Sports Psychology during his off-seasons. He’s an Emmy Award-Winning Fox Sports Analyst, host of an <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3DoYiL7X_N1Ta1o4HE9Mlg\">acclaimed video series</a>, and author of the New York Times instant bestseller, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OeXXWd\">Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man</a>. Emmanuel’s newest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36nWEDm\">Illogical: Saying Yes to a Life Without Limits</a>, breaks down how to defy logic so that you can dream bigger and break through your limitations.</p> <p>Fear of failure often fills the space between where you currently are and where you want to be. To overcome that fear, you have to redirect your perspective of failure by letting go of logic so you can keep pushing yourself beyond what conventional wisdom says is possible. If you live in a world where you compare yourself to a standard, this episode is for you.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
