  "description": "<p>You guys!! <strong>Family Karma</strong> is back, and we just love it! The most polite cast to ever appear on reality TV has really let its second season bitch flower bloom: look, there's Brian and Amrit enjoying starfruit! And there's Anisha saying goodbye in a sort of cold way! And is that a pasta station we see?To be fair, Vishal DOES threaten to bash the new guy's face into the ground, but even that's pretty tame by Bravo standards. Love this show and so glad it's back!!</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p>\n",
