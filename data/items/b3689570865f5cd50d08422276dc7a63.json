    "media:description": "A piece of property in Florida that is literally submerged underwater is selling for $43 million! Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola discuss on The Young Turks. Watch LIVE weekdays 6-8 pm ET. http://youtube.com/theyoungturks/live\n\nRead more HERE: https://news.yahoo.com/underwater-real-estate-piece-submerged-070502955.html\n\n\"A Delray Beach developer is hawking a pristine waterfront property in Florida for a whopping $43 million, but it‚Äôs not a mega mansion, it‚Äôs under the brackish patina of the Intracoastal Waterway in Boca Raton with a base of muck and sand and threadbare seagrass.\n\nAfter six years of wrangling to clear the title and other legal baggage from the 4 acres of submerged land, owner William Swaim said it‚Äôs ready for the market, which is hot for waterfront parcels.\n\nSwaim, who specializes in flooded lands ‚Äúthat other people overlook,‚Äù said the plot can be filled in with buildable dirt, have a seawall constructed, and is zoned for single-family homes. He‚Äôll do the dirt and seawall, but it will cost an extra $3.5 million.\n\n‚ÄúSubmerged parcels are a headache,‚Äù Swaim said about making the land developer-ready. ‚ÄúIt takes years to clean them up, and most people don‚Äôt want to take years to clean them up.\"\"\n\n\n***\n\nThe largest online progressive news show in the world.
