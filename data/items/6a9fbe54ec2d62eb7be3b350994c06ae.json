Janet knows it doesn’t have to be this way. She offers her perspective on the process and a potty learning method that recognizes a child’s natural motivation to achieve this milestone (they can do this), and how parents can support the effort without pressure, bribes, or deal-making.  The result is a child whose self-confidence grows in all areas because he has been allowed to own this accomplishment.\n\nThanks again to Ritual Vitamins for supporting this podcast.
