  "description": "Donald Trump was the worst president in US history. About that, at this point, there can be no doubt. One measure of the disaster he has been is the damage he has done to US foreign policy. Fortunately for the United States, the next president is coming into office with more foreign policy experience than any president since George H.W. Bush...and arguably considerably more than even Bush. And his first-rate team has long-experience with one another and are ready to hit the ground running as of day one. The question is: What should their priorities be? We discuss with former US Under Secretary of State Ambassador Nicholas Burns of Harvard's Kennedy School, Mieke Eoyang, who runs national security programs at the Third Way organization and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Don't miss this thought-provoking and forward looking discussion.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
