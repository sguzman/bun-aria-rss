  "description": "<p>Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan wonders if he's the only person not tripping inside a warehouse in the burned-out Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, where the Grateful Dead are soundtracking yet another acid test. He further wonders if he's the only one who recognizes the gravity of the situation when the LAPD burst in. Later, he falls hard for a likeminded blues lover who turns on her lovelight. But not before he falls into a pit of despair when he is unknowingly dosed and embarks on a trip from which he may never return.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Long-Strange-Trip-History-Grateful/dp/0767911865/\"><em>A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Dennis McNally</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Living-Dead-Twenty-Garcia-Grateful/dp/0815411634/\"><em>Living with The Dead: Twenty Years on the Bus with Garcia and the Grateful Dead</em>, by Rock Scully with David Dalton</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sound-Life-Grateful-Dead/dp/0316154490/\"><em>Searching for the Sound</em>, by Phil Lesh</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/This-All-Dream-We-Dreamed/dp/1250058562/\"><em>This Is All a Dream We Dreamed: An Oral History of the Grateful Dead</em>, by Blair Jackson and David Gans</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gd66-01-xx.sbd.hanno-uli.18846.sbeok.shnf/gd66-01t03.shn\">Grateful Dead 1966 “Viola Lee Blues” rehearsals</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/owsley-stanley-the-king-of-lsd-82181/\">Owsley Stanley: The King of LSD</a> (Rolling Stone)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/watts-riots\">Watts Rebellion</a> (History.com)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2009/08/viola-lee-blues.html\">Grateful Dead Guide: Viola Lee Blues</a> (Dead Essays)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/oct/06/fbi-ken-kesey/\">Fleeing marijuana possession charges, Ken Kesey successfully hid from the FBI … in Marijuana City, Mexico</a> (Muckrock)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixaOIn1-ups\">Wavy Gravy interview 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEatmImfz8o\">Wavy Gravy interview 2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://gdlistening.blogspot.com/2011/10/watts-acid-test-21266.html\">Watts Acid Test - 2/12/66</a> (Truckin’ with the Dead)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gradesaver.com/the-electric-koolaid-acid-test/study-guide/summary-the-electric-kool-aid-acid-test-and-the-fugitive\">The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” & “The Fugitive” Summary and Analysis</a> (GradeSaver)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2011/04/pigpen-solo.html\">Grateful Dead Guide: Pigpen Solo</a> (Dead Essays)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/gd1966-02-12.sbd.bershaw.9515.shnf\">Grateful Dead live at Youth Opportunities Center 1966</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/art-exhibits/unearthed-grateful-dead-pool-party-photos-debut-at-north-bay-museum-exhibition\">Unearthed Grateful Dead pool party photos debut at North Bay museum exhibition</a> (SF Chronicle)</p>\n<p>For behind the scenes info and news on this episode, follow:</p>\n<p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/doubleelvis\"> @DoubleElvis</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/disgracelandpod/\">@Disgracelandpod </a></p>\n<p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://wwww.twitter.com/doubleelvisfm\"> @DoubleElvisFm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disgracelandpod\">@Disgracelandpod</a></p>\n<p>Tik Tok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@disgracelandpod\">@Disgracelandpod</a></p>\n<p>Pinterest:<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/doubleelvisfm/\"> @doubleelvisfm </a></p>\n<p>Facebook:<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DoubleElvisProductions/\"> Double Elvis Productions</a></p>\n<p><em>Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse and many more musical icons all died at the age of 27.
