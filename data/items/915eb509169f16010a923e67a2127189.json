But that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this week's guest — a humble athlete, proud dad, devoted husband&nbsp;and dedicated entrepreneur with a unique success equation: Work hard. Play harder. Love hardest.</p><p>His name is Jesse Thomas. He's rad. And this is his story.</p><p>It begins with a stand out track and field career at Stanford and the Olympic steeplechase dream cut short by a career-ending injury. While later pursuing a masters degree in mechanical engineering, he picked up a bike and progressed so rapidly he entertained a professional cycling career. But that dream too was crushed when a spill left him with a fractured C1 vertebra, nine months in a neck brace, a plate and 4 titanium screws to hold it all together.</p><p>Life as an athlete was over for Jesse. Or so he thought.</p><p>Spending the next several years as a tech entrepreneur, Jesse got itchy. He didn't like being out of shape. So he decided to do something about it.</p><p>Fast forward to 2011. The stage was&nbsp;Wildflower, a prestigious and formidable half-ironman distance triathlon set in the idyllic rolling hills of central California. A complete unknown amateur, Jesse nonetheless won the race outright, shocking the triathlon community by dominating an impressive professional field on a borrowed bike and a pair of $9 aviator sunglasses he bought at the drug store.</p><p>The victory was so unexpected, as Jesse crossed the finish line the race announcer had to ask, Who are you?</p><p>The story is legend. And the rest is history. Jesse went on to become the first person to win that race three years in a row. And along his circuitous path as a professional, he has graced the podium at many of the most lauded triathlons in the world, including 3rd at the coveted Challenge Roth ironman distance event last summer.</p><p>Jesse's&nbsp;ability to out-exercise the rest of us is impressive. But it's only a somewhat unrelatable fraction of what truly interests me about him. It's who he is that compels me most — a person successfully alchemizing an insanely demanding training and racing schedule against the more relatable pressures of being&nbsp;a present dad, husband, podcast host (check out <a href=\"https://pickybars.com/blogs/the-scoop/work-play-love-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Work, Play, Love</a>) and&nbsp;CEO of <a href=\"https://pickybars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Picky Bars</a> — the performance nutrition company&nbsp;he co-founded with his wife Lauren Fleshman,&nbsp;herself a prolific former professional runner with the most All-American accolades in Stanford athletics history.</p><p>How does he do it all?</p><br><p>Today we canvass a life in motion — from the Wildflower race that changed his life to his symbiotic relationship with entrepreneurship and family that fuels his purpose.</p><p>We discuss the importance of coaches. Leaning on mentors. The challenges faced by the retiring athlete.
