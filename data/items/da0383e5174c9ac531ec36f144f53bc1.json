  "description": "<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Matt \"Money\" Smith and CBS Sports' Will Brinson via Skype. Producer Kent Brown sent us a new voicemail from his mom as she reviews <em>The Shape of Water </em>(9:00). The group plays a game of 'Use Your Noodle' as Eddie Spaghetti asks them which NFL quarterbacks have thrown for over 30,000 yards and 250 touchdowns (11:00). Next, everyone reacts to Sully's Tweet about Chick-Fil-A and subsequently ranks the best fast food items (21:20). Shek, Money and Will debate which wide receiver they'd take for this upcoming season between Dez Bryant. Larry Fitzgerald, Jordy Nelson, Alshon Jeffery. Adam Thielen, Brandon Marshall or Michael Crabtree (29:50). Lastly, Shek brings up the awkward hug between EmmaVP and Money at the Dodgers game last week and makes them reenact the scene (36:00). </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
