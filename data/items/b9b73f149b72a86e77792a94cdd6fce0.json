  "description": "In Episode 117 I sit down with Dean & Ayesha Sherzai, MD leading Neurologist's who specialise in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's. Recently Dean and Ayesha performed a thorough review of the literature to find out how important omega 3s are for brain function and whether or not we should supplement them. Naturally they ended up splitting this review into two parts, one covering pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence and the other covering adulthood. In this episode we break down their findings with the goal of helping you understand what omega 3s are, where we get them from and whether we should consider supplementation. It was a pleasure to have them back on the show. I love everything that they are about and I'm sure you're going to find this a very informative episode.\n\nSpecifically we cover:\n\n\nWhat Omega 3's are\n\nDifference between short chain and long chain omega 3's\n\nOmega 3's and pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence\n\nOmega 3's and adulthood\n\nOmega 3's and cognitive impairment\n\nConsidering supplementation\n\nand much more\n\n\nThe Sherzai's new book The 30 Day Alzheimer's Solution:\nHarper Collins\nBooktopia (Australian's)\n\nMy Book:\nMy book is coming out early 2021 published with Penguin - I cannot wait to share with you.
