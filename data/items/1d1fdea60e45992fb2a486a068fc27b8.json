  "description": "<p>Throughout the story of the Bible, God singles out different people, like Jacob, to be the conduit of his blessing to all humanity. But from birth, Jacob consistently acts more like the snake from the garden of Eden than a righteous chosen one of God. He lies his way into blessings that God had intended for him all along. So what will God do? In this episode, Tim and Jon discuss the theme of blessing and curse in the life of Jacob.</p><p><a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/podcasts/the-bible-project-podcast/\">View full show notes from this episode →</a></p><p><strong>Timestamps </strong></p><ul><li>Part one (00:00-17:30)</li><li>Part two (17:30-28:20)</li><li>Part three (28:20-45:30)</li><li>Part four (45:30-1:05:57)</li></ul><p><strong>Referenced Resources</strong></p><ul><li>Interested in more?
