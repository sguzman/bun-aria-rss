  "title": "Ep. 782 - There Is A Conspiracy To Sexualize Your Children. Here's Where It All Started.",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as more school boards across the country adopt radical pro-transgender policies, it is time that we take a step back and trace the roots of this madness. We know that our country has gone insane, and that the insanity is being especially foisted upon our children, but how did we end up this way? Where did it begin? Who did it begin with? Today we’ll discuss the two men who started it all. Also, doctors in Florida walk out of the job in protest against patients who aren’t vaccinated. And the government has investigated itself and decided that it didn’t do anything wrong when Ashli Babbitt was shot in the Capitol, though they still won’t tell us who shot her. And a viral trend has people suffering devastating head injuries while trying to climb milk crates. It is very hilarious, I mean troubling. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the revolutionary new social movement called “lying flat,” in which people just lie around all day doing nothing. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
