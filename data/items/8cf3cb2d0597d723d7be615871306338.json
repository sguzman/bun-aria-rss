Such is the hubris of a car enthusiast, who believes they are Lewis Hamilton (or Nicholas Latifi, whoever you prefer), nay they are better, and thus they don't need such aids like Anti-Lock Braking Systems slowing them down.\n\nTrue, if you car doesn't have ABS, you better learn to perfect your threshold braking technique, because it's all you have. But if you drive a modern car with ABS, it's going to outperform your braking time and time again. Don't believe me?
