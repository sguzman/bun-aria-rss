  "description": "<p>While Shannon finalizes plans for season 3, a loootttt has been going on. A mini life update was simply necessary, she just can’t stay away. After the Ford family vacation, Shannon went back to Nashville to pack for the first boyfriend family trip she has ever gone on (and it’s to Portugal?! Unreal). Shannon gives packing advice and her best tip on avoiding fights with family members on vacation. What happened when Shannon was seated at a wedding table with John? Which Very Cavallari cast member did she unexpectedly run into recently? Shannon talks about her trip itinerary and drops some breadcrumbs about next season. Who do you want to see on Probably A Podcast? Tell us! Season 3 coming soon!</p>",
