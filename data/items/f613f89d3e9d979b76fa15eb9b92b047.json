  "description": "Today I talked to Anne F. Harris. Anne wears two hats: she's a medieval art historian and president of Grinnell College. We talked about her new book Medieval Art 250-1450: Matter, Making, and Meaning (Oxford University Press, 2021), which she co-authored with Nancy M. Thompson. We also discussed the significance and relevance of Medieval art today, the transition from teaching to administration, what it's like to head a premiere liberal arts college in the age of Covid (and all else), and her vision for Grinnell. \nMarshall Poe is the founder and editor of the New Books Network. He's also a graduate of Grinnell College. He can be reached at marshallpoe@newbooksnetwork.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
