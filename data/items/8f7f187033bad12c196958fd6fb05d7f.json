  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by the acting phenomenon who you will surely have seen and loved in any one of her tremendous appearances - yes, it’s JANUARY JONES!</p><br><p>A truly huge one this week, people - well worth waiting for too, as January takes to the show with ease and grace and gets right on in from the ground floor! Of course, you will surely know January from arguably one of the top three television shows of all time Mad Men, in which she played Betty Draper, but she has putting in power moves and all kinds of work since (and obviously before) that show - a lot of which you will hear about on this episode! So settle in and enjoy this delightful show where she and Brett cover the whole death thing of course, as well as how they met in a not so great bowling game, her old show ‘Huff’, her dogs getting familiar with Brett (as you’ll hear by way of mic rumble here and there!), the left and right side of the brain and spirituality / mortality, her early days in a small Dakota town and being mom-shamed in a cinema. Perfect from start to end. You will love it. Enjoy January Jones!</p><br><p><strong>AUDIO NOTE!</strong> From 18:25 to 22:35 there is a slight drop in quality. This is where we had to resort to the backup recording while a little problem was fixed in-flight.
