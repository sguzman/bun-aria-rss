  "description": "<p>Tammy Jo Blanton's body is found in her bathtub by police responding to a welfare check request. Just the night before, September 10th, 2014, Blanton called 911, saying that her ex-boyfriend, Joseph Oberhandsley, would not leave the front of her home. The welfare check had been requested by Blanton's friend and co-worker when Blanton did not show up for work. When police arrive at the home, Joseph Oberhandsley answers the door, covered in blood. Police find signs of a forced entry, and ultimately Tammy Jo Blanton's body. She has not only been stabbed repeatedly, but her body mutilated and also cannibalized. </p>\n<p>In this episode of Body Bags, forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan and Jackie Howard discuss the differences between dismemberment and mutilation, the perspective of the judge and jury when it is revealed that injuries to the body are post-mortem, and the horrific details in the case of Tammy Jo Blanton’s murder.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/body-bags-with-joseph-scott-morgan/id1587763116\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"0\"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/385AEt9XDYJoCyWtGZo3bw?si=j4zNy8vhQISmIFTA0HvASg&dl_branch=1\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"1\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-body-bags-with-joseph-scot-87375583/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"2\"><strong>iHeart</strong></a></p>\n<p>Show Notes:</p>\n<p>0:30 - Introducing Tammy Jo Blanton’s murder</p>\n<p>1:30 - Tammy Jo Blanton calls the police because her ex-boyfriend, Joseph Oberhansley would not leave her home</p>\n<p>3:00 - Describing the initial murder scene</p>\n<p>5:00 - Cause of death: sharp force injuries.
