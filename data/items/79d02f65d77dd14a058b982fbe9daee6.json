  "description": "<p>Join me as I sit down with one of my very favorite persons, Michelle Visser. Michelle's family raises pigs on their New England farm. (In fact, reach out to Michelle if you're looking for a great source of pasture-raised pork in the New Hampshire area.) <br/><br/>Michelle is also a published author and my Marketing & Project Manager (pretty much one of my right hands on The Prairie Homestead team). <br/><br/>Michelle and I get a little starry-eyed and do a deep dive into two good animal fats today. We break down the kinds of fat you can source from cows and pigs, why this fat is so good for us, why it ever got such a bad rap, how to render it, how to use each kind of fat, and where to get it if you're not a pig or cattle farmer yourself.<br/><br/>Michelle's <a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/17/complete-guide-to-rendering-lard/'>Complete Guide to Rendering Lard</a> (<a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/17/complete-guide-to-rendering-lard/'>https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/17/complete-guide-to-rendering-lard/</a>)<br/><br/>Jill's <a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2012/02/how-to-render-beef-tallow.html'>Complete Guide to Rendering Tallow</a> (<a href='https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2012/02/how-to-render-beef-tallow.html'>https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2012/02/how-to-render-beef-tallow.html</a>)<br/><br/>Michelle's recipe she promised: <a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/18/chocolate-chip-cookies-made-with-lard/'>Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies made with Lard</a> (<a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/18/chocolate-chip-cookies-made-with-lard/'>https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/18/chocolate-chip-cookies-made-with-lard/</a>) <br/><br/>Evidence for all the ill effects of hydrogenated oils here: <a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/19/how-to-bake-with-lard-and-why-you-should/'>How to Bake with Lard (and why you should)</a> (<a href='https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/19/how-to-bake-with-lard-and-why-you-should/'>https://soulyrested.com/2022/03/19/how-to-bake-with-lard-and-why-you-should/</a>)<br/><br/><b>Where You Can Find Michelle:</b><br/> The Simple Doesn't Mean Easy podcast: <a href='https://soulyrested.com/podcast/'>https://soulyrested.com/podcast/</a><br/>SoulyRested.com:  <a href='https://soulyrested.com/'>https://soulyrested.com/<br/></a>YouTube: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOLRbLo4lnwJ2nPiL2xtB8g'>SoulyRested on YouTube</a> <br/>Instagram:  <a href='https://www.instagram.com/souly.rested/'>https://www.instagram.com/souly.rested/</a><br/><br/>This episode is proudly sponsored by Genuine Beef Co.
