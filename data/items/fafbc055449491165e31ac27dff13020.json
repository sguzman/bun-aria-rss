  "description": "I never fucked Wayne I never fucked Drake…yet\nWelcome home Slooty Pebbles! It’s a new week and Sofia is BACK from Miami and more specifically, straight out of a stripper’s asshole! No, seriously. This week we dive into A LOT of topics. First, Sofia gives us a rundown of her trip and tells a special story about how a Sloot spotted her out and about and felt it was appropriate to attempt to embarrass her in front of her friends. Next, we dive into the hottest (literally) story of the week regarding an Instagram model, Drake, a condom, and condiment. Something out of the four doesn’t belong! We dive into the topic of “trapping” and how no matter how rich he is…it’s pretty much NEVER worth it. Finally, In this weeks Sloot University we cover a very important topic: anxiety. Sofia unpacks the many different forms of anxiety, the harsh yet humorous reality about her struggles, and how much therapy honestly fucking sucks. But we support it! 2022 has started off HOT (Frank’s Red Hot specifically) and we are back to our regularly scheduled program!
