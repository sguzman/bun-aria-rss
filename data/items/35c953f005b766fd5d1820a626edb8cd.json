Tareen's background straddles the line between technology and home. She helped build e-design platform Decorist, and acted as the head of innovation at Bed Bath & Beyond—two experiences that convinced her of the transformative power of digital renderings. On this episode of the podcast, she chats with host Dennis Scully about why she believes photography is on the verge of disruption, why an improvement to the iPhone will change everything, and whether artificial intelligence can replace interior designers. <i>This episode is sponsored by Resource Furniture and Universal Furniture.  </i></p>\n",
