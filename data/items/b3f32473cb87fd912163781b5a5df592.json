  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Drug Testing...JINX! Buy Me a Coke! We start off this episode by checking in with Kentapedia (Kent Zbornack) to get some facts straight on the shooting schedule, Jenna gives some Micheal Scott trivia, and we get a little deductive sass from Dwangela. Then we get into Micheals fear of being drug tested, Dwight's hilarious struggle with helping Micheal pass his drug test, and Jenna does a deep dive on what could possibly make your urine green. Finally, Jenna talks about the three taps on the coke can moment, and we dig into the deleted scenes to find who left that joint in the parking lot. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a chance to be our State Farm Real Deal, go to <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__officeladies.com_realdeal&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=95HGyDrggEeIlRMF8ZOGnqbWSbnHr8fMMQbGKE5E-WM&s=zFfC0Q8VNBm7pjDoSrYbRgZCeEdXqTHrkkD-HGNvl7c&e=\">officeladies.com/realdeal</a> and submit your question for a chance to win some awesome swag, including a signed Office Ladies mug. </p>\n",
