  "description": "<p>Happy New Year's Eve!</p>\n<p>We take a look back at 2018 and a look forward to 2019 today on Timesuck. We also find more inspiration in the tales of Nick Vujicic and Bethany Hamilton. Nick was born with Tetra-amelia syndrome - a rare disorder characterized by the absence of arms and legs. But he hasn't let that stop him from learning to skateboard, surf, swim, \"walk\", and even jump. He's incredible! And he's also a self-made millionaire and married father of four. Bethany Hamilton is a pro surfer who had a Tiger shark bite off her left arm when she was thirteen. She was back in the water a month after the attack and within three years became a professional surfer winning numerous awards and tournaments. In addition to continuing to kick ass in the ocean, she's now a married mother of two and motivational speaker. Take some inspiration into 2019 and kick some f*#king ass, Timesuckers!!!!</p>\n<p>Today's Timesuck is brought to you by Marvelous Light by Paul Frank Spencer. It's available for purchase at all online retailers and can be ordered through your local bookstore.
