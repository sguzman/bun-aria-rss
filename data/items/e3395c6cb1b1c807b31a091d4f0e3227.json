Geno Smith got written off but maybe for good reason (00:18:59-00:23:54). Cleaning up stories from Sunday (00:23:54-00:33:22). Hot Seat/Cool Throne including Robert Saleh taking receipts on Jets haters (00:33:22-00:53:15). Ryan Fitzpatrick joins us in studio to talk about the end of his career, transition to media, the importance of locker room cohesiveness and tons more (00:53:15-01:39:55). We introduce a new segment that was supposed to be Inside The Talking Boot but we changed on the fly to simply we call a Quarterback and ask them 1 question (01:39:55-01:58:59). We finish up with guys on chicks (01:58:59-02:15:17).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
