  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life, we bring you another episode in our 2021 Summer Short Story series. This week Angelina, Cindy and Thomas talk about E. M. Forster’s short story <a href= \"https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/the%20machine%20stops.pdf\"> “The Machine Stops.”</a> If you are interested in more E. M. Forster chat, you can go listen to our hosts discuss “The Celestial Omnibus” in <a href=\"https://www.theliterary.life/017/\">Episode 17</a>. Angelina points out how this story made her think of Dante. Thomas and Cindy share their personal reactions to reading “The Machine Stops.” They marvel at how prescient Forster was to imagine a world that comes so close to our current reality. They also discuss how to stay human in an increasingly de-humanizing world.</p> <p>On July 15, 2021, we will be celebrating our 100th episode hosting a LIVE Q&A episode in our Patreon group, and you can ask questions in our Facebook group with hashtag #litlife100.
