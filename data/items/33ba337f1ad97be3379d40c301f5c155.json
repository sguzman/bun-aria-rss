  "title": "Xi Jinping’s plan for China",
  "description": "This month China’s President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a further five years as the country’s leader after the Communist Party abolished two-term limits. It opens the door to Xi continuing to rule for the rest of his life. His time in power has seen the country take a more confrontational approach to many of its neighbours as well as to the West. China’s GDP continues to grow and living standards for most citizens have risen, but some fear the ‘economic miracle’ of recent decades may be coming to an end and that rising tensions over Taiwan and Hong Kong could lead to conflict. So, who is Xi Jinping? What makes him tick? And what are his plans for the future of China?\n\nRitula Shah is joined by a panel of expert guests.\n\nDaniel R. Russel - Former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs (2013 - 2017), currently Vice President for International Security and Diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI), New York\n\nLucy Hornby - visiting scholar at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, formerly of Reuters and the FT\n\nSteve Tsang - Director of the China Institute at SOAS, The University of London\n\nAlso featuring:\n\nVictor Gao - Vice President of the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank based in Beijing\n\nProducers: Paul Schuster and Ellen Otzen",
