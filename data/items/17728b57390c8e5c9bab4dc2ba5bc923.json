  "description": "<p>While this entire season has been dedicated to generating additional income for your homestead, there's a good chance that you've already heard of or contemplated many of the ideas we've discussed. Today that's about to change my friends. In this episode I'm joined by Chloe Mackintosh of Boxwood Avenue. Despite living in a tiny town in California, Chloe has been able to support homestead by building an online store featuring handcrafted items by local artisans, antiques, and vintage finds. She's been so successful in this venture that she's even preparing to open her own retail store. This episode is super important because like Chloe, many of us have already have skills that we can leverage in new ways to help our bottom line.</p><p>The Positively Tea Company is your go-to source for organic, loose-leaf teas without the artificial junk!
