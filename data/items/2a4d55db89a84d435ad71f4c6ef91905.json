Pretty surprising update from i-Rocks to their K76M Fun keyboard - a few small changes resulting in a massive difference in quality. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nIntro by Kyle Carter\nOutro by Facundo Cabanne\n\nMy keyboard reviews: http://bit.ly/1TbOtft\nMy switch teardowns: http://bit.ly/2C1QGHz\nMy TOP X videos: http://bit.ly/2FmpZfd\nMy XL typing demos: https://bit.ly/2OoAW3w\nMy tutorials and featurettes: https://bit.ly/2OrkLUh\nMy unboxing videos: https://bit.ly/2TSrr0m\n\nI'm Thomas and I do videos and reviews on mechanical keyboards ranging from the most sickening modern RGB gaming keyboards to vintage hardware relics, or sometimes keycaps or keyswitches ranging from Cherry MX to Alps SKCM to IBM buckling springs and anything in between.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates on my keyboard videos! https://twitter.com/chyrosran22\n\nThe practice sentence was: \"Hello my name is Thomas and I'm typing on the updated i-Rocks keyboard right now. This is a very nice, light-typing keyboard, I really like it! They should do more of these!\"",
