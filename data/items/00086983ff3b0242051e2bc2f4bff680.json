Bill O’Reilly brings his biggest stories of the week: dictator-governors, reopening the economy, and the northeast’s plan to “Trump-proof” it. The media still slams hydroxychloroquine, but Dr. Robin Armstrong describes its great results with his patients. In today’s coronavirus update, China revises Wuhan’s death rate UP, the White House releases reopening guidelines, and wholesale gas prices are WAY down! Nancy Pelosi’s freezer reeks of elitism, while Joe Biden’s mental state just reeks. And do you trust Dr. Fauci? One “Dr. Shiva” may provide some balance.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
