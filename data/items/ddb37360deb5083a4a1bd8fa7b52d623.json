  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss the first part of The Who’s career (from 1964 to 1970) with Ben Domenech.</p>\n<p><b>Introducing the Band:</b></p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Ben Domenech. Ben is the publisher of <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Federalist</a> and also writes a daily newsletter, The Transom, which you can subscribe to at <a href=\"http://thetransom.com./\" target=\"_blank\">thetransom.com</a>. Follow Ben on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bdomenech\" target=\"_blank\">@bdomenech</a>.<br />\n<b>Ben’s Music Pick: The Who</b></p>\n<p>Today the gang is talkin’ ’bout its generation as they cover the first part of the career of one of the greatest and most important bands in the history of rock music, The Who! Yes, the ‘orrible ‘Oo, more or less the definitive power trio (despite the fact that they had four members), innovated in so many different ways — instrumentally, lyrically, vocally, conceptually, and also in terms of writing songs about masturbation and dog-racing — that it takes us a little over three hours to cover the explosively imaginative first six years of their career, up through <i>Live At Leeds</i>. Sit back, relax and let your mind roll on over all your problems as Political Beats brings you Emergency Quarantine Relief by revisiting the glory of a band that you might have known, during their early years, mostly for anthemic proto-punk singles, but which was also by equal turns inspiring and charmingly goofy. We promise we will not put a car in your swimming pool.</p>\n",
