  "description": "<p>About an hour northwest of Madrid, an enormous stone crucifix rises 500 feet out of a rocky mountaintop. It’s so big you can see it from miles away. Beneath the cross, there’s a sprawling Benedictine monastery and a basilica carved out of the mountain. This place is called The Valley of the Fallen. And it’s likely the most controversial monument in Spain. The Valley is synonymous with Francisco Franco, the general who ruled Spain from the end of its bloody civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975. When Franco died, he became the Valley’s most notorious inhabitant, until he was removed in 2019. Currently there are tens of thousands of other bodies still trapped in the basilica beneath where Franco used to lie. Many were victims of Franco’s security forces, murdered during the height of the civil war, and for years, their families have been trying to get them out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=32765&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Valley of the Fallen</a></p>\n<p>Buy <a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/book/\" target=\"_blank\">The 99% Invisible City</a>, our first book!</p>\n",
