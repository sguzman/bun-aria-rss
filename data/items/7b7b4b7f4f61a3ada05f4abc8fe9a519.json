  "itunes:summary": "Luciano Chessa examines the work of Italian Futurist, painter and musician Luigi Russolo, presenting a reading of the mechanical sound synthesizers, the intonarumori, that he began to create in 1913. It traces the roots of Russolo’s instrument to Leonardo da Vinci’s noisemakers, and then reestablishes the previously unacknowledged prominence of occultism, including theosophy, in early twentieth-century Italian culture.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/luciano-chessa-music-the-dead-can-hear\n\nHistories and Theories of Sound\n3 July 2018\nFlorence Peel Centre, Fitzroy\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Discipline\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
