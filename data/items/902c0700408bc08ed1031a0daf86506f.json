  "title": "Mikel Welch on bridging the gap between TV and high end design",
  "description": "<p>The world of high-end design can feel very far apart from the big-tent appeal of home makeover shows, but interior designer <strong>Mikel Welch </strong>has managed to break through in both. His work has been featured in premier showhouses around the country, and he’s a regular on TV, with appearances on everything from TLC’s <i>Trading Spaces</i> to <i>Good Morning America</i> to a new show for Quibi with a premise that has to be seen to be believed. On this episode of the podcast, he chats with host Dennis Scully about his circuitous career path, the surprising economics of design on TV, and the industry’s long-overdue reckoning with race. <i>This episode is sponsored by The Urban Electric Company.</i></p>\n",
