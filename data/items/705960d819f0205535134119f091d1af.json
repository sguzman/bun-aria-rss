  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, with the government seizing unprecedented power in the name of a “national emergency” and a threat to “public health,” we must consider what might happen when the next Democratic president gets into office and decides that, for example, climate change is a national health emergency.

And today we cancel a school principal who warned parents that they should not attempt to teach their own kids during quarantine. Plus, a whole bunch of people write to tell me why I’m wrong to object to the government arresting pastors who hold worship services.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
