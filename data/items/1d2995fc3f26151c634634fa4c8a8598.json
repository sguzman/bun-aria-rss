This very special episode is full of big announcements and big egos. &nbsp;We even answer the age old question: Which has more museums, Boise or New York City? We also discover the world of people who get excited by squirrels, making this our most wholesome episode yet. But don't get too excited, because we're still being described as \"what muppets would sound like on crack.\"</p>\n<p>Buy our merch! <a href=\"https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet\">https://store.dftba.com/collections/beach-too-sandy-water-too-wet</a></p>\n<p>Logo by Courtney DeKorte.
