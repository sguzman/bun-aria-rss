  "description": "<p>Ben Mandelker (bsideblog.com) and Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) tackle all the death threats, backstabbing, and leg throwing on Bravo, starting with the Real Housewives of NYC season finale.  Aviva threw her leg, and the world scratched its head.  Then it's on to the latest brawl in Orange County, followed by more hilariously deplorable behavior on Game of Crowns.<br />\nThe Bravo entertainment wheezes to an end with recaps of Ladies of London and Real Housewives of New Jersey, both of which had snoozers of episodes (but that didn't stop us from having lots of fun at their expense).
