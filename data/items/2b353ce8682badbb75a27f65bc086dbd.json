  "description": "<p>Chris Anderson was the editor in chief of Wired Magazine for over a decade, during which time he wrote an \"accidental\" trilogy of three books: The Long Tail, Free, and Makers. His latest book details how a mild obsession with do-it-yourself drones (pilotless planes) sucked him into the maker community, and to co-found a business now producing millions in sales. We talk about the maker movement, the revolution of atoms that's underway, and his drones. (He left Wired just after we recorded this podcast to work full-time as chief of his business, 3D Robotics.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p>Canine design that fits your style at <br /><a href=\"http://www.domesticbeast.com/?utm_source=mule&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=dec\">Domestic Beast</a>.</p>\n\n\n",
