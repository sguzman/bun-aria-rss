  "description": "<p>Great episode in store for you today!\n\n-RockyBoots.com promo code \"ZBT\" for 25% off. Folks, thats a hell of a deal-\n\nRound 1: Boozed-up. A recent study proves which branch of service drinks the most… well… at least goes to the hospital the most for binge drinking. Round 1 will be a judgment-free zone where we can judge everyone. \n\nRound 2: Wanna get boozed-up, put your pocket book down and just dance the night way? Dont try that shit in Italy friends. The US has banned dancing like this is a 1937 Quaker Community. \n\nRound 3: Hurry up and wait took on new meaning in 2001 for one anti-Taliban fighter. Hurry up and wait for round 3 so we can tell you just how long he had to wait in order for his relief to show up so he could depart the scene of his downed tank. Actual tank this time too. \n\nRound 4: Time for a little spy goofin with a former CIA agent and a businessman who experienced the Chinese intellectual theft practices first hand. \n\nRound 5: WHO DOES NUMBER 2 WORK FOR? A secret underwater cave was discovered by some folks doing some satellite goofin in the south china sea. I love a good secret lair!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
