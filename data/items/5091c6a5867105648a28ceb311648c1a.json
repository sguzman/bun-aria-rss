  "description": "By all accounts Dee Dee Blanchard and her daughter Gypsy Rose were an unfortunate pair - a single mom, forced to care for her daughter and her many illnesses. As if that weren't bad enough, their home was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina. When Habitat For Humanity was gracious enough to build them a new home in Springfield, Missouri, neighbors welcomed the devoted and loving mother and the sweet young girl who always had a huge smile on her face despite her sickly condition. But things aren't always as they appear, and what neighbors didn't suspect was one of the worse cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy was occurring right across the street. Even more shocking is how the horror would end. Dee Dee and Gypsy's story gripped the nation and can now be seen in the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, the Hulu series_ The Act_, and continues to make headlines from the courtroom.\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices.
