Today’s guest, Mike Mutzel, is here to shed light on this important and timely topic. You’re going to learn about how health disparities lead to higher infection rates and worse outcomes, the root causes of our main health problems, and what we can do to become healthier and more resilient.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>This episode contains discussions on the power of exercise, what lifestyle habits make vaccines more effective, the incredible inner workings of the human immune system, and realistic practices you can integrate to help your body become as strong and protected as possible.
