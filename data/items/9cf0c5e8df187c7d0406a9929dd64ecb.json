  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, according to President Reagan's diaries in June of 1987, Joe Biden was a demagogue trying to reverse the Reagan doctrine. Others have criticized Biden as a transactional politician. Even Bernie Sanders sees Biden as malleable and urged “the squad” to ensure that Biden becomes the most progressive President if elected. The Democrats have given it all they've got and are spent, now it is time for patriots to go and vote to save the republic. Later, Facebook has an antiquated business model similar to those used in communist China, and as such, they are censoring the Mark Levin Show using phony fact-checkers from leftists such as Politifact. Then, Ron DeSantis calls in with an update on Florida's election turnout and the increase in republican registrations indicating that President Trump may not need to win Pennsylvania and Michigan. DeSantis pointed out that President Trump is in better shape in 2020 than he was in 2016 with a possible increase in Black and Hispanic voters in Miami-Dade County. Also, the books on liberty and natural law that informed the founding of America should be burned if the manifesto known as the Biden Sanders Unity Task Force document becomes the law of the land. Democrats are pushing for a one-party system where the country is ruled by the Democrat Party, not the US Constitution. Afterward, Stanley Kurtz joins the show to reiterate the importance of stopping the Obama-era initiative known as AFFH (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing) which allows the federal government to take over local zoning and effectively bring the city into the suburbs. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
