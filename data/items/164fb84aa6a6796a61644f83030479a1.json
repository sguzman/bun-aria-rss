  "description": "<p>Whether you've been dating someone for a short time or been married for years, there's one question that can remain perennially interesting — did I choose the right partner?  <br /><br />My guest today has some answers to that question that aren't based on crowd-sourced anecdotes or biased personal hunches, but reams of scientific research. His name is <a href=\"https://tytashiro.com/\">Ty Tashiro</a> and he's a professor of psychology, a relationship expert, and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNJVRYG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FNJVRYG&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Science of Happily Ever After: What Really Matters in the Quest for Enduring Love</em></a>. We begin our discussion with the difference between loving someone and being <em>in</em> love with them, and how the latter comes down to a combination of <em>like</em> and <em>lust</em>. Ty shares the three elements that go into liking, and how this liking piece is really the foundation of long-lasting relational happiness, even though it tends to get underemphasized. Ty then reveals the surprisingly low ROI of factors like looks and income in relationship happiness, before unpacking the factors that <em>do</em> have an outsized impact in contributing to enduring love. We discuss which personality traits are predictive of relationship stability and satisfaction, which have the opposite effect, and why you need to ask your friends for their assessment of your significant other's personality, rather than only assessing it yourself. We also get into the importance of your partner's attachment style, which they learned in childhood, and two red flags to look for in your relationship. <br /><br />These insights will prove super useful for those in the dating scene, but will also be of interest to those already in long-term relationships, in either affirming the wisdom of your choice of partner, or helping you identify issues that may be sabotaging your relationship and can still be addressed.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/love\">aom.is/love</a>.</p>\n",
