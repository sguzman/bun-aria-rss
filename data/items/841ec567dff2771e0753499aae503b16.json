I've been brainstorming a variety of ways to do this. Back when I started the site, for instance, GRS had two regular features that highlighted the community of readers.</p>\n<p>First, there was an ongoing &#8220;Ask the Readers&#8221; column in which real-world readers presented questions and dilemmas for discussion. This was an opportunity for folks to seek advice from the community at large. Here are some actual past questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120306182309/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/02/04/ask-the-readers-how-do-i-motivate-my-boyfriend-to-save-money/\">Ask the Readers: How do I motivate my boyfriend to save money?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120306211315/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/11/12/ask-the-readers-how-can-we-afford-to-buy-a-house/\">Ask the readers: How can we afford to buy a house?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120306215135/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/04/10/ask-the-readers-wheres-the-fun-in-personal-finance/\">Ask the Readers: Where's the fun in personal finance?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second, there was a regular &#8220;Reader Stories&#8221; column in which people like you shared financial anecdotes from their lives. These stories were often tales of success but could also be interesting how-to articles. Here are a few past reader stories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120329190625/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2012/03/18/reader-story-i-quit-my-passion-and-took-a-boring-job/\">&#8220;Reader Story: I quit my passion and took a boring job.&#8221;</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120401041219/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2012/02/19/reader-story-i-fought-the-law-and-the-law-won/\">Reader Story: I fought the law (and the law won).</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120417225343/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/02/20/reader-story-sailing-away-from-the-american-dream/\">Reader Story: Sailing away from the American Dream.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to bring these features back. Perhaps they won't be weekly as they used to. Maybe they'll only be monthly. It doesn't matter. What's important here is that it's an opportunity for Get Rich Slowly to be about more than just me. It's a chance for the site to help everyone get better with money.</p>\n<p>To that end: <strong>If you have a financial question or money dilemma that you'd like help with, drop me a line.</strong> I'll work with you to craft a question for the GRS community. Similarly, <strong>if you have a money story you feel like sharing with everyone, send it in</strong>.</p>\n<h2>How to Submit a Story or Question</h2>\n<p>If <em>you</em> would like to share your story, or if you’d like to ask a question, please keep these guidelines in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your story doesn’t have to be an example of what to do <em>right</em> with money, but be aware that other readers can get cranky with folks they think are making dumb decisions. If you think you can handle negative comments, then go ahead and share examples of what <em>not</em> to do.</li>\n<li>Keep things entertaining! Write naturally, as if you were sending an e-mail to a friend. Don’t try to gussy it up for Get Rich Slowly. I’ll help edit things so they’re presentable.</li>\n<li>People don't like bankruptcy and “I ran away from debt” stories. Your story can still have these elements, but try not to make them the focus. If your story is, “I got out of debt by declaring bankruptcy”, it’ll go near the bottom of the stack.</li>\n<li>Length doesn’t matter (your story can be long or short). You don’t have to put the story in MS Word or any other format. Just type it up and send it over to jdroth@getrichslowly (dot-org, not dot-com).</li>\n<li>If you need to be anonymous for whatever reason, be sure to specify that. Also, I'm happy to link to your website, but I will <em>not</em> run questions or stories that are blatant ploys at self-promotion. If what you send me is clearly meant to be an ad, you're just going to piss me off. It won't get published and I probably won't even reply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, please: Send me your stories and questions. I look forward to reading them, and to sharing the best with your fellow GRS readers.</p>\n<div id=\"mediavine-settings\" data-blacklist-content-desktop=\"1\" data-blacklist-content-mobile=\"1\"></div>\n",
