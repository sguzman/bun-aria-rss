  "description": "The birth of the modern-day NBA is often attributed to Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and David Stern. In From Hang Time to Prime Time: Business, Entertainment, and the Birth of the Modern-Day NBA (Atria Books, 2020), Pete Croatto pays homage to those legendary figures, while putting their contributions to the game in the context of some of the cultural, business and technological forces that built the NBA into a pop culture juggernaut. Croatto examines how the ABA/NBA merger, CBS’s personality-driven coverage of key players, the expansion of cable television, the emergence of hip-hop culture and a brilliant marketing team at NBA Entertainment transformed a fledgling league searching for its identity into a global phenomenon.\nThe breadth and depth of this thoroughly researched book (Croatto interviewed over 300 sources) is staggering, and yet, the author managed to present the narrative in a breezy, easy to read narrative. From Hang Time to Prime Time has something for everyone, appealing to die-hard and casual basketball fans alike. The reader will learn about building a business, marketing a product, music, fashion, technology and more.\nPaul Knepper was born and raised in New York and currently resides in Austin. His first book, The Knicks of the Nineties: Ewing, Oakley, Starks and the Brawlers Who Almost Won It All, is available on Amazon and other sites.
