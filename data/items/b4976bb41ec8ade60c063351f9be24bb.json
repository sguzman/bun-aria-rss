  "description": "<p>Since we’re all spending a lot more time indoors, getting to know our kitchens a little better and not going to restaurants, we’re particularly happy to have Beth Moncel joining us today. Before Beth was a food blogger, she was a microbiologist after earning a degree in nutritional science. Now, she has a massively popular site called Budget Bytes where you can find simple, delicious recipes that are designed for folks with small budgets. Beth has published a cookbook and she has developed a really cool mobile app as she continues to help others discover the joy of cooking while saving money. After housing and transportation, for most of us food is our next biggest expense every month so we’re excited to talk with an expert who sits at the intersection of food and money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Whimsical Nature by Phase Three Brewing - thanks to Doug for sending this one our way!
