  "description": "<p>*Trigger Warning: This episode brings up conversations that could be triggering for some. Please proceed with caution. On this week's episode we revisit previous conversation involving race, police brutality and the use of the N-word amongst other POC. Mandii relives her traumatic experience in London where she realizes the PTSD from police brutality in America (Ep109), Weezy goes off on a white listener who wrote in regarding feeling \"socioeconomically\" effected by a previous black sex worker and her experience with white supremacy (Ep41) and for many, a large portion of a bonus episode featuring Brianda from the Super Trip Talk Podcast discusses colorism in the latinX community, the use of the N word along with inclusivity as it pertains to the WD audience.
