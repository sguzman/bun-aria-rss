  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Chapter Eleven - “Keeping Up Appearances.” Luke 12:1-7. Today we’re further unpacking Jesus’s teaching on hypocrisy and how we are to live in it. How does Jesus define it, in totality? What examples does he give and what are the implications? What role does faith play? How does the metaphor of marriage play into this? What was Jesus’s instructions to the layperson regarding the Pharisees? What impact does this have on American Evangelicalism and how many of us were raised? And more importantly, how can this change for future generations of Jesus followers? How can the Kingdom be manifested and known now and going forward? What is our role as citizens? \n\nThis is still the beginning of the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
