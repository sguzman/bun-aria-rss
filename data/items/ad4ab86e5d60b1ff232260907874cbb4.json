  "title": "Cynthia Bond: “Ruby” (An Oprah’s Book Club Selection)",
  "description": "<p>New York Times best-selling author Cynthia Bond discusses her first novel, “Ruby,” which is an Oprah’s Book Club choice. Cynthia says that as an adult she was flooded with painful memories of sexual abuse from her childhood. She found healing in a writing class and her work there eventually led to the idea for the novel that would take her 10 years to complete. “Ruby” was finally published in 2014. Cynthia says the message she wants to share in her book is about survival. \"The lesson is that it is possible to not just survive anything, but it is possible to be a victor,” she says. “It is possible to be victorious over any obstacle. And that's something I know in my marrow. I know in my bones.\" Cynthia also talks about her years of teaching writing classes to the homeless and at-risk youth throughout the Los Angeles area.</p>\n",
