  "description": "Build IRONCLAD discipline in this FREE workshop: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3RFH0Vh\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3RFH0Vh</a><br /><br />On Today's Episode:<br /><br />Understanding what cryptocurrency, NFTs and blockchain are is still being missed by so many people. However, the opportunity being presented by cryptocurrency and NFTs is so much more than investing. Even if you don’t understand much of this as of today, try to view this crypto conversation through the lens of being an opportunity parallel to what the internet was in 1997 when it first started to gain traction. Think of the first AOL commercials and the buzz and excitement you may have experienced from that. <br /><br />Now imagine 2 things. One, imagine getting the opportunity to invest in the “internet” or an internet based company at that time. It’s probably fair to say you wouldn’t have much need to punch a clock now. The other thing to imagine is, how much the internet as a technology has advanced cell phones, businesses, the way we interact and communicate with the entire world. That scenario is quite possibly the same kind of  opportunity you are living through right now with NFTs, bitcoin, ethereum, and blockchain. <br /><br />This is a technology that is being adopted faster than any other technology ever was, and it’s an opportunity that’s going to disrupt life, business, and humanity forever. Why this content is being brought to you, is to serve as a red flag and get your attention to at least do your research and learn about what this is so you can make informed decisions going forward. In this video, Tom is answering more questions and laying out what you need to do step-by-step.<br /> <br />Steps to Research NFTs:<br />1. Learn about this technology so you can think from first principles.<br />2. Start with any words you know, bitcoin, crypto, NFTs, etc. and start learning terminology.<br />3. Figure out who the different players are in the crypto and NFT space.<br />4. Venture down the rabbit hole to gain expertise, follow them and engage.<br />5.
