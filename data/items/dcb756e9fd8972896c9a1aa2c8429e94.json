Great jobs, money in the bank, and a beautiful home, in a safe, leafy neighborhood. They appear to be on top of the world, until one night, the combination of burnt baked ziti, and an apparent invasion of body swapping enemy space alien vampires, who need to be thwarted, cause chaos to reign in this otherwise serene home. The murder is unimaginably horrible, giving even the investigators nightmares, for years to come.
