  "description": "<p>Jacob is that very ancient figure in the book of Genesis and yet an incredibly modern figure. Jacob is a man with an inner vacuum, an inner emptiness. Although he has begun his relationship with God, that does not immediately create a full remedy for his inner emptiness. </p>\n<p>People with an inner emptiness have a tendency to give themselves to the hope that out there somewhere there is that right person, that he or she who is somehow going to make their life right and going to fix it, but what we’re going to see here are three things. First of all, we’re going to see what is behind that hope for one true love. Secondly, we’re going to see the disillusionment that generally accompanies that hope for one true love, and lastly, what will actually fulfill that hope. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on November 11, 2011. Series: The Gospel According to Jacob. Scripture: Genesis 29:15-35.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
