  "description": "<p>While stocks rise in the long run, this week reminded investors that stocks go <em>down</em> faster than they go up.  Ron Gross, David Kretzmann, and Jason Moser analyze what happened, how emotions can get the better of us, and what investors can do to prepare for the next drop. We also share why we’d be ok if Twilio, Match Group, Visa, Mastercard, and Idexx Laboratories fell some more next week. Square needs a new CFO, Sears a miracle, and we dip into the Fool Mailbag to discuss both cannabis and Coca-Cola. Plus, cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier talks about the growing challenge of hacking and his new book <em>Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World</em>.</p> <p><br /> Thanks to LinkedIn for supporting The Motley Fool.  Go to <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/fool\">https://www.linkedin.com/fool</a> and get $50 off your first job post.</p>",
