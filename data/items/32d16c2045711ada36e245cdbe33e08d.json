  "description": "This book seeks to shed some light on the elements that go into creating works that last the test of time. From the inception of the idea to its completion and marketing, this book covers all angles if you want to put yourself into a position to create a perennial seller. As a person you loves to create, I found this book valuable as a way manual to create long-lasting products. The appealing factor was as much as you believe that luck plays a factor, as it should, to create a perennial seller the creator must have a detailed approach from the beginning if they want to be successful. Luck seldom plays a significant role as many continue to believe. This book is for those wishing to create works that will last far beyond when they continue to live. If you fit into that category, then I highly suggest you read this book. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
