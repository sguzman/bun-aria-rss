  "description": "<p>Dorie Greenspan thought she was finished writing cookbooks. She had published her 13th book—“a baker’s dozen,” she joked—but a suggestion that she do a savory baking book was enough to get her excited and inspired. The result, <i>Baking With Dorie</i>, was recently released and it’s not the savory-only work she thought she would produce. “I just couldn’t stay away from desserts,” she says. Interviewing Dorie is baker Umber Ahmad, the owner of <a href=\"https://mahzedahrbakery.com/\">Mah-Ze-Dahr Bakery</a>, which has locations in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia. </p><p>Their chat took place during the Cherry Bombe Cooks & Books conference, held at <a href=\"https://acehotel.com/brooklyn/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8p2MBhCiARIsADDUFVEtKKX64Yozn3_GvMVlFvOXp1-I02Zb3k9UTXnXMvjevTaFYxoyTm0aAk0iEALw_wcB\">Ace Hotel Brooklyn</a>.
