  "title": "The Past, Present, and Future of EMO (with Allegra Frank)",
  "description": "Nate doesn’t know much about the musical style known as emo. Sadly, he was too busy nerding out on jazz during his youthful years to catch the moment. That’s a shame, because emo is experiencing a revival right now - most surprisingly within the world of hip hop. All of which leaves Nate in the awkward position of not really having any idea what’s going on, so thank goodness for some schooling by Vox culture reporter Allegra Frank, who spent her teenage years the right way: getting emotional to the soundtrack of emo. Her first lesson about this endlessly fascinating subculture? It’s way more than just a sound. \n\nSongs discussed:\nSunny Day Real Estate - Seven\nJawbreaker - Do You Still Hate Me?!\nMy Chemical Romance - I’m Not Okay (I Promise)\nFall Out Boy - Sugar, We’re Goin Down\nPanic! At the Disco - I Write Sins not Tragedies\nJimmy Eat World - Lucky Denver Mint\nJimmy Eat World - A Praise Chorus\nJimmy Eat World - The Middle\nAmerican Football - Never Meant\nFoxing - Lich My Prince \nThe World is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die - Heartbeat in the Brain\n\nCheck out more of Allegra’s work here: https://www.vox.com/authors/allegra-frank\nAnd learn more about Tom Mullen and Washed Out Emo here: http://www.washedupemo.com/about\nLearn more about your ad choices.
