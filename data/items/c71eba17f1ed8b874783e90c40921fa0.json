He even stuck a fish hook through his cheek and put fireworks where they should never go. Don't get me started on what he's done with a stapler.</p><p>Ever since he snatched a video camera from his father's closet at age 15, Steve-O has lived for attention. And the Jackass&nbsp;star&nbsp;learned early and often that public adulation escalated in lock step with the outrageousness of his behavior.</p><p>The equation was simple: the further he pushed the envelope, the more America's favorite prankster felt loved and alive.</p><p>Insanity ensues.</p><p>Still, it wasn't enough. It would never be enough. An insatiable hunger for wholeness that could never be sated. A spiritual hole he almost died trying to fill — first through external validation, then through substances. As insanely dangerous as his stunts had become, it was drugs and alcohol that ultimately brought Steve to his knees. To the brink of death. To the psych ward. To sobriety.</p><p>It was March of 2008. A moment that broke him. A moment that saved him.</p><br><p>Let's back up.</p><p>Steve-O knows how to play the idiot.</p><p>But Stephen Glover is no moron.</p><p>Growing up in five countries fluently speaking three languages, Steve has maintained household name status for almost two decades in an industry famous for it's flash in the pans and also rans. He's starred in a variety of television shows and movies, including (of course) three global blockbuster installments of&nbsp;Jackass. Sober since 2008, he wrote the New York Times bestselling memoir <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401310796/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1401310796&linkCode=as2&tag=ricroloffweb-20&linkId=QVSMJTBXBOYT42ZE\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Idiot*,</a> then&nbsp;reinvented himself as a successful stand-up comedian. On the heels of his recently released Showtime special <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/steveoguiltyascharged\" target=\"_blank\">Guilty As Charged,</a> Steve has&nbsp;taken&nbsp;his unique blend of comedy, stunts, stories and performance art on the road, selling out venues across across the globe.</p><p>I've known Steve&nbsp;for over seven years. When the camera is off, he's far more grounded than you might imagine. Surprisingly self-aware, present, generous and contemplative are just a few descriptors that spring to mind.</p><p>That's the Steve I'm interested in.</p><p>So this week we go beyond Steve-O to meet&nbsp;Stephen Glover —&nbsp;the human being behind the&nbsp;clown, comedian, stunt man and provocateur.</p><p>The best part?
