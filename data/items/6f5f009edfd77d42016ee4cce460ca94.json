Future BonusCasts like this one will be offered as exclusive content to those pledging $5 a month or above. For the price of a cup of coffee, you can help keep the History Goes Bump Podcast in production and growing. Our goal would be to bring you at least 10 episodes a month on the free feed and lots of other fun stuff like contests and virtual ghost tours on video or through Periscope.</p> <p>On this BonusCast, Diane shares an interview she conducted with writer Robert Schneck a couple of years ago about his story, \"The Bridge to Body Island,\" which features the legend of the Bye Bye Man. This story is the inspiration for a supernatural Hollywood thriller set to be released in 2016. Enjoy!</p>",
