  "description": "Dr. Shawn Baker is an extraordinarily accomplished athlete, but he is best known as one of the foremost advocates of the carnivore diet. On this episode of Health Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Shawn Baker addresses the controversy surrounding the carnivore diet, and perhaps surprisingly, does not advocate that every single person ought to go full carnivore. But he does explain the evolutionary logic behind the carnivore diet, describes its benefits, and makes a strong case that people need to take responsibility for their own health instead of delegating that responsibility to professionals.
