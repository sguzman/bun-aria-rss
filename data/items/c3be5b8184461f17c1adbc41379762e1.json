  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, a Hezbollah scout scoped out New York City sites in order to later attack them. Today, charges were filed against Alexi Saab, who is now a U.S Citizen, had in his possession surveillance videos of NYC targets like George Washington Bridge, the Empire State Building, and Herald Square dating back to 2003. Saab had extensive bomb-making training and weapons in his Morristown, New Jersey home. Hezbollah takes their orders from Iran, yet the pro-Iran wing of the Republican Party led by Sen. Rand Paul remains silent. A planned attack on U.S soil from within and we still have people saying that we shouldn't get into any conflict with Iran — even though they are here spying, and plotting to kill us! Then, the Washington Post is pushing another pseudo-event today, this time claiming that whistle-blowers have overheard President Trump speaking with other world leaders. Later, 2020 candidate Andrew Yang says Americans have \"gotten dumber\" because they're stressed out. Finally, a recap of Mark’s speech at the Stop Socialism Choose Freedom Rally in Washington DC earlier today.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
