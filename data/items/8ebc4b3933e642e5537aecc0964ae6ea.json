  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game including watching the Manning Cast and how the Cowboys look to be firing on all cylinders and how the Eagles might not be as good as everyone thought they were after week 1, and look ahead to this weekend's Sunday Night Football game in Tom Brady's first time back in Foxborough since he left, how big of a game it is for Mac Jones, and much more. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk fresh off a :37 second comeback drive to lead the Packers to victory on Sunday Night Football in San Francisco, is the defending MVP, Aaron Rodgers Book Club founder, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about the incredible win in San Francisco, that last drive, what Coach LaFleur's demeanor was like and the \"cold handshake\" between him and Kyle Shanahan, drawing up that play on the final drive during the week in practice, and everything else from a crazy week 3, before unveiling the new book for this week's book club (41:12-1:25:26).  Later, coming off a great team win against the Chiefs in Kansas City, Running Back for the Los Angeles Chargers, Austin Ekeler joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about the big win this last weekend, why Brandon Staley is such a good coach and how things seem different around the building, how he knows Justin Herbert is a dude, acknowledging that there is a battle to be the team of Los Angeles right now and what SoFi Stadium is like, and if he's always had a 12 pack (1:29:13-1:45:46).
