  "description": "Media juggernauts Marc Maron and Tom Scharpling join forces once again, this time to save not only themselves but the world as well. Along the way, they talk about Howard Stern, movie theater food, falling for advertising, sweating, and Jonah Ray’s influence on Marc’s identity. Also, we get the story of Marc’s ill-fated music career and the reason Sausage Party led to a great awakening in Tom’s life. Theme music by <a href=\"http://freemusicarchive.org/music/The_Tokeleys/Live_at_WFMU_on_Terre_Ts_Show_on_1242004/Mausoleum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Tokeleys</a>.
