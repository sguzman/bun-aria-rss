  "title": "Murder on The Orient Express by Agatha Christie",
  "description": "A classic murder mystery story, the book follows a detective Hercule Poirot as he tries to find a killer on the lavish Orient Express. The book tells the tale of thirteen strangers stranded on a train, where everyone’s a suspect. Poirot must race against time to solve the puzzle before the murderer strikes again. What Poirot finds is a common history between all the strangers on the train, which plays an integral part in the story. The writer’s style of contrasting characters leaves the reader feeling suspicious of the true killer constantly questioning what their motives might be. The suspense that Christie is able to achieve within the story is why I really enjoyed this book. Countless adaptations on screen have tried to capture this but I believe that the book holds the true power that Christie wished to achieve.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
