  "description": "In this episode of Dear Alice, we get to interview Kory Robison, a great builder that we love working with here in Utah. We often have many questions on the design side about timelines, the average cost per square foot, if you should remodel or build… Sometimes we don’t even know what questions we should be asking before starting. Today we are going to using Kory for his knowledge and figure out what we should be asking, and how to find those answers as well. <br /><br />Questions to ask before a new build or remodel 3:07<br />When to include different Players? 11:05<br />Build or Remodel? 18:31<br />Timeline for Build 22:46<br />Percentages of Builders Fees/Average Cost per Square Foot 30:24 <br /><br />“It’s probably a pretty good idea if you’re getting ready to build a home right now that you ask your builder what are his fees. Most builders should be pretty open with that information.” 32:30<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
