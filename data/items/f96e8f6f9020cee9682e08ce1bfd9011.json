  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Your genetics determine a lot about who you are—including your eye color, your blood type, and even some interesting traits like whether you can roll your tongue. Many people believe that certain health conditions, like whether you develop obesity or type 2 diabetes, are inherently genetic. However, that’s not entirely true. Our genes do play a role in our susceptibility to certain illnesses and conditions, but they are not the only factor at play.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">The good news is, we have a lot of power over how our genes are expressed, through our environment and our habits. Our guest today, Dr. Ben Lynch, is leading the charge on changing the way our society views genes. He is an epigenetic pioneer, the president of Seeking Health, and the author of <em>Dirty Genes</em>. On today’s show, Dr. Lynch is sharing interesting insights on the topic of methylation, how your genes work, and how you can optimize your health.</p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode covers topics like fertility, critical nutrients your body needs, and why certain pharmaceutical drugs are hindering your body’s natural processes. We’re going to discuss fortifying your immune system in the age of COVID-19, plus some powerful protocols you can implement to heal from prominent symptoms.
