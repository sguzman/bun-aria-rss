  "description": "<p>Supporting your local scene is an important thing for ANY type of music, especially DIY punk/hardcore. Andy Franchere is an embodiment of that. He sang for the band <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/145fkoeaFNYyhrtoFCzSdc?si=fsZCf53HQh6JSa5hFpNV5w\">Diehard Youth</a> and currently plays in <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5y27brH8TK9vfiK9vPlWEU?si=3AbzqcMjTX6viV_ta8KBzA\">Ill Communication</a> but more importantly, he is instrumental in encouraging his local scene. Andy's story may sound familiar because you most likely know someone like him, which is why I am glad to feature this discussion with him. We discuss his life as a firefighter, growing a scene and knowing your limits. Even though you may not know his bands, Andy's story will ring true to many of you.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
