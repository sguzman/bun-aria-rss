  "description": "As Raphael Dalleo demonstrates in his wide-ranging and compelling American Imperialism Undead: The Occupation of Haiti and the Rise of Caribbean Anti-colonialism (University of Virginia Press, 2016), the US occupation of Haiti reverberated throughout the Caribbean, as intellectuals and activists shaped their anti-colonial views in its shadow. Dalleo’s work recovers the important links between the reality of US military and economic power and critiques of imperialism in the work of writers including George Padmore, C.L.R. James, and Amy Jacques Garvey. In highlighting the ways the occupation of Haiti haunted Caribbean literature and politics, this book offers fresh readings of these well-known critical voices.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
