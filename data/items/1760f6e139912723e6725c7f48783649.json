Sometimes your mothers are out doing so much they have to delay doing what they love most - the Momcast.</p>\n<p>We've been shooting our pilot and trying to live thru puppyhood. Both are exhausting. PLUS we have some VERY NSFW audio on this one. This episode might seriously be a collection of some of the most sexually offensive clips we've ever played, plus a new one that's going in the vault. </p>\n<p>We review the first 10 minutes of a Steven Seagal film that is so bad, so impossibly not put together that after a 3rd viewing we're still not sure what's going on - but Stone Cold Steve Austin is in it too. </p>\n<p>You ready to Fill Her Up? We got that too. </p>\n",
