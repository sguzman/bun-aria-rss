The death toll is nearing 2,000 — and still rising — while thousands more are injured and homeless. <br/><br/>Haiti's last major earthquake was in 2010. It killed an estimated 200,000 people and injured 300,000 more. This week's quake struck farther from major population centers, but that's made search and rescue efforts challenging. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2100218/jason-beaubien\">Jason Beaubien </a>reports from Haiti where Tropical Storm Grace has made matters even worse. <br/><br/>And Haiti's ambassador to the U.S. Bocchit Edmond tells NPR's Ailsa Chang what the country needs now. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
