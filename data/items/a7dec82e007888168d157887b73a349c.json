  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>In the world of competitive sports, an athlete&rsquo;s mentality can be their best or worst friend. While we may perceive the athletes in our lives, or on our screens, as superhuman, it&rsquo;s important to remember that they are more human than super. As athletes like Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles take public steps to address and protect their mental health, it&rsquo;s imperative that we continue to create a space for athletes to feel seen and heard. This week I&rsquo;m joined by Olympic, World, and US National Champion Track and Field Sprinter Natasha Hastings. During our conversation we explored the types of pressures competitive athletes are up against and how coaches and family members can aid the athletes in their lives to suit up not just for their sport but also for their mental health. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a>&nbsp;for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Natasha</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.natashahastings.com/about.html\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natashahastings/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/natashahastings\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
