  "description": "<p>Readers? This episode is gonna be perfect for you. It's a hot, sweaty threesome of an ep with the luminous and hilarious Celeste Yim (SNL), who is a straight up film festival brat, former prodigious torrenter, and low key roast master that Matt and Bow are simply tickled to have on the damn show! On this ep, JUNO as both a script and film, and extended flowers-giving to Diablo Cody, Jennifer Garner and Elliot Page. Also, Jennifer's Body and Whip It! as underrated pieces of cinema, the moments that all the fools on this ep learned that writing was something they could even do, a Top Chef and Padma check-in, occasionally feeling shame about liking, pursuing and doing comedy, wi-fi drama that is actually compelling, and the answer to the question \"Where do we stand on 'hamburger phone' being a thing?\" All this, anger at reservation culture, how Disneyland is a struggle as of late, and an attack on sunsets by Bowen with one of the hottest takes of all time. Listen now, or you'll be S.O.L. ...... bitch!!!!!!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
