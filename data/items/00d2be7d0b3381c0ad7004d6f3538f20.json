  "description": "<p>Vinho Verde, the DOC (Denomination of Controlled Origin) Region, has made wine since Roman times. This region is one of the largest DOCs in Europe but within its boundaries there are vast differences between the nine sub regions. In this show,  Mafalda Teixeira Coelho, co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.quintadaraza.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quinta da Raza</a> and Pedro Campos, winemaker clear up a lot of the misconceptions about Vinho Verde. We learn about the terroir of this old and complex region, the various subregions, and how serious, and sometimes ageworthy wine is being produced here.</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/IMG_2383.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Mafalda Teixeira Coelho, co-owner of <a href= \"https://www.quintadaraza.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Quinta da Raza</a> and Pedro Campos, winemaker (c)Wine For Normal People </span></p> <p>In September 2021, I visited the region and I just loved the wines of <a href=\"https://www.quintadaraza.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quinta da Raza</a>, I adored Mafalda and Pedro, and I thought they were perfect representatives to tell us about their corner of this big region, in Basto, and what they are capable of making in this unique terroir.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s what we discuss in the show:</p> <ul> <li>The diversity of Vinho Verde, it’s 9 sub regions and how proximity to the sea, position in the mountains, and soil type make big differences in the grapes you can grow and the resulting wines.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/SFD_Vinho_Verde_Regional_Guide_CO_Vinho_Verde_Sub_Regions_Map_CO_Vinho_Verde_2520x1420-1536x866.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Map: Vinho Verde Commission</em></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <ul> <li>Pedro tells us about the Basto subregion, where <a href= \"https://www.quintadaraza.pt/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Quinta da Raza</a> is located.
