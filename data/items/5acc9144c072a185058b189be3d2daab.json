    "media:description": "Jake Blount, a banjo scholar, explains.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nJake Blount has built a career out of understanding the banjo‚Äôs connection to Black American folk music. In this video, he walks us through the instrument‚Äôs history ‚Äî from West Africa to enslaved people in the US to the early record industry ‚Äî to explain how Black folk music has evolved. \n\nFor example: The early record industry confined Black musicians to ‚Äúrace records‚Äù and white musicians to ‚Äúhillbilly records.‚Äù Hillbilly music would have been early country and string band music. Race records restricted Black musicians to blues and jazz genres. Which meant Black musicians playing bluegrass-style banjo weren‚Äôt recorded ‚Äî even if they were responsible for teaching white musicians.  \n\nUsing field recordings, their own banjo and fiddle skills, and a deconstructed version of one of their own songs, Jake explains how Black musicians have long been left out of the current canon of folklore recordings and American folk music history. And what he‚Äôs doing to keep the tradition alive, with fresh observations and a musical style that looks both forward and backward.  \n\nThis video was filmed on location at Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nListen to Jake Blount‚Äôs music and find his album The New Faith, here: https://jakeblount.com/\n\nJake‚Äôs website also lists resources for Black string band music.
