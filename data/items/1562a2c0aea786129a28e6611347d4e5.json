  "description": "<p>LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE. We all have greatness inside us. That’s the whole reason I started this podcast. So why do we make ourselves smaller to fit in with everyone else? Why do we hide? Why do we make excuses? Why do we let others dim our light? By denying our destiny, we create disease, conflict, and unhappiness. Shine your light. It’s not always easy. When you embrace your greatness, others will attack you. You’re challenging their “paradigm.” DO IT ANYWAYS. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I’ve combined key lessons from Teachers of The Secret: Michael Beckwith, Lisa Nichols, Jack Canfield, John Assaraf, and Bob Proctor. Michael Beckwith, Lisa Nichols, Jack Canfield, John Assaraf, and Bob Proctor are all featured in the book and movie The Secret. Michael Beckwith is a minister, author, and founder of the Agape International Spiritual Center, a New Thought church with a congregation estimated in excess of 8,000 members.  Lisa Nichols is a hugely successful entrepreneur, life coach, and CEO of one of the first publicly traded self-development companies. Jack Canfield is the co-author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, which has more than 250 titles and 500 million copies in print in over 40 languages. John Assaraf is founder of NeuroGym, has built 5 multimillion dollar companies, wrote 2 New York Times Bestselling books and is featured in 8 movies.  Bob Proctor is the best-selling author of “You Were Born Rich” and has transformed the lives of millions through his books, seminars, and courses. These teachers help us to use visualization to tell The Universe what we want. It’s not difficult, but it’s a skill many of us have never been taught. So get ready to learn how to master the Law of Attraction on Episode 836. Some Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do you deal with people trying to dim your light? (07:15)<br />\nWhat are you most proud of? (10:00)<br />\nIs there ever a place for anger? (12:00)<br />\nHow does someone discover their unique calling? (15:00)<br />\nHow can someone be positive when they’re broke and unhealthy? (22:00)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhy people attack you when you go after your dream (7:30)<br />\nHow to visualize with emotion to create cognitive dissonance (13:30)<br />\nWhy you should pursue acts of service instead of “things” (17:45)<br />\nHow negative self-talk affects the brain (19:15)<br />\nThe only two beliefs that exist (24:00)<br />\nThe fundamental truths to achieving success (26:00)<br />\nWhy so many brilliant people are not successful (36:00)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/836 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
