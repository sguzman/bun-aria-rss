  "title": "Top 25 Players Under 25: How to rank elite young QBs like Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert & Kyler Murray (Football 6/2)",
  "description": "It's that point in the offseason where you're about to get hit with a ton of lists. And here's one we'll start with: the Top 25 players in the NFL under the age of 25. Cody Benjamin joins Will Brinson to break down his rankings, including players he had too high, too low and those he got just right. As you listen, remember that guys like Patrick Mahomes, Christian McCaffrey and Josh Allen are ineligible for this list. Otherwise, they'd be at the top! Also, no rookies. You can expect Trevor Lawrence next year. After those important disclaimers (3:15), we recognize the players that barely missed (8:30), which include a crop of 2nd-year WRs like Tee Higgins and CeeDee Lamb. However, Jets OT Mekhi Becton might be the most glaring omission Cody made according to Brinson. The guys tackle 25-11 on the list before hitting the Top 10 (23:00). 4 QBs make their way into the top 8, but how are Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert and Kyler Murray slotted? What would your order be? That upper echelon also features 3 wide receivers and 3 stud defenders.
