You can find all my sources here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13chruB-Mmxc722Xxsv0Daz9pLqdX5AAI4olvvS9dq7Y/edit\n\nSome extra info:\nAt 20:47, I mention that a function is holomorphic if it satisfies the cauchy-riemann equations. This is not always true, the partial derivatives have to be continuous as well. \nFor example, f(z) = {0 if z=0, z^5/|z^4| if z!=0} satisfies the cauchy-riemann equations but is not differentiable at z=0.\nThanks to Ge for pointing this out!\n\nMistakes:\n3:15: The upper number line should still be labeled as \"x\" instead of \"x^2\"\n14:56 It should be nz^(n-1)\n\nThese animation in this video was made using 3blue1brown's library, manim:\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:53 The Real Derivative, Revisited\n4:31 Differential View\n9:17 Transformation View\n13:02 Conformality\n16:01 Cauchy-Riemann Equations\n22:15 Brilliant Ad, Stereographic Projection\n23:57 Outro, deriv of e^z\n\n\nFollow me!\nWebsite: https://vcubingx.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vcubingx\nGithub: https://github.com/vivek3141\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/vcubingx\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/vcubingx\n\nMusic (in order):\nKnowmadic - Faces\nMommy x Philantrope - Embrace\nGameChops - Route 113\nKnowmadic - Faces\nIdealism - Still\nGameChops - Azalea Town\n\nWhat does it mean to take a complex derivative?
