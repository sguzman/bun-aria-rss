In podcasting I found the opposite attitude—people helping each other out and doing whatever possible to facilitate things for other podcasters in the same field. In this spirit, today we’ll do something unique: six history podcasters cooperating, with each one tackling a segment, to create a super-episode together. As the host, yours truly will get the ball rolling setting the theme and offering some examples of ‘historical ripples’—events that end up having unforeseen consequences years, or decades, or centuries after they take place. Alexander Rader Von Sternberg (<em>History Impossible</em>) will chat about how a man who died feeling like he had failed to make his mark in history ended up—possibly more than any other—shaping the culture of several Asian civilizations. CJ Killmer (<em>Dangerous History</em>) will tackle the Bacon’s Rebellion and its ramifications. Sebastian Major (<em>Our Fake History</em>) will play with the myth and lasting impact of Homer’s telling of the Trojan War. Sam Davis (<em>Inward Empire</em>) will be discussing the impact of Henry David Thoreau’s essay Civil Disobedience on the Civil Rights Movement about a century later. And Darryl Cooper (<em>Martyrmade</em>) will make a case for the Japanese origin for suicide bombings in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">If you'd like to keep following my work on Luminary, please follow my personal link to their platform to sign up.
