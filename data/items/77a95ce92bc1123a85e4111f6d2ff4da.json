  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and other governors who made the deadly decision to commingle COVID-positive patients with the elderly and infirmed in nursing homes, should not have immunity. Why do they get a pass? Because they're Democrats. They all blame Trump for coronavirus but of course, there wouldn't be a COVID-19 vaccine but for the Trump Administration. The good thing about having a republic of states is that we can see what works and what doesn't when it comes to the coronavirus across the country. Some states haven't shut down their schools or their small businesses while others have. Later, lawmakers introduced legislation to massively increase mail-in voting. The bill is disguised as \"reform\" and election \"security\" and any pushback is viewed by the left as questioning the electoral system. It's the Democrat Party that turns diversity against the people and has historically incited hatred based on race. Afterward, MyPillow CEO, Mike Lindell, calls in to share how Twitter shut down his account. Lindell speculated that Big Tech would come after podcasters next and encouraged all Americans to stand up for liberty during this time of cancel culture.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
