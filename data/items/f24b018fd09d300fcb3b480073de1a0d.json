  "description": "<p>Ron Delsener is a working-class kid from Queens who rode his charm and his hustle all the way to the top of the music industry. He basically <em>created</em> the genre of the massive outdoor concert with his epic series of free Concerts in the Park. He landed everyone: Pavarotti, Streisand, even post-breakup Simon and Garfunkel. And Delsener is still firing on all cylinders: James Bay and Hozier are among the artists he maintains relationships with today. In his wonderfully profane and discursive conversation with Alec, Delsener delivers a full dose of the old-school Queens personality that the <em>New York Times</em> says \"radiates like a lighthouse beacon.\" Delsener's rockstar stories are great, his accent is great, and you'll leave the interview finally understanding what a concert promoter actually <em>does</em>. (Hint: it's so lucrative because it’s so high-risk.)</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
