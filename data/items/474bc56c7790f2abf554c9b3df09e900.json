  "description": "This is the end of a show that lasted longer and traveled farther than any of its hosts ever contemplated. Like most episodes themselves, that end is sudden and unexpected and may not make much sense to you. It contains answer to some questions, but not all of them, and gets bogged down with weird distractions. The moon is there, and so is Casio Dog, and the Fullcat, and Bobby Petrino. Welcome. This was the Shutdown Fullcast, and we hope you enjoyed it, because we sure as hell did.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
