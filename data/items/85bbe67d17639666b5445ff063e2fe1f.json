  "description": "<p>In this episode, we explore limitations. When - and why - is it a good idea to place limits on your work? First, we discuss the benefits of limiting ourselves in some way. That might mean limiting colours or setting rules for a certain body of work; it might mean keeping everything to one size; or it could mean limiting the media we use. But whatever parameters we set, limits can open up our creativity.&nbsp;The we look at the flip side - where might we benefit from challenging our limitations? What do we believe that might not be true? We hope this free-ranging discussion will help you to assess where limitations might fit into your practice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
