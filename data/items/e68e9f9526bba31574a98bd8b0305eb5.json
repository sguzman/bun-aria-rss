  "description": "<p>Mary Gauthier is a folk singer/songwriter whose songs have quite literally saved her life. Writing music did not come easily to Gauthier. She began abusing drugs and alcohol as a young girl growing up in Louisiana. After years of struggling with addiction, Gauthier got clean at age 27 and began frequenting open mics around Boston. She released her debut album, <em>Dixie Kitchen,</em> in 1997 and moved to Nashville not long after. She has since become known for her ability to write vivid, literary-style lyrics that pull from her past trauma, loss, and heartbreak.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Mary Gauthier about how the same determination that once drove her to drink now powers her songwriting. She also talks about how conversations with young U.S. veterans inspired her Grammy-nominated album, <em>Rifles & Rosary Beads</em>. And Gauthier recalls seeing one particularly moving open mic performance that inspired her to become the artist she is today. <strong>  </strong></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Mary Gauthier songs<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7h8Eq2lQnHoKvxyM3etejx?si=c2b689d738b844dc\"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
