Private jets to exotic locales. Rolex, cover model girlfriend and cash. Lots of cash.</p><p>But ten years living extravagantly as a decadent nightclub promoter in New York City took it's toll.</p><p>By 28, Scott Harrison had become the worst person he knew.</p><p>Morally bankrupt&nbsp;and desperate to rediscover his sense of purpose, Scott decided it was time for a drastic change. So he sold all his belongings and decamped NYC for a year spent volunteering aboard a hospital ship off the coast of Liberia, West Africa.</p><p>Abroad, Harrison witnessed levels of poverty and illness he never knew existed. As one year turned into two, he came to understand that many of the diseases their group treated were waterborne, easily preventable with access to clean drinking water —&nbsp;a basic need sorely lacking across vast swaths of the undeveloped world.</p><p>Upon returning to New York in 2006, Scott turned his full attention to the global water crisis and the (then) 1.1 billion people living without access to clean water. The manifestation of that commitment is <a href=\"http://cwtr.org/richrollspring\" target=\"_blank\">charity: water</a> — a revolutionary for-purpose endeavor that to date has raised over $3000 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 8.4 million people all across the world.</p><br><p>Equally impressive is the extent to which Scott has quite literally reinvented and re-energized how we give and how we think about giving. He did it by creating an aspirational brand. He did it by restoring public trust in charity. And he did it by leveraging technology to deeply connect each and every giver with the gift's specific result and impact.</p><p>Simply put, Scott Harrison is one of the most impressive people I have ever met. His inspiring story from lost to found is legend — an astounding example of what can be achieved when a life pivots from self-serving to selfless service.</p><p>Scott's story can be found in his riveting new memoir,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charitywater.org/thirst\" target=\"_blank\">Thirst,</a>&nbsp;which vividly recounts Scott's redemptive tale of transformation and the twists and turns that built charity:&nbsp;water into one of the most trusted, disruptive, innovative and admired nonprofits in the world.
