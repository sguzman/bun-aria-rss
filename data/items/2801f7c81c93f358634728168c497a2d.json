  "description": "Let's be honest, one of the aspects that makes the interviews on the OM3 so great is the fact that JJ and Tommy often cause the guest to dig a little deeper to answer questions and roll a bit out of their comfort zone. But somehow when Kevin Love joins the podcast, there's no need to try and pull info out of him or force delicate subjects into the mix because... well, he does that all by himself. And as usual, this interview is no different. Kevin displays his typical intelligence, humor, sarcastic wit, and basic down to earth nature as he digs into his current season with the Cavs and opens up about the team's past, present, and future. Oh, he also sticks around for the OM3 draft as they break down the worst things you can do on an airplane. Hmmm... I sense a campaign for OM3 correspondent coming on. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
