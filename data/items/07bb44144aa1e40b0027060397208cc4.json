  "description": "<p>How do you flip the switch from struggle and futility to wild, unbridled joy and success? And how does money play into that equation, if at all, as a source fuel, an outcome, or both?</p><br><p>Today's guest, Jen Sincero, started out as a musician in a band, and really thought that that would be her future. She loved the music, the creativity, the comradery of being in a band, surrounded by community. What she didn’t like, though, was the struggle that seemed embedded in the experience. She wanted the passion, but not the suffering. In addition to music, Jen started writing on the side, eventually publishing a book about her drummer, and then to a second book. And Finally, it started leading her into a deeper and deeper career in writing.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Along the way, she also realized that the life that she was living was not the life she wanted to be living. And she started doing a lot of deep, personal work that incited a personal awakening and reinvention, which then fueled her to write <em>You Are a Badass®: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</em>, which became a global phenomenon that has remained on the NY Times bestseller list for years, sold millions of copies worldwide, is available in over 40 languages, and continues to grow in popularity around the globe. Her follow-ups, <em>You Are a Badass® at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth</em> also a NY Times bestseller, <em>You Are a Badass® Every Day,</em> and <em>Badass Habits</em> are written with the same signature benevolent snark, down-to-earth humor and blunt practicality that made <em>You Are a Badass</em>® a beloved bestseller and Jen a celebrated voice in the world of self-development.</p><br><p>Her book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CICKAt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>You Are a Badass at Making Money </em></a>is the focus of today’s best of conversation. We track her journey and also we dive into this idea of personal development and money and making money.
