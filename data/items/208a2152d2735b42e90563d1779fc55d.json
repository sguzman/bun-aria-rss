  "description": "<p>Genomic signal processing has been used successfully in bioinformatics to\nanalyze biomolecular sequences and gain varied insights into DNA structure,\ngene organization, protein binding, sequence evolution, etc. But challenges\nremain in finding the appropriate spectral representation of a biomolecular\nsequence, especially when multiple variable-length sequences need to be handled\nconsistently. In this study, we address this challenge in the context of the\nwell-studied problem of classifying genomic sequences into different taxonomic\nunits (strain, phyla, order, etc.). We propose a novel technique that employs\nsignal processing in tandem with Gaussian mixture models to improve the\nspectral representation of a sequence and subsequently the taxonomic\nclassification accuracies. The sequences are first transformed into spectra,\nand projected to a subspace, where sequences belonging to different taxons are\nbetter distinguishable. Our method outperforms a similar state-of-the-art\nmethod on established benchmark datasets by an absolute margin of 6.06%\naccuracy.\n</p>",
