  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, there’s a pattern at the Justice Department under President Biden of unequal application of the law, this time with the FBI harassing pro-life groups. The left does not believe in freedom of speech, the free exercise of religion, your second amendment rights, and in many cases they do not believe in due process rights or probable cause. Also, every major civil rights bill post civil war was supported by Republicans, and either flat out opposed by all or most of the Democrats. How is it possible for someone like Robert Byrd, who filibustered the Civil Rights act for 14 hours, to be a leader in the Democrat party? People like Maya Wiley and Eric Holder are Democrats because they love big radical socialist government, not because of the party's history. Next, Biden is destroying America from within while handing Iran the keys to a nuclear weapon, but he did not sabotage the Nordstream pipeline. Russia on the other hand has every reason to do it. Putin is not a victim; he is a monster in every respect. Later, Ainsley Earhardt joins Mark to talk about her new book \"I’m So Glad You Were Born: Celebrating Who You Are.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Glad-You-Were-Born-Celebrating/dp/031077702X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2G0L6CZ49YN2C&keywords=Ainsley+Earnhardt&qid=1664375112&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=ainsley+earnhardt+%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-3\nLearn more about your ad choices.
