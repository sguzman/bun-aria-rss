Specialization allows creatives – artists, content creators, and everything in between – to carve out increasingly specific niches and build curated cultural communities. Art in all forms has an opportunity to blossom with the coordinative capacity of modern technology, and every active participant is inherently a creator. Smartphones and social media make everyone journalists, photographers, actors, and commentators simultaneously.</p> <p>With this budding paradigm, ownership of creations is paramount. The crypto industry lends itself elegantly to this need, blending creation and ownership. Web 2 has witnessed an explosion of distributed content, but centralized platforms determine the nature of how it plays out. Crypto offers a natural evolution to the creator economy, enriching the relationship between creator and community.</p> <p>This conversation takes a wide lens to the intersection of culture and the crypto industry. From MySpace to Instagram to Patreon, the ebbs & flows of internet culture and economy moves at a blistering pace. Our experienced panelists break these things down and discuss where we're going.</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Li on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ljin18?s=20\">https://twitter.com/ljin18?s=20</a> </p> <p>Jesse on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/jessewldn?s=20\">https://twitter.com/jessewldn?s=20</a> </p> <p>Cooper on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?s=20</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:30 Cooper, Li, and Jesse<br /> 7:30 What is the Creator Economy?<br /> 14:32 Evolving Creator and Community<br /> 21:31 Creator First vs. Platforms<br /> 28:35 The Internet Dream<br /> 36:16 Evolving Platforms<br /> 43:00 Sovereign Creation<br /> 47:19 DAOs and the Creator Economy<br /> 55:30 Creator Economy Platforms<br /> 59:27 Get Involved<br /> 1:02:08 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
