  "description": "In Notable New Yorkers of Manhattan’s Upper West Side: Bloomingdale-Morningside Heights (Fordham UP, 2020), Jim Mackin introduces readers to almost 600 former residents of a culturally and politically fertile slice of Manhattan wedged between Central Park and the Hudson River from the West 90s to 125th Street. The range of people he has uncovered will astonish even long-time residents of the area. Actor Dustin Hoffman, writer Dorothy Parker, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and singer Ronnie Spector are just four of the people you will meet in these pages. This thoroughly researched book, intelligently designed for both armchair browsing and walking tours, is a testament to the density of Manhattan life and the range of people and stories that can found in New York City neighborhoods.\nRobert W. Snyder, Manhattan Borough Historian and professor emeritus of American Studies and Journalism at Rutgers University, is the author of Crossing Broadway: Washington Heights and the Promise of New York and co-author of All the Nations Under Heaven: Immigrants, Migrants and the Making of New York.
