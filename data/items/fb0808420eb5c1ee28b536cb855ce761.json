  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the Bucs bringing most of the band back together, and all the other pertinent things happening in the NFL. Also joining the show is arguably the greatest climber in the world, the subject of the 2018 Oscar winning documentary <i>Free Solo, </i>Alex Honnold, to chat about truly being one of one, his life climbing these insane walls, his new podcast, why he won't be competing on American Ninja Warrior, his thoughts on climbing coming to the Olympics, and much more in one of the most fascinating interviews you'll hear (21:32-49:21). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2016 NFL rushing TD's leader, 8 year NFL veteran, LeGarrette Blount joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his new CBD business, what he thinks of the Patriots spending all this money, if Carson Wentz is a dude, if he thinks anyone can fill Bill Belichick's shoes, and more (51:06-1:13:27). To close out the show, Pat and AJ blaze through everything going on in the NFL currently, and chat more about the Alex Honnold conversation (1:15:08-1:33:30).
