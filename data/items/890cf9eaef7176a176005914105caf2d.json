All I saw was solid black against the whites. It wasn’t natural. It was… creepy, unnerving, demonic.\"</em> - Detective Paula May This is the horrific story of L.C. Underwood, a man who arrogantly evaded justice for his heinous crimes until Detective Paula May and her investigative team uncovered who he really was. Because of their efforts, he was convicted for First Degree Kidnapping and Murder of Viktor Gunnarsson, Kay’s new boyfriend. But was Underwood also responsible for the brutal murder of Catherine Miller that occurred mere days after Gunnarsson’s demise?<br>\n<br>\nSentenced to life in prison plus forty years, Underwood has no intention of staying in prison and vows not to stop until he exacts revenge on those he blames for his current predicament. His thirst for revenge will not be quenched until more blood is shed. Underwood rages on, plotting his next move, enlisting others to perform the evil deeds he imagines. Wreaking havoc in the lives of Kay, Jason, Detective May, and others, he sends them all on an emotional roller coaster ride that never seems to end. </p>\n\n<p><br>\nGet the new book here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/3y93Xan&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw27Se3tbAz6DWU3_l5pNmP4\">https://amzn.to/3y93Xan</a><br>\n<br>\nGet the first in the series here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/3xcOlRT&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw22Wd6aQR4os4oK9NR1UijR\">https://amzn.to/3xcOlRT</a></p>\n\n<p>Subscribe to Darkness Radio's True Crime Tuesday here:  <a href=\"https://www.stitcherpremium.com/darkness\">stitcherpremium.com/darkness</a> </p>\n\n<p>Use code: DARKNESSRADIO at checkout for a special year long savings!  </p>\n",
