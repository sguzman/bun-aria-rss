  "description": "<p>Does the fear of ‘no’ keep you from creating something new? Are you afraid you may waste time pursuing the wrong things if you really go for it? It can be scary to step into a new opportunity, especially when you feel your path isn’t very ‘linear.’ Wouldn’t it be easier if everything made sense from the beginning?! In this episode, Jordan brings on award-winning social entrepreneur, CEO of the fashion impact brand, Noonday Collection, and author of Imperfect Courage, Jessica Honegger, to remind us all of what it means to make steps forward even when the fear is still present – and even when we don’t have a clear picture of what’s next. You’ll learn the importance of deciding right now that your 'why' is worth the risk, why you need to define what your end goal of success looks like for you, and the Sisterhood Effect mindset you need to adapt ASAP. Sister, if you’ve ever found yourself frozen by fear or paralyzed by the unknown, pull up a seat and borrow some courage from Jessica and Jordan to step into that open door built just for you.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details:</p>  <p>Jordan's Book: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/book\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p>  <p>Jessica Honegger Link: <a href=\"https://jessicahonegger.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://jessicahonegger.com</a></p>\n",
