  "title": "Creating a Data-Driven Organization: the book",
  "content": "I am pleased to announce that I am currently under contract with <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/\">O'Reilly</a>&nbsp;to write a book on \"Creating a Data-Driven Organization.\" It is still at the early stages but should be out next year.<br /><br />This is a great opportunity to go deep into what it means to be data-driven and to think about how organizations best achive that goal. I'll cover the infrastructure, skills, and culture needed to create organizations that take their data, treat it as a core asset, and use it to drive and inform critical business decisions and ultimately make an impact.<br /><br />So far, it has been a lot of fun. I've read and learned a ton and can't wait to share.<br /><br />No word yet on which animal will appear on the cover...<br /><br />",
