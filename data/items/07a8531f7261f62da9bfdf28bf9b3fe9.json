  "description": "<p>Leona Kinsey disappeared from La Grande, Oregon, on October 25, 1999. A friend last saw Leona at a local Walmart. According to her friend, Leona said she planned to meet someone at a nearby grocery store and then stop by her friend's house around 7 PM that night. Leona never showed up at her friend's house and was never seen again. Her friend became concerned and later went to check on Leona. She found that Leona wasn't home, and her pets weren't cared for in a way that Leona would have if she planned to leave for any amount of time. She decided it was time to alert the police that Leona was missing, and that was the beginning of the long search for answers as to what happened to Leona.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about Leona Kinsey's disappearance, please call the La Grande Police Department at (541) 963-1017.
