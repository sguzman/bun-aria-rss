  "description": "Steve Keen and Phil Dobbie had very different ideas about Brexit a few years ago. Now they both agree it’s a vote that should never have happened? So, is it the impact of tariffs?? Is it the impact on foreign investment? Is it impacts on the supply chain? No, many of those things, Steve believes, will be overcome.

Now they agree on one thing, Brexit will never happen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
