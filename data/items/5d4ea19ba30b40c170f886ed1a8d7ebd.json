  "description": "<p><em>The American designer discusses the power of many businesses to be advocates for change.</em></p> <p> </p> The last few years have offered Tory Burch, founder of her namesake womenswear label, time to focus less on business and more on design, particularly since her husband Pierre-Yves Roussel took on the role of chief executive in 2018. Now, the pandemic is giving her even more time to focus on perfecting product, a rare silver lining of an otherwise challenging situation.   In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks speaks with Burch about her activist-focused approach to business and how the last 10 months have shaped her fashion label.   <ul> <li>Restriction is a crucial component of creativity. To Burch, the travel restrictions and social distancing measures have opened new avenues of creativity, fostering agility and resourcefulness. “One thing that’s happened because of lockdown is it makes you stand still,” said Burch. “To be able to be in one place has been really transformative on many levels.”</li> <li>Burch emphasises that what constitutes luxury needs to be reconsidered. “I really believe luxury isn’t about a price point, and I think that’s relatable particularly today,” she said. “How do you design beautiful things that are timeless and that will last? That’s what I’ve been thinking about,” she said, adding that having time to spend is the ultimate luxury.</li> <li>Through the Tory Burch Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to advancing women’s empowerment, Burch is finding new avenues through which to support women and help them weather the coronavirus crisis. “Its horrendous for women right now,” said Burch. “They are taking care of children at a much higher rate than men. We have had to help many women figure out how to take out PPP loans… We had to pivot to really be a resource for women.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/tory-burch-names-pierre-yves-roussel-ceo'> Tory Burch Names Pierre-Yves Roussel CEO</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-week/independent-women-spring-summer-2021-stella-mccartney-sacai-chitose-abe-tory-burch'> Independent Women Brought Hope to Fashion’s Virtual Spring</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-week/visual-metaphors-at-tory-burch'> Visual Metaphors at Tory Burch</a></p>     <em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
