What is money? What is value? What are the characteristics of a good society? In our conversation with Luke Burgis, we dive even deeper: what drives our basic desires and behaviors? Luke makes an incredibly compelling argument that the root of our wants and perceived needs derive from Mimetic Desire -- the idea that we look to others and mimic what they do.</p> <p>Mimetic desire appears to emerge among all successful social species. As humans, we learn how to exist in a society by observing and processing those around us. Our parents, friends, and communities at large all collectively inform how we perceive the world around us. In this model, the individual melts away, and instead, we become interdependent nodes in a network of ideas, ideologies, actions, and behaviors. We often want things because others want them. Although rationality certainly plays a role, it takes a back seat to the more immediate and salient driving forces of mimesis.</p> <p>How does this relate to crypto in particular? Well, mimesis certainly drives the patterns we find in markets: speculation and adoption are both functions of mimetic desires. This model also applies more broadly when we consider the coordinative power of the internet and blockchains. If we accept mimesis on the aggregate and individual scale, we can more fully grasp the scale and scope of these new social and economic technologies.</p> <p>Hot off the release of his book 'Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life,' Luke is fascinated by the potential of blockchains to revolutionize how we interact and function as a species and society. However, Mimetic Desire won't be going anywhere anytime soon.</p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 6:50 Luke Burgis<br /> 9:05 What is Mimetic Desire?<br /> 16:25 Modeling Desire<br /> 23:35 Coping with Abundance<br /> 27:19 Collective, Shared Desires<br /> 31:30 Genes & Memes<br /> 37:25 Mimetic Desire & Memes<br /> 45:20 Subjective Scarcity & Rivalries<br /> 54:24 The Internet & Mimetic Desire<br /> 1:01:00 Bitcoin and The Role of Money<br /> 1:12:10 Wealth is What You Want<br /> 1:17:43 Markets, Bubbles, Mania<br /> 1:26:58 Rivalrous Communities<br /> 1:33:00 Mimetic Bubbles & Reflexivity<br /> 1:39:45 Algorithms Determining Outcomes<br /> 1:43:49 Legitimacy<br /> 1:48:40 What about Rationality?<br /> 1:52:22 The Take on Crypto<br /> 1:55:20 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Luke on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/lukeburgis?s=20\">https://twitter.com/lukeburgis?s=20</a> <br />  Luke’s Newsletter<br /> <a href= \"https://read.lukeburgis.com/\">https://read.lukeburgis.com/</a> <br />  Wanting on Amazon<br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Wanting-Power-Mimetic-Desire-Everyday/dp/1250262488/\"> https://www.amazon.com/Wanting-Power-Mimetic-Desire-Everyday/dp/1250262488/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
