  "description": "'Arizona Cardinals quarterback' is the easy way to describe Brett Hundley, but he's way more than that. A world traveler and full-time photographer (on top of his day job), Hundley's interests go beyond football. In this conversation with Will Brinson, Hundley details his epic offseason trip that was cut short due to COVID-19. He also talks football, including the Cardinals addition of DeAndre Hopkins, Kliff Kingsbury's offense and the growth of Kyler Murray. Brett also discusses the difficulty of learning Mike McCarthy's system (from his time with the Packers) and why a limited offseason could pose problems for the Cowboys.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod @WillBrinson, @bretthundley7\nSCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
