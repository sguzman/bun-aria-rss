  "description": "<p>Jack Dorsey says he can “understand” if current and former Twitter employees blame him for the state of the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html\"><ins>under Elon Musk</ins></a>. The co-founder and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html\"><ins>former CEO</ins></a> of Twitter took to the platform on Saturday to say he was to blame for the situation. “Folks at Twitter past and present are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment,” Dorsey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1588913276980633600?s=20&t=vdB9K7iLmhXQCuuTRoSWTw\"><ins>said on Saturday</ins></a>. “I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.”</p><div id=\"0291f88b3e8046e88309a548e94cccbd\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Folks at Twitter past and present are strong and resilient.

I apologize for that.</p>— jack (@jack) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1588913276980633600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Dorsey went on to add he was grateful to everyone who had ever worked at Twitter. “I don’t expect that to be mutual in this moment… or ever… and I understand,” he wrote. Dorsey posted the apology after <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/11/05/jack-dorsey-source-everyone-at-twitter-hates-him-now/\"><em><ins>The New York Post</ins></em></a> published a story earlier in the day claiming he is now “hated at Twitter.” Many employees reportedly “blame” him for Musk’s takeover and the company-wide layoffs that will see about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-layoffs-010148183.html\">50 percent of Twitter’s workforce cut</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The thread marks Dorsey’s first public comment on Twitter since Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy the company on October 27th. When the SpaceX founder first announced the takeover, Dorsey put his support behind it. “Elon is the singular solution I trust,” <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-elon-musk-twitter-takeover-034408777.html\"><ins>he said at the time</ins></a>. “This is the right path… I believe it with all my heart.” Dorsey was quiet after Musk attempted to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-messages-jack-dorsey-parag-agrawal-000254423.html\"><ins>renege on the acquisition</ins></a>, but in texts that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-messages-jack-dorsey-parag-agrawal-000254423.html\"><ins>became public in September</ins></a>, it became clear that he had wanted Musk to take a more active role at Twitter for some time.</p>",
