Unfortunately, it’s not so simple. And a black and white approach to diet can be dangerous not only for our individual nutritional needs, but it can slow much-needed progress when it comes to truly supporting and protecting our environment. There’s no doubt that factory farming should be illegal, but that is a far cry from stating that all meat is bad. Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> I’m thrilled to sit down with Diana Rodgers and Robb Wolf to talk about the nuances of regeneratively raised meat and how it can reverse climate change, support better health for those that eat it, and provide natural and caring conditions for the animals it involves.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Robb Wolf, a former research biochemist, is the two-time <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Wall Street Journal </em>bestselling author of <em>The Paleo Solution </em>and <em>Wired to Eat</em>. Robb is the co-founder of The Healthy Rebellion, a social movement with the goal of liberating 1 million people from the sick-care system. Robb is the executive producer of the film <em>Sacred Cow</em>. Diana Rodgers, RD, is a “real food” nutritionist living on a working organic farm near Boston, Massachusetts. She’s an author, runs a clinical nutrition practice, hosts the <em>Sustainable Dish Podcast</em>, and is an advisory board member of Animal Welfare Approved and Savory Institute. Her new book, <em>Sacred Cow: The Case For Better Meat</em>, just launched, and the <em>Sacred Cow</em> film she directed and produced will be out later this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Tushy, ButcherBox, and chili.</p><br><p>The Tushy bidet is a sleek attachment that clips onto your existing toilet and connects to the water supply behind your toilet to spray you with clean, fresh water. And it’s really affordable, starting at only $79. Right now Tushy is offering Doctor’s Farmacy listeners 10% off, too, so it’s a better time than ever to make the switch to a bidet. Just go to <a href=\"https://hellotushy.com/pages/mark-hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hellotushy.com/HYMAN</a>.&nbsp;</p><br><p>ButcherBox makes it super easy to get humanely raised meat that you can trust delivered right to your doorstep. ButcherBox is now gradually welcoming new customers due to increased demand, but only if you’re on the waitlist! So reserve your spot today at <a href=\"https://www.butcherbox.com/FARMACY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ButcherBox.com/farmacy</a>, and you’ll get an email when they’re ready to take your order.&nbsp;</p><br><p>One of the easiest and most effective ways to get better sleep every single night is through temperature regulation, which is why I was so relieved to discover the transformative products from chili. The chiliPAD and OOLER system are two really cool gadgets that fit over the top of your mattress and use water to control the temperature of your bed—which helps lower your internal temperature and trigger deep relaxing sleep. Right now chili is offering my audience a really great deal.
