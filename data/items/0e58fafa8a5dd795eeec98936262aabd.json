  "description": "In Episode #227, I sit down with Alan Flanagan, PhD and Drew Harrisberg to discuss the carnivore diet and veganism, assessing many of the popular claims made by health and nutrition “influencers”. We discuss Big Pharma, social media censorship, and vegan protein intake. We also zoom in on the ethics of veganism, spotting a legitimate academic, and why socioeconomic and environmental factors impact nutrition decisions.\nIn the current social media climate, it is crucial that we develop the skills necessary to analyse the validity of nutritional claims.
