  "description": "In this third episode of _[Scary Stories Told in the Dark](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/shows/scary-stories-told-in-the-dark/)_, we bring you two terrifying tales from an anonymous author and [Christopher Gideon](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/authors/christopher-gideon/), performed by host and narrator [Otis Jiry](http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/performers/otis-jiry/), about both sides of the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) coin, and the abject fear that one can experience both being the creation, as well as the creator. Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on yourself, or or empathize with, one thing is certain: the \"_Singularity\"_ will someday affect us all, and when it does, pulling the plug may not be so easy as we expect.
