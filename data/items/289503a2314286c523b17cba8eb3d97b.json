  "description": "<p>The American artist Joel Shapiro has been pioneering new forms in sculpture for more than five decades. He joins our host Charlotte Burns today to talk more about his art and his influences; his hopes and motivations; and about what, for him, defines great art. “I'm not talking magical thinking—but some level of rapture or depression or some level of emotionality that is not matter of fact, and I think that that's what artists want,” he says. “So when you see something like that, I don't think it's so explicable.”</p> <p>Shapiro, whose art has been exhibited widely around the world—from the roof of the Metropolitan Museum in New York to a recent show at the Kunstmuseum Winterthur in Switzerland—discusses a range of topics, from investing his art with emotion to the importance of color. He talks about the artists who have inspired him and the works he himself has collected. Art, he says, “is a manifestation of the culture, so it's important. It shows you what's going on.”</p> <p>For this, and much more, tune in today.</p> <p>Transcript: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-joel-shapiro\">http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-joel-shapiro</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
