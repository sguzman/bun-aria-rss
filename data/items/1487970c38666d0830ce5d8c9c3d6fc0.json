  "description": "<p>Today on the show for Freaky Friday! We had friend to the room Flame Monroe, another comedian who we are not responsible for what comes out of her mouth. Moreover, she gave her opinions on Kim Kardashian, Jussie Smollett, SXSW, Hosting Award Shows and much more. Later on, in the show Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a mother who got drunk and spent almost 6k on an Uber to Ukraine to “go help”. Also, for our Freak Friday topic, we opened the phone lines to ask a simple question, how do you like your pickles? which came from Nick Cannon exploring his options on how to eat a pickle on his show. Maybe you like your pickles big and juicy with some ranch dressing or even peanut butter if you’re feeling wild, lets discuss.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
