  "description": "<p>Oxygen is quite the savvy traveler. We explore how this gas travels all around the world and ends up pretty much everywhere for us to breathe. Plus we'll look at how plants and others make the stuff. And we learn how oxygen ended up on Earth in the first place (hint: it involves super space explosions!). We'll make friends with some molecules, hear about a tiny fart that changed the world and guess an all new mystery sound. Oh, and this week's Moment of Um asks: \"if a poisonous snake bit itself, would it die?\"   This episode is sponsored by Visit Panama City Beach (VisitPanamaCityBeach.com), KiwiCo (kiwico.com/brainson), Quip (getquip.com/brainson) and Calm (calm.com/brainson).
