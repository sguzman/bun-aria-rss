    "media:description": "For those of us who are already using token-based authentication in our environments, abstraction and standards mean we don't often have to worry about the details of the libraries we use in our software. For those of us not using token-based authentication, perhaps the value isn't immediately obvious.\n\nIn this session, we're going to strip back the covers and take a look at where token-based authentication came from, what problems it was designed to solve, and how it actually works under the hood.\n\nEven though you're probably never going to have to write your own authentication, knowing what's happening will keep you and your users safer, and could even prevent an oversight or security vulnerability in the future.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcmelbourne.com/",
