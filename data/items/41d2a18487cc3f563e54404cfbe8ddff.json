You’ve seen him and JJ go ​at it on First Take countless times, ​and his voice is heard just about everywhere sports are being discussed. Now it’s his turn to pay a visit to JJ’s home turf. ​However, this time it​'​s a little different. ​On ​today's episode of the ​O​ld ​M​an ​& the ​T​hree, ​Stephen A is not necessarily here ​​for hot takes ​and x' & o's, but to give us insight into what makes the man behind the camera tick. He delves into his beginnings as a writer, his short lived hoops career, his relationships with the players past and present and how he deals with criticism, as well as his feelings on the game today and future plans.
