It damages our good gut bacteria and may lead to leaky gut. Glyphosate also depletes glutathione, our master antioxidant and a cornerstone of our biology, and it dramatically impacts our sulfur, methylation, and detoxification pathways that have many essential roles for our health. And not only is glyphosate harming human health and the health of our future generations, it’s also destroying our ecosystems.</p><br><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Stephanie Seneff, Ken Cook, and Dr. Zach Bush about why it’s important to be aware of the effects of glyphosate and make choices that reduce our exposure as much as possible.</p><br><p>Stephanie Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She has a bachelor's degree from MIT in Biology with a minor in Food and Nutrition Science, and a master’s degree, an engineer’s degree, and a PhD degree, all from MIT, in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&nbsp;Her recent interests have focused on the role of toxic chemicals and micronutrient deficiencies in health and disease, with a special emphasis on the pervasive herbicide, glyphosate, and the mineral, sulfur. She is the author of&nbsp;<em>Toxic Legacy: How the Weedkiller Glyphosate Is Destroying Our Health and the Environment</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ken Cook is president and co-founder of the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.
