  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, School Choice vouchers have a long-fought history in the courts. The basic principle of school choice is the allocated tax dollars assigned to a student follow the student at their choice of schools, hence the term school choice. Empowering parents to send children to the best school they choose not just the government school in their neighborhood. This enhances educational opportunities for low-income earners, middle-income earners, and high-income earners regardless of where they live. Similarly, the Landmark Legal Foundation fought these battles at the national level for years. Then, Hillary Clinton said Joe Biden needs a massive legal team and their own workers to counter the intimidation from Republicans. Clinton implored Biden to not concede the election as she did on the night of her loss to Trump. Later, citizens made some of the most powerful presentations on the first night of the Republican Convention. Afterward, following the shooting in Kenosha Wisconsin, lawyers are now demanding the immediate arrest of the officers involved in the shooting of suspect Jacob Blake, without conducting an investigation. White young people wearing black, carrying umbrellas, and launching fireworks at police have been rioting and committing arson for the past two nights.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
