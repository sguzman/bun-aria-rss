  "description": "<p>Leadership begins between the ears, as Mark Cole points out in this second part of our Thought Boosters series. If you listened to Episode 17 last week, you know John Maxwell teaches that a healthy environment is vital for thoughts and ideas to reach their full potential.</p> <p>In this episode, we’re talking about how to boost your thinking. You may be asking, “What’s at stake if I don’t boost my thinking?” The answer is your leadership capability. If you don’t take the time to boost your thinking, you’re not giving yourself sufficient creative space to increase your capabilities.</p> <p>This episode will walk you through nine thought boosters and leave you with a clear picture of how to boost your thinking so you can lead with more clarity, capacity, and room for creativity.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Thought Boosters Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
