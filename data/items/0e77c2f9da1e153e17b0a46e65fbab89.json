  "description": "<p>The Schur orthogonality relations are a cornerstone in the representation\ntheory of groups. We utilize a generalization to weak Hopf algebras to provide\na new, readily verifiable condition on the skeletal data for deciding whether a\ngiven bimodule category is invertible and therefore defines a Morita\nequivalence. As a first application, we provide an algorithm for the\nconstruction of the full skeletal data of the invertible bimodule category\nassociated to a given module category, which is obtained in a unitary gauge\nwhen the underlying categories are unitary. As a second application, we show\nthat our condition for invertibility is equivalent to the notion of\nMPO-injectivity, thereby closing an open question concerning tensor network\nrepresentations of string-net models exhibiting topological order. We discuss\napplications to generalized symmetries, including a generalized Wigner-Eckart\ntheorem.\n</p>",
