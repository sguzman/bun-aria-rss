We hear from Eddie Slaughter, a legacy farmer based in Buena Vista, Georgia, who spent thirty plus years fighting the USDA to keep ownership of property that had been in his family for generations. Then, host Carla Harris sits down with Shelley Stewart III, a McKinsey partner who leads the firm’s research on Black economic mobility. We discuss the racial inequities that have kept Black Americans from building wealth and how those affected can prosper in spite of it.<em>&nbsp;</em>Come on and join us for the ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
