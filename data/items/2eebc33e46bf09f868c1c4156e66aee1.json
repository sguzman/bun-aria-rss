  "description": "Zack, Jenn, and Alex discuss the wealthy authoritarian nation of Brunei’s horrific new criminal code, in which men who have sex with men can be executed by stoning. They delve into the possible reasons Brunei’s sultan is adopting this code, explain how it’s rooted in a very particular and regressive interpretation of Islamic law, and then zoom out to talk about the international reaction — both the necessary organizing to put pressure on the government of Brunei and the ways in which the law is being used in the West to tar Muslims as a whole. On Elsewhere, they talk about the potential closure of the island of Komodo to tourists because people keep stealing Komodo dragons, and then implore Worldly listeners not to keep massive poisonous lizards as pets. Jenn invents the phone number 1-800-Allah, Alex compares religions to apps, and Zack uses the word “dang.”\nThe BBC has a great explainer on the Brunei law and what it all means.\nThe New York Post goes into detail on the “sex-obsessed world” of Brunei (and yes, it mentions the yacht named “Tits”), and 60 Minutes did a great documentary on it.\nIt’s worth noting, as this AFP report does, that Brunei hasn’t executed anyone for decades.\nAs Zack mentioned, the LGBT community of Brunei has spoken out against the law and worries what it means for them.\nCelebrities like George Clooney and Ellen DeGeneres have called for a boycott of Brunei-owned hotels.\nThe BBC has a very short explainer on Sharia law (but you should just listen to Jenn’s explanation again). If you want to learn more, though, there’s a really great (and accessible) book by two leading scholars called Shariah: What Everyone Needs to Know that’s basically a book-length explainer.\nHere’s the archival record of the Sean Hannity segment from 2014. \nThis is Zack’s big feature on Islamophobia and the Trump administration.\nAs Jenn mentioned, there are polls taken regarding Muslim views on Sharia law. They typically differ around the world.\n\nNational Geographic has everything you’ve ever wanted to know about Komodo dragons.\nThe Washington Post reported on the smuggling ring that stole more than 40 Komodo dragons for roughly $35,000 each.\nIf you want to watch the full BBC Komodo dragon attack, it is very worth it. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
