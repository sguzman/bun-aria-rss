  "description": "<p>Get comfy because we got a long episode today. Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) and Ben Mandelker (The Banter Blender podcast) welcome back The Real Housewives of Orange County with a super-supersized episode. The guys break down the whole premiere: from Tamra's life lessons to Shannon's crumbling marriage to new girl Meghan to Heather's mansion. And of course Brooks.<br />\nThen it's on to the \"Married to Medicine\" premiere with master wordsmith Toya welcoming back for season 3. After that, we shed some tears for the women of \"Blood, Sweat, and Heels\" (it's a big deal), and finally we wrap up with the \"Kandi's Ski Trip\" finale.
