  "description": "As you know, it’s my mission to help teach you how to build the MINDSET and SKILLS that will help you live an extraordinary life - and over the last few months I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to help create a brand-new tool that will help you do that. It’s called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life.

By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com!<br /><br />On Today's Episode: <br /><br />Why is being rich something so many people want, but so few achieve. Does being successful guarantee becoming rich? Obviously that requires you to define what success is for you and your journey. The funny twist in all of this is that being rich is so easily fantasized and yet the work it takes to become rich and successful is barely thought of.<br /><br />Jim Rohn said, “Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.” As hard as that is to accept as truth, it is evident when you look at elite athletes, world-class performers, and the best of the best in any field.<br /><br />When you watch this, understand that Tom’s drive is always fulfillment, meaning, and purpose. The work it takes to achieve his level of success is not easy nor is it for the faint of heart. It’s not impossible, and it’s not the only path forward, but it has proven to be majorly successful over and over again. The path to becoming rich and successful is going to require you to dig deep and it requires skills, grit, and determination for you to tap into a level of potential you never knew was possible.<br /><br />You can watch the full episodes included today here:<br />Tom Bilyeu on The School of Greatness: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DN6BP65jWhk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/DN6BP65jWhk</a> <br />Tom Bilyeu on Rich Roll:https://youtu.be/prlqWU54NME <br />Tom Bilyeu on Ed Mylett: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VjTGHnlX8fw\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/VjTGHnlX8fw</a> <br />Tom Bilyeu on Valuetainment: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jSvTTh93dY0\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/jSvTTh93dY0</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction 0:00<br />0:12 | There Are No Excuses, Only Taking Action<br />31:03 | Rich People Do These 8 Things<br />47:37 | The Power of Stories<br />49:50 | Reading List<br />51:29 | Take Ownership<br />54:20 | It’s Not About the Money<br />1:00:29 | Learn From Failure & Move Forward<br />1:22:55 | Bonus: They Choose To Win & Not Quit<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“We’re not judged by our intentions.
