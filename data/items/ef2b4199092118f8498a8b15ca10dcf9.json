  "title": "Michelle Obama: Becoming, Part 1",
  "description": "<p>At the Hearst Tower in New York City, Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama sit down for a conversation about Mrs. Obama’s much-anticipated memoir “Becoming.” The two speak in front of an audience that includes a group of local, female high school students. The former first lady, mother, wife, attorney and author discusses the life experiences that have shaped her. She reminisces about her humble childhood on the South Side of Chicago with her family, which she describes as “four corners of a square:” her mother, Marian, her late father, Fraser, and her brother, Craig. Mrs. Obama explains how her parents invested everything they had into her and her brother’s futures. She discusses her years as an attorney and executive in Chicago and how she worked to balance the demands of her career and raising two daughters. Mrs. Obama candidly discusses some of the challenges she and Barack Obama faced during the early years of their marriage, including a stint in counseling. She also opens up about her years in the White House and the pressure of being the “first black family” to live there. Finally, Mrs. Obama explains her thoughts on how she believes President Trump put her family’s safety at risk.</p>\n",
