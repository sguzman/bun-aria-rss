  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Over the past couple years, there have been a lot of fear tactics used in the media to instill a sense of disempowerment and helplessness into our citizens. Recently, the CDC released some new data on chronic disease in Americans, reporting that 60% of American adults have been diagnosed with one chronic illness. When you look at the numbers surrounding chronic disease, it’s clear that the messages we’ve been hearing about protecting our health have been misplaced.</p> <p class=\"p1\">This Halloween, we’re going to dive into some of the numbers on America’s concurring health crises, including obesity, diabetes, and more. You’re going to learn about the powerful systems that contribute to our poor health outcomes, and why blind trust in their advice is leading to our collective degradation. You’ll also learn about some of the biggest issues in our healthcare system, including corruption, fraud, and inefficiency.</p> <p class=\"p1\">But fear not, you don’t have to fall victim to this doomed system. You’re also going to hear some realistic principles and practices you can incorporate in order to protect your health, your family, and your risk for all manner of diseases.
