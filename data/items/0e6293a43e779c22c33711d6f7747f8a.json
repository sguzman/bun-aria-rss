  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 1/24/22",
  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, in the 1950's there were isolationists on the right and radicals on the far left, and today we have a similar dynamic. Within the conservative movement, there are pro-Russia activists that think Vladimir Putin isn't so bad. Putin is working very closely with Xi in China. Biden's weakness and mental deterioration have invited our enemies to become more aggressive toward the United States and our allies. In 1994 Ukraine relinquished its nuclear weapons in exchange for the U.S, Russia, and England to provide security assurances under the Budapest memorandum. Some say that this is not the U.S's problem. By that logic, was Poland our problem? Did Russia develop hypersonic missiles to attack Ukraine? Of course not, they developed them for use against the U.S.  Then, it's imperative that the United States begin producing automobile chips and semiconductors outside of China since making so much of our critical components is a national security threat. This would lower the overall cost of cars for all Americans from an estimated 33% to 12%. Democrats are currently blocking legislation on this and helping China's interest. Later, the leftwing author Jane Mayer is on the attack against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife Ginni. Mayer is criticizing Ginni Thomas for having a life apart from her husband's career. Despite there being no ethical requirement or law for one's spouse to recuse themselves from having any personal opinions on social issues, or from engaging in free speech activism, Mayer insists that Thomas should step aside. This flawed thinking would institutionalize the practice of 'judge shopping' by simply questioning any judge's partiality as a means to get a more favorable judge. Afterward, Project Veritas Founder James O'Keefe joins the show to discuss his new book, American Muckraker: Rethinking Journalism for the 21st Century.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
