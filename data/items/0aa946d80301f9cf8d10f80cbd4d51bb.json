  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part One: Return of the King</strong></em>. We're starting a new series today that will help us renew the key words used in <strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong>, words that have come to define our faith and understanding of the journey we're on with Yahweh. <em>\"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—</em><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><em>not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"</em></p>\n<p>To begin, what is the <strong>Kingdom of Heaven</strong>? How does it operate as an image of God himself? When the White House issues a statement, we all realize the actual White House isn't speaking. It is a symbol or image for the powers within. Everything Jesus said and did pointed to the Kingdom! “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” Something is here that forces you to reckon and respond.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
