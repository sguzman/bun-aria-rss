  "title": "230: Work Less, Get More Done | Alex Soojung Kim-Pang",
  "description": "Many of us can feel burnt out, tired or stretched too thin. It can be hard to balance everything on our plates, especially in work environments that require long hours and multi-tasking. But Alex Soojung-Kim Pang says that overworking can actually hinder productivity, and that working less can help you get more done. After struggling to deal with the pressure of numerous projects as a technology forecaster and consultant, Pang took a sabbatical at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. He realized that he had accomplished more in just a few short months than he typically did at work. Now, Pang challenges the relationship we have with work, claiming that cramming in all those overtime hours is not beneficial to the mind and body. He says working too hard blocks creative flow and has negative effects on quality. Pang discusses how he came to this realization and how it can be applied to your life.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: http://www.askpang.com/\nWebsite: http://www.strategy.rest/\nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/Alex-Soojung-Kim-Pang/e/B001KHJ91I\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/askpang\nYung Pueblo featured on ABC's Nightline\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/yung-pueblo-instagram-people-heal-happier-life-69352620\nFull Show notes: www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/Alex-Soojung-Kim-Pang-230\nJeff Warren Retreats:\nhttps://jeffwarren.org/event/fidgetyskeptics-california/\nhttps://jeffwarren.org/event/how-to-guide-meditation/\nhttps://jeffwarren.org/event/omegaretreat/\nTen Percent Happier Podcast Insiders Feedback Group:\nhttps://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
