  "description": "<p>From August 9, 2014: Washington was abuzz this week as&nbsp;more than 50 African leaders were in town for the first U.S.-Africa Summit. On August 8, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the President of Somalia, spoke at Brookings on the future of his country. In his talk, President Mohamud addresses the challenges to democracy that Somalia faces, and how Somalia, the African Union, and other international partners can work together to ensure security, foster development, and promote stable state-building in the country. President Mohamud also addresses the challenges his state faces in its&nbsp;ongoing battle against Al-Shabab militants—a mission that the<a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2014/08/summit-showcases-africas-progress-and-pitfalls/90941/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;U.S. has contributed more than half a billion dollars</a>&nbsp;to since 2007. President Mohamud provides a realistic assessment of that threat, while highlighting the efforts his country is taking to bring democracy to Somalia. Michael E. O’Hanlon, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, provides introductory remarks and moderates the conversation.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
