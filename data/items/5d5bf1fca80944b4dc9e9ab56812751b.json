  "description": "With Joe Burrow set to become the next CIN QB, we look back at what the #1 overall pick QBs have done in the last 20 years (2:00) and we look at how WRs have done with those QBs (6:55). What will it mean for A.J. Green this season? Also, how do you pronounce Ben Gretch's last name (11:15)? ... News and notes! We react to Austin Ekeler's new contract (14:00). Should he be drafted in Round 1 in PPR? Plus more reaction to news from around the NFL ... AFC East team needs as we do discuss NE (24:00), BUF (27:45), MIA (32:55) and NYJ (40:00). Can Sam Darnold's talent get unlocked in Year 3? Why don't we want BUF to make any major moves? Does MIA bring in a veteran RB? Is Damien Harris going to make an impact for NE? And then on to the AFC West with LAC (43:25), DEN (49:10), KC (52:10) and LV (55:55). Is Tyrod Taylor good enough or does LAC need to be aggressive at QB? Will KC let their second year players step into the spotlight? ...
