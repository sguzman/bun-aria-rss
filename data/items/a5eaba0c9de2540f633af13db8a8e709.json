  "description": "Best not to listen to this story just before bedtime. It’s a bit scary! In the sea just off the coast of Guyana lives a spirit – a Water Mama who is half woman half fish. She is said to enchant people and lure them under the sea. Will the sugar cane man be able to resist her magical powers? Listen to Tuup tell this story - and see if you think it’s a happy ending. If scary stories aren’t for you – then maybe try listening to one or our funny Anansi stories like ‘Anansi and the Hot Pepper Soup’ or ‘Anansi and the Tree with a Face.’",
