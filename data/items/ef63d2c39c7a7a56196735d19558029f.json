  "description": "<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Two</strong></em>. Today we continue the conversation about the Bible with pastor and author <strong>Joshua Ryan Butler</strong>. Josh, who wrote \"<a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780529100818\">The Skeletons in God's Closet</a>\" (which Mike referenced a few times throughout the '<strong>New Creation</strong>' series), sits down to chat about the complexities of the Bible and how we can approach it. Is the Bible 'authoritative?' What does that mean? How can God's word be manipulated and used for wrong? What are we to make of Old Testament violence, which seems to be God sanctioned? How do we read the Bible? Again, what are we to do with all of this???</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
