  "description": "In today’s podcast we hear that the Rotexy Trojan has evolved into phishing and ransomware. Bad apps found in Google Play. An open source library used in cryptocurrency wallets had a wide-open backdoor. Facebook goes before Parliament, which seems in a pretty feisty mood. Pegasus spyware found to have been deployed against journalists in Mexico and elsewhere. Russia escalates its hybrid war against Ukraine. Do people care if their smart speakers eavesdrop? How about their smart lightbulbs? Johannes Ullrich from SANs and the ISC Stormcast podcast on DNS over HTTPS and network visibility. Guest is Shaun Bierweiler from Hortonworks on the use of open source software in the federal space.\n For links to all of today's stories check our our CyberWire daily news brief: https://thecyberwire.com/issues/issues2018/November/CyberWire_2018_11_27.html\n Support our show",
