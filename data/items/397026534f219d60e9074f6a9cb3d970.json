  "description": "<p>The pandemic presents an opportune time to get re-acquainted with<strong> Zach Bush, MD.</strong></p><p>A triple board-certified physician specializing in internal medicine, endocrinology and hospice care, today's guest is an internationally recognized educator, speaker and authority on all facets of well-being.</p><p>Focused on the relationship between the microbiome, disease and food production systems, Zach is the founder of Seraphic Group, an organization devoted to developing root-cause solutions for human and ecological health in the sectors of big farming, big pharma, and Western Medicine at large</p><p>He is also the founder of Farmers Footprint, a non-profit coalition of farmers, educators, doctors, scientists, and business leaders aiming to expose the deleterious human and environmental impacts of chemical farming and pesticide reliance -- while simultaneously offering a path forward through regenerative agricultural practices to rebuild living biodiversity and ultimately reverse climate change.</p><p>To me, Zach is a master healer. A man I call friend. And a critical voice in the conversation we need to have in this unprecedented moment of global calamity.</p><p>Without minimizing the profound severity of our current situation, I cannot overstate the unique opportunity we are being gifted.</p><p>Like an addict’s moment of clarity, the pandemic presents a singular occasion to break the chains of denial that imprison us. A moment to objectively examine that which no longer serves us. The behaviors that repeatedly lead us astray. An economic system that demands constant growth at the cost of the collective good. A political system that preys on fear to divide. A conglomerated food apparatus that foments disease. A pharmaceutical complex that relies upon that disease to create dependency. And and ultimately a collective obsession with ego, power, money, and material consumption that is rapidly eroding our biosphere, degrading our integrity -- and separating us from others, ourselves and our innate divinity.</p><p>I aspire that we emerge from this planetary wake up call not as victims, but empowered -- armed with greater clarity to reimagine and actualize a better, more sustainable, purposeful, intentional and fulfilling life experience for ourselves, our loved ones, future generations and frankly the world at large.</p><p>I can think of few people better equipped to traverse this terrain than Zach, alongside me for his fourth appearance on the show.</p><p>Well worth your undivided attention, today he shares his&nbsp;unique perspective on the coronavirus epidemic in a conversation that goes behind what is happening. How to best navigate it. And what the pandemic signifies for humanity and the future of planetary ecology.</p><p><strong>Audio Note: </strong>This podcast was recorded remotely. My first since the earliest days of the podcast, I admit a severe allergy to this dynamic. Being physically present with my guest is crucial to providing an optimal listening experience. However, sequestration demands I adapt. So this is my fairly reluctant attempt to do just that. Therefore, please excuse the audio quality, a somewhat eroded version of what you’ve come to expect. Sub-par bandwidth and latency issues impeded our ability to converse as naturally as I would have preferred -- more staccato back and forth than my hallmark organic flow.</p><p>Zach has a knack for landing our podcasts with unmatched profundity. And today he delivers a master class in thinking both deeply and broadly about this unique situation we are collectively experiencing.</p><p>I love this man. I’m grateful for his wisdom. And I’m proud to share it with you today.</p><p>May you find it equal parts instructive, enlightening and moving -- especially the end.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p>Rich</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
