  "description": "In today's podcast we follow the latest news and trends with respect to ransomware, now the hottest commodity on the black market, and still able to fetch between $15,000 and $20,000 an extortion. Twitter credentials join VK's in the criminal souk; both sets may have been harvested via earlier breaches in other social media sites. NATO looks into cyber collaboration, workforce development, innovation (Estonia hints low budgets can drive creativity), and the risk of strategic surprise in hybrid warfare. Cylance becomes the industry's latest unicorn with a big Series D funding round. The Johns Hopkins University's Joe Carrigan help us plan our backup strategy, and Scott Petry from Authentic8 offers suggestions for safe browsing while traveling.",
