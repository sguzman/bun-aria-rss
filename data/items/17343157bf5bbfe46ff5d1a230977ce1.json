  "description": "Julia Jarcho's Writing and the Modern Stage: Theater beyond Drama (Cambridge UP, 2017) is a fascinating argument for the centrality of writing in experimental theater from Gertrude Stein to Suzan-Lori Parks. Countering arguments that locate the theatrical avant-garde solely in the live event, Jarcho focuses on playwrights and theatre makers whose theater insists on and even revels in language. This book will be of interest to fans of experimental theatre, or to playwrights and theatre makers interested in reconceptualizing the work that writing does on stage.\nAndy Boyd is a playwright based in Brooklyn, New York. He is a graduate of the playwriting MFA at Columbia University, Harvard University, and the Arizona School for the Arts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
