And most importantly, what does your podcast do?</p><p>In addition to philosophizing these questions and more, in today’s edition of ‘Roll On,’ Adam Skolnick and I trade fitness updates, engage in typical ribald banter, indulge you with a cameo from environmental activist, UN Patron of the Oceans, and arctic swimmer, <strong>Lewis Pugh</strong>.</p><p><em>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</em></p><p>Aside from being my fortnightly sidekick hype beast and favorite edgelord of words literary, Adam is a waterman, writer, and veteran journalist best known as David Goggins’ Can’t Hurt Me, co-author.
