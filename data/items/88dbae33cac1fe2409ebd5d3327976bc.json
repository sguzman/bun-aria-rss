  "description": "<p>26-year-old Keith Roberson worked as an oil field flowback supervisor outside Ozona, Texas. In early September 2018, Keith Roberson's mother received a phone call she wasn't expecting. Keith had not shown up for work, which was out of character. Keith's mom made her way to Ozona to begin searching for her son. She learned that on the evening of September 5, Keith had been driving eastbound on Interstate 10, a long stretch of highway that crosses the entire continental United States. Keith was in a vast, desolate area in between many tiny Texas towns, nearest the city of Sonora, when his car crossed the median to the westbound side, struck an oncoming vehicle, and ended up off the westbound side of the road. But when police arrived, Keith wasn't in his vehicle. No one has seen or heard from Keith since.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Steven \"Keith\" Roberson, please contact the Texas Department of Public Safety. You can reach them online at iwatchtx.org or call them at 1-844-643-2251. Keith's mother, Sharmon, is offering a $15,000 reward to anyone who can find Keith.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://Shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://Shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p><a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive Market</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>thrivemarket.com/VANISHED</strong></a>.
