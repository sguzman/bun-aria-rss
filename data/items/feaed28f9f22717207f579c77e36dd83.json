  "description": "Viet Thanh Nguyen's novel <em>The Committed</em> follows the same unnamed character we met in his Pulitzer-winning thriller, <em>The Sympathizer</em>. The character is now in Paris; having become disillusioned with the revolution he was a part of when we last saw him, he hasn't given up on the idea entirely. Nguyen told NPR's Scott Simon the book is also about colonization: He \"wanted it to be set in a Paris that was not the tourist Paris or the romantic Paris. [It's] a novel about French ideas and French Revolution and French colonialism, but it's also a crime thriller set in these immigrant neighborhoods.\"",
