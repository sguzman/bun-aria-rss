I am VERY excited as I have admired his work for many years and worked alongside of him when he played in Shadows Fall (I worked at Century Media while they were releasing their earlier LP's) but never got to spend time with him. We changed that and discussed a ton of things like his early touring life, his diverse music tastes and of course, his dreadlocks.
