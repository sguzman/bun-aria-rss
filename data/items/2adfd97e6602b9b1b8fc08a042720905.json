  "description": "<p>Super excited to be jamming out on the podcast today with the Manifestation Babe to dive into her story from immigrant background to spiritual multimillionaire. In this, we discuss our similar journeys of overcoming our familial and parental conditioning and how the Law of Attraction shifted her life.
