  "title": "Ep. 768 - Tyrannical Biden Administration Abolishes Private Property Rights",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the CDC has extended the eviction moratorium once again forbidding property owners from evicting tenants who don’t pay their rent. Biden admits that this isn’t constitutional and he has no authority to do what he’s doing, and yet he does it anyway. This is what it’s like to live in a lawless country. Also we have our Five Headlines. The New York Attorney General releases her report detailing Governor Cuomo’s serial sexual harassment. But I’m still mostly concerned about the fact that Cuomo killed thousands of elderly people. Plus, the NIH director says that parents should wear masks in their homes to protect their children, and later backtracks. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about the rapper who is in the middle of a PR crisis because of his comments about gay people. Yet this rapper says many more objectionable things in his songs, and few people seem to have a problem with that.\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
