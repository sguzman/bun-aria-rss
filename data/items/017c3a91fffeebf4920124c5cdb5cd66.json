  "description": "<p>Two Pulitzers, a National Book Award, and a MacArthur Genius Grant: Colson Whitehead is one of the greatest novelists working today. From <em>The Intuitionist</em> to <em>The Underground Railroad</em> and <em>The Nickel Boys</em>, his incredible body of work is driven by sharp insight and brilliant sentences. <em>Harlem Shuffle</em> is his newest novel, a character study, a caper flick, and an absolute thrill to read.

Featured Books: <em>Harlem Shuffle</em> and <em>The Intuitionist</em> by Colson Whitehead, Richard Stark’s <em>Parker</em> novels, and <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em> by Patricia Highsmith. Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
