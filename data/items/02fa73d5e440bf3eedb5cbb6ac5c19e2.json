  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the enemy of the Constitution, is the Speaker of the House. In true fascist fashion Pelosi is obstructing the Senate because they cannot control the trial there. So, at the direction of Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe, Pelosi has decided to put the brakes on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate and snapped at reporters who asked if she was playing politics with the impeachment in order to gain leverage over the Senate process. The Senate has the sole power under the Constitution to adjudicate an impeachment. Therefore, Pelosi is attempting to obstruct the Senate’s power to act on its constitutional authority. Mitch McConnell should immediately put an end to this and declare the impeachment null and void as the speaker has failed to complete the impeachment process by timely sending it to the Senate for adjudication. McConnell has no less authority to unilaterally make such a decision than Pelosi does to withhold the administrative notification of the articles of impeachment to the Senate either indefinitely or with conditions. Her effort to cripple the presidency and blackmail the Senate must be defeated. Then, based on the Pelosi Plan there is no President of the United States that should not have been impeached based on her erroneous standard. Trump was impeached because the Democrats will do anything to stop a duly elected President of the United States. They've tried to abolish the electoral college, prosecution through the special counsel and the phony dossier, and filing false evidence with the FISA Court. From spying on his campaign to the silent or soft attempted coup to sabotage his presidency, the attacks do not stop and we have never seen anything like this before. Afterward, Donald Trump, Jr. joins the program to discuss Wednesday's impeachment vote and Nancy Pelosi's obstruction of the Senate. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
