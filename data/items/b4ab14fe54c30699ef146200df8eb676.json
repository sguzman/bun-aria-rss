Listen in to hear the framework again and what you need to do to move from love addiction, avoidance, or anorexia to being a healed and loved woman. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m starting it all off with love addiction. So many women are stuck in a cycle of love addiction and aren’t sure how to get out of it. Oftentimes we think of sex addiction as something separate but it’s really another facet of being addicted to love. It’s just manifested in the physical. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re love avoidant you’re perfectly happy to just relax and keep yourself away from love. Many times wives and mothers hide love avoidance through the actions of taking care of others, but you still need love. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love anorexia is a short-lived stage, but it’s one that is prolonged when you’re not balanced. Love anorexia or love deprivation results in women living in a fantasy world. Usually this disorder is triggered by a bad relationship and then swearing off love, but when you live a balanced life you no longer need dramatic swings. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intimacy disorders are complex, but with the right guidance you can leave them behind and live a balanced and fulfilled life.
