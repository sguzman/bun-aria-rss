  "description": "After two, overly emotional attempts, Mike and Bonnie have a conversation about the recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. They lament the death, the loss, the political posturing and discuss what a Kingdom movement might be in this time. It's a raw and unfiltered conversation with a few rants and emotional pleas. As always, we appreciate your thoughts and feedback.
