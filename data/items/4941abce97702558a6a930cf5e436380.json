  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, 108 illegal immigrants at the border have tested positive for the coronavirus and President Biden is letting them into the United States. Biden hasn't done a damn thing to fight this virus. Democrats sit back and regulate honest taxpaying citizens while allowing communicable diseases to enter the country. Then, Democrats reject our economic system and want to blow out the filibuster. Stacy Abrams falsely says Republicans want to go back to the Jim Crow era while they work to destroy the electoral college. The H.R. 1 Bill is wrong and misstates the filibuster rule which dates back to the debate in ancient Rome. Later, Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins the show to explain that Democrats are now pushing for a voting age of 16 years old and increased public funds for future elections. Afterward, Benjamin Netanyahu continues to be targeted by activist prosecutors. The tyranny and persecution against Jews in that region rages on, while the Israelis have the firepower to flatten Gaza they show restraint.  \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
