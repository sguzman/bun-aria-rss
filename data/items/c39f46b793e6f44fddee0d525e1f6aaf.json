Castles and rich histories go hand in hand with hauntings and Leap Castle has many stories of the supernatural and is considered the most haunted castle in the world. The most well known haunting is about the Elemental that apparently resides at the castle. Come along with us to Ireland to find out more about this interesting location. Moment in Oddity features a murder investigation that revealed illegitimate children and This Day in History features the first continuous publication newspaper published in America.</p> <p>Check out our website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-42-leap-castle.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-42-leap-castle.html</a></p>",
