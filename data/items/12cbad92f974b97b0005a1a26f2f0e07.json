  "description": "<p>In this somewhat unusual episode, Levi R has some harsh words for the Anti-Distributists. Distributism was an attempt to apply the social teaching of the Church to the problems of the early 20th century. It has a ton of great ideas, some of which are very useful today. The most important thing is that you form your economic policy perspectives around Church teaching, rather than the other way around. Unfortunately, there are far too many Catholics who insist on doing the latter. This episode is a response to them.</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/catholiceconomics/message\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/catholiceconomics/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/catholiceconomics/support</a>",
