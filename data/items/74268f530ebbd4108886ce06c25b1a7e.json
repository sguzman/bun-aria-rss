  "description": "<p>Just outside of Philadelphia, in a town called Glenside, sits a small private university that is home to a castle. This is the second campus that we have featured with a castle-like structure and this one is also haunted. Grey Towers was once home to the William Harrison Family and many of them seem to still be here after death. The university that now sits on that former property is Arcadia University and it has a history dating back to the mid-1800s. Our listener Chris Klimovitz is an alumni of Arcadia University and he joins us to share his experiences at the university and the stories of haunting legends and experiences connected to the school. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Michael Rogers and features Skeletal Body Paint Rituals and This Month in History features PT-109 rammed nearly killing future President John F. Kennedy.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes are here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-219-arcadia-university.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-219-arcadia-university.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>",
