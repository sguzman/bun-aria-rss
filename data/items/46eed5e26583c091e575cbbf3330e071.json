    "media:description": "Ariana Grande - 34+35 (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. She reproves her queen status with the swag she shows while skipping toward the camera at the start of “34+35.” The lustful lyrics are in the air, and visions of a private evening with boo accent the naughty atmosphere. The song has become a certified classic since it arrived last fall. Its steamy luster is obvious here. \n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “34+35” by Ariana Grande.
