What happened to the Rams offense, Belichick coached a gem of a defensive game and Brady did just enough to win. Best commercials and halftime show recap. Who is to blame for Rams loss, Saints fans must be extra mad, and we sent NFL Security on a wild goose chase. (3:10-24:53) Who's back of the week. (24:54-29:30) Our lawyer Mr Portnoy joins the show to talk about the win and his son being arrested, can barstool counter sue, and what happens next? (30:57-44:14) We had some great interviews over Super Bowl Week on radio so we bring you the best of including an awesome 20 minutes with Dan Patrick, a great story with Mark Schlereth, Ian Rapoport rating next head coach hires, and Chad Johnson talking about the time he had an orgy in college. (44:14-1:24:21) Segments include Sabermetrics Gronk's rings, (1:25:29-1:27:10) put one in his earhole Rovell (1:27:12-1:30:49), Mahomes vs Allen update,(1:30:50-1:34:14) Perspective,(1:34:15-1:36:17) and explain it to us, 21 Savage (1:36:18-1:40:10).Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
