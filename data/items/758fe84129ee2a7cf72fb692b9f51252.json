  "description": "<p>r/Tifu OP's daughter asked to capture a black widow egg sac so she could watch it hatch. OP agrees, and seals the egg sac in an airtight container. At least... she THOUGHT it was an airtight container. Turns out the container had a little hole in it big enough for black widow baby spiders to escape into OP's bedroom. Oops! Let's hope OP is still alive after that huge TIFU! If you like this episode, follow for more daily Reddit content!</p>\n",
