    "media:description": "I'm so excited for the Barbie movie it's unreal. Kenbros... for too long society has ignored our greatness, our time in the sun will come soon enough. The vast potential we hold will not be squandered. The Ken revolution will be swift, and it will be powerful. The world will know of its greatest underutilized resource, the Ken. Call me Ken 10 because it's Hero Time, gonna turn Alien X and win the powerscaling debates.\n\nIf the Barbie movie is mid (bad) I'm gonna turn this channel into an anime video essay channel. That's how confident I am that this movie's gonna slap. This movie's gonna be the Citizen Kane of movies.",
