  "description": "Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm  \n\nToday on the Matt Walsh Show, med students participate in a bizarre incantation ritual where they pledge to reject the gender binary and show respect for primitive medical practices.

Plus, the unedited portions of Kanye’s interview with Tucker Carlson are leaked online. The Left is calling it a bombshell scoop, we’ll see if they’re overreacting again. And even MSNBC is now admitting that John Fetterman is mentally incompetent.
