  "description": "<p>This week's episode was prompted by a question from Kate, an Australian artist who asked: \"Should you like your own work? Do you ever stop fighting that inner critic (and external critics) and just start enjoying the process?\" We both believe that loving your own work is crucial, touch on how we evaluate our work (and the importance of doing so) and share our feelings about where we find ourselves currently. We also ask whether &nbsp;what we love changes, &nbsp;whether this is an issue, and what to do with those older pieces that no longer make us feel excited. As for the inner critic ... Alice suggests there is a difference between criticism and critique. Can we analyse/assess our work without ever allowing that self-critique to stray into negative thoughts about ourselves or our level of talent? Finally, we each offer concrete steps that we believe artists can take to begin making work that they love.</p>\n<p>Mentioned:</p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Club: <a href=\"https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest\">https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Art Tribe: <a href=\"https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
