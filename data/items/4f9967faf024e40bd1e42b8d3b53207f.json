  "description": "BLM groups held more protests over the weekend — harassing diners, using \"white shields,\" and burning down a black-owned business. One assistant principal went on an anti-police rant, and other protesters promoted summoning spirits. Meanwhile, a kid was suspended for holding a toy gun on a Zoom class call, and Trump threatened to defund schools teaching the 1619 Project. The media continues to claim that Trump hates the military, but Glenn looks into the anti-Trump history of the Atlantic. Conservative street artist Sabo talks his latest piece on Nancy Pelosi’s salon visit.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
