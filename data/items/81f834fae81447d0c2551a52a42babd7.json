Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nIn the morning, when the moon is at its rest\nYou will find me at the time I love the best\nWatching rainbows play on sunlight\nPools of water iced from cold night\nIn the morning\nIt's the morning of my life\n\nAnd in the daytime I will meet you as before\nYou will find me waiting by, waiting by the ocean floor\nPainting castles in the shifting sands\nPools of water, nobody understands\nIn the morning\nIt's the morning of my life\n\nIt's the morning of my life\nThe minutes take so long to drift away\nPlease be patient with your life\nIt's only morning and you're still to live your day\n\nIn the evening I will fly you to the moon\nTo the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room\nWhere we'll wait until sunlight\nPools of water iced from cold night\nFor another day\nIt's the morning of my life\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
