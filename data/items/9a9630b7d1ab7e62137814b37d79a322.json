  "description": "The Democrats had a bad night on Tuesday as Glenn Youngkin won the governorship in Virginia and Phil Murphy was barely able to hang on in New Jersey. However, what those results mean remains very unclear. Did Congress's failure to pass the Build Back Better agenda lead to apathy amongst the party faithful? Do Democrats need better candidates? Was this just a thermostatic turn against the party in power? What should the Democrats do to correct course before the midterms? David Rothkopf and Kavita Patel work through these and other questions facing Democratic leaders in the run up to 2022 and 2024 with David Corn of Mother Jones and Jonathan Alter of MSNBC.
