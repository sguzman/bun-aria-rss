  "description": "<p>A New York girl reported missing for two years has been found safe. Paislee Shultis was four at the time of her disappearance. Investigators suspected that Paislee’s biological parents, who didn’t have custody, took her. Today that was proven. After receiving a tip that someone was hiding Paislee, New York State police found the child and her parents at a home in Saugerties. A detective helped search inside the home and when he shined a flashlight at an odd-looking place in the staircase, he noticed a blanket.Police removed a few steps in the area and located Paislee and her biological mother, 33-year-old Kimberly Cooper, in a “small, cold and wet” space. Cooper and father Kirk Shultis, Jr., were both arrested and charged with felony custodial interference and endangering the welfare of a child. Paislee is in good health and is now back with her older sister and legal guardian.
