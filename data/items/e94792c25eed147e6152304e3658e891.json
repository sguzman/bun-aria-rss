  "description": "On one hand, the Left tries to appropriate faith and bastardize it for their own ends. On the other, they degrade and mock it. These two strategies seem to contradict. Also today we'll go through five headlines, including one of the best questions I've ever heard anyone ask at a town hall. And some emailers attempt to explain why I'm wrong.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
