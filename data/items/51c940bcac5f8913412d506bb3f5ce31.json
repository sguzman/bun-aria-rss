  "title": "Why You Should Pursue Your Dreams & How I’ve Grown My Brand For 9 YEARS!  EP 1220",
  "description": "<p>This week is a very special one. 9 years ago I took a bet on myself when I uploaded an interview with a man named Robert Greene for a new show I was starting called The School of Greatness. The last 9 years have been extremely transformational for me and none of it would’ve been possible without 1. Your guy’s support of the show and coming back to listen each week… and 2. Having the courage to believe in myself and start this in the first place. I took in some questions around the show from you guys over on social media that I think will help give more context to my journey and help you if you’re in the middle of a career change or thinking that it might be time to make a change in another area of your life.</p><p>In this episode we discuss why so many people are wanting to leave their jobs to go all in on their passion, how to develop the belief in yourself to pursue your dreams, how The School of Greatness has changed my life over the last 9 years and what went into building this show, what my big vision is now that we’re 9 years, and so much more!</p><p>For more go to: <a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/1220\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/1220</a></p><p>Kobe Bryant on Mamba Mentality, NBA Titles, and Oscars: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/691-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/691-pod</a></p><p>Kevin Hart Breaks Down His Secrets to Success: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/956-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/956-pod</a></p><p>Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt on the Power of Forgiveness: <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/925-pod\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/925-pod</a></p><p> </p>\n",
