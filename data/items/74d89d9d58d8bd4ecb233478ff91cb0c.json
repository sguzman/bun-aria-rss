  "description": "<p>If you had no interest in Riesling or in Rheingau previously, this show will change your mind completely and make you jump out of your seat to try Georg Breuer's exquisite wines.</p> <p>Theresa Breuer is a young woman who found herself (sadly, earlier <img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/IMG_0338.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"189\" height=\"126\" /><br /> than she expected) at the helm of one of the most respected, highest quality Riesling producers in the Rheingau region of Germany.  I had the pleasure of spending the day with her a few years back and she is brilliant, poised, kind and a genius vigneron and cellar master, but more than anything, at 30-something, she is one of the best fresh faces and ambassadors for what Rheingau wine is, was, and should be. </p> <p>This show should give you a perspective on why Rheingau is so special and make you understand why a dork like me loves this place so much! </p> <p>Here are the show notes: </p> <p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p> <ul> <li>Theresa shares Weingut Georg Breuer's nearly 140 years in wine -- from her great grandfather Peter's involvement in the business side of wine, to her grandfather after whom the Weingut is named, to her dad, Bernhard, and then to her.  </li> <li>We discuss Bernhard Breuer's obsession with quality, bringing the reputation of Rheingau back from a less than stellar period, and her involvement in the business. </li> <li>Theresa shares her (beautiful) philosophies about wine and why it means so much to her.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Rheingau Education!</strong></p> <ul> <li>I have rarely found anyone who can educate on a region as well and succinctly as Theresa Breuer and we are lucky to have her explain stuff like:  <ul> <li>Where is Rheingau and what makes it so unique for wine?</li> <li>The parallels with Burgundy in terms of Grand Cru, Premier Cru, Village, Regional sites and why it is so easy in Rheingau</li> <li>Why Riesling is so dominant in Rheingau and why it does so well here (hint: reflection from the river, slate/quartzite soils, slopes!)</li> <li>How climate change has affected the region, what a hot year like 2019 means for the wine, and what really matters to vintage</li> <li>How oak is used in Rheingau (and it is used, a LOT!)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Theresa gives us the deep dive into site specific info. It's fascinating: </strong></p> <ul> <li>Theresa shares detailed and excellent information about George Breuer's sites and the why and how behind the differences in the wines. We discuss their beautiful Grand Cru sites in Rüdesheim – Berg Schlossberg, Berg Roseneck and Berg Rottland and their wholly owned site, Nonnenberg in Rauenthal (in the eastern part of Rheingau</li> <li>Theresa talks about her commitment to organic viticulture and her vision for the wines -- to let the vineyard produce the best wines and to let the Riesling show its home in the glass! </li> <li>We talk about what makes Theresa's wines elegant and age worthy.</li> <li>We discuss the generational shift in Rheingau and what it does and will mean for wine in the future.</li> </ul> <p>Theresa unveils big news: Weingut Georg Breuer bought some land in the (very different, Mittelrhein-type) wine area of Lorch, to the west of their Grand Cru vineyards.
