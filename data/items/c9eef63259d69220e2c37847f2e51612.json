The guys also discuss the rules that were passed (8:45) The Pick Six Superfriends then dissect the ongoing free agency of Jadeveon Clowney (20:30), as he reportedly turned down an offer from the Browns. That sparks a separate Baker Mayfield vs. Tyrod Taylor debate (doesn't take much for these guys to go off on a tangent!).
