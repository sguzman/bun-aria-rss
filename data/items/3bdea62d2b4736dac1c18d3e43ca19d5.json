  "description": "It's a glorious day to be a fan from either Canada or Australia as it's all about GOLD and SILVER for both nations on a medallistic day that will go down in history! Ben & Jarrod are joined by Mallory again to get all Matt Graham excited, as well as Team Canada excited and twizzle their way through the news of the day. We also try and work out why everyone at the Winter Olympics are all so much happier than the Summer Olympics, why these games make us dislike the Campbell sisters even more, talk up just how great curling is and wish all sports were like it and find out if Mallory actually knows anything about Canada. It's all available to click yourself into gear so wrap that silver around your neck and ski ski ski faster than Harry Laidlaw!",
