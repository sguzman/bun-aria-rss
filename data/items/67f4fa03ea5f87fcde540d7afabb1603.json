  "description": "This week, the vast majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill sought to block a bipartisan commission that would investigate the attack that took place on January 6th and the factors leading up to it. Some even portrayed the attackers as the victims or as just a bunch of tourists visiting a national monument. It would have been shocking if it were not so commonplace. So the question becomes, do enough Americans even care about preserving our system of government to protect it? And if not, how can a sufficient number be motivated to care? We discuss with Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and a professor at NYU Law School. It's an important discussion. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
