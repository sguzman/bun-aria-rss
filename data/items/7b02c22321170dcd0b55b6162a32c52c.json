  "description": "As promised, we are talking today about the serial killer from Episode 266. In that episode, we focused on the only survivor of his crimes, Holly Dunn. Today, we take a walk through all of his crimes. \nThroughout the 80's and 90's, Angel Maturino Resendiz was one of the most brutal killers the United States had ever seen. Known by the media as the Railroad Killer, he stalked victims nears railroad tracks before brutally butchering them either next to the tracks or in their own homes. His mode of operation involved sexual assault and a gruesome amount of overkill. He moved freely between his home in Mexico and the States before finally being caught through fingerprints and SNA. After a reign of terror that was as prolific as it was terrorizing, he was fortunately coerced into turning himself into authorities in 1999.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.hollykdunn.com/sole-survivor/\" target=\"_blank\">Sole Survivor by Holly Dunn</a> <br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our beautiful sponsors!\n\n<br>\nHello Fresh: Get up to fourteen free meals—including free shipping! —when you use code morbid14 at <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid14\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid14</a><br>\n<br>\nLiquid IV: Grab your favorite Liquid I.V. flavors nationwide at Walmart or you can get 25% off when you go to <a href=\"http://LIQUIDIV.COM\" target=\"_blank\">LIQUIDIV.COM</a> and use code MORBID at checkout!<br>\n<br>\nEverlane: Go to <a href=\"http://everlane.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">everlane.com/MORBID</a> and sign up for 10% off your first order plus free shipping!<br>\n<br>\nCandid: Go to <a href=\"http://CandidCO.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">CandidCO.com/morbid</a> and use code morbid<br>\n<br>\nBrooklinen:    Go to <a href=\"http://Brooklinen.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklinen.com</a> and use promo code MORBID to get $20 off, with a minimum purchase of $100\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
