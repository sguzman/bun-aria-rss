  "title": "Ep 245 | Phil and His AR Go to the Doctor, Self-Segregation in America & 'Unconverted Believers'",
  "description": "Phil, Al, and One Kingdom's Mike Kellett talk favoritism, why the self-segregation spreading on college campuses and beyond is so unbiblical, and why violence always follows prejudice. Phil is always prepared — even at the doctor's office. The guys look back on a year of lockdowns and discuss the church as a living organism, the pruning happening in churches, and the problem of \"unconverted believers\" in the church. And Phil offers a reminder that God doesn't live in church buildings.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
