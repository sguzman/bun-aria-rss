  "description": "Our audiobook this week is GIRL&#039;S. NIGHT OUT by Ember Davis\n\nAMELIA\nAfter four years of having everything that I’ve ever wanted, including the love of a man I never thought would look at me twice, I still have doubts sometimes.  I know Beckett loves me; he shows me every day.  Still, how long will it last?\n\nWho will I be if the day comes when he no longer wants me?  What happens to the rest of our family if that day arrives?  Who will be responsible for everyone then?\n\nA girl’s night out might help some of the stresses and worries fall away.  I should have known my husband, my own personal caveman, wasn’t going to simply let me out of his sight.  Not in the dress I’m wearing where other men can see me.\n\nIt’s a good thing he’s so sexy or I might find him infuriating.  Turns out, he knows exactly what I need, and it isn’t a girl’s night out.\n\nBECKETT\nMy wife is a lot of things, including transparent when it comes to her thoughts and emotions.  I can read her as easily as I can love her fiercely.  I know she’s been battling her own inner demons, the ones which tell her not to get too comfortable and to prepare for the worst.\n\nShe forgets that I will slay her dragons because it wins me the heart of the only woman I want, the only woman who is mine.  She’s been stuck in her head lately while giving too much of herself to everyone else.  It’s my job to take care of her and I’m damn good at it.\n\nA girl’s night out isn’t what she needs.  She needs a little time away from the kids, from the family, from all the things she thinks she is responsible for.  I’m not the only one crashing the party, but when I cart off my wife, we’re not going home.  I have plans for her which will get her to shut off her brain and kill her doubts.\n\nIt’s time she and I had a little heart-to-heart.  Being naked during it is only a bonus.\n\nebook of Girl’s Night Out: https://amzn.to/3IZtN69\nMORE Ember Flint eBooks: https://amzn.to/3sXSLxi\nAsk Me to Stay: https://amzn.to/3sY5dgp\nAfter the Rain: https://amzn.to/3KtuBk8\nBanks Ink Series: https://amzn.to/3J0ilY9\n\nALEXA RILEY TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nOther AR Books Mentioned\nAn Avalanche of Love: https://bit.ly/3HSMAyV\nFlight Risk: https://bit.ly/3KugKtZ\nGuarding His Obsession: https://bit.ly/3pRTBts\nNot Yet: https://bit.ly/3KymClO\n\nOther Books Mentioned\nFIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE by Rochelle Paige\nA TREACHEROUS TRADE by Kerrigan Byrne\nBeverly Jenkins\nALWAYS BEEN YOU by QB Tyler\nPRISONER OF MY DESIRE by Johanna Lindsey\nTHE LAST ELIGIBLE BILLIONAIRE by Pippa Grant\nA WHIRLWIND MARRIAGE by Helen Brooks\nAFTER THE BILLIONAIRE’S WEDDING VOWS by Lucy Monroe\n\nRMR Ads\nTHE GIRL NEXT DOOR by Emma Bray: https://amzn.to/3CssFWo\nTHE FAE KING&#039;S CURSE by Jamie Schlosser: https://amzn.to/3CwJSOz\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
