Whenever there are more cars on the road, the speed generally decreases everywhere.  Indeed, this is the only mode that deviates significantly from zero at night and it deviates positive - the roads are generally completely clear at night and thus the speed is somewhat higher than average.  The second mode is an odd mode, which we attribute generally to directional traffic - when everyone is going to work it has one sign, when they are coming home it has the other.  We have previously <a href=\"http://efavdb.github.io/traffic-patterns-of-the-year-2014-edition\">visualized these two modes</a> and, indeed, these concepts are reflected in their spatial structure: the first mode is generally uniform while the second has regions with either sign and many sections of highway are positive in one direction and negative in the&nbsp;other.</p>\n<p>The time-dependence of these scores is remarkably consistent from week to week (See Wednesdays plot below of the scores for modes 1 and 2).  On the right, we plot the same quantities for several Sundays as well.  Not surprisingly, the fluctuations are smaller on Sundays than on weekdays, reflecting more homogeneous speeds in sparse traffic.  However, they are still reproducible from week to week - see Sundays Jan. 5, 12, 19, and 26 - apparently there is a slight slow-down around 6 pm.  Feb. 2 was Super Bowl Sunday and the traffic pattern differs qualitatively from other Sundays.  Remarkably, we can identify the time of the Super Bowl kickoff from this data - before the kickoff there is slightly more traffic than the average Sunday and immediately after,&nbsp;less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://efavdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WednesdayModes.png\"><img alt=\"WednesdayModes\" src=\"https://efavdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/WednesdayModes.png\"></a><a href=\"https://efavdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuperBowlModes.png\"><img alt=\"SuperBowlModes\" src=\"https://efavdb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuperBowlModes.png\"></a></p>\n<p>[1] <em>On projecting into principal components</em>: In the original basis, our data reads \\(\\vert x(t) \\rangle = \\sum_j a_j(t) \\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\), where the sum runs over all loop locations(there are some 2,000 loops in the Bay area) and \\(\\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\) is a unit fluctuation in speed at the location of loop <span class=\"math\">\\(j\\)</span>. Changing bases, to the principal components \\(\\vert \\phi_i \\rangle\\), \\(\\vert x(t) \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j} a_j(t) \\vert \\phi_i \\rangle \\langle \\phi_i \\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\) \\(= \\sum_i c_i(t) \\vert \\phi_i \\rangle\\) where \\(c_i(t) = \\sum_j a_j(t) \\langle \\phi_i \\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\). The coefficient \\(\\langle \\phi_i \\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\) is often called the “loading” of \\(\\vert \\ell_j \\rangle\\) into \\(\\vert \\phi_i&nbsp;\\rangle\\).</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) {\n    var align = \"center\",\n        indent = \"0em\",\n        linebreak = \"false\";\n\n    if (false) {\n        align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align;\n        indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent;\n        linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?
