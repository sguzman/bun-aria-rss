  "description": "<p><em><strong>Deconstructing Deconstruction: The End</strong></em>. Let's wrap this up, shall we? This episode, Mike presents six different categories that could be causes of someone deconstructing. Mike and Tim discuss how unhelpful it is to make a blanket “you’re deconstructing” condemnation of folks who could be found in any of these places. What are these different causes or places? How do we allow for journey and nuance in this? Is it more helpful to sit with someone in their doubt or questioning, rather than defining it for them? The six categories to consider, other than just Deconstruction: <strong>Disillusionment / Discipleship / De-conversion / Redefinition / Doubt / Disorientation.</strong></p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
