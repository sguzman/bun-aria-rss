  "description": "<p>Lucille Ball was a glamorous actress, producer, film studio head and comedian who was not afraid to get a little messed up if it brought a laugh. Her legacy as one of the funniest women - if not THE funniest woman - on television stands to this day. Like nearly all stars in Hollywood, her life was one of successes and failures. Her greatest success was the television show \"I Love Lucy\" and it has never been out of syndication. She was the first female to head a major Hollywood studio. The spirit of her comedy endures to today and it would seem Lucy's actual spirit is still here with us in the afterlife. Join us as we explore the life and afterlife of Lucille Ball. The Moment in Oddity features the Mushroom Death Suit and This Day in History was done by Carbon Lilies and features Socrates being sentenced to death.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be seen here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-105-life-and-afterlife.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-105-life-and-afterlife.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
