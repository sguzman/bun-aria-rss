In particular, anti-democratic trends such as increased voting restrictions point to a nation on the brink. “Full democracies rarely have civil wars. Full autocracies rarely have civil wars,” she says. “It’s the ones that are in between that are particularly at risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span>This segment was originally aired January 7, 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span>The segment also features an excerpt from “The Muddle,” a short story by Sana Krasikov.
