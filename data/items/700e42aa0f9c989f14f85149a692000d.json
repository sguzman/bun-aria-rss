  "description": "<p>Season 4 is here! In this episode we're talking about Black folk and water. Yes, swimming.  We hear from a man who nearly lost his life while on vacation, and take a deeper look into our relationship to swimming. There are a lot  of jokes and myths within our community about why we don’t swim more, but what isn't funny is that nearly 70% of African American kids don't know how to swim. Today, we break down stereotypes that we've even heard our own family members reinforce. </p>\n\n<p>Editor: Jen Chien Sound Designer: Seth Samuel Associate Producer: Natalie Peart</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>",
