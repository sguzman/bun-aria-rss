  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, serious allegations and evidence have emerged indicating that Joe Biden knew about his son's dealings and lied to the American people about it. This information has been corroborated by the CEO of Biden's shell company to collect money from China. Tony Bobulinski came forward to verify that the email is authentic and that he witnessed Joe and Hunter Biden discuss influence peddling. Democrats in the government and the media have falsely claimed that the laptop is part of a Russian disinformation campaign. This has been debunked by the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Bobulinski's statements that he was a party to the emails published and those were in fact the conversations he had with Hunter Biden. While Joe Biden claims this is a smear, Hunter Biden has not denied ownership of the laptop. Then, Author Peter Schweizer joins the show to detail his discussions with Tony Bobulinski. Schweizer added that the communist Chinese government-controlled energy company made a forgivable unsecured loan to Biden which equates to more of a gift than anything else. Later, Biden will hurt our economy and cost Americans their jobs. Biden's tax plan will strangle paychecks, and his energy policies will make gasoline prices skyrocket. Biden's anti-fracking platform will cause electricity costs to increase, along with black-outs and brown-outs. Afterward, Sen. Joni Ernst calls in with an update on her campaign and discusses how she's being challenged by a candidate hand-picked by Sen Chuck Schumer. Ernst described this election as the battle for America. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
