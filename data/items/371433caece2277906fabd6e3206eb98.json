  "description": "The questions are pouring in on IBM and Northern Dynasty (NAK)…   I’ve been bullish on each of these stocks in recent months. But after this week’s news, I have even more reason to add to my case.   On today’s show we start with IBM...   Warren Buffett just announced he sold off one-third of his position in the company, stating he “underestimated how much competition is in the space.” And later on said that he has revalued the stock “somewhat downward.”   It’s one of the very few investment choices Warren Buffett has made that hasn’t gone exactly as planned.   The stock price is down nearly 30% since Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested close to $11 Billion back in 2011.   And today, as all eyes are still on Buffett, IBM shares have pulled back even further.   But as I explain on the show, I’m taking a completely different stance… and explain why there’s still plenty of room for IBM to grow at these levels.   Let’s not forget, this is not a momentum stock trading at insane valuations with no dividend…   We’re talking a durable company trading at just 12X earnings. And is paying a 4% dividend yield which is more than double of what the average company in the S&P 500 pays.   Moving on, I then discuss the recent news surrounding NAK and the infamous EPA.   A settlement is expected to take place in less than one week. And from the looks of it, each party seems to be on common grounds.   Tune in as I explain why the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold mine should be everyone’s radar in the next couple of days.   Other topics talked about: Sandstorm Gold’s (SAND) recent merger… The current state of oil & gas… and why America needs deregulation before tax and healthcare reforms.  ",
