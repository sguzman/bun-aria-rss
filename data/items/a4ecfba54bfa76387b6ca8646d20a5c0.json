On August 4, 1892, the brutal murders of Andrew and Abby Borden were committed within the walls of their modest home, in broad daylight, on a busy street in Fall River, Massachusetts. It is today, 124 years later, still considered America's biggest unsolved murder mystery. Their youngest daughter, Lizzie, was accussed, and the bizarre case of how she did it, and why she did it, still baffles. But now, just in time for the 125th Anniversary of the Borden murders, comes new evidence: What if...there was proof of two murder plots the week of the murders? What if...for the first time...the identity of the two men the police and attorneys searched for, who were seen on the Borden property the day of, and three days prior to, the murders, are now revealed? What if...the police sent off the wrong items to be tested for poison? And, what was it Bridget saw from her attic window that had to be hushed up? It's all here. After five years of exhaustive research, Rebecca F. Pittman presents new evidence and photos, based on trial testimony, police reports and interviews. Never-before-seen photographs of Lizzie's Maplecroft mansion, and her bizarre behavior within its walls, are documented. Also included, are reports of the paranormal activity happening at the Lizzie Borden B&B today.If you think you know the story of Lizzie Borden and the events leading up to the murders of Andrew and Abby Borden...think again! Other books in Ms. Pittman's History and Haunting Series include: The History and Haunting of the Stanley Hotel, The History and Haunting of the Myrtles Plantation, The History and Haunting of Lemp Mansion, The History and Haunting of Salem: The Witch Trials and Beyond, and coming July 2020, The History and Haunting of the Palace of Versailles. www.rebeccafpittmanbooks.com where you can also sign up for her Ghost Writings newsletter.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
