  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat sits down for a chat with one of the most respected men in sports media. Former host of the Mike & Mike Show, current host of Get Up!, and one of the most prominent voices at ESPN, Mike Greenberg. They discuss his career transition from Mike & Mike in the Morning to Get Up! and whether he felt pressure to succeed, he gives his background on how he got to where he’s at right now, discusses the NBA Finals, talks about who some of the people he’s been most star struck around, and rants about the current state of the New York Jets in an incredible interview (2:27-36:13). Later, winner of the 100th Indianapolis 500, runner-up at this year’s Indianapolis 500, and one of the biggest stars in all of IndyCar, Alexander Rossi, joins the show. They discuss all the drama from this year’s 500, and he talks about what prevented him from taking the checkered flag, talks about the emotion he showed that gained him fans around the world, and chatted about how he thinks IndyCar is handling drivers becoming well known personalities in a hilarious and insightful interview (46:42-1:13:01). Pat and the guys also discuss why they think the concept of one-hit wonders are now dead, and Pat makes a statement about the whole Shane Morris situation. Today’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
