  "title": "PMS 2.0 189 - 4 Super Bowls, An NFL QB Summit, & A Genius Stop By For Chats. Stephen Gostkowski, AJ Hawk, Jordan Palmer, & Joe Schobert. Let's Have A Thursday.",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by 8 year NFL veteran and Joe Burrow's QB Coach, Jordan Palmer. Pat and Jordan discuss the different prospects that he has been working with for this class, his thoughts on both Joe Burrow and Jordan Love, and how the quarantine will affect both the teams involved in the draft, and how some players will be affected by having no pro day or being able to sit down with GM's and coaches (00:00:49-21:09). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss their upcoming NFL Draft special that will be airing in prime time, and everything else that is happening in the sports world (21:11-1:48:28). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, the NFL All Decade Kicker of the 2010's and current free agent, Stephen Gostkowski. Pat and Stephen chat about how his hip is feeling after having surgery this year, what it was like playing for Coach Belichick, which teams have been interested in him since the start of the offseason, how he anticipates his next stop being different, and what he's been doing to entertain his kids during the quarantine (1:41:30-2:02:14). Lastly, Pro Bowler, the NFL leader in tackles in 2017, and newly paid Jacksonville Jaguar, Joe Schobert, joins the program. Pat and Joe chat about why he ultimately chose the Jaguars, what it was like being in the locker room after the Myles Garrett incident, what it was like being a walk-on at Wisconsin and at what point he knew he belonged, how he's staying in shape during the quarantine, and he breaks down some of the things that an NFL linebacker looks at to know what the offense is trying to do (2:02:16-2:20:36). Make sure to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Stay safe and stay strong out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
