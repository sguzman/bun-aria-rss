  "description": "<div>The Catholic Church is half way through a two-year consultation exercise that will culminate in a 'Synod on Synodality' in the Vatican next year.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>A synod on what? Don't worry if you're confused. No one in Rome seems to be able to define synodality, either. What will the world's bishops discuss? Probably not the figures revealing how many Catholics have taken part in this exercise, because they're acutely embarrassing. The English and Welsh bishops couldn't even get 10 per cent of Mass-goers to take part in a consultation process that many observers suspect has been shamelessly rigged by Pope Francis's bureaucrats. And in Belgium, a country where some six million people identify as Catholic, the number of participants is somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Damian Thompson's guest on this episode of Holy Smoke is Ed Condon, editor of the influential Pillar website. His judgment is as impartial as ever â€“ but, make no mistake about it, we're looking at one of the most expensive and self-indulgent fiascos in recent Catholic history.<br>\n<br>\nProduced by Damian Thompson and Cindy Yu.</div>\n",
