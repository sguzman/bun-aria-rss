  "description": "Back in June 2020, during a summer of protests for racial justice, the <em>New Yorker </em>republished 'Letter from a Region in my Mind,\" a seminal James Baldwin essay calling out the ignorance of liberal white Americans. In the following months, writer Jelani Cobb put together a collection of essays from the magazine that fit a similar theme: Black writers, including Toni Morrison and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote pieces for the <em>New Yorker</em> about race and racism that still ring true today. In this interview, Cobb reflects on the essays and what it took for those Black writers to break into the magazine. ",
