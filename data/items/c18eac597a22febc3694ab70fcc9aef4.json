  "description": "<p>Every fall, the New York Architecture and Design Film Festival (ADFF) premieres the best new documentaries of the year. <strong>Kelsey Keith,</strong> the Editor-in-Chief of Curbed, was on the ADFF discussion panel for <em>Enough White Teacups</em>, a film by Michelle Bauer Carpenter about using design to solve critical human problems.  Host George Smart interviewed Keith at the Curbed offices in New York where they talked about the movie as well as Paris, Candide, and tacos.</p> <p>The <strong>Mmuseumm</strong> is New York's smallest, barely the size of a closet, and highlights a new model of curating modern artifacts. The New York Times Style Magazine included Mmuseumm on The Cultivist’s “Top 12 International Hidden Art Gems,” and it was called curatorial genius by <strong>Steve Heller</strong> at The Atlantic. Closed for the winter, it will reopen in the spring. <strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Greg Durrell</strong> is the producer of <em>Design Canada</em>, the first documentary chronicling the history of Canadian graphic design and how it shaped a nation and its people.  He is a partner at Hulse & Durrell, a Vancouver-based firm that develops brands, products and films for ambitious organizations to make a lasting impact. Their client list includes the International Olympic Committee, the Canadian Olympic Team, NBC Sports, and Square, that company whose terminals you're swiping regularly.<strong><br /></strong></p>",
