  "description": "<p>As we get ready to FINALLY experience the Olympic Games in Tokyo, it's time to celebrate another occasion first as we bring your our landmark 100th episode and celebrate with a very special episode that might be worth as much as an Olympic gold! Join us as we go over some of our favourite memories from the first 100 episodes, and then take a trip down memory lane in hearing the best bits of our show from episodes 51 right through to 99! There are some classic interview clips including snippets from each of the guests who have appeared on the show since our 50th episode, as well as going over highlights of our coverage from the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and even that time we wasted an episode talking about the Hobart Olympic Bid. It's one episode that you won't want to miss!</p>",
