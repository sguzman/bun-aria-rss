  "description": "Everyone loves to talk about electric cars. And, based on the success of Tesla, it seems like everyone wants to drive one. The strange thing is no one really wants to buy them. Less than 2% of the cars sold in the U.S. this year were electric. This week, Alex Eule talks to Barron's Jack Hough about whether -  after years of false starts  - we might finally be on the cusp of the electric car revolution.
