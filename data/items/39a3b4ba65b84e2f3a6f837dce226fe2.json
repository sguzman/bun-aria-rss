  "description": "In Episode 116 I sit down with Environmental Researcher Nicholas Carter to talk further about grass-fed beef and planetary health.\n\nSpecifically we cover:\n\n1 - Results from a new peer-reviewed study on White Oaks Pasture, a farm that for years has claimed their beef is carbon negative.\n2 - The importance of rewilding for cooling our planet\n3 - How changing the foods we eat can help free up land to be rewilded and protect existing forests\n4 - The GHG footprint of our food - how important is transport in this conversation? Beef versus Avocado as an example.\n5 - The UK's Regenuary movement and some of their claims\n6 - and much more\n\nResources:\n\nJohn Hokpkins University study published in 2020 which combined data from 140 countries and identified the single greatest way for someone to lower the GHG footprint of their diet was by adopting a vegan diet. Next best was a vegan diet with insects and molluscs and then a two-thirds vegan diet (2 vegan meals and snacks a day with one meal containing animal products).\n\nYou want to reduce the carbon footprint of your food? Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local. Article by Hannah Ritchie\n\nAuthor of White Oaks Pastures study acknowledging that their beef is NOT carbon negative and such claims are false.\n\n\nWant to support the show?\nThe single best way you can support the show is by leaving a review on Apple podcast app - it only takes a few minutes and would be much appreciated.
