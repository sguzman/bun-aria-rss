  "description": "<p><p>The conversation with Big Cat continues where it left off: With Kirk Minihane screaming at Steve Robinson to play bad radio -- much to Big Cat's delight. Big Cat tries his hardest to move from \"work friends\" to \"friends\" with Minihane, but he leaves the studio pining for a real text message rather than a DM. KFC joins the studio for a while and Minihane does not like getting tag teamed by two Barstool elders. Kevin Clancy ponders his future at Barstool and gets some negotiating advice from Minihane. Clancy declares himself the king of the Mincels.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
