  "description": "<p>We promised today’s guest, makeup artist Terri Bryant, that we would title this episode of the podcast “Makeup Artist Develops Revolutionary, Universally Designed Products That Make Makeup Artistry Better and Easier for Everyone”—but it was too long to fit! However, that’s exactly what Terri's done with her line, Guide Beauty. After receiving a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, Terri began working with experts in Universal Design and Inclusive Design to rethink makeup products and make them easier for people with mobility issues to use—which, of course, made them easier for everyone! Listen in as Terri shares her story, teaches us about the everyday products that owe their existence to pioneers of Universal Design, and explains why she’s on a mission to make applying cosmetics easier for everyone.</p><ul><li>All the products mentioned on Ep. 431: <a href=\"https://shopmy.us/collections/67427\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shopmy.us/collections/67427</a></li><li>Episode recap, links, and sponsor promo codes:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fatmascara.com/blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fatmascara.com/blog</a></li><li>Private Facebook Group:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/301355990240321/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Mascara Raising a Wand</a></li><li>Social media:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fatmascara/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@fatmascara</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessicamatlin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@jessicamatlin</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenn_edit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@jenn_edit</a></li><li>Submit a \"Raise A Wand\" product recommendation and be featured on the show:&nbsp;email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@fatmascara.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">info@fatmascara.com</a> or leave a voicemail at <a href=\"tel:1646-481-8182\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">646-481-8182</a></li></ul><p><br></p> <p>Become a member at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/fatmascara\">https://plus.acast.com/s/fatmascara</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
