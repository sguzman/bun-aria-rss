The CEO of Youtube created a free speech award, gave it to herself, and then did a video with a young YouTube creator in which she explained how she's using robots to police speech on YouTube. Welcome to the dystopia (0:22:30). More and more Joe Rogan episodes are disappearing because. Unlike YouTube, where robots decide what speech is OK, at Spotify the most offended person on the payroll gets to decide who Rogan can interview. Ryan Whitney joins us Wednesday. Episode Four of The Case is out today, so go give that a listen.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
