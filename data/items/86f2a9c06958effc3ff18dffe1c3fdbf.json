  "description": "<p>We’re looking at the parables Jesus tells in Luke 15: the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the lost coin, and the parable of the lost son. These famous parables not only show us how God’s grace changes us individually, but how God’s grace forms us into a unique kind of human community. </p>\n<p>The gospel creates a completely unique and distinct kind of community — a community the world has never seen. Let’s take a look at the sheep, the search itself, and the shepherd, and see what each one of those teaches us about how God’s grace creates community.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 28, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:1-10.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
