  "title": "A Very Square Peg: A Podcast Series about Polymath Robert Eisler. Episode 4: Women’s Coats and Beach Cabanas",
  "description": "In this episode, we examine the rivalry/friendship between Eisler and the great scholar of Jewish mysticism Gershom Scholem and reassess Eisler’s infamous meeting with Scholem and Walter Benjamin in Paris in 1926. We try to unravel the mystery of why Eisler was disavowed by his government after he was appointed to The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation. Finally, we take a look at the ambivalent reception of Eisler’s 1922 Orpheus lecture in Hamburg (he gets a spontaneous ovation but his attempted art theft comes back to haunt him) and his strained relationships with the pioneering German intellectual historians Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl. One question remains: how did Eisler’s frock coat get stolen?\nVoice of Robert Eisler: Caleb Crawford\nAdditional voices: Brian Evans and Chiara Ridpath\nGuests: Amir Engel (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem), Steven Wasserstrom (Reed College), and Claudia Wedepohl (The Warburg Institute).\nFunding provided by the Ohio University Humanities Research Fund and the Ohio University Honors Tutorial College Internship Program.\nSpecial thanks to the Warburg Institute and the Griffith Institute at the University of Oxford.\nBibliography and Further Reading\n-Eisler, Robert.
