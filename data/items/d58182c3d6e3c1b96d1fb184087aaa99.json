  "description": "In Episode #201, I welcome Dr Jed Fahey to The Proof to discuss phytochemicals and their impacts on human health. As a nutritional biochemist with an impressive resume, Dr Fahey is well positioned to educate on this incredibly interesting topic.\nIn this episode, we really dig into phytochemicals (also called phytonutrients). As well as hearing about Dr Fahey’s background, you’ll learn more about what phytochemicals are, what we know and don’t know about them, and to what extent they form an important part of human nutrition. We also cover the potential for negative effects, impact on specific communities including people with autism and Parkinson’s disease, and practical applications you can implement.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nJed Fahey’s Story (1:30)\n\nDiscovering Phytochemicals (8:57)\n\nOrganic vs Conventional (13:30)\n\nClassifying Phytochemicals (17:01)\n\nWhy we need them (24:04)\n\nUnpacking Plant “Toxins” (42:53)\n\nSulforaphane & How it Works (50:35)\n\nImpact of Gut Microbiome (1:10:54)\n\nFreshness vs Supplementation (1:14:54)\n\nResveratrol: Good or Bad?
