  "description": "<p>In ancient Greek botanical literature, there is a reference to a spiny plant called a <em>kaktos</em>. This word would pass into Modern English as \"cactus,\" though the <em>kaktos </em>itself was certainly not a cactus as we know it. More likely, it was an undomesticated \"artichoke,\" a plant whose name ultimately comes from Arabic. In this episode, we take a look at the intertwined history of these two words and the plants they designate. </p>",
