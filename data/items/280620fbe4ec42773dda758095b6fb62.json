Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) have been foundational elements of this government support.\n</p><p>\n\tThis webinar will examine the impact this research has had on national security and the overall economy. It will also discuss how these institutions have made use of testing to attain these security and economic goals. Finally, it will look at how these resources can continue to be leveraged in the further development of 5G technologies and beyond for future networks.<u></u><u></u>\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3955427/412CCC2ABF3FDA6A2F3EC0135093DD67\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this webinar!</a></p><hr/><p><strong>\n\tSpeaker:\n</strong></p><p>\n\t\t\tMURAT TORLAK\n\t\t</p><p>\t\tProgram Director, Computer and Network Systems (CNS)</p><p>\n\t\t\tMurat Torlak received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, in 1995 and 1999, respectively.
