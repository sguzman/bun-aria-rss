  "description": "<p>Awakening through Anger - The U-Turn to Freedom (2015-11-11) - Anger is naturally triggered when we feel an obstacle to meeting our needs.

This talk explores the U-turn that enables us to offer a healing attention to the feelings and unmet needs under anger. Once present with our inner life, we are able to respond to those around us with wisdom, empathy and true strength.</p>\n<p>“Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.”<br />― Mark Twain</p>\n<p>Free download of Tara’s new 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease” when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
