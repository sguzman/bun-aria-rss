Finds like chips made from egg whites, corned beef that is completely plant-based, a tasty chocolate milk that has 17g of protein, and SO MUCH MORE! Plus, mushroom jerky that Lisa declared as the best mushroom jerky she’s ever had! So put on those swimsuits (okay, you don’t really have to), push play, and enjoy this week’s episode! And don’t forget to head on over to our <a href=\"https://www.hungry-girl.com/pages/shark-tank-haul-episode-march\">Foodcast page</a> for a list of the products mentioned in the episode!</div>\n",
