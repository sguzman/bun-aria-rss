  "title": "PMS 2.0 024 - A Poetic Thanksgiving Celebration With AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat's former podcast cohost, Super Bowl winning linebacker for the Green Bay Packers, and the man who will be in the booth with him Saturday, AJ Hawk, calls into the show for a hilarious conversation. They cover what their gameplan is for the Texas Tech/Baylor game, and chat about a number of different things, including AJ's disdain for players who make other grown men squirt water into their mouths, his thoughts on pep-talks, and why he's excited to be in a 3-man booth with Pat (5:21-40:35). Later, the entire crew joins Pat to read the Thanksgiving poems they prepared, chat about the insane merch sale that starts today at noon at store.PatMcAfeeShow.com (and runs through Cyber Monday at 7 PM) and send you into the Holiday weekend with some Thanksgiving themed bangerz. It's a hilarious one. Come and laugh with us, and have a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Cheers.\n",
