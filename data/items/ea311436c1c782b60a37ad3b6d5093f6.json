I am talking about small odysseys\nthat, with the rhythm of a galley, launch his waking house \nin the thinning indigo hour, as he mutters thanks over\nthe answer of a freckled, forgiving back in creased linen,\nits salt neck and damp hair, and, rising from cover, \nto the soundless pad of a leopard or a mewing kitten,\nunscrews the coffee-jar and measures two and a half spoons, \nand pauses, paralyzed by a sail crossing blue windows,\nthen dresses in the half-dark, dawn-drawn by the full moon’s \nmagnet, until her light-heaving back is a widow’s.\nShe drags the tides and she hauls the heart by hawsers\nstronger than any devotion, and she creates monsters\nthat have pulled god-settled heroes from their houses\nand shawled women watching the fading of the stars.\n\n\"For Sigrid\" from THE BOUNTY by Derek Walcott.
