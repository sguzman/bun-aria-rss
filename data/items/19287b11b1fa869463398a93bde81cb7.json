On the other hand, being the only sibling to refuse would also cause drama you don't want to deal with. <strong>How do you balance being genuine with not calling someone a cruel person on their wedding day?</strong> We'll try to find an answer to this and more here on Feedback Friday.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
