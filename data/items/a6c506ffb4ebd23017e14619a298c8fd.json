  "description": "<p>Alexis Ohanian is the Co-Founder of Reddit, as well as the Founder of venture capital firm SevenSevenSix. As a builder-turned-technology entrepreneur, Alexis is focused on making the world a better place through novel projects and initiatives like Coinbase, Axie Infinity, Opensea, and Riverside (which we used to record this episode!)</p> <p>We explore how Alexis would rebuild Reddit for Web3, and how many emergent behaviors in the early days of Reddit and the internet are surfacing again—this time, on steroids with crypto-enabled communities. Alexis is concerned with empowering the good parts about internet culture, doubling down on the importance of community and culture.</p> <p>Tune in for sage advice on investment insights and investor cheat codes—where are the next opportunities? Wherever they are, Alexis is sure to be found there.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ZERION | Trade Across 7 Networks and 500+ protocols<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>  <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>  </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: </p> <p>👀 POLYGON | LAYER  2 DEFI<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Polygon\">https://bankless.cc/Polygon </a> </p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Across\">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>  </p> <p>🦊 METAMASK | THE CRYPTO WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/metamask\">https://bankless.cc/metamask</a>  </p> <p>💳 LEDGER | THE CRYPTO LIFE CARD<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>  </p> <p>🧙‍♂️ ALCHEMIX | SELF REPAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">https://bankless.cc/Alchemix </a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 6:00 Alexis Ohanian is Having Fun<br /> 8:57 Getting Into Crypto<br /> 16:40 Reddit and Web3<br /> 24:52 Emergent Behaviors<br /> 34:00 Rebuilding a Web3 Reddit<br /> 39:38 Internet Reputation<br /> 45:00 Permissionless Web3<br /> 53:52 What’s on the Horizon?<br /> 1:00:26 Seven Seven Six<br /> 1:04:10 The Case for Optimism<br /> 1:07:24 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Alexis on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/alexisohanian?s=20&t=YFn8AnfCSkaWdAxctt9QXw\"> https://twitter.com/alexisohanian?s=20&t=YFn8AnfCSkaWdAxctt9QXw</a> <br />  SevenSevenSix<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/sevensevensix?s=20&t=YFn8AnfCSkaWdAxctt9QXw\"> https://twitter.com/sevensevensix?s=20&t=YFn8AnfCSkaWdAxctt9QXw</a> <br />  Alexis’ Art<br /> <a href= \"https://opensea.io/assets/0xb6329bd2741c4e5e91e26c4e653db643e74b2b19/696\"> https://opensea.io/assets/0xb6329bd2741c4e5e91e26c4e653db643e74b2b19/696</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
