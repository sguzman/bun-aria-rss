  "description": "I, Daniel, am leading the show today… and this episode is all about Russia. [0:30] JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are catching the attention of politicians such as Elizabeth Warren over trading Russian bonds… I break down why—despite the bad perception for Wall Street—these banks aren’t breaking any sanctions. [2:35] But what about Main Street? Should individual investors have the option to invest in Russia? [7:25] Several of the world’s largest and most successful brands are cutting ties to Russia—including Coca-Cola, PayPal, PepsiCo, and McDonald’s, to name a few. I highlight one step McDonald’s is taking… that could create shareholder momentum. [12:15] If Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ends, and the sanctions were removed… would Russia become a buying opportunity? [21:10] Enjoyed this episode?
