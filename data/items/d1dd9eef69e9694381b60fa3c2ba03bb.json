  "description": "Having dreamed of space since she was a little girl, Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides wants to use the power of space to shift our perspectives, connect us with each other and our home planet and become the kind of species we would be proud to send to the nearest star. She studied astrobiology at Stanford and Caltech, and has done research on plant life in the Canadian Arctic with NASA, dove to the bottom of the ocean with Titanic Director James Cameron and floated weightless hundreds of times as a Flight Director for Zero Gravity Corporation. She currently teaches leadership and development, as well as mindfulness, to the staff at Virgin Galactic. She believes space and mindfulness have the power to bring the world together in a way that will help expand our minds and grow as a species.\nThe Plug Zone\nWebsite: http://lorettawhitesides.com/\nWebsite: https://www.thenewrightstuff.com/\nTwitter: @lorettahidalgo\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
