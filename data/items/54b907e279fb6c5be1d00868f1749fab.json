Remove the stem and top inch of each artichoke and boil in well salted water for 40 min to 1 hour. They are done when a leaf at the bottom of the artichoke can easily be removed with very little effort. Set them on a wire rack and cool for 1 minute, then turn them over and let them drain and cool for 10 more minutes. \n2. To make the sauce, mix the rue, celery seeds, and pepper together in a small saucepan, then add the olive oil, honey, garum and raisin wine and heat over a low heat until simmering. Whisk the starch into 2-4 tablespoons of raisin wine, then add it to the simmering sauce and whisk until it begins to thicken. Note that it will continue to thicken as it cools. \n3. Once the sauce is ready, pour a little on top of the artichokes and sprinkle pepper over them. Keep most of the sauce on the side for dipping. \n\n**Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
