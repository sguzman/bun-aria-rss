  "description": "By now, you know the higher education system in the United States is broken. You didn’t need COVID-19 to prove it.\nBecause even before the postsecondary education industry was forced to pivot to remote learning en masse, a caste system was rapidly bubbling up within its ranks: \n\nThe best of the best go to Harvard and become the ruling class…\n\nWhile everyone else perishes in a middle-ground limboland that’s left entire swaths of the population—often low income and often minorities—robbed of the opportunity for upward mobility.\n\nIt sucks that students can’t go back to campus to do things like learn and network and party in person. But that’s not the real tragedy. This caste system is, according to today’s guest and NYU Stern professor Scott Galloway. \nAs Scott sees it, the system has enabled us to completely lose sight of the importance of unremarkable students—those who might not be MIT material, but deserve a shot at college (aka the ticket to improving your socioeconomic standing).\nIn this episode, Scott tears apart that system (and almost every other system, for that matter) in a wide-ranging conversation about the future of higher education. Some buzzy sneak peeks:\n\nScott: “Harvard is a streaming video platform that costs $58,000 a year.”\n\nHe also says we’re headed toward a hybrid model of online and offline education that’ll bring with it a culling of the middle class of higher ed.\n\nIs there a chance big tech saves higher ed...?\n\nYou don’t want to miss this episode.
