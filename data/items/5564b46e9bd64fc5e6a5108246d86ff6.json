  "description": "<p>95% of people say that they're self-aware. But only 10-15% of people actually are. As my guest today says, that means \"on a good day, 80% of us are lying to ourselves about how much we're lying to ourselves\" and this blind spot can have big repercussions for our success and happiness. </p>\n<p>Her name is <a href=\"https://www.tashaeurich.com/\">Tasha Eurich</a>, and she's an organizational psychologist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525573941/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525573941&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Insight: Why We're Not as Self-Aware as We Think, and How Seeing Ourselves Clearly Helps Us Succeed at Work and in Life</em></a>. Tasha kicks off our conversation by arguing that our level of self-awareness sets the upper limit of our individual effectiveness and that self-awareness can be developed and is truly the meta skill of the 21st century. She then unpacks what it is you know about yourself when you possess self-awareness, how there are two types of this knowledge, internal and external, and how you can have one without the other. Tasha then outlines the seven pillars of self-awareness, the barriers to getting insights into them --  including falling into the cult of self -- and how these barriers can be overcome, including asking yourself a daily check-in question. We then discuss how two of the most common methods for gaining self-knowledge -- introspection and journaling -- can in fact backfire and how to do them more effectively by asking yourself what instead of why, and actually journaling less instead of more. We also get into why you should be an in-former, rather than a me-former on social media, how to become more mindful without meditation, and how to solicit and handle feedback from other people, including holding something called the \"Dinner of Truth.\"</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/selfawareness\">aom.is/selfawareness</a>.</p>\n",
