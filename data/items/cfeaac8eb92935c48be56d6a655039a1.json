  "description": "<p>Today’s episode is the second part of Laura’s interview with Kaillie Humphries, two-time Olympic Women’s Bobsled Champion, first female bobsledder to defend her Olympic title, and the most successful Canadian bobsledder in history. In part one, Kaillie shared the exciting story of her epic gold medal win on her home soil, and this week the conversation picks up right at that historic point in her life.</p>\n<p>Kaillie shares the stress, pressure, and expectations on her following her gold medal win and the preparation for her next Olympics. She talks about becoming a leader, her 2014 Olympic performance, what kept her wanting to continue to compete afterward, and her efforts to ensure equality and equity in her sport. Kaillie also goes into great detail about the verbal and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of the Canadian coaching staff and Federation in the lead up to her 2018 Olympics, the steps she took to address it, and  precisely why athletes are so hesitant to speak up about such abuses. The conversation draws to a close with her story of joining the USA Team, the grace and humility that both she and the team demonstrated during this transition, and her plans for the future. Kaillie’s story is one which ranges from the sheer joy of victory to the pain and personal agony of being bullied and excluded by those who should have been supporting and protecting her. There is so very much for everyone to learn from the perseverance, consistency, and courage she has shown throughout her life – listen in to today’s episode (and part one if you missed it) to be inspired by all that she has to share.</p>\n<p>Episode Highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The stress, pressure, and expectations Kaillie faced after winning gold and while working to defend her title, and how she dealt with these</li>\n<li>The story of Kaillie’s 2014 Olympic win, the role that consistency played, and what it taught her</li>\n<li>What kept her wanting to compete after 2014</li>\n<li>Bringing equality and equity to bobsled</li>\n<li>Dealing with coaching staff and Federation abuse and filing a complaint about it</li>\n<li>The effects of the bullying she received</li>\n<li>‘Coach’s discretion’ and how it can be used to threaten athletes</li>\n<li>The effects of filing the complaint and why athletes fear doing so</li>\n<li>Kaillie’s move to the USA team and the grace and humility exhibited by all involved</li>\n<li>What the next couple years look like for Kaillie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<p>“If we don’t win, at least I’m happy with how I competed.”</p>\n<p>“I wanted to push and see how far I could go.”</p>\n<p>“I was constantly being told that I was wrong, that I was incorrect, that I was letting my country down, that I wasn’t, you know, living up to expectations, that my teammates didn’t like me.”</p>\n<p>“These are people who are supposed to be looking out for you, and they don’t have my best interests at heart.”</p>\n<p>“They were challenges that I faced to the best of my ability and I handled them with as much grace as I possibly could.”</p>\n<p>“I am best friends with one of my biggest competitors – there is no need for people to look down on another based on hair, color, race, gender, it doesn’t matter what it is.”</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of what I consider verbal and mental abuse that had occurred.”</p>\n<p>“I needed to speak my truth, and I needed to hold people accountable, and I needed to make sure that moving forward I was in a safe place.”</p>\n<p>“Be who you are and respect other people for the fact that they’re who they are.”</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<p>The Pursuit of Gold homepage:   <a href=\"http://thepursuitofgold.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thepursuitofgold.com/</a> </p>\n<p>Laura’s Social Media:</p>\n<p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lala_the_diver/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/lala_the_diver/</a></p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheLauraWilkinson\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/TheLauraWilkinson</a></p>\n<p>Kaillie’s Social Media:</p>\n<p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kailliehumphries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.instagram.com/kailliehumphries/</a> </p>\n<p>Twitter:   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobsledKaillie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/BobsledKaillie</a></p>\n<p>FaceBook:   <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bobsledkaillie/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/bobsledkaillie/</a></p>",
