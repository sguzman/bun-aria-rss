  "description": "This week, the gals head south to Lone Star State to discuss some unique crimes and culture. Topics include a locomotive stunt gone awry, one very \"Lucky\" suspect, a violent man who intimidated an entire town for decades, and lots of Dr. Pepper. Crack open a bottle of Spoetzl Brewery Shiner Blonde (yes, we know it's not a wine), grab your fishin' pole and your aviators, and tune in for Waco Whackings.",
