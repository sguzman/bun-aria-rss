  "description": "<p>It's the episode that launched a million memes: Taylor Armstrong losing her mind at a party in Malibu. For our live show in Philadelphia, we decided to take a stroll down memory lane to Season 2, Episode 14 of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\" Our recap was so long (mainly because we were feeling like lunatics and going on a million tangents), that we've split the episode into two parts, with the second one coming tomorrow. Happy New Year!<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
