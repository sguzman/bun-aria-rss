    "media:description": "This video is an addendum to my most popular video, A Swift Introduction to Geometric Algebra.  It clears up some misunderstandings that have arisen from the original video, and then describes two useful ways of understanding the geometric product.  This also leads to a discussion of the other flavors of geometric algebra, such as PGA and CGA.\n\nIf you want to learn geometric algebra at a much slower pace, check out my video series From Zero to Geo.
