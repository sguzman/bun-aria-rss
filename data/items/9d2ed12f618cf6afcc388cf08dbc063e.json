  "description": "Have you ever visited the  Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown or the Evan Williams Bourbon Experience in downtown Louisville? It's time you meet Jeff Crowe who is the General Manager of Visitor Experiences for Heaven Hill. Jeff takes us through what each locations have to offer and gives some insight into how he can fairly distribute Parker's Heritage and William Heaven Hill releases\nShow Notes:\n\nDid you come from a hospitality background or whiskey?\n\nWas life a bit less hectic in 2013?\n\nHow has bourbonism grown since you have been around?\n\nHas it put more stress on your job\n\nTalk about each theEvan Williams Bourbon Experience EWBE and theBourbon Heritage Center BHC and what you will see in each\n\nHeaven Hill is unique that you don’t actually ever get to tour where the majority of the bourbon is made. Is there plans to open up Bernheim for visitors?\n\nI’ve always told people that they need to visit EWBE to break up the distillery visits because it’s more like a mix of a museum with video projectors. Most distillery visits get pretty repetitive but this breaks the mold. Do you know whose idea it was to build it this way?\n\nTalk about the history of this building because it was owned by the Shapiros at one point too.\n\nWhat is the wildest thing you’ve seen happen at either location? Someone trying to dive into the large glass of Evan Williams at the entrance?\n\nYou also spend time at the BHC in Bardstown. Even though these locations are only an hour away from each other, is there a different vibe or feeling the visitors get from each?\n\nIs there something one offers that the other can’t?",
