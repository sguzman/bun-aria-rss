  "description": "Another 2020 Democrat drops out of the race, and that candidate’s failure says a lot about the Democrats’ present dilemma. We will examine the fall out as another one bites the dust. Speaking of which, an explosive new book sheds new light on who Jeffrey Epstein was, and how he died, and if he died. A transgender woman—that is, a man—demands a gynecologist inspect the genitals he doesn’t have. We analyze why it matters. And Hong Kong protesters find hope in Swole Trump.
