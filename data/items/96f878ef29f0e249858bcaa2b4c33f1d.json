  "description": "With great fanfare Donald Trump did the presidential equivalent of stuffing a pair of athletic socks down his pants and announced the new defense spending bill.  It was, as might be expected, yuge.  Once again we will outspend China by four or five times and Russia by perhaps a dozen times.  Are we safer?  Does it matter that if we spend that much we can't have the schools, roads and health care system we need?  Does it matter that the future of warfare may be a lot cheaper than the old-style industrial military we keep building and rebuilding?  Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks and David Sanger discuss and debate.
