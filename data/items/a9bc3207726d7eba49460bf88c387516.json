  "description": "<p>After learning some interesting things about Kmarko, Kirk Minihane now feels a little remorseful and has decided to help the big guy out. Kirk responds to Dave Portnoy, KFC, and Big Cat, who took to The Rundown last night to talk shit and flaunt their own ignorance of cancel culture (0:19:00). Following Torii Hunter's allegations that multiple children have called him racial slurs at Fenway, the Red Sox are in full pander mode -- and this includes the radio propaganda arm of the organization, WEEI. Kirk reacts to the Red Sox's statement from last night and Hunter's interview on WEEI from earlier in the week (0:31:38). Then, Red Sox President Sam Kennedy actually answers a call from the show and agrees to an on the record interview, in which he states that the Red Sox have not been able to find any records supporting Hunter's claim about the incident with the children (1:04:30).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
