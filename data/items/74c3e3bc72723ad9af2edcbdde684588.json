  "description": "The Myth of the American Dream. Today we sit down with author D.L. Mayfield to discuss her journey and the road that led to her writing ‘The Myth of the American Dream.’ We talk about growing up as a pastor’s kid, missionary work and what it looks like to really love you neighbor. D.L. has had a rad and very practical undiscipling of the beliefs she was handed for what Jesus may actually have instead for her (and us). What does loving your neighbor look like with the people next door? What about refugees, immigrants and other displaced people? Who is it that God had in mind when advocating for the marginalized and the meek? What’s a ‘lock in?’ Who was Agnes United?\n\nWe also read some listener responses to “Jennifer’s” questions (from last episode) about how to reconstruct. This community continues to inspire and we are so thankful. \n\nYou can find D.L.’s book here: https://www.ivpress.com/the-myth-of-the-american-dream\nYou can follow and interact with her:\nInstagram & Twitter: @d_l_mayfield\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.  \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
