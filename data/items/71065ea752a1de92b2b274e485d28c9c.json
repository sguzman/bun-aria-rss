  "description": "<p>Another day of Beijing is in the record books and we're back to go over everything that happened and more on a day that brought multiple medals for Canada and multiple non-medals for Australia! How is Canada feeling with a couple more history breaking medals? How is Australia feeling after the disappointment of the snowboard cross? What are our actual thoughts on figure skating and does something need to change with it? Did we even need to watch the women's halfpipe when we already knew the result? Why does the OTP curse continue in a big way today and is in particularly special visual form? Do we feel athletes with doping violations should be eligible for the DAILY DALE? And why are Australian viewers really missing out on some of the Canadian coverage? Listen in to get your Olympic vibes sorted for another action packed day!</p>",
