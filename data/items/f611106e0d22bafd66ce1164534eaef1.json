  "title": "Ep. 796 - AOC Takes Brave Stand Against Rich Elites By Partying With Them",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the ruling class got together at the Met Gala last night to celebrate their wealth. AOC was on the scene in a “Tax the Rich” dress. Was it a courageous and rebellious display by the congresswoman, or rank, shameless hypocrisy? We’ll discuss. Also, a new poll shows that an increasing number of vaccinated Americans are cutting off ties with unvaccinated friends. Plus, Secretary of State Blinken admits that many of those SIV applicant Afghans we’re admitting into the country are not actually SIV applicants. And, a male MMA fighter enters the ring with a female fighter and beats her into submission. This is being celebrated as a brave and beautiful moment in sports history, but I have a different take. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
