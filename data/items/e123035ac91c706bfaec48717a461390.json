  "description": "Signs you need to spice up your sex life: Your idea of a great night is watching TV and then doing it in missionary position, you haven’t had oral sex since your birthday, you don’t remember the last time you had sex, and you’re pretty sure the best sex of your life happened a long, long time ago. Well, don't despair, sex can get better over time. You can reignite the spark in your relationship if you’re proactive about your sex life.
