  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is delighting in the cheating scandal surrounding Alex Cora and the Boston Red Sox. The story has everything: media corruption, watching an old enemy flail, and frauds embarrassing themselves. April Reign, the creator of the #OscarSoWhite movement, joins the show to talk about the lack of racial and gender diversity among the Oscar nominees (00:54:30).

No fanboys are more inconsolable over the Red Sox news than Jared Carrabis' crew on the Section 10 podcast.
