We crunch the numbers for you in this episode. So if you’re not biking, you should really give it another shot. People change- you’re not set in stone are you?! Just because at some point in time you decided that biking wasn’t for you, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t reconsider. And on top of the massive financial benefits there are a host of other additional advantages of riding more. Plus, we disprove a bunch of common excuses that are given as to why some folks can’t bike more, or bike to work. Then we round things out and share how you can begin incorporating cycling into your life, and how you can get riding today!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Fruited Boysenberry Blackberry Raspberry Hill by Southern Grist!
