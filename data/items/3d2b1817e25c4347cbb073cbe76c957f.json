  "description": "<p>Denise is out of town, so Diane is joined by special co-host Mom (Ann Student) on this episode! During February 1864, Camp Sumter was opened in Macon County, Georgia. Camp Sumter came to be known as Andersonville, and that is what it is still referred to as of today. Of all the prisons we have featured on the podcast, Andersonville Prison seems to be the worst thus far. This prison was opened to house Union prisoners during the Civil War and to say that it was overcrowded would be an understatement. The amount of prisoners who lost their lives at this prison reaches into the several thousands. And the prison was not open for very long. These kinds of conditions and numbers of death usually lead to paranormal activity and there seems to be quite a bit of it going on here. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Andersonville Prison. Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Laurette Vinson and features the cliff burials of the Igorot People and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features the visions of Bernadette Soubirous. Research Assistants: Jessie Harms and Ann Student.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-104-andersonville-prison.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-104-andersonville-prison.html</a></p> <p>Become and Executive Producer!
