  "title": "688 Maria Shriver on Reflections for a Meaningful Life",
  "description": "<p>“Everybody wants to be great, but I advocate that people already are great.” Things move much faster than they used to. The world is 24 hours a day, and people feel like they have to keep up. We have to post, we have to read, we’re comparing ourselves to each other on social media. Wayne Dyer says, “Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is rather than as you think it should be.” It’s so important that we take time to step back and reflect, so we don’t lose sight of what really matters. When we accept ourselves and everyone around us, we can experience a fuller life. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I dive deep into a lot of things that have inspired an incredible mother and human being: Maria Shriver. Maria Shriver is a journalist, author, and former first lady of California. She has received a Peabody Award, been a co-anchor on CBS and NBC, and is an emmy-award winning producer. Maria is a New York Times Bestselling Author a few times over. She works with Alzheimer's and helps with so many charities around the world. Maria’s been through a lot in her life, but she still shows up for all of us. I’m so excited about this one, guys. So get ready to learn all about faith, love and family on Episode 688. Some Questions I Ask: Do you think we’re doing too much as a society? (3:30) You’ve spent time with the most amazing individuals- are they typically happy? (8:50) How can parents raise conscious children to live meaningful lives? (12:20) Who has been your greatest teacher (19:00) Do you think we should be putting more women in leadership, or do you think that they should earn it on their own? (29:54) In This Episode You Will Learn: How social media affects your children (3:35) Benefits of church vs. the benefits of meditation Why successful people are more complicated than anyone else What to do when you’re triggered emotionally by someone next to you The greatest lesson Maria learned from her mom (15:20) The number one thing Maria thinks will heal society (27:30) Why faith, love, and family are the most important things in life (45:30)</p>\n",
