  "description": "<p>This paper describes the design, implementation, and user evaluation of an\nIoT project focused on monitoring and management of user comfort and energy\nusage in office buildings. The objective is to depict an instructive use case\nand to illustrate experiences with all major phases of designing and running a\nfairly complex IoT system. The design part includes motivation and outline of\nthe problem statement, the resulting definition of data to be collected, system\nimplementation, and subsequent changes resulting from the additional insights\nthat it provided. The user experience part describes quantitative findings as\nwell as key results of the extensive human factors study with over 70 office\nusers participating in two major pilots in France and Japan. The original idea\nfor this project came out from a diverse group of companies exploring\nchallenges of designing and operating smart buildings with net-positive energy\nbalance. Members included companies involved in the design and construction of\nsmart buildings, building-management and automation systems, computer design,\nenergy systems, and office furniture and space design. One of the early\ninsights was that maximum energy efficiency in office buildings cannot be\nachieved and sustained without the awareness and active participation of\nbuilding occupants. The resulting project explored and evaluated several ways\nto engage and empower users in ways that benefit them and makes them the\nwilling and active participants.\n</p>",
