  "description": "Jonathan Awde, CEO and President of Gold Standard Resources, gives us an inside look at what's taking place in the depressed gold sector.  He explains why two recent game-changing events could be a sign that the four-year bear market in resources is close to a bottom.   \nJonathan then talks about Gold Standard Ventures. The company owns one of the largest land positions in the Carlin Trend. This is home to some of the biggest gold discoveries ever made - including seven projects that have over 20 million ounces of gold each.\n \nGold Standard is a speculative company.   And Frank does not own a position in his newsletters or personally.  However, this is another junior mining name that should be on your watch list.  After listening to the full interview, you will see why the company has incredible upside potential once the resource sector bottoms.",
