  "description": "So do you have a slow Saturday afternoon, and need something to watch while folding laundry? Perhaps check out Netflix's heist movie <em>Army of Thieves</em>. It's also a prequel to Zack Snyder's <em>Army of the Dead</em>, and it stars that film's squirrelly German safecracker, Ludwig Dieter, played by Matthias Schweighöfer, who also directed the film. Dieter joins a rag-tag crew of bank robbers that includes <em>Game of Thrones</em>' Nathalie Emmanuel.  ",
