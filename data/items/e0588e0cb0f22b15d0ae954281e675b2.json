  "description": "New sexual assault allegations came out this week against prominent news, political and entertainment figures.  A few years into the #MeToo movement, what are our expectations about whether or how men accused of sexual harassment and assault can return to public life?  Also, crackdowns on political corruption in Chicago intensify, and cell phone use by audience members during performances has led to a heated debate in the theater world. Plus, Snoop Dogg's performance at a university this week causes controversy. Sam hosts this weekly wrap episode from member station WBEZ in Chicago.  His guests are Greta Johnsen, host of the 'Nerdette' podcast and WBEZ weekend anchor and Dan Mihalopoulos, investigative reporter on WBEZ's Government and Politics team.",
