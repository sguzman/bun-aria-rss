  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking!   Think you got what it takes to work with Jim Cramer?   My first question of the day comes from Jim himself. He’s looking for some help. And I promised him I would reach out to you - my listeners.   If you didn’t know, I worked under Jim for 5 years at TheStreet.com as an Senior Analys... And I have never had a better learning experience outside of that 5 year span.   It was a job of a lifetime. And I wouldn’t be here today without it. If interested in the opportunity, be sure to tune in for the specific instructions. I’ll see what I can do.   Moving on, and after some March Madness talk (sorry, I just had to mention my Jayhawks), we get back on track [14:40]. This is when I take a closer look at the gold stock, Timmins Gold Corp (TGD).   Tune in as I take listeners, start to finish, throughout my entire analysis process. These are my 6 never-skip qualifications before I make any mining investment.   This is the stuff that has saved me a fortune.   Special thanks to Zach, Darren, & Reymond.   Keep them coming! Just email your questions to me at Frank@CurzioResearch.com, with the subject line: Frankly Speaking",
