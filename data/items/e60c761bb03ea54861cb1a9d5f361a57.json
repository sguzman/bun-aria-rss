  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, makes headlines in the fitness industry for its ability to burn the maximum amount of calories in a short period of time. But HIIT is anything but a trend. In fact, high-intensity exercise is something that our genes expect, and as you’re going to learn today, it plays an important role in fighting inflammation, regulating insulin sensitivity, and fat storage in the body.</p> <p class=\"p1\">On this masterclass episode of The Model Health Show, you’re going to hear the amazing science behind high-intensity interval training. We’re going to discuss the different types of muscle fibers in the body and how they function. You’re also going to learn about how energy is stored in the muscles, and how high-intensity training can help tap into those reserves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">If you want to add high-intensity exercise into your training routine, I’m going to share multiple accessible, low barrier to entry methods you can incorporate.
