  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football doubleheader and what we know moving forward about all of the teams involved, and look ahead to tonight's Tuesday Night Football Games and make their picks to round out week 15 of the NFL season. Joining the program as he does every week, is the reigning NFL MVP, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about his performance last week in Baltimore tying Brett Favre's franchise record for touchdown passes, his thoughts on the new spot testing for Covid and how that is going to impact the team for the rest of the season, if he tries to bend his throws like Angelina Jolie in Wanted, the matchup this weekend on Christmas against the Browns, how special Davante Adams is, and more (11:08-42:43). Later, friend of the program and safety for the Buffalo Bills, Jordan Poyer joins the show to chat about his foundation and what they're doing around Astoria, Oregon, he and Micah Hyde's spat with the media earlier this year and if they take it personal when the media doesn't give them respect, how crazy it was playing against New England with the wind in Buffalo, what they need to do this week against the Patriots, and more (44:47-1:00:02).
