  "description": "<p>Marshmallows, lollipops, gummi bears -- we want them all! But we’ve all heard that eating a lot of sugar isn’t that healthy for us. So what’s the deal? Why do we like sugar so much in the first place? We’ll find out why our bodies evolved to seek out sweet things, and how clever humans invented a way to make food even sweeter. And we’ll get to the bottom of a confectionary conundrum from our co-host Zoe: are sugar rushes a real thing? Plus: Sanden cooks up some very sweet schemes and we have a new mystery sound for you to guess!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:<br>Mathnasium (<a href=\"https://www.mathnasium.com/\" class=\"default\">mathnasium.com</a>)</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
