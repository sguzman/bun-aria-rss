The government is, once again, set to run out of funding on Friday. And a record number of House Republicans have announced they're not running for re-election ahead of the 2018 midterms. This episode, host/congressional correspondent Scott Detrow, congressional correspondent Susan Davis, political reporter Jessica Taylor and political editor Domenico Montanaro.
