We hear from Brownsville high school teacher Mayra Delgado. After seeing her students struggle with connectivity, she co-founded a group called What the Fiber to address the problem. </p><p>Then, host Carla Harris sits down with one of the people that are helping to bring broadband to Brownsville, Rene Gonzalez. Rene is the co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Lit Communities, a company that helps cities develop their own fiber networks instead of bringing in an outside internet service provider. This not only connects their residents and businesses but allows the city to earn money by charging Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for use of the city network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
