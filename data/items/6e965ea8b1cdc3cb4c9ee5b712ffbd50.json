  "description": "<p>Underneath his over-the-top hair, makeup and outfits, RuPaul Charles believes that at the core “we’re born naked and the rest is drag.” It’s a radical way of interpreting who we are, but whatever we claim as our identity is considered our drag, he says. A pop culture fixture since the early 90s, RuPaul has preached a gospel of self-love and tolerance that has permeated American culture. Now more popular than ever, thanks to the success of his Emmy-award winning competition show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” RuPaul shares what he believes is the authentic meaning of “identity,” and how we can all see past the stereotypes and labels to discover true connection with those around us.</p>\n",
