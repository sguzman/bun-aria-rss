  "description": "In our series finale on Ayrton Senna, James, Joe, and Nolan relive that fateful moment on May 1, 1994, when Ayrton Senna crashed while driving in the San Marino Grand Prix. Senna’s’ untimely death at Imola was foreshadowed by multiple devastating crashes, and the death of fellow F1 driver, Roland Ratzenberger, who died on the same track just days before Senna. It was, maybe, the worst weekend in Formula 1 history. To this day, Senna continues to be an icon, and his namesake remains as being synonyms with greatness.\nFollow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey \nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes \nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
