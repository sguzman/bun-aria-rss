  "description": "In this episode, restaurant owner and bartender Marc Branden Shelton joins Fred from his LA County restaurant  Lock & Key Social Drinkery. Known for its enormous Tomahawk steaks, the Lock & Key survived the Pandemic \"barely.\" Shelton discusses the challenges of the past 2 years in the restaurant business, while his anti-snobbery beliefs have led to a strong bar program that includes nearly 300 bourbons. Shelton's also gone viral a few times, racking up video views nearly in the billions. \n\nFor the tasting, Shelton stands in front of his bar and just grabs random bottles to taste with Fred. They chose Blanton's, Elijah Craig (18 year for Marc and private pick for Fred), Stagg Jr. and more.",
