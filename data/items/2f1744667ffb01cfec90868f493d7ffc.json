  "description": "This week, host June Thomas talks to Spanish-language journalist and broadcaster León Krauze, who works primarily as a local news anchor in Los Angeles but also hosts a radio show and writes for outlets like Slate and the Washington Post. In the interview, León discusses the process of figuring out which topics and stories matter most to his community. He also describes what it’s like to have a hyperlocal focus and explains why his Los Angeles broadcast might differ from Spanish-language news in other parts of the country. \nAfter the interview, June and co-host Rumaan Alam discuss the skill it takes to be bilingual, and they reflect on a point León made about the difference between audio and visual media. \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, León shares some of the biggest misconceptions about the Latinx community in the U.S. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675.\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
