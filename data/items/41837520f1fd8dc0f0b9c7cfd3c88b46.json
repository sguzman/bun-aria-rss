  "description": "We’re continuing our conversation with activist, founder of the me too movement, and our personal friend and hero,Tarana Burke. We talk about: \n\n1. What Tarana would say to her twelve-year-old self that might have changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n2. Tarana’s life-shifting realization that her relationship struggles with her mother were not due to her mother’s lack of desire to love her well, but her lack of capacity—and how Tarana built more capacity for her own child.   \n\n3. The one thing Tarana said to her child that changed everything—and why Amanda now says the same thing to her children.  \n\nCW: We reference sexual abuse and trauma.\n\nAbout Tarana: \nFor more than 25 years, activist and advocate Tarana J. Burke has worked at the intersection of sexual violence and racial justice. Fueled by commitments to interrupt sexual violence and other systemic inequalities disproportionately impacting marginalized people, particularly Black women and girls, Tarana has created and led various campaigns focused on increasing access to resources and support for impacted communities, including the ‘me too.’ movement, which to date has galvanized millions of survivors and allies around the world.\n\nBook: Unbound: My Story of Liberation and the Birth of the Me Too Movement\nInstagram: @taranajaneen\nTwitter: @TaranaBurke\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
