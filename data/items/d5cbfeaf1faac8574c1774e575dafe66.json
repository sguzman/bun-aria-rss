  "description": "<p>I had several encounters 20 years ago on and around some property that’s in the family. My Mother had lived there and past away from drug and alcohol problems in ‘95. So I went up to her old house and started fixing it up as it was in pretty bad shape. But even though Mom and I never got along and I was never close with her or that side of the family they didn’t give me any grief about me just taking over the old place. No one else wanted it at the time. I was a teenager with my own home and my own ride. That combo tends to make boys think they’re men. Most of time everything up there was quiet and normal. But several events occurred over the years that scared me so bad I buried it deep inside and tried for years to forget about it.</p>",
