  "description": "Drew opens the show vexed by someone who was asking him about 'Big Pharma' and he attempts to have Adam help him understand what exactly he is able to do as a healthcare professional when someone has such feelings. They then review the breaking news (as we record) that the CDC has advised that fully vaccinated people do not need masks in indoor or outdoor settings save for some rare exceptions. They also review a clip of Adam on 'The Doctors' in late 2020 with some views that while controversial at the time, have aged very well. ",
