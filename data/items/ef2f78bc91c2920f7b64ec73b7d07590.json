  "description": "<p>The filmmaker, artist, author and general cultural icon John Waters visits the podcast this week to talk about his first novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/books/review-liarmouth-john-waters.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Liarmouth: A Feel-Bad Romance.”</a> The book features three generations of women in the Sprinkle family, and their very complicated (and antagonistic) relationships with one another. The first of them we meet is Marsha, an unrepentant thief and overall misanthrope; but Waters says he still wants us to root for her.</p><p>“She’s so crazy and so terrible that you can’t believe it at first,” Waters says. “And she’s quite serious about herself, as all fanatics are. No one in this book has much of a sense of humor about themselves, which, I think, can be played funny — the same way that when I made a movie, the main thing I told every actor was, ‘Never wink at the audience. Say it like you believe every single word.’”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Elizabeth Harris discusses the winners of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/books/pulitzer-prize-books-winners-finalists.html\" target=\"_blank\">this year’s Pulitzer Prizes</a>; and Dwight Garner and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. John Williams is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by The Times’s critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/books/review-tacky-rax-king.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Tacky”</a> by Rax King</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/books/review-last-days-roger-federer-geoff-dyer.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Last Days of Roger Federer”</a> by Geoff Dyer</p><p><i>We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.
