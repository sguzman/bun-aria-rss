  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler, and Gregg Rosenthal recap all the action from a surprising Week 7, starting with Chiefs-Niners (2:55). Then we hit Lions-Cowboys (9:33) and Buccaneers-Panthers (16:24) before Nick Shook joins to help cover Falcons-Bengals (22:36) and Browns-Ravens (29:40). Next, we discuss Giants-Jaguars (37:40), Jets-Broncos (45:06), Seahawks-Chargers (53:55), Texans-Raiders (1:01:15), Colts-Titans (1:05:17), Packers-Commanders (1:12:31), and finally close the show with Steelers-Dolphins (1:22:39). Along the way, the heroes try to decide which teams are actually good.</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
