  "description": "<p>Comedian Graham Kay has been fired more than anyone on Earth. Stand-up comedian Ari Shaffir, fresh off not appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast for two years and before that losing his own show 'This Is Not Happening,' now sits down with Graham to discuss the many times heâ€™s been fired.</p> <p>The intro covers some of Ariâ€™s own firings even though he left off getting fired from his own stupid show that heâ€™s just realizing now wouldâ€™ve been a solid thing to talk about instead of the same Dominoâ€™s story heâ€™s told like 80 times already. Although, to be fair, he wasn't exactly fired from that show as much as blackmailed and forced to step aside. Plus stay tuned for the outro where Ari also profits off another comedianâ€™s hard work.</p> <p>\"Chinese Democracy\" by Bill Burr (Official Blog of Comedian, Bill Burr: Tuesday, March 4, 2008): https://bit.ly/3i1GRgRÂ </p> <p>Connect with Graham!</p> <p>Watch Graham's special 'Graham Kay: Stupid Jokes': <a href= \"https://bit.ly/3vDmMkY\">https://bit.ly/3vDmMkY</a></p> <p>Check out <a class=\"mention-chip ytcp-mention-input\" spellcheck= \"false\" href= \"https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCoPACpprvFSHr5iiX-F-6ww\">Â @The Edge LordsÂ </a> podcast: https://bit.ly/3fBdTTt I</p> <p>nstagram: https://bit.ly/3yP9VxT |</p> <p>Twitter: <a href= \"https://bit.ly/3i5yhgV\">https://bit.ly/3i5yhgV</a></p> <p>Ari is back on the road, get your tour merch now! http://bit.ly/cattourshirt With Mark Normand, Dina Hashem, Mike Vecchione and Gary Vider at SoulJoel's Comedy Club - June 6 ðŸŽŸ <a href=\"http://bit.ly/souljoels\">http://bit.ly/souljoels</a></p> <p>The Music-</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti Flag - Youâ€™re Fired</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyaneed - Paintjob</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mungo JerryÂ </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take This Job And Shove It - Johnny Paycheck</span></p> <p>Â </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to BetterHelp and 3Chi.com for sponsoring this episode!
