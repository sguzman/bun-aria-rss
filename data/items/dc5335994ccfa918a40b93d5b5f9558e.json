  "description": "<p>In medical image analysis, low-resolution images negatively affect the\nperformance of medical image interpretation and may cause misdiagnosis. Single\nimage super-resolution (SISR) methods can improve the resolution and quality of\nmedical images. Currently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based\nsuper-resolution models are widely used and have shown very good performance.\nReal-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is\none of the recent practical GAN-based models which is widely used in the field\nof general image super-resolution. Unlike natural datasets, medical datasets do\nnot have very high spatial resolution. Transfer learning is one of the\neffective methods which uses models trained with external datasets (often\nnatural datasets), and fine-tunes them to enhance the resolution of medical\nimages. In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator\nnetworks of the Real-ESRGAN model are fine-tuned using medical image datasets.\nIn this paper, we worked on retinal images and chest X-ray images. We used the\nSTARE dataset of retinal images and Tuberculosis Chest X-rays (Shenzhen)\ndataset. The proposed model produces more accurate and natural textures, and\nthe output images have better detail and resolution compared to the original\nReal-ESRGAN model.\n</p>",
