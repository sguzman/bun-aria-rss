Just as amazing as the expansive beauty is how this neighborhood came to be, especially given everything that stood in the way. Collier Heights was established in the early 1950s, when redlining and racial zoning all put hard limits on where black people could live. Driving its development was a team of community leaders who used cold, sharp strategy, flipping the logic of Jim Crow housing segregation on its head.</p><p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=38330&post_type=episode\">The Epic of Collier Heights</a></p>\n",
