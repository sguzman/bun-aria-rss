  "description": "<p>I suspect most loyal&nbsp;<em>Mindscape</em>&nbsp;listeners have been exposed to the fact that I’ve written a new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Something-Deeply-Hidden-Emergence-Spacetime/dp/1524743011/smcarroll-20/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime</em></a>. As I release this episode on Monday 9 September 2019, the book will officially be released tomorrow, in print, e-book, and audio versions. To get in the mood, we’ve had several podcast episodes on quantum mechanics, but the “emergence of spacetime” aspect has been neglected. So today we have a solo podcast in which I explain a bit about the challenges of quantum gravity, how Many-Worlds provides the best framework for thinking about quantum gravity, and how entanglement could be the key to showing how a curved spacetime could emerge from a quantum wave function. All of this stuff is extremely speculative, but I’m excited about the central theme that we shouldn’t be trying to “quantize gravity,” but instead looking for gravity within quantum mechanics. The ideas here go pretty far, but hopefully they should be accessible to everyone.</p><p><em>Support Mindscape on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/seanmcarroll\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Patreon</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The end of this episode includes a bonus, a short snippet from the audio book, read by yours truly.
