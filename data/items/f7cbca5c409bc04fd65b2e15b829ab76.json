Well, kind of....</p><br><p>Following the exploits of Liverpool & Tottenham in the Champions League, we talked about the greatest comebacks in sport. We recalled names like Tiger Woods, Niki Lauda, Greg Le Mond & Muhammad Ali, whilst Michael spoke about two great comebacks he had witnessed - one in hockey and one in netball and John got all nostalgic about Kriss Akabusi. </p><br><p>UK Sport announced who their new chief executive will be this week.

It aims to get more people involved in the sport.
