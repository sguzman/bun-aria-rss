  "description": "<p>If you’re a leader, or… honestly… just a living, breathing human being, you make important decisions every day. And with every decision you make comes the pressure to make the right choice. That can seem daunting––even overwhelming at times. That’s why, this week, John Maxwell is going to teach four important components of great decision-making. This really is a practical lesson that you won’t want to miss!</p> <p>For the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede discuss a specific important decision they have recently wrestled through and how John’s principles rang true through the decision-making process. They also discuss the importance of vision casting and why leaders need to create environments where it is safe for the people to fail.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “DNA of Great Decision-Making Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Decision and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/How-Successful-People-Think-Change-Your-Thinking-Change-Your-Life-Hardcover_p_810.html\"> <em>How Successful People Think</em> by John C.
