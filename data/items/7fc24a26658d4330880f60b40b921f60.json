  "description": "<p>This summer, I gave a TED Talk at the TED Conference. My talk was about what you discover when you really listen. It was based on how making Song Exploder has changed the way I think about conversations and connecting with people. My talk came out today on the TED website and on the TED Talks Daily podcast, and the very nice folks at TED asked if I would also put the audio of the talk here, on Song Exploder. And I normally wouldn’t put this much of myself on here, but they asked, and like I said, they were very nice. I hope this isn’t too meta, to talk about the show, and what I get out of making it. But it also features some music, including beautiful cello played by Yo-Yo Ma, so there’s that to look forward to. Here it is, my TED Talk on what you learn when you listen closely.</p>\n\n<p>To listen to my song with Yo-Yo Ma, visit <a href=\"https://ffm.to/betweenthereandhere\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://ffm.to/betweenthereandhere</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For more, visit <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/ted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/ted</a>.</p>",
