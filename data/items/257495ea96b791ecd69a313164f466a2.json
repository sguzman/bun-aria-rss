  "description": "<p>For the case of nonlinear second-order differential equations with a constant\ncoefficient of the first derivative term and polynomial nonlinearities, the\nfactorization conditions of Rosu and Cornejo-Perez are approached in two ways:\n(i) by commuting the subindices of the factorization functions in the two\nfactorization conditions and (ii) by leaving invariant only the first\nfactorization condition achieved by using monomials or polynomial sequences.\nFor the first case the factorization brackets commute and the generated\nequations are only equations of Ermakov-Pinney type. The second modification is\nnon commuting, leading to nonlinear equations with different nonlinear force\nterms, but the same first-order part as the initially factored equation. It is\nillustrated for monomials with the examples of the generalized Fisher and\nFitzHugh-Nagumo initial equations. A polynomial sequence example is also\nincluded.\n</p>",
