  "description": "New for 2020, it’s Scotch Pursuit! Ok, not really. But what better way to start the new year by trying something new and having Dr. Rachel Barrie, the master blender for The GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh of Brown-Forman, come and show us the ropes. We talk about malting, peat, Glens and Bens, rules and regulations to be considered a scotch, the temperatures and more. This is a fantastic 101 to the scotch world and even made us, not so much scotch curious, but more single malt curious. Since this recording, we’ve tried numerous single malts and found some great ones. If you have an “entry Scotch” for bourbon drinkers, drop it here in the comments.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about Al Young.\n\nWhy all the Glens and Bens?\n\nDoes the altitude affect the whiskey?\n\nTalk about growing up around scotch.\n\nTell us about your doctorate.\n\nTell us about the the brands.\n\nWhat is an old school malt?\n\nHow do you keep malts consistent?\n\nWhat is malting?\n\nWhat is the process for making scotch?\n\nWhat kind of stills do you use?\n\nWhat is your favorite cask?\n\nHow do you make a blend?\n\nHow old does scotch have to be legally?\n\nIs there a lot of evaporation loss in the barrel?\n\nWhat proof does BenRiach come out of the barrel?\n\nHow many barrels are in a typical batch?\n\nDo you have a team helping you blend?\n\nIs there a limit to the number of times you can use a barrel?\n\nTell us about the special releases.",
