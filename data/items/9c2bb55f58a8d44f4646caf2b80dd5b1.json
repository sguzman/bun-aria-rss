  "description": "<p>This week, we're discussing the challenges of finding time to make our art when we all have so much else going on. Many of us balance family, work and art-making and then somewhere in there, we also need to find time to market the work and manage the admin side of things. This means posting on social media, managing a website, keeping inventory, dealing with galleries, communicating with buyers, packing and shipping, doing our accounts .... the list goes on and, truthfully, it can be a challenge. Neither of us claim to have this all worked out, but we have found some ways to make things a little easier on ourselves. These solutions include creating good systems, asking for help, making clear choices, and being careful not to bite off more than you can reasonably chew (something we both find easier to say than to do!)</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Laura Horne Art podcast <a href=\"//\">https://www.laurahornart.com/thepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Unforgotten &nbsp;<a href=\"//\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mLwTNqJLRw</a></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/\"><u>www.alicesheridan.com</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
