  "description": "<p>Ex-jailer Vicky White commits suicide as cops close in on her and fellow fugitive Casey White. &nbsp;Authorities tracked down the Alabama outlaws to a motel in Evansville, Indiana. The pair attempted to flee when they realized police had found them, which led to a chase.&nbsp; &nbsp;A newly released&nbsp; 911 call appears to contain the last words of Vicky White. As sirens screech in the background,&nbsp; a woman&rsquo;s voice says, \"Airbags are going off! Let&rsquo;s get out and run! We never should have left the hotel.\"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dashcam video also reveals that when the vehicle rolled over, police could see that Vicky was holding a gun to her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;She still has the gun in her hands,&rdquo; one officer says in the video. &ldquo;Finger&rsquo;s on the trigger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vicky White was hospitalized and died hours later. Casey White was extradited back to Alabama, where he has been charged with first-degree escape. He is already facing capital murder charges in connection with the death of Connie Ridgeway in 2015.</p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sheriff Rick Singleton - Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office, Facebook: \"Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>James Shelnutt - 27 years Atlanta Metro Area Major Case Detective, Former S.W.A.T. officer, Attorney, The Shelnutt Law Firm, P.C., www.ShelnuttLawFirm.com, Twitter: @ShelnuttLawFirm&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Lenny DePaul - Former Chief Inspector/Commander U.
