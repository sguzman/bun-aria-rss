After being diagnosed with hypothyroidism in high school, Kiersten was placed on thyroid supplementation that helped her lose about 60 pounds â€“ but since then, itâ€™s been an up and down roller coaster.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheâ€™s experienced times where she was able to lose weight, trying things like a keto diet, working with a weight loss coach, and being on a strict exercise regimen. But after experiencing some personal hardships a few years ago, she gained all her weight back. Now the heaviest sheâ€™s ever been with about 100 pounds sheâ€™d like to lose, Kiersten is wondering where to go from here. Equally, sheâ€™s trying to figure out how she can quiet the voice of self-criticism, and see herself and her journey in a kind and loving way â€“ something more important than ever to Kiersten as she seeks to heal the abuse she experienced as a child.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tune into this powerful and potent episode, where we take a special look at the role of childhood abuse and abandonment, and how that shows up in how we speak to ourselves as adults â€“ regardless of our bodyâ€™s shape or size.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">--------------------</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Â </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ðŸ‘‰ Weâ€™re now enrolling for the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training!
