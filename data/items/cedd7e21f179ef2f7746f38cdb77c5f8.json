OP's stupid manager decides to go on a power trip and orders OP to help him out instead of collecting trays. OP happily complies, causing dishes to pile up across the entire hotel. Eventually, high-level executives at the hotel notice that something is wrong, so they ask OP why she isn't doing her job. OP happily reports that her idiotic manager won't let her do what she's supposed to do. Say goodbye to your job, manager!</p>\n",
