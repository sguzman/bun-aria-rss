  "description": "<p>We revisit the search for heavy neutral leptons with the Big European Bubble\nChamber in the 1982 proton beam dump experiment at CERN, focussing on those\nheavier than the kaon and mixing only with the tau neutrino, as these are far\nless constrained than their counterparts with smaller mass or other mixings.\nRecasting the previous search in terms of this model and including additional\nproduction and decay channels yields the strongest bounds to date, up to the\ntau mass. This applies also to our updated bounds on the mixing of heavy\nneutral leptons with the electron neutrino.\n</p>",
