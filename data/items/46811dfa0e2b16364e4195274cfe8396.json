    "media:description": "The Hodge Conjecture is one of the deepest problems in analytic geometry and one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems worth a million dollars, offered by the Clay Mathematical Institute in 2000. It consists of drawing shapes known topological cycles on special surfaces called projective manifolds, and proposes that similar shapes known as algebraic cycles can be used to model them, provided that the rotation number is zero.\n\nThe Hodge Conjecture has been looked over by numerous mathematicians, some of them so famous that it sounds almost like name-dropping: Alexander Grothendieck, Micheal Atiyah, John Tate, and John Nash, among others. It was proposed by William Hodge in 1948 in his book Theory and Application of Harmonic Integrals and gained fame once he gave a seminar on it in Cambridge during the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950.\n\nIn this video I attempt to give an intuitive picture of the Hodge Conjecture and also a small overview of Algebraic Geometry in general. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic Credits:\n\nInspired by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired/\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWind Of The Rainforest Preview by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5729-wind-of-the-rainforest-preview\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nMusic: https://www.purple-planet.com\n\nhttp://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImage Credits:\n\nKlein Bottle: Tttrung / CC BY-SA (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\nZinc replacement Copper reaction: Qiang Fu / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nPause Button: Fabián Alexis / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)\nProjective Space: Original: Mark.Howison at English Wikipedia This version: CheChe / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\nHirzebruch: Konrad Jacobs / CC BY-SA 2.0 DE (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/de/deed.en)\nHodge's House:Stephencdickson / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSources and Citations:\n\n1) John Forbes Nash, Michael Th.
