  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio explores The Life, Near Death & Miracles of Charlie Gardner<br>\n </p>\n\n<p>Today Dave and Tim uncover A Near-Death Experience You Won’t Forget!</p>\n\n<p>Sure, near-death experiences are fairly common, but Charles (Charlie) Gardner’s experience may take the cake when it comes to pathos, humor, and life lessons. Nine years ago, when he developed sepsis while recovering from the flu, Charlie spent six weeks in a coma, suffered 13 strokes and major organ failure.<br>\n<br>\nIn the near-death experience that accompanied that ordeal, Charlie had the requisite out-of-body experience but the bright light he saw was something altogether different!  This is a look at his life leading up to the incident, during the experience and the aftermath of this enigma.<br>\n<br>\nGet the book here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2YbZLpZ\">https://bit.ly/2YbZLpZ</a></p>\n\n<p>Visit his site here: <a href=\"http://www.charlesgardnerauthor.com/\">www.CharlesGardnerAuthor.com</a></p>\n",
