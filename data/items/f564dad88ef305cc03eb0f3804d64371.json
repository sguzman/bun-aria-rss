  "description": "<p>Ann writes, “Last year, in spring I had an experience that has significantly and profoundly affected my life in such a way that I am no longer able to enjoy the past times that I have been so deeply in love with since a child. In place of the lengthy carefree and joyful, stress free experience that our mountains have been my visits are now anxious and brief. I am frightened almost to the point of giving into a need to flee. Never do I go exploring outside of eyesight and its so bad that I feel no joy or peace there anymore. It just feels like I dont want to go there, to stay away.</p> <p>I believe I was stalked and followed by a creature. This has left me pretty much paralyzed with fear. I am an outdoors woman deluxe…reduced to being afraid to venture out beyond the confines of my own yard. I know it was a Sasquatch. All the way down to my soul I know what it was.”</p> <p> </p> <p>We will also be speaking to Jim who is a Bigfoot Researcher, and he will be sharing his encounters with us. Jim said, “We experience a lot of strange things but the area we go to is known to be haunted but things got really strange when I went on a ghost hunt in Tombstone, Arizona...\"</p>",
