He talks with Joe about Oculus and all new VR shit which was super interesting. Penn Jilette is a wizard... lol well he's a great magician and comedian. He's had so many great shows and opinions over the years and it's really cool to hear Joe and him catch up.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
