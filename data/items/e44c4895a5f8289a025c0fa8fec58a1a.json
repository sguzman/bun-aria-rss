  "description": "<p>Homesteading with kids isn’t for the faint of heart, but if you’re up for the challenge it will certainly make an incredible impact on their lives.  I know with our kids, life on the homestead has taught them the value of hard work, how to establish boundaries, and how to be creative.  More than anything, perhaps the most valuable lessons kids can learn is learning how to fail.  If you’v ever doubted your decision to raise your kids on the homestead, I encourage you to listen to this episode.  It’s sure to erase that doubt and help you understand why raising a prairie kid (as I like to call mine) is one of the best gifts you could ever give them. </p><p>A BIG thank you to Remond’s Real Salt for being our podcast sponsor for the month of June! <a href='http://theprairiehomestead.com/salt'>http://theprairiehomestead.com/salt</a> Redmonds is my #1 go-to salt for cooking and food preservation.
