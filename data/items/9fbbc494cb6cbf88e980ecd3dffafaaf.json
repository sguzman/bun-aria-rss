  "description": "The last time Andrew Yang was on the podcast, he was just beginning his long shot campaign for the presidency. Now, he’s fresh off a speaking slot at the Democratic convention, and, as he reveals here, talking to Joe Biden about a very specific role in a Biden administration. \nWhich is all to say: A lot has changed for Andrew Yang in the past few years. And even more has changed in the world. So I asked Yang back on the show to talk through this new world, and his possible role in it. Among our topics:\n- Could a universal basic income be the way we rebuild a fairer economy post-coronavirus? \n- What’s changed in AI, and its likely effect on the economy, over the past five years? \n- What’s the one mistake Yang wishes the Democratic Party would stop making? \n- What did he learn from the surprising success of his own campaign? \n- What job is he talking to Joe Biden about taking if Democrats win in November? \n- Democrats think of themselves as the party of government. So why don’t they care more about making government work? \n- How can Democrats get away with endlessly claiming to support ideas they have no actual intention of passing?\n- Do progressives have an overly dystopic view of technology?\n- Is there a way to pull presidential campaigns out of value statements, and into real plans for governing?\n- The unusual power Joe Biden holds in American politics\nAnd much more.\nReferences: \nVox's Kelsey Piper's piece on GPT-3 \nMy previous podcast with Andrew Yang \nEzra's piece on \"Why we can't build\" \nBook recommendations:\nZucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe by Roger McNamee\nThey Don't Represent Us by Lawrence Lessig \nHumankind by Rutger Bregman\n\nThis podcast is part of a larger Vox project called The Great Rebuild, which is made possible thanks to support from Omidyar Network, a social impact venture that works to reimagine critical systems and the ideas that govern them, and to build more inclusive and equitable societies.
