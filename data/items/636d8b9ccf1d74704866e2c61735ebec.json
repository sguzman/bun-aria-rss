  "description": "<p>The availability of Martian atmospheric data provided by several Martian\nmissions broadened the opportunity to investigate and study the conditions of\nthe Martian ionosphere. As such, ionospheric models play a crucial part in\nimproving our understanding of ionospheric behavior in response to different\nspatial, temporal, and space weather conditions. This work represents an\ninitial attempt to construct an electron density prediction model of the\nMartian ionosphere using machine learning. The model targets the ionosphere at\nsolar zenith ranging from 70 to 90 degrees, and as such only utilizes\nobservations from the Mars Global Surveyor mission. The performance of\ndifferent machine learning methods was compared in terms of root mean square\nerror, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute error. The bagged\nregression trees method performed best out of all the evaluated methods.\nFurthermore, the optimized bagged regression trees model outperformed other\nMartian ionosphere models from the literature (MIRI and NeMars) in finding the\npeak electron density value, and the peak density height in terms of\nroot-mean-square error and mean absolute error.\n</p>",
