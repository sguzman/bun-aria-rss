I am by no means against self driving vehicles in any way! I'd much rather spend my time in a vehicle reading, watching videos, or talking to my family and friends &#x2026; anything, really, instead of driving. I also think fully autonomous vehicles are a fascinating, incredibly challenging computer science problem, and I want everyone reading this to take it as just that, a <em>challenge</em>. Prove me wrong! Make it happen by 2030, and I'll be popping champagne along with you and everyone else!</p><p>(My take on VR is <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/i-tried-vr-and-it-was-just-ok/\">far more pessimistic</a>. VR just&#x2026; isn't going to happen, in any \"changing the world\" form, in our lifetimes. This is a subject for a different blog post, but I think AR and projection will do much more for us, far sooner.)</p><p>I'd like to thank John for suggesting this friendly wager as a fun way to generate STEM publicity. He is, and always will be, <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/you-dont-need-millions-of-dollars/\">one of my biggest heroes</a>. Go read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812972155/codihorr-20\">Masters of Doom</a> if you haven't, already!</p><p>And while I have you, we're still looking for code contributions in our project to <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/\">update the most famous programming book of the BASIC era</a>. Proceeds from that project will also go to charity. &#x1F60E;</p><p>* We may adjust the amount up or down to adjust for inflation as mutually agreed upon in 2030, so the money has the desired impact.</p>"
