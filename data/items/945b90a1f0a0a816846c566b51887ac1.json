  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is checking up on your New Years resolutions and lending a helping hand chatting with author Leda Scheintaub about her book “The Whole Bowl: Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free Soups and Stews,” co-written by Rebecca Wood. Gluten-free and dairy-free recipes and cookbooks abound these days, yet there’s not been a great book exclusively about soups and stews. Leda shares with Cathy just how she and Rebecca developed a delicious and satisfying set of recipes to fill this gap complete with more than fifty recipes accompanied by beautiful photographs, not to mention nutritious delights, ranging from staples like a hearty vegetarian stock that will be the base for many other soups to exciting new possibilities like Congee Five Ways or Quinoa Hokkaido Pottage. No winter’s day should be without a delicious bowl of great soup! Tune in to hear the background and fun details behind putting the book together.
