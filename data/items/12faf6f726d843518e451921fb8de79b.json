Robots as a means of questioning what it is to be human, and highlighting the ethics behind the creation of artificial life. \n\n\n\nTo help me explore all of this I chatted to a roboticist who also writes about literature, and a literature professor who has worked and published extensively on robotics.\n\n\n\nSupport WTTE by becoming a member of HeadStuff+\n\n\n\nFor links, references, full transcripts and more head to wttepodcast.com",
