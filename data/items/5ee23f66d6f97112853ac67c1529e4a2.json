  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 57: Featuring Tim Jackman",
  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 57, Whits and RA open up discussing the MVP-quality performance from Brad Marchand, shrinking crowds in Detroit, the free-falling Senators and corresponding trade chatter, the official retirement of Chris Neil, and much more. The fellas then welcome Tim Jackman to the show to explain his interesting side of the long-percolating beatdown of Whits that resulted in one of hockey's greatest photos. He talks about how, when trying to break into the National, he was not only asked to fight much more but also was told he needed to start winning more. Jackman also fills us in on what he's been up to since hanging up the blades, his favorite things about his NHL career stops, and more. The boys close up with #AllRightHamilton and “Yoda” briefly pops in to torment Whits.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
