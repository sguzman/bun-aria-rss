  "description": "<p>We propose a principled way to define Gaussian process priors on various sets\nof unweighted graphs: directed or undirected, with or without loops. We endow\neach of these sets with a geometric structure, inducing the notions of\ncloseness and symmetries, by turning them into a vertex set of an appropriate\nmetagraph. Building on this, we describe the class of priors that respect this\nstructure and are analogous to the Euclidean isotropic processes, like squared\nexponential or Mat\\'ern. We propose an efficient computational technique for\nthe ostensibly intractable problem of evaluating these priors' kernels, making\nsuch Gaussian processes usable within the usual toolboxes and downstream\napplications. We go further to consider sets of equivalence classes of\nunweighted graphs and define the appropriate versions of priors thereon. We\nprove a hardness result, showing that in this case, exact kernel computation\ncannot be performed efficiently. However, we propose a simple Monte Carlo\napproximation for handling moderately sized cases. Inspired by applications in\nchemistry, we illustrate the proposed techniques on a real molecular property\nprediction task in the small data regime.\n</p>",
