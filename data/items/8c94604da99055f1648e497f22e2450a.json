  "description": "There is always going to be reasons to take up on offense. The people that are around us are one thing but how about the people that you have never met. Think twice about taking any offense, we have to recognize whats happening when we are frustrated and when we are going in the circle of offense. We have to learn to drop it and let it go, the quicker we let go of offense the more free we are going to be. We cannot take debate of offense and live in victory, joy and peace.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
