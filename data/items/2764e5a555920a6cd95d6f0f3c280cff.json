  "description": "<div>HELLO Friends ! <br>\nI wanted to talk today about Rebecca Corium and her disappearance. The story is odd, you never get straight answers and ONCE AGAIN a big company just ignores and shuts down requests from the family to further investigate. <br>\n There are also many other reports of what was heard/seen but its hard to verify what is true or just rumors. There was also a flip flop found that Disney said belonged to Rebecca but was later proven to not be hers. I didn’t mention that part because, it was just another distraction set up by the company. <br>\n I hope Rebeccas family has found some sort of peace or can find their peace and closure, we all deserve that and its so confusing to me why this happens. <br>\n Love and appreciate you guys so much, I hope you have a good day. <br>\nx o<br>\nBailey Sarian<br>\n<br>\nIf you haven't already, subscribe to my YouTube @BaileySarian!</div>\n",
