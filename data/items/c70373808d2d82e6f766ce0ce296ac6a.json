  "description": "I&rsquo;ve been interested in the area of causal inference in the past few years. In my opinion it&rsquo;s more exciting and relevant to everyday life than more hyped data science areas like deep learning. However, I&rsquo;ve found it hard to apply what I&rsquo;ve learned about causal inference to my work. Now, I believe I&rsquo;ve finally found a book with practical techniques that I can use on real problems: Causal Inference by Miguel Hernán and Jamie Robins."
