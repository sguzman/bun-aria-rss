  "description": "<p>Savannah, Georgia is a city shaped by unique people and compelling events. There have been battles, devastating fires, murders and so much more that has led this quaint city to be deemed one of the most haunted in America. Ghosts stories and legends thrive beneath the canopy of spanish moss draped live oak trees. Stately historical mansions carry histories dating back centuries and each seems to have supernatural story of its own. The oldest hotel in Savannah is the 17 Hundred 90 Restaurant and Inn, which was built in 1820. There are stories that up to three ghosts haunt the property. The most famous is the ghost that stays in Room 204 and whom everybody refers to as Anne. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the 17 Hundred 90 Inn. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Tammie McCarroll-Burroughs and features Mike the Headless Chicken and This Month in History features President Grover Cleveland's secret cancer surgery. Our location was suggested by Sarah Kovensky.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/07/hgb-ep-210-17-hundred-90-inn.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/07/hgb-ep-210-17-hundred-90-inn.html</a></p> <p>Want access to over 80 bonus episodes featuring haunts connected to crimes, ghost animals and fun interview extras and outtakes?
