  "title": "PMS 2.0 202 - Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane, Hue Jackson, & Legend, AJ Hawk Are Here For A Great Tuesday. Let's Go.",
  "description": "Today’s show is a loaded one. First, Pat welcomes Buffalo Bills General Manager Brandon Beane to the program. Pat and Brandon discuss the Bills attempting to trade for a WR last year, and why they eventually made a move to bring in Stefon Diggs, deciding to empower Josh Allen as their starting QB by not bringing in someone like Cam Newton, establishing the type of culture he desired in Buffalo and why it was difficult at first, and what it was like seeing Vontae Davis retire at halftime of a game (00:00:43-25:21). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. Pat and AJ discuss everything from The Last Dance and discuss the documentary at length, Pat and Aaron Rodgers becoming texting buddies, Sebastian Janikowski giving Pat life advice, AJ tries to figure out how long Pat would survive in the Octagon against Francis Ngannou, Pat demonstrates the hard count he would use to try and get defenses to jump offsides, they discuss the golf event from this past weekend, and cover everything else that is going on in the world (27:17-2:11:18). Later, former Raiders and Browns Head Coach and friend of the program, Hue Jackson joins the show. Pat and Hue chat about the rumors that the Browns almost traded the #1 pick in 2018 to the Seahawks for Russell Wilson, how his tequila company has been doing, how teams address players getting arrested in the offseason given the recent circumstances, and whether he thinks it’s essential for young QB’s to have a veteran presence in the Quarterback room (2:11:20-2:26:17). Don't forget to send a picture of where you're watching the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
