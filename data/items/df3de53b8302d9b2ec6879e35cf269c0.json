  "description": "<p>After the 'What's Next!?' Conference in Brussels a few weeks ago, I sat down with a small group to answer a bunch of questions following my talk.  In this one we cover the current state of marketing, the difference between being a businessman versus a marketer, how I don't plan on selling VaynerMedia, winning over your boss's budget (or not), and as always, day-trading the market's attention in this ever-changing digital age. Love these post-keynote interviews because my energy levels are still charged up from my time on stage. Would love to know what you think !! </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5429555.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
