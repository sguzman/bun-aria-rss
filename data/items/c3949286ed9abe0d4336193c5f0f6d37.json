  "description": "Huge tech companies have led the way in this record-breaking bull market. But can the momentum continue? That’s the question I ask Chris Wood, chief investment officer at RiskHedge, 15-year market veteran, and brilliant tech analyst. Chris offers his thoughts on where the tech sector is headed… and gives a couple of his favorite small-cap ideas to invest in right now.   Plus, do you have what it takes to be a successful contrarian investor? Here’s a pop quiz to find out.  Editor’s note: In this week’s episode, Frank talks about  2-Second Trader, Curzio Research’s soon-to-be-launched weekly trading advisory edited by Rich Suttmeier. You’ll hear a lot more about  it in coming weeks. But if you haven’t already, check out —where Rich uses his proprietary trading system to tell readers when to buy or sell. -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?   Get Wall Street Unplugged delivered FREE to your inbox every Wednesday: https://www.curzioresearch.com/wall-street-unplugged/   --------------------------------   Wall Street Unplugged podcast is available at: --: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wall-street-unplugged-frank/ --: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/curzio-research/wall-street-unplugged-2 --: https://www.curzioresearch.com/category/podcast/wall-street-unplugged/   : https://twitter.com/frankcurzio :. https://www.facebook.com/CurzioResearch/ : https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-curzio-690561a7/ : https://www.curzioresearch.com",
