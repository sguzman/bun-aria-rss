In this episode we’re not only joined by Radio Silence’s Tyler Gillett, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Chad Villella, but with legacy cast member David Arquette and the insanely talented new star Melissa Barrera who stars in the latest film. We got to ask them about the creation of the film, David shares a fond memory with the one and only Wes Craven and we got to hear their thoughts on some burning questions we had for the future of the franchise. Hold onto your butts, and never run up the stairs instead of going out the front door… It's insulting.<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n**we tried to stay away from true spoilers but discuss some characters and themes in the new Scream!**<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
