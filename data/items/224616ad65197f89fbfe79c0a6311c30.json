  "description": "<p>EPISODE 103 - SANDY POWELL - Costume Designer</p> <p>Team Deakins talks with the celebrated costume designer, Sandy Powell (THE FAVOURITE, VELVET GOLDMINE, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE). We delve into many things, such as how a costume designer helps the actor find his/her character, being mindful of the silhouette and shape of a design, and working with a director multiple times. She shares how she chooses her projects, how she works with color and approaches designing instinctively. She tells us about her different experiences with the director Todd Haynes and what the projects entailed. We also cover finding clothes versus making them, working with actors, doing a period project and how strict you are, and how to get past a block. And much more!</p>",
