  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys do a deep dive into the Oscars as they recap the show, talk about Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, give some of their takes on the Academy Awards as a show and whether it suffered from having a host or not, and how Hollywood might as well be a different planet. The guys also discuss the Robert Kraft saga and try to make sense of what he was thinking, and whether or not they think there are actually bigger names attached. Pat also gives an outlook on combine week that is coming up as the NFL offseason is about to heat up again, and extends the St. Paddy's Day t-shirt sale for a limited time. Later, one of the most electric humans on the planet, former Vice President of officiating for the NFL, and current rules analyst for FOX Sports, Mike Pereira, joins the show from Top Golf. They discuss his career as an official, some of the things he'd like to see changed in order to makes the lives of the officials easier, who he has beef with, and what some of his hobbies are in an absolutely hilarious interview (1:07:53-1:35:56). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
