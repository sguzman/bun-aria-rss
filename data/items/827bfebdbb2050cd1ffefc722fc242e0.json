  "description": "Pause for a moment and imagine this scenario. You’re a teenager from another country, and someone says “hey, I want to introduce you to a game. It’s called basketball.” You pick up the ball and begin to play. Then fast forward 7 years down the road (a virtual blink of an eye in an athlete’s life), and you’re not only good at the game, you’re a superior talent. And you’re now playing in the world’s greatest basketball league, the NBA. Oh, and one more thing, you’re an All-Star as well. Wait, what? Sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? Well, that’s pretty much exactly how it played out for Pascal Siakam, the former Camaroon teenager and present Toronto Raptors all star forward. His story is almost too crazy to believe, but he breaks it all down for you on today’s Old Man and the Three. In this incredible interview, Pascal not only tells the story of how his hoops career came about, but he also covers where things stand now with the Raptors, what it was like winning a chip, his relationship with his late father, and so much more. A true can’t miss interview. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
