  "description": "<p>You've heard us talk <em>about</em> him every episode for the past two years... but until now most of you have never actually heard us talk <em>to</em> him! To celebrate the LP Show going public, we've remastered our first, canonical interview with Hamilton Helmer, originally released as an LP episode in March 2020. Hamilton’s 7 Powers framework gives a deep, academic investigation to the question, “what creates an enduring company?” This episode is an absolute must-listen for anyone working or investing in tech (and beyond), and we're so excited to finally make it available to everyone.</p> <p><br /> And if you want more episodes like this, we have good news... <strong><a href=\"http://pod.link/acquiredlp\">all back catalog LP Show episodes are now free</a></strong> and available to anyone! You can <a href= \"http://pod.link/acquiredlp\">follow our new public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice. It's already chock-full of 60+ great episodes like our VC Fundamentals series, interviews with founders of top early-stage startups, and master classes on pricing, marketplaces, SaaS investing and many more topics.
