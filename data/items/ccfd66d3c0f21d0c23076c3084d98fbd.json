  "description": "Last Month, we lost best-selling author, iconic reporter and journalistic pioneer Mary Martha Corinne Morrison Claiborne Roberts, \"Cokie\" to her family, friends, colleagues and the tens of millions of Americans who read her column or watched and listened to her every week on NPR and ABC News.\nOriginally from New Orleans, Louisiana, she learned politics at an early age. Both her father and her mother served for decades in the United States Congress. An award winning political reporter and analyst, Cokie Roberts, along with Eleanor Clift, NPR's Linda Wertheimer and Nina Totenberg transformed the male dominated world of Washington political journalism.\nAn Emmy Award winner, Cokie Roberts also earned other honors, including the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for coverage of Congress and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. In 2000, she was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.\nWith all the impeachment news weren’t able to properly pay tribute to her life and legacy.\nAnd so, this week, to honor groundbreaking journalist Cokie Roberts, we put her 2013 commencement address at LSU into the Words Matter Library. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
