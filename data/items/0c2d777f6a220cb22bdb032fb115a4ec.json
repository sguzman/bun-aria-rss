  "description": "<p>Fear is an emotion that is hard-wired in us as humans, and so we naturally want to avoid the things that frighten us. But the biggest problem with this survival instinct is that there are times when we <em>must</em> face these fears in order to move forward and get ahead in life. We have a natural desire to avoid pain but if we don’t address it head-on, it’ll often lead to worse pain and problems down the road. This is often true when it comes to relationships, with our physical health, and it’s definitely true when it comes to our money. It’s a serious issue when we let fear get in the way of taking action. During this episode, with Halloween just around the corner, we cover some of the most common money fears that lurk in the back of our minds, and how to face them down in order to get one step closer to financial freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Hopfenweisse by Schneider Weisse- a massive thanks to Zach for sharing these with us!
