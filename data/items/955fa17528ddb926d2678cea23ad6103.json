  "description": "<p>This episode is all about FIRE which stands for Financial Independence Retire Early. This movement came about as an entire generation began to push back against the notion of traditional retirement- working hard in a job you hate so that you can kick back when you’re 65. Thanks, but nah. We have friends who have completely rejected that idea and have retired in their 20s and 30s, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that the pursuit of financial independence doesn’t have to look a specific way. Just like those books we loved in the 90’s you get to choose your own adventure! From leanFIRE to fatFIRE and everything in between, there are a variety of lifestyles we can aspire to. So we’ll talk about the different types of FIRE and then some of the most important tactics to consider on your path to achieving financial independence.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Smells Like Bean Spirit Double Maple by Mikerphone Brewing!
