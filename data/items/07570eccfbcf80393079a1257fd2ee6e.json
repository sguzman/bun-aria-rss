Thank you to a careful listener for pointing this out to us.\n\nFiona founded the project in 2014, with the view of enabling people to explore, discover and voice their friendships with poems, so this is a particularly special episode as it captures her first experience of an Exchange.\n\nThe Poetry Exchange team had a wonderful few days together in Carcassonne, South of France last year and it was here that Fiona joined fellow Poetry Exchange team members, John Prebble and Becca Manley to talk about her friend.\n\n'A Kite For Aibhín' is read by Becca Manley.\n\n*****\n\nA Kite For Aibhín\nAfter 'L'Aquilone' by Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912)\n\nAir from another life and time and place,\nPale blue heavenly air is supporting\nA white wing beating high against the breeze,\n\nAnd yes, it is a kite! As when one afternoon\nAll of us there trooped out\nAmong the briar hedges and stripped thorn,\n\nI take my stand again, halt opposite\nAnahorish Hill to scan the blue,\nBack in that field to launch our long-tailed comet.\n\nAnd now it hovers, tugs, veers, dives askew,\nLifts itself, goes with the wind until\nIt rises to loud cheers from us below.\n\nRises, and my hand is like a spindle\nUnspooling, the kite a thin-stemmed flower\nClimbing and carrying, carrying farther, higher\n\nThe longing in the breast and planted feet\nAnd gazing face and heart of the kite flier\nUntil string breaks and—separate, elate—\n\nThe kite takes off, itself alone, a windfall.\n\n\n'A Kite for Aibhín'. Taken from 'Human Chain' by Seamus Heaney(Published by Faber & Faber Limited, 2010)",
