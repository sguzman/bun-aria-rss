  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life podcast today, our hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks discuss chapters 2-6 of C. S. Lewis’ <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bQJAni\">The Great Divorce</a>.</em> Angelina reminds us as we begin this exploration of Lewis’ narrative not to read too much theology into the details of this dreamlike world he creates. Cindy points out the similarities between these chapters and his descriptions at the end of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YnACdw\">The Last Battle</a></em>. Thomas highlights the passage on Napoleon from chapter 2, showing what Lewis envisioned hell to be like. Angelina, Cindy and Thomas talks about the description of the land near heaven, the various characters’ responses, as well as the weight of the actual environment and Lewis’ picture of those who people it. <span style= \"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></span></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>We long for paradise because we were created for paradise. We were created to live in an environment that cooperates with, not fights against, our desires. We were created for Eden, a place we’ve never been, and so we desire a perfect life full of healthy relationships.</p> <cite>Julie Sparkman</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Anyone who puts himself forward to be elected to a position of political power is almost bound to be socially or emotionally insecure, or criminally motivated, or mad.</p> <cite>Auberon Waugh</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>“The secret is not to dream,” she whispered. “The secret is to wake up. Waking up is harder. I have woken up and now I am real. I know where I come from and where I’m going. You cannot fool me anymore. Or touch me. Or anything that is mine.”</p> <cite>Terry Pratchett</cite></blockquote> <h3>The Stricken Deer</h3> <p><em>by William Cowper</em></p> <p>I was a stricken deer, that left the herd<br /> Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt<br /> My panting side was charg’d, when I withdrew<br /> To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.<br /> There was I found by one who had himself<br /> Been hurt by th’ archers. In his side he bore,<br /> And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.<br /> With gentle force soliciting the darts,<br /> He drew them forth, and heal’d, and bade me live.<br /> Since then, with few associates, in remote<br /> And silent woods I wander, far from those<br /> My former partners of the peopled scene;<br /> With few associates, and not wishing more.<br /> Here much I ruminate, as much I may,<br /> With other views of men and manners now<br /> Than once, and others of a life to come.<br /> I see that all are wand’rers, gone astray<br /> Each in his own delusions; they are lost<br /> In chace of fancied happiness, still wooed<br /> And never won. Dream after dream ensues,<br /> And still they dream that they shall still succeed,<br /> And still are disappointed; rings the world<br /> With the vain stir. I sum up half mankind,<br /> And add two-thirds of the remainder half,<br /> And find the total of their hopes and fears<br /> Dreams, empty dreams. The million flit as gay<br /> As if created only like the fly<br /> That spreads his motley wings in th’ eye of noon<br /> To sport their season and be seen no more.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3d4lXYQ\">Unhitching from the Crazy Train</a></em> by Julie Sparkman</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aU7op7\">Wee Free Men</a></em> by Terry Pratchett</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YnACdw\">The Last Battle</a></em> by C.
