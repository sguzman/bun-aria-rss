  "description": "<p>In this 61st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss kambo, the poison of an Amazonian frog, which is being used by Americans who are seeking a purgative and possibly spiritual experience, but the people at the NYT once again reveal that they have no idea even how to speak science, much less assess it. From there, down the rabbit hole we go to a discussion of the different diets of four Amazonian tribes. We then discuss the politicization of science, in discussion of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Oregon Healthcare Authority, possible drug treatments for COVID, and a third, promising vaccine which is on the horizon. We also reveal that Ted Wheeler, mayor of Portland, has said some mean things about antifa. At the top of this episode, we reveal new “First Against the Wall Club” merchandise, and make a correction from episode #60, regarding the Evergreen locker room story. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
