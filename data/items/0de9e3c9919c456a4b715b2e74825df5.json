  "description": "<p>The duo are in studio alone for another conversation of whoreible things!! There are conversations on this week's episode that both Weezy and Mandii didn't think they would truly discuss. Conversations go from germs during sex, cleaning sex toys, reusing sex toys and then to male-male-female threesomes inspired by a post of the lovely men from Insecure. A topic that doesn't get much attention is abortion and the duo open up about their decisions to have an abortion in the past, possible regret, and the stigmas surrounding abortion in general.
