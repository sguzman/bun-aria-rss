  "description": "<p>Merry Christmas Tanner! Let's all go tap-dance on Em's coattails. This week we both accidentally end up in Salt Lake City, which seems to be a pretty messed up place (no offense, SLC). Em tells the story of Kay’s Cross, arguably the most haunted spot in SLC. It’s full of demons, shadow people, and an alarming amount of cult leaders. Oh, it also exploded. Meanwhile, Christine covers a different kind of horror, the murder of Franklin Bradshaw, a wealthy grandpa with a cardboard briefcase and oatmeal full of amphetamines. We also learn that Em went to modeling school and Christine…well, didn’t. And that’s why we drink!<br />Visit http://rothys.com/drink to get the shoes you’ve been waiting for! <br />Listeners get $60 off on their Embr Wave by visiting http://embrwave.com/drink! <br />Get 30% off your first order at http://thredup.com/drink! <br />Get 10% off during your first three months at http://ritual.com/atwwd!</p>\n",
