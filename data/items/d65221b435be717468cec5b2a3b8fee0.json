  "description": "<p>Gabriel \"Fluffy\" Iglesias (comedian) opens up about redefining himself after his long term relationship came to an end, the therapeutic benefits he gets from sharing his struggles onstage, and the significance of his milestones in relation to his Mexican heritage. He discusses the origins of his sense of humor, being bullied as a kid, and why he chose to have a sober period. Gabriel explains how his dogs help him regulate his emotions, why he had always been reluctant to start therapy, and how therapy has taught him to be a better listener in every area of his life. He and Mayim bond over their processes for \"coming down\" after a performance high before geeking out over Gabriel’s incredible car collection. Mayim and Jonathan consider the importance of having positive communication tools when discussing difficult topics in any relationship. </p><p>Gabriel Iglesias' Website: <a href=\"https://fluffyguy.com/\">https://fluffyguy.com/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
