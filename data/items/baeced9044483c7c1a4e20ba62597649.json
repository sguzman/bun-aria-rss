  "description": "Maggie Haberman, White House Correspondent for the New York Times, has been covering Donald Trump since he began considering a run for president and has delivered some of the biggest scoops since he assumed the Oval Office. She sits down with Preet to discuss ethics in journalism and how to deal with the most unpredictable White House ever. Plus: Preet answers questions about Twitter’s role in democracy and the new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\nDo you have a question for Preet? Tweet them to @PreetBharara or call 669-247-7338 and leave a voicemail.\n(Please note: in this episode, Mr. Bharara suggests that WNYC was the only news organization to uncover sexual harassment claims about its own employees. In fact, New York Magazine first reported on this. We regret the error.)\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
