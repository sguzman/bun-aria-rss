  "description": "The new comedy <em>See How They Run </em>is a whodunit for people who <em>really </em>like a whodunit. Set behind the scenes at a 1950s production of Agatha Christie's <em>The Mousetrap</em>, the film is a murder mystery with a big cast that includes Sam Rockwell, Saoirse Ronan, David Oyelowo, Ruth Wilson, and Adrien Brody. And it's an entertaining send-up that takes some very meta swings at the very idea of a murder mystery.",
