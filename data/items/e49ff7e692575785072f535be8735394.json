  "description": "Writing in a diary can be great for your mental health. It can also be great to look back and see how much you’ve changed. That’s exactly what Emma is doing this week. Analyzing old diary entries to understand why she felt a certain way, and how she’s grown. Why friendships don’t last long, manifesting things that aren’t good for us, and why it’s important to make mistakes. Plus, questions on the meaning of life, and why is cauliflower so damn good? \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
