  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, an investigative reporter attempted to buy a gun at Wal-Mart and found out that background checks actually work. The process includes a federal background check and employees who are trained in gun sales. This reporter effectively makes the case that current gun laws are working.  Mass shooters vary widely but gun laws won't cure mental illness.  Then, Israeli journalists have uncovered photos of the village that Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's family is from — and it's not a poor war-torn neighborhood, but a beautifully luxurious part of town. Later, social activist journalists are at it again with the Trump is insane narrative with hosts from the Sunday shows joining the chorus.  Afterward, Congressman Lee Zeldin calls in to discuss New York Times Senior Staff Editor Tom Wright-Piersanti’s anti-Semitic remarks. Finally, former prosecutor Andy McCarthy joins the program to discuss his new book \"Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency.\"  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
