  "description": "As we dive into this week's podcast we begin to tread in areas not often mentioned by the restaurant industry with Drone delivery leading the way and how Flytrex may be the next Uber for restaurant delivery. The real question will be the adoption curve of the digital consumer and if they have the uptake acceleration we have seen with online the third party. The likelihood that we see widespread drone delivery by 2025 is now a real possibility.<br /><br />C-Stores may have been the old school grab and go's of the past, but soon they will be forced and poised to enter the serious fray of fast-casual as they face an entirely new population of electric cars that are about to change the landscape of the American roadways. Fuel stations could be a thing of the past by 2030 and see the birth of a new model for C-store applications.<br /><br />Chipotle is often referred to as the rule breaker and the one that seems to always be out in front. In my book the Chipotle Effect, I predicted what we would see a new reality of the digital restaurant which is now becoming evident. Chipotle continues to separate from the pack as they enter into a fully digital and Chipotlane model - that in my opinion puts them on a course to 10K location by 2030. Lots to unpack in this episode as we also discuss what the tech stack might look like as we see these three key shifts moving the food consumer further and further from the dine-in restaurant.<br /><br />This episode is sponsored by Popmenu.
