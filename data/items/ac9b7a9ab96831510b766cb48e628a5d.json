  "description": "<p>I hope you will enjoy listening to this live event, recorded at my book signing and podcast launch April 26th, 2018 in Sparta, New Jersey at Interplay Couture. After some brief introductions you will hear my talk. I was asked to speak on the topic: “There is Hope: Life Balance and Self Care” but you’re going to hear why I renamed the talk to “Commitment for Self-Care and Self Care for Commitment.” I will discuss five strategies I used to manage my energy in my quest to launch my book and podcast, as well as some of the inner obstacles I faced along the way. The following are the books and apps I referenced in the talk: The Sugar Addict’s Total Recovery Program by K. DesMaisons Stress Free for Good: 10 Scientifically Proven Life Skills for Health and Happiness by Luskin and Pelletier The Essential Rumi Translated by Barks, C. Apps: Insight Timer (I like the bells for meditation and prayer) CBT-i Coach (to learn about sleep hygiene). If you haven’t yet had a chance please consider purchasing my recently published book entitled “There’s Always Hope: A Story About Overcoming.” I wrote it with love for children nine and under or to serve as a symbolic gift for an adult in your life who is in need of hope. Thank you to Sparta Books and Interplay Couture of Sparta, NJ for hosting the book and podcast launch and for donating profits to Ginnie’s House Children’s Advocacy Center of Newton, NJ. I am grateful that you have supported their mission to treat and prevent child abuse.

One small gift you can give me back is to take the time to leave the show a comment and rating on iTunes.
