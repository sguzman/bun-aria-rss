  "content:encoded": "<p>Lately I&#8217;ve found that the overhead of configuring my development environment occupies too much of my development time, particularly on side-projects that are already time-starved.  Nobody likes to sit down&#8211;all stoked to code&#8211;and spend the first 15 minutes just getting everything up and running.  Lucky for me, my beautiful and talented <a title=\"Jim Vallandingham\" href=\"http://vallandingham.me/\" target=\"_blank\">co-worker</a> spammed me a helpful link this week for a <a href=\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course\">tmux</a> tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/remiprev/teamocil\">Teamocil</a>, which it turns out, is kind of the shit.  I already use tmux for programming on remote servers to avoid my code disappearing into space in the event that I&#8217;m prematurely disconnected, so getting Teamocil up and running was really easy.  It&#8217;s just a matter of configuring a yaml file.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s my environment for cellbot, a RESTful service that exposes <a title=\"SBML.org\" href=\"http://sbml.org/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">SBML</a> models as JSON (coming soon!).  At the moment, I have two basic configurations.  The first is my API development set-up which consists of three panes, one large pane for vim and two small ones for the command line/git and my web server.</p>\n<pre id=\"code_snippet_5\" style=\"position:relative;width:100%;border:0;padding:0;\">name: \"cellbot-api\"\nwindows:\n  - name: \"server\"\n    root: \"~/projects/human-cellbot-api/api\"\n    layout: main-vertical\n    panes:\n      - commands:\n        - vim \"app.js\"\n        - focus: true\n      - commands:\n        - git status\n      - commands:\n        - npm start </pre>\n<p>Then it&#8217;s just a matter of opening a new tmux session and typing &#8220;teamocil cellbot&#8221;.  Teamocil then renames my tmux session to &#8216;cellbot-api&#8217;, constructs my panes, and issues my commands.  Ultimately my set-up looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"stag-section stag-image stag-image--no-filter stag-image--none\"><img src=\"http://www.erinshellman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cellbot-env.png\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<p>I have app.js and API documentation open in a split-window vim session (although I did the vim split manually).  This makes it super simple to modify the code and documentation (<a title=\"iodocs github\" href=\"https://github.com/mashery/iodocs\" target=\"_blank\">iodocs</a>, thanks Mashery!) simultaneously. Next to that I have an open terminal window for git and any other command line stuff I might want to do.  Finally in the bottom left I can monitor my server.  <em>Fun!</em></p>\n<p>Second, I have an configuration to fire up my databases.  Data for the API are stored in mongodb and I&#8217;m using Redis for my OAuth store.</p>\n<pre id=\"code_snippet_6\" style=\"position:relative;width:100%;border:0;padding:0;\">name: \"cellbot-db\"\nwindows:\n  - name: \"db\"\n    root: \"~/projects/human-cellbot-api/api\"\n    layout: main-vertical\n    panes:\n      - commands:\n        - sudo mongod\n      - commands:\n        - sudo redis-server \n      - commands:\n        - sudo mongo\n        - focus: true </pre>\n<p>In this case I just want to run both of those database servers, and then open a mongo shell so that I can interactively debug my endpoints when I need to.  The only minor annoyance is the sudo-ing, but it&#8217;s still faster than remembering to start those servers when I have 15 minutes and just want to write code.  I also found <a title=\"Better productivity with Tmux and Teamocil\" href=\"http://blog.shameerc.com/2014/05/better-productivity-with-tmux-and-teamocil\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> post useful, especially the tips about adding mouse actions to tmux, because that&#8217;s what enables you to slide the pane sizes around.</p>\n<p>I spent some time a few months ago organizing my dotfiles and getting them all up on github and I love that I can include the .teamocil directory in my dotfiles repo and take my environment with me wherever I go.  <em>Get into it!</em></p>\n",
