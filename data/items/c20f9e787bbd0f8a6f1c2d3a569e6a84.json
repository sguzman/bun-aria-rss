  "itunes:summary": "I played squash regularly with a group of friends. We were all about the same standard. We almost took it in turns to win or lose. Nevertheless, winning feels good. The feelings of pleasure and satisfaction that accompany victory are quite natural.\nThis is, of course, a trivial example. The victory that is at the centre of today’s passages is of a totally different order and significance. But even the tiniest and most insignificant victory gives us a taste of its meaning and joy.\nThe great victory of God that we read about in the New Testament is foreshadowed in the Old Testament. The ultimate victory of God came with the life, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus and the outpouring of his Spirit who gives you power to live a life of victory.",
