Firefall fell due to the failure to both keep an audience but due to funding issues later down the line. Firefall was a great MMO for a short time and it'll be missed by many who had the chance to play it. \n\nRed 5 Studios was the company behind this game. But unfortunately Red 5 Studios was shut down shortly before Firefall was. All in all it's a shame.",
