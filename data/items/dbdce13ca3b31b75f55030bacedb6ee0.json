  "description": "Steven Avery. September 11, 2003. Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Steven Avery is released from prison after serving 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. On October 31, 2005, Auto Trader photographer, Teresa Halbach, would go missing after visiting the Avery salvage yard to photograph a van. Her disappearance would be brought to the attention of the authorities three days later. Within a week, Steven Avery would again be arrested. This time around there seemed to be plenty of evidence of his guilt. Between the investigation and his subsequent trial, questions would be raised about the evidence collection and the actions of the sheriff's department that had been wrong about him in the past. Could the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department be wrong about Avery a second time? Could they possibly have even set him up to end his pending $36 million civil suit? Or did Steven Avery really murder the missing photographer and cremate her remains on his property?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
