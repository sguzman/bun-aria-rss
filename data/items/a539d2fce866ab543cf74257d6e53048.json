  "description": "<p>Nantucket is a small isolated island off of Cape Cod and has long been a summer destination for people. This had once been a whaling hub and was originally home to the Algonquian Nehantucket People. Fog regularly envelopes the island leading to it being nicknamed \"The Little Grey Lady of the Sea.\" It seems the perfect setting for a few ghost stories and this little island has plenty of them.
