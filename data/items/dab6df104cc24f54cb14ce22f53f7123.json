    "media:description": "After testing out this camera, I've come to the conclusion that we need to modularize all the things... smartphones, laptops, cameras, TVs, and more. The ability to swap out the battery with a new, fully-charged cell is super convenient. You can literally flip the screen module around to take selfie pictures or videos. But, arguably the best feature of all is the ability to swap out the lenses so you can capture 360 photos/videos or 4K ultra-wide action camera shots, depending on your needs. Starting at $299, the Insta360 ONE RS isn't exactly cheap, however it should significantly improve your content creation game. \n\nBuy the Insta360 ONE RS (affiliate link):\nhttps://www.insta360.com/sal/one_rs?insrc=INR48D7\n\nInsta360 ONE RS Bundle at Apple.com: \nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/HQ2U2ZM/A/insta360-one-rs-twin-edition-apple-bundle\n\nSlashdot: https://www.slashdot.org\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/slashdot\nVideo Twitter: https://twitter.com/SlashdotTV\nMain Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdot\nVideo Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdottv\nSlashdot MERCH: https://www.slashdotstore.com/",
