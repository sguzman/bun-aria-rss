  "description": "<p>My guest today is Glasgow born photographer, Mark Mann, who has built a stunning career, photographing many of the most iconic celebrities in the world, from Robert Redford, Michael Douglas, Iggy Pop, and the Black Eyed Peas to Seinfeld, Rihanna, Queen Latifah, Stevie Wonder, Bradley Cooper, Willie Nelson, and hundreds of others. Funny thing is, Mark pretty much stumbled into photography in the most unexpected way in his late teens, then ended up on a plane to NYC where, with little experience, he found himself dropped into the world of hip hop and music, focusing some of the early icons in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>He fell in love with the stories people’s faces told and started spending more and more time developing his signature approach to hyper-vivid, close-up, black and white portraits that, in some way, capture a moment, a mood, a vibe or story. But behind the scenes, it hasn’t been a straight line or an easy path. The reality of the photographic life is not an easy one, but, for him, it’s been the source of profound connection and a life of stories that will live in his mind long after the images themselves fade.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Mark Mann at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.markmannphoto.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.markmannphoto.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/markmannphoto/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/markmannphoto/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;<strong>Sparketype</strong>&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://goodlifeproject.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=933dace875e063f68c8bba8022cead74&i=353A299A1A2639\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
