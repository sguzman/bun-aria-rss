  "description": "On this week’s episode of The Waves, Slate senior editor Allegra Frank and Robin Boylorn, a professor at the University of Alabama and occasional Slate contributor, discuss the enduring appeal of Keeping Up With the Kardashians as the E! reality show it comes to a close at the end of its 20th season. The pair digs into the show as a backdrop for the creation of a family dynasty of internet celebrity, track the diminishing role of television in their multi-billion-dollar empire, and parse out the curious appeal of the sisters who became famous just for being famous. \n\nAfter the break, Allegra and Robin dig deep on the Kardashian-Jenner clan’s history of appropriation of Black culture, and discuss the impact of their adopting working-class Black aesthetics to great personal gain as several of them became mothers to Black children themselves. The sisters haven’t shied away from airing their learning moments for the world to see. But have they been able to use their enormous platform to any meaningful end? \n\nFor Slate Plus members, Allegra and Robin continue our new segment, Gateway Feminism, where they talk about one thing that helped make them feminists. For Allegra, it’s the manga and anime series Cardcaptor Sakura, and for Robin it’s her favorite Toni Morrison novel and feminist blueprint, Sula. \n\nRecommendations\nAllegra recommends a new EP, Whole Damn Body from Los Campesinos! \nRobin thinks you should check out the Crunk Feminist Collective’s new newsletter, The Remix.\n\nPodcast production by Asha Saluja filling in for Cheyna Roth.
