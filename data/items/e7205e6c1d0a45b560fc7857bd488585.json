  "description": "<p>Bryan and Shannon Miles fell in love when they were young, got married, started a family and each started building their own successful careers. But a series of unexpected experiences led them to re-evaluate what they wanted out of their lives, and the way they wanted to contribute. So they pretty much blew everything up and went out on their own, starting a new venture together with the goal of creating freedom, by building a company that helped others create freedom. Not a bad vision, right?</p><p>Their passion is all about empowering small business owners and entrepreneurs to be more efficient as they achieve success in business (and in life). Having now generated more than $100M in revenue as the Co-CEO's of BELAY SOLUTIONS, a virtual staffing company, they graduated to Co-Chairs where they are stepping into a more educational role, sharing the Own Not Run philosophy that led them to build their own company. I was fascinated by their approach, since it’s always been a large part of my aspiration, too. To build something that truly mattered, while also doing it in a way that put family and flourishing at the center.&nbsp;</p><p>Quick note, too, this conversion, like a few others we’ve recently released, was recorded in our studio in what we’ve now come to know as Before Times. We’d been holding it until it felt like a more accessible conversation, and with so many people now reflecting on how to create their own endeavors or build existing companies in a way that built freedom into the DNA, it felt like the right time to share it.</p><br><p>You can find Bryan and Shannon Miles at:</p><p><a href=\"https://ownnotrun.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://ownnotrun.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/belay_solutions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/belay_solutions/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
