  "description": "<p>In this paper, $2 \\times 2$ zero-sum games (ZSGs) are studied under the\nfollowing assumptions: (1) One of the players (the leader) publicly and\nirrevocably commits to choose its actions by sampling a given probability\nmeasure (strategy);(2) The leader announces its action, which is observed by\nits opponent (the follower) through a binary channel; and (3) the follower\nchooses its strategy based on the knowledge of the leader's strategy and the\nnoisy observation of the leader's action. Under these conditions, the\nequilibrium is shown to always exist and be often different from the Nash and\nStackelberg equilibria. Even subject to noise, observing the actions of the\nleader is either beneficial or immaterial to the follower for all possible\ncommitments. When the commitment is observed subject to a distortion, the\nequilibrium does not necessarily exist. Nonetheless, the leader might still\nobtain some benefit in some specific cases subject to equilibrium refinements.\nFor instance, $\\epsilon$-equilibria might exist in which the leader commits to\nsuboptimal strategies that allow unequivocally predicting the best response of\nits opponent.\n</p>",
