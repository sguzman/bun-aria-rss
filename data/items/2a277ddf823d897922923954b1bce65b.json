  "description": "<p>There are many legends that incorporate curses into their telling. A curse is a type of magic that is meant to harm people. It would seem that curses can fall upon the land as well. And there is a place on Earth that is considered one of the largest areas of cursed land. This is a forest that is said to be the world's most haunted forest. A forest so completely terrifying that many have feared even saying its name: Hoia Baciu Forest. There are claims of all types of unexplained and paranormal activity, ranging from ghost and UFO sightings to strange feelings and sickness. People feel an urge to flee the forest. Is this just overactive imaginings or is something truly sinister going on in this forest where the vegetation is weird and in some places won't grow? This location was suggested by listener Christopher Klimovitz and he joins us from Albania to give a firsthand account of what it is like to visit the forest. The Moment in Oddity features the Frogman of Loveland, Ohio and This Day in History features a gas explosion that rocks Cleveland.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-156-hoia-baciu-forest.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-156-hoia-baciu-forest.html</a></p> <p>Become and Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
