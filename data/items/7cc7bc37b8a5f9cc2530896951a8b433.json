  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast, we talk about a call we got from Yes Theory, we explore the concept of saying yes, which we did and talk through our fears about skydiving for a second time…which should pretty much explain what the call was about. \nWe also continue our conversation on instagram and debate some recent news about the platform. Lastly we take a really interesting question from a listener and give our opinion on the matter. \nMake sure to review the pod on iTunes and leave us a voice message on Anchor, we love to hear from you!",
