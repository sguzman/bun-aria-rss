  "title": "Uncle Si's Dating Advice for Loners",
  "description": "Si Robertson ain't buying what Joe Rogan is selling when it comes to black panthers (but he still believes, boys). Si calls out dumb humans for trying to play God with wild animals. JD takes issue with pronouncing silent letters, tiny plates, and Willie's claim about Bella's wedding. Si and the boys consider crashing Phil, Jase, and Al's live podcast in Texas on Wednesday (shh, don't tell). Godwin, JD, and Si share their best fatherly advice. Si almost joined the Marines, but one thing stopped him. Martin nails his dating advice for introverts — complete with a seating chart. And if you're a loner who's having trouble meeting your special someone, Si has exactly what you need to hear today.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
