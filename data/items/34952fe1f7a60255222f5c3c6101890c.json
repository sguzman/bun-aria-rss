  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show marveling at some of the things they are hearing out of politicians that just outright don't make sense. To bolster the point Adam shares with Dr. Drew some video of the Mayor of New Orleans commenting on recent stats declaring New Orleans the murder capitol of America. After marveling at the lack of an answer that was provided by an elected Mayor of a major city they turn to the phones and speak to a caller with a question about Bill O'Reilly and his habits when interacting with his guests. As the show wraps up they speak to one more caller with a question about the hysteria that seems to be surrounding this year's flu season. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2\nShopify.com/adamanddrew\nBlindsGalore.com let them know we sent you",
