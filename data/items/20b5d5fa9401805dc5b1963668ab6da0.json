  "description": "<p>Nine-time Grammy Award-winner Sheryl Crow has spent the last three decades performing for sold-out crowds and festivals. But rarely do we get a glimpse into her very private personal life. Today, as Sheryl approaches sixty, she sits down with Hoda for a very intimate conversation. They connect over experiences they’ve both endured – like surviving breast cancer and the dissolution of a relationship. They also share a deep joy in simple things like the honor of motherhood later in life and the fulfillment that comes with reaching this stage in the game. Sheryl shares what she’s learned – perspective she’s gained from her own mother, her sons and thirty years in the music industry.</p>\n",
