Vinegar might be a good fabric softner but it can't get a face as soft as Andrew's after a shave. Luigi was a good guard dog. Nikki is annoyed about her joke being edited but they celebrate the FBoy Island 2 announcement. They flash back to 1995 and an aggressive Sunny-D commercial. Andrew drops 2 jokes that Nikki heard late. She clears some things about the Welcome Home Nikki Glaser? Finale before getting to Reddit Dump.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
