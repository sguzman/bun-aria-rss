  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, NRATV host Dan Bongino fills in for Mark. The spygate scandal on President Trump is all coming together and it just gets uglier and uglier. We now know of three separate scandals; the laundering of false information about Trump, government operatives gathering information on a political campaign, and the fact that the Trump team was being set up from the start. The Russian collusion in the 2016 election was very real, but it was between the Hillary campaign and Russia, not Trump. Also, the old rules of political discourse need to be replaced with new rules. In the past we were friends with democrats and could have civil discussions about differences. Now we need new rules because radical leftist kooks have taken over portions of the Democrat party. They are interested in one thing only – aggression and confrontation at every opportunity.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
