  "description": "<p>Your annual salary is not the only thing you should consider when it comes to your compensation at work- you also need to take a serious look at your other benefits. Some of them are straightforward line items on your paystub like retirement plan contributions, but others might be offered more as informal company perks like wellness classes. Hopefully you’re taking full advantage of all of those offerings. But if you’re not, realize that not utilizing those benefits to their fullest potential can be akin to leaving money on the table (and possibly even more money than you realize due to their tax advantage)! You may not be interested in every single option, but it’s at least worth doing a little digging to see what is available so that you can make the best informed decision possible when it comes to compensation.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Koko Buni by Creature Comforts.
