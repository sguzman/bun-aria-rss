His administration arrested journalists and newspaper publishers who criticized his handling of the Civil War. \n#2 Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. His administration threw many ordinary citizens in jail WITHOUT arrest warrants. The people detained often didn’t know why they were arrested or how they could challenge it.\n#3 Lincoln made things worse for Native Americans. He signed laws that gave away millions of acres of tribal land. He approved mass executions of Indian warriors and multiple Indian massacres happened under his watch.\n\n#abrahamlincoln #lincoln #presidents",
