  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">It’s 2020, did anyone really expect the election to be easy? The morning after the vote, a sleep-deprived Holy Post crew discusses what the incomplete results mean for the country and the church. The country hasn’t repudiated Trumpism, but they don’t seem to be embracing progressivism either. Did evangelicals still “hold their nose” and vote for Trump, or do exit polls show they’re deeply inhaling? An article from Christianity Today’s president, Tim Dalrymple, helps explain the evangelical divide over politics. And can the church learn to be prophetic again rather than partisan? Also this week, Phil talks with David French about reactions to the Holy Post video on abortion, and what the data shows will actually reduce the abortion rate in America.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/november-web-only/trump-election-politics-church-kingdom.html</p>",
