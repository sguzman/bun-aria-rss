  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down The Merger, and the ladies reach out to director Ken Whittingham, and writer Brent Forrester, who share their memories and insights on this episode. Then we chat about Pam's plants and homemade sexy sweater, and we get the lowdown on that Staples shredder in the original airing of this episode. Finally, we get a little heartbreak in the breakroom (and maybe a new country song?), Tony's firing and reappearance in Threat Level Midnight, and we dig into that last hilarious last scene between Dwight and Andy. We hope your mama knits you a sexy sweater after this episode. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To submit your version of Heartbreak in the Breakroom email us at <a href=\"mailto:officeladies@earwolf.com\">officeladies@earwolf.com</a> or tag us on Instagram @officeladiespod</p>\n",
