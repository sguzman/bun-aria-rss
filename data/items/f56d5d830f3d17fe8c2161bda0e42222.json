  "description": "Contributor(s): Kathy Cramer and Denise Baron | The 2016 election revealed stark divisions along the rural-urban divide in America. Professor Kathy Cramer’s research explored that division and investigated how rural American resentment toward cities and the urban elite provided fertile ground for right-leaning candidates to win elections. Prof. Cramer recently presented this research at the LSE. You usually have to be in London to catch the public lectures sponsored by the US Centre, but this August, we’re bringing them to you. This podcast lecture series features the research of leading American academics. This is the third lecture of this series, and it features Professor Kathy Cramer on “The Politics of Resentment in the 2016 US Presidential Election”.",
