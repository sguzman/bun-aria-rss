  "description": "At a moment when the U.S. Supreme Court's influence on American life has never been more obvious, 5-4 offers an irreverent take on the high court's past. Each episode focuses on a pivotal, historical case in which the justices screwed up in some way. 5-4 balances humor with analysis as legal commentators Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael dissect the legal reasoning and practical outcomes of the Court's most questionable and misguided decisions. Slow Burn co-creator Leon Neyfakh narrates the facts and historical context around the case-of-the-week. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
