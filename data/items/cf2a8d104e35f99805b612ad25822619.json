  "description": "Contributor(s): Joe Uscinski, Ros Taylor | This Extra Inning of the Ballpark features audio from the US Centre’s event “Conspiracy Theories in the Age of Trump,” which took place on 25 July 2018. Joseph Uscinski, associate professor of political science at University of Miami, speaks about his book American Conspiracy Theories and why President Trump might be America’s first conspiratorial president. Using an analysis of more than a hundred years of data taken from newspapers, surveys, and the internet, Professor Uscinski demonstrates that conspiracy theories follow a strategic logic: they are tools used by the powerless to attack and defend against the powerful. Our chair for this event, Ros Taylor, is Research Manager for the LSE Truth, Trust & Technology Commission, based in the Media Policy Project within the Department of Media and Communications at LSE.",
