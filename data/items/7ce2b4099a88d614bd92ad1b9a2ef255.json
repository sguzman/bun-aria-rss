  "description": "<p>The Power of Inquiry in Spiritual Awakening (2016-02-10) - Parts I and II - In spiritual life, inquiry arises from our deep yearning to understand reality, and it involves bringing an interested, engaged attention to our immediate experience.  These two talks explore how inquiry serves emotional healing by focusing on difficult “stuck” places, how inquiry enables us to become more intimate and understanding of others, and in the deepest way, how inquiry can reveal the deepest truth of what we are…our true nature. The talks include several guided reflections that can enrich your meditation practice and serve spiritual awakening. </p>\n<p>\"True inquiry doesn't land on an answer. It opens to a mystery that's meant to be lived.\"</p>",
