Joining the show is NFL Network Insider and host of the RapSheet and Friends Podcast, Ian Rapoport to discuss everything that happened in the NFL this weekend including the potential fight between Mike Vrabel and John Harbaugh, Taysom Hill's ascendance in New Orleans, whether or not the Packers are going to get rid of Mike Pettine or not, and much more (23:29-44:18).
