It’s for all these reasons, and more, that meditation is a foundational pillar to good health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Daniel Goleman, Emily Fletcher, and Dr. Joe Dispenza about how meditation changes lives by reducing stress, creating resilience, and improving emotional intelligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Goleman is best known for his worldwide bestseller <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> and most recently coauthored the book <em>Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body</em>. Goleman has been ranked among the 25 most influential business leaders by several business publications including <em>Time</em> and the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>. Apart from his writing on emotional intelligence, Goleman has written books on topics including self-deception, creativity, transparency, meditation, social and emotional learning, eco-literacy, and the ecological crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emily Fletcher is the founder of Ziva, the creator of The Ziva Technique, and a leading expert in meditation for high performers. She is also the author of <em>Stress Less, Accomplish More</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Joe Dispenza’s passion can be found at the intersection of the latest findings from the fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions. He uses that knowledge to teach people how to heal their bodies of health conditions, make significant changes in their lives, and evolve their consciousness. Since 2010, he has partnered with scientists and universities to perform extensive research on the effects that meditation has on the brain and body. He and his team have also studied gene expression, protein regulation, immune response, neurotransmitter changes, telomere length, and variations in bioactive cellular metabolic particles in novice and advanced meditators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and Paleovalley.</p><br><p>AG1 contains 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, whole-food sourced superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to support your entire body.
