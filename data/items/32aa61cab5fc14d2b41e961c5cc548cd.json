  "description": "Our audiobook this week is JAKEN by Joanna Blake\n\nI’ve been on the run for years. I never had a reason to take a stand. Not until I met her.\n\nShe’s in trouble when I first meet her. A damsel in distress. I can’t stop myself from rescuing her, and I lose my heart in the process.\n\nI find out everything I can about the girl. She’s a survivor. A warrior. Raising five siblings on her own, kicking butt, and looking great doing so.\n\nI set a plan in motion to make her mine. But when she finds out the truth about who I am and where I came from, the house of cards I built falls to pieces. I’m going to have to come clean and clear my name once and for all.\n\nThe question is, even if I can fix the past, am I good enough for an angel like her?\n\nMore Joanna Blake - https://amzn.to/3BEK1Oh\nBlake&#039;s Bombshells FB group - https://bit.ly/3zEspBq \n\nOther Book Mentioned\nWait for It and Lingus by Mariana Zapata\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
