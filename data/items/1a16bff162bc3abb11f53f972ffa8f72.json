  "title": "AFC Team-by-team NFL Draft Grades: Broncos get top marks with 'A' while Raiders labeled with 'D' draft (Football 5/4)",
  "description": "The draft is done and the grades are in. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to discuss marks for each team in the AFC. The guys start in the AFC East (2:45), where the Jets and Patriots both landed 1st-round quarterbacks, the Dolphins cashed in on 2 first-rounders and the Bills looked to bolster a squad that made the conference championship game last season. We progress to the AFC North (23:00), where Breech's Bengals landed a kicker, Wilson's Steelers' secured a 1st-round running back, the Ravens added help for Lamar Jackson and the Browns kept building one of the best rosters in the league. The AFC South collectively were issued the worst grades (42:00), minus the Jaguars, who picked a generational talent, Trevor Lawrence. The Titans, Texans and Colts could have done better. And the AFC West is secretly, or maybe not-so-secretly, shaping up to be one of the best divisions in football (58:30). The Broncos, Chiefs and Chargers are fared well in the draft, but the Raiders fell behind, per usual. \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
