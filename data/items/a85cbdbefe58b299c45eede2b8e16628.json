  "description": "<div>The gals discuss a couple of utterly bonkers cults that have somehow evaded the spotlight in recent years. These stories will have you saying \"Uganda be kidding me!\" and googling travel agencies to take you to the comet Hale-Bopp (AKA San Diego). Episode topics include our odds for scoring a Nike endorsement deal, #tfw your apocalypse predictions are thwarted, and everyone's favorite company, Herbalife. This week's wine pairing has a bizarre (and somewhat inexplicable) cult following of its own: Kendall Jackson Chardonnay. Go grab a bottle (you know it's on sale) and enjoy!<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
