Even if Coco is leaving Hololive, she will continue to be an inspiration to millions of artists, musicians, and creators, including myself. I hope you enjoy!\n\nH U G E thank you to @Kuri_Woo who composed the incredible music for this film - without you, this film would have fallen flat on its face haha. (no seriously, Woo has carried the entire past two films now. Absolute god.) More variations on the theme will be coming soon, so keep an eye out for that! Follow him now, or else.\nhttps://twitter.com/Kuri_Woo\n\nThank you to the viewers who helped me out with several of the paintings! It gives a quality that I could never achieve on my own.\n\nWebsite, for all of my artworks and content:\nhttps://myxoch.com\n\nTwitter, to keep up to date:\nhttps://twitter.com/CrashLandStudio\n\nDiscord, to get more involved:\nhttps://discord.gg/FkWtKHc3V2\n\nThanks for stopping by!",
