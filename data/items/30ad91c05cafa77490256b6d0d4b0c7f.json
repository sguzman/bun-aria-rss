  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 12 step program isn’t for everyone. It didn’t work for Angie Manson, so she decided to create a better way.  Her drinking and using started at just 11 years old, and Angie found herself in rehab by age 16. Like many others, all she did there was meet more people to party with. Having been arrested 8 times by age 18, Angie found herself facing embezzlement charges and 10 years in prison.  Sentenced to a year in rehab, Angie got into a place run out of a guy’s house who had helped her friend get clean.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working for her keep, Angie learned all positions in the organization. Seeing her progress over a 3 year period, the judge declared Angie a success story.  She proved him right when she went on to open her own rehab center.  One that doesn’t take the traditional 12 step course.  In Angies program you are not powerless over your addiction. It’s about addressing what happened to you, what you did in turn, and then making amends for it. Angie says making amends to yourself is often overlooked but is a vital step. She discusses topics like this and more on her podcast, The Elevate Experience.</span></p> <div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Show Notes:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" title= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-target-href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison\">https://underdogempowerment.com/angie-manson</a></span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <ol class=\"listtype-number listindent1 list-number1\" start=\"1\"> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" data-target-href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol> <p> </p>",
