  "description": "A U.N. climate summit is underway this week in Glasgow, Scotland. Many of the world's top carbon emitting-countries will be represented there. Scientists say they need to do more to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. <br/><br/>The U.S, along with the China, are the world's top greenhouse gas emitters. India is third. And Brazil plays a crucial role in global climate, because it is home to vast rainforests that feed on carbon. But those rainforests are disappearing faster until the current government. <br/><br/>Ahead of the summit, NPR international correspondents in China, India, and Brazil gathered to discuss what climate action those countries are taking:  <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/705255512/emily-feng\">Emily Feng</a> in Beijing, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/463861805/lauren-frayer\">Lauren Frayer</a> in Mumbai, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2101062/philip-reeves\">Philip Reeves</a> in Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer\">Lauren Sommer</a> outlined the stakes at the Glasgow summit <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/29/1045344199/cop26-glasgow-climate-summit\">here</a>. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
