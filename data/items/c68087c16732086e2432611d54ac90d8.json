  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Lance Armstrong's investment in Uber. An investment in a venture capital fund that bought into Uber has proved a lifeline for the disgraced cyclist. Armstrong's $100,000 investment has made him about $20 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Also discussed is Major League Baseball's decision to move up the start time of ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball, which will now begin at 7 p.m. Eastern instead of an hour later. The new time slot means baseball will, for the first hour of the game, compete against 60 Minutes, which begins at the same time. Also touched on is NCAA President Mark Emmert's three-year contract extension through 2023.</p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
