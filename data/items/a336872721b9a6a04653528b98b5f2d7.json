  "description": "I was quite surprised when I learnt that a maximum likelihood estimate follows asymptotically a normal distribution with the mean being the estimated value and the variance being the inverse of the Fisher Information multiplied by the number of observations. Asymptotically means when you have a big number of samples to calculate your ML estimate. [&#8230;]",
