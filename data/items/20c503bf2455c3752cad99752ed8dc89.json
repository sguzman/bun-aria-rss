  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Justin Gest, Dr Lisa McKenzie, Dr Dennis Novy | Welcome to LSE IQ, a new monthly podcast from the London School of Economics and Political Science. This is the podcast where we ask some of the leading social scientists - and other experts - to answer intelligent questions about economics, politics or society. A year on from the EU Referendum, academics, the media, politicians and policy makers have sought to understand why the UK public voted for Brexit. One demographic in particular has come under scrutiny for their apparent role in the leave vote. In this episode Sue Windebank asks what Brexit can tell us about the white working class? This episode features: Dr Justin Gest co director of LSE’s Migration Studies Unit and Assistant Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University; Dr Lisa McKenzie, Fellow in LSE’s Department of Sociology and; Dr Dennis Novy, an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Warwick and an Associate at the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.
