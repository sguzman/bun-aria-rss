  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, at his very first press conference, President Biden learned from President Obama how to filibuster his answers by droning on and on. Biden falsely describes the HR-1 Bill as a remnant of Jim Crow. The Democrats don't have any principles and all they want is power. The filibuster has nothing to do with race yet Al Sharpton is going after two Senators for disagreeing with their Democrat colleagues on destroying the filibuster. All Americans should call Sen. Joe Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and respectfully request that they support the filibuster and reject any moves to kill it. Then, Fox News contributor Joe Concha calls in to explain why Biden danced around the friendly questions from the social activists posing as reporters in his very first press conference. Concha agreed that it seemed very curious that in the four decades that Biden was in Congress he never took any action to change the filibuster. Later, the border is still a mess and the Democrats will not admit that they are bringing in immigrants to turn red states into blue states and will use these migrants to get it done. The Biden administration has only allowed the media into one facility and they barely pushback at the lack of transparency.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
