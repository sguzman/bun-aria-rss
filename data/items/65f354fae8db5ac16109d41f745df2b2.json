  "description": "Susan Monica was a farmer in her 60’s with her very own property where she raised chickens and pigs and worked on beautiful wrought iron fences. She had made it through much of her life flying under the radar. That was until one of the handymen on her farm, Robert Haney disappeared without a trace. The last anyone knew of his whereabouts was that he was living in a camper on Susan’s property. During the search for Robert, Susan told the police had something to confess- not only about Robert’s disappearance but another mans as well. She drew a map for the detectives with an “X” in the middle telling them, “That’s where you’re going to find Steve.”<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.news10.com/news/hundreds-of-bodies-discovered-under-rhode-island-highway-during-search-for-gravesite/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.news10.com/news/hundreds-of-bodies-discovered-under-rhode-island-highway-during-search-for-gravesite/</a><br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: Get up to fourteen free meals—including free shipping! — with code morbid14 at <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid14\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid14</a>.<br>\n<br>\nNative: Go to <a href=\"http://NativeDeo.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">NativeDeo.com/morbid</a> or use promo code morbid at checkout to save 20% on your first purchase.<br>\n<br>\nBetterHelp: Special offer for Morbid listeners: get 10% off your first month at <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/Morbid\" target=\"_blank\">betterhelp.com/Morbid</a><br>\n<br>\nDoorDash: If you’re ready to save money on your Doordash orders, use promo code MORBIDTRUECRIME for 50% off your first order of 12 dollars or more, after you sign up for Dashpass.<br>\n<br>\nRothy’s: Right now, you can get $20 off your first purchase at <a href=\"http://rothys.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">rothys.com/MORBID</a>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
