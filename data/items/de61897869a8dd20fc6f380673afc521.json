  "description": "<p>So far in the second movement of Numbers, the leaders of the twelve tribes of Israel have rebelled against Yahweh, the people themselves have rebelled against Yahweh, and even the Levites have rebelled against Yahweh. In fact, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and Caleb are the only people that <i>haven’t</i> rebelled. So what happens when those closest to Yahweh fail to obey his word, too? In this episode, Tim and Jon talk about Moses’ rebellion, the high cost of leading God’s people, and humanity’s deep need for a more faithful representative to intercede on our behalf.</p><p><a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/podcasts/the-bible-project-podcast/\">View full show notes from this episode →</a></p><p><strong>Timestamps </strong></p><ul><li>Part one (00:00-14:55)</li><li>Part two (14:55-39:37)</li><li>Part three (39:37-55:08)</li></ul><p><strong>Referenced Resources</strong></p><ul><li>“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Alla_Inscription\"><i>Deir Alla</i> Inscription</a>”</li><li>Interested in more?
