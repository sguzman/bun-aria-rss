  "description": "<p>Have you wondered what Nate is up to recently? Then you don't want to miss this episode. The guys also perform an autopsy on the last two years of being alive, looking at how things have played out in our country, specifically with the test case of Nate's children's own shenanigans with Stickergate. Standing up to tyrants is a lot more costly than you might think -- but it's vital you show your children how to do it. And you'll get lots of good advice on being able to read your own history in this episode.
