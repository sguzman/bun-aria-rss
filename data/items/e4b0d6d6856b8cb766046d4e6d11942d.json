  "description": "<p>Extreme political polarization. Weaponized misinformation. Media incentivized to divide. And growing inequality. Our democratic experiment has seen better days. How do we reimagine it for the betterment of all?</p><p>Spiritual thought leader, activist, and political writer&nbsp;<strong>Marianne Williamson</strong>&nbsp;says it begins with&nbsp;<em>love</em>.</p><p>You may know Marianne for her Presidential bid in 2020—the democratic candidate unafraid to ask the bigger questions about what matters most.</p><p>But if that’s the sum total of your relationship with this human, prepare yourself for a force of nature that extends well beyond that singular life chapter.</p><p>The author of 14 books (including four #1 New York Times bestsellers), Marianne has been a leader in spiritual and religiously progressive circles for over three decades. She is the founder of Project Angel Food, a non-profit that has delivered more than 14 million meals to ill and dying homebound patients since 1989. Marianne created the group to help people suffering from the ravages of HIV/AIDS. She has also worked on poverty, anti-hunger, and racial reconciliation issues throughout her career. In 2004, she co-founded The Peace Alliance and continues to support the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace.</p><p>I first met Marianne at a fundraiser back in 2014 during her bid for Congress. Fascinated by her bold and unconventional presence on the Presidential stage—particularly her debate performances—I’ve followed her career closely for years and always admired her unique perspective on democratic principles and responsibility.</p><p>Today’s conversation is about what’s required to solve our most urgent problems—from the perils of our entrenched government-media-industrial complex and the ills of corporate stranglehold on governance, to the legacy of 60’s activism, the role of spirituality in politics and the complex relationship between personal evolution and global change.</p><p>To read more,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/marianne-williamson-663/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
