  "title": "Two mothers clash over integration in 'What's Mine & Yours'",
  "description": "At the center of author Naima Coster's novel <em>What's Mine & Yours</em> are two struggling mothers. Jade is a Black single mother who is trying to provide a better life for her son, and Lacey May is a white mother who is trying to give her daughters the life she never had. Their stories will intertwine over decades, starting with when Lacey May opposes the integration of her daughters' school – the same school Jade is trying to get her son into. Coster told NPR's Audie Cornish that fiction gives us a window into other people's lives but that does not mean we have to condone their actions.",
