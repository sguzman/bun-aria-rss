  "description": "<p>Our guest this week is none other than Chicago Bulls legend, Joakim Noah. This is about as meaty as a conversation gets with topics discussed from his childhood to prime Derek Rose and so much more. But first, JJ and Tommy talk about the early MVP race and how Giannis Antetokounmpo should be the favorite now. Then we immediately get to Joakim Noah. Topics include: Joakim's comments on Cleveland, Joakim's childhood and how he fell in love with basketball, how he landed at Florida and won two National Championships, why he returned to Florida after winning his first National Championship, his rookie season in Chicago where his team voted to suspend him, the nature of things leaking in a locker room like the Jordan Poole / Draymond Green situation, that classic 2009 playoff series between The Chicago Bulls and The Boston Celtics, what it was like playing with prime Derrick Rose, the hope Derrick gave to the city of Chicago, Joakim's recruitment of Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, his thoughts on his ruthless competitiveness today, his time on The New York Knicks, fighting with his head coach Jeff Hornacek, getting another chance with The Memphis Grizzlies, finally retiring from basketball, the work he's doing now with The BAL (Basketball Africa League), Obama's 50th Birthday party game with Kobe Bryant and LeBron James and so much more.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to The Old Man and The Three on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts AND <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/OM3_us_hfd_wiaa_110122\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Listen to OM3 Things on Amazon Music</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/LA/MI/NJ/TN/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/KS/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), visit OPGR.org (OR), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).</em></p><p><em>21+ (18+ NH/WY).
