  "description": "Three stories of people making deals. The first is from Japanese folklore, and it's about making the most of what you have...even when what you have is a dirty piece of straw and a fly friend. The second story is about a man who made a deal with the devil...and all the stupid (maybe brilliant?) decisions he made after that deal. The third story is that of Rumpelstiltskin, a weird little imp that might have been a hero if he didn't insist on purchasing humans. The creature of the week the poludnica, and she is looking out for you and your rights at work...violently. Sponsors: Check out that fresh, delicious goodness sent straight to your door.
