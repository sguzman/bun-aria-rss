  "description": "<p>This week, we are joined by special guest Karen Stamper. Karen is an accomplished painter and collage artist with a special passion for sketchbooks. She teaches workshops in person and online and in this episode, we pick her brains about helping adults loosen up, have fun and learn. As a former art teacher in high schools, Karen has an interesting perspective on the difference between adult students and kids.</p>\n<p>We also discuss the importance of being generous with your knowledge and have an extensive conversation about how artists can take their teaching online, an important topic in this time in which workshops are being cancelled around the world. &nbsp;Our discussion includes how to know if you will enjoy teaching, how to get over fear of the camera, which platforms work best. how to build an audience for your online course, and the importance of encouraging and supporting students through the challenges of learning new things. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Karen's website: <a href=\"https://karenstampercollage.com/\"><u><strong>https://karenstampercollage.com/</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Find Karen's online <a href=\"//www.karen-004e.mykajabi.com\" target=\"_blank\">workshops HERE</a> (new platform)</p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
