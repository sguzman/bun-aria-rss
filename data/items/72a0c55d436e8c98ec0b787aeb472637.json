  "description": "<p>Today on the show we had Donnell Rawlings stop by, but before he came in, we had to of course prank him, and this might be the best one yet! During the interview he speaks on catching covid twice, his father being a drug king pin, brotherly love and more. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to D.A.R.E program for criticizing the HBO show Euphoria, claiming they glorify drug use and addiction. (totally not true) Lastly it’s not a Friday if they don't do a Freaky Friday topic, and today it was about massage envy but not the place! After Envy shares a story of when him and his wife went to a massage class, and him being nervous about getting an erection with the man massaging him we open the phone lines to see if any of our listeners ever nervous about what may happen if a male massages them.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
