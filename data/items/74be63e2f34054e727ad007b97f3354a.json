  "description": "<p>Come with us on a delicious journey through the freezer case at Trader Joe's. Hear how frozen foods can be fresher than the \"fresh\" foods; come along as we sample some of our Customers' favorite frozen finds at a neighborhood Trader Joe's; find out about some new treats coming soon to a Trader Joe's near you. Along the way, we'll share some info about how long frozen food keeps in your freezer (a good long time, it turns out), and the very best way to prepare our much-loved Cauliflower Gnocchi. If you're a frozen foods fanatic, or even if you're more fickle about freezer fare, this episode of Inside Trader Joe's will leave you hungry for more. (Figuratively and literally, we hope)</p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode12-Transcript.pdf\"> Episode 12 Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
