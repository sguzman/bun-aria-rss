  "description": "Need to get up to speed on air yards, yards per route run, aDOT or the other fancy stats that are becoming more relevant these days? We've got a Fantasy Football Advanced Statistics primer for you. We'll tell you our favorite stats to use and briefly talk QB strategy (8:00) before we get into the nitty gritty ... Let's start with some RB stats (10:43) as Ben tells you about High Value Touches (HVT). We cover Derrick Henry and Nick Chubb. What types of touches matter and lead to Fantasy production? WR stats are trendier (19:44) as we tell you why air yards and aDOT matter. You should know what types of routes WRs are running and which players are better fits for PPR leagues. And if a player has a lot of air yards but not a lot of actual receiving yards, what does that mean going forward? We discuss Curtis Samuel, Kenny Golladay, Michael Thomas and more ... As we get to the TE position (34:30), Ben details why a couple of stud TEs are so productive when they run routes, even if they don't run as many routes as you might think. We discuss Mark Andrews, Darren Waller and George Kittle. And we finish with some QB and team stats (51:40). Pay attention to pace statistics! ...
