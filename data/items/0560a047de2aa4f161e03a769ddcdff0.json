  "title": "PMS 2.0 162 - Drew Brees, Matt Patricia, Michael Lombardi, & A Full Super Bowl Conversation. Let's GOOOO",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys give a full breakdown of the Chiefs gritty comeback victory in Super Bowl LIV. Pat discusses who he thinks the blame falls on as most media pundits are either pointing to Kyle Shanahan or Jimmy G, and chats about how scary the Chiefs are, who seemingly still did not play a complete game in the playoffs. Pat also discusses the NFL Honors handed out this year, and why he is very excited for the potential Patrick Mahomes/Lamar Jackson matchup for years to come. Also included is an incredible interview from Radio Row with Super Bowl Champion/MVP, 13x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, 2x Offensive Player of the Year, Walton Payton Man of the Year Winner, and the man who holds almost every passing record in NFL history, New Orleans Saints Quarterback, Drew Brees. Pat clears the air with Drew and chats about the last time they were in Miami together for Super Bowl XLIV, and if that feeling is what keeps him going, what his plans are for next year as some signs may be pointing to retirement, if being left off the NFL All 100 team adds fuel to the fire, and why he excluded kickers and punters from his motivational speech in the locker room at Purdue earlier this year (13:39-24:37). Later, former GM and VP of the Cleveland Browns, member of the New England Patriots coaching staff, author, host of the GM Shuffle podcast and the Lombardi Line on the Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSIN), friend of the show, Michael Lombardi stops by to recap the Super Bowl. Pat and Michael discuss the game, and what the big takeaways were, including Kansas City not being called for one holding penalty, who deserves the most blame for the 49ers blowing a 10 point lead in the 4th quarter, why the 49ers abandoned the run, which few plays decided the game, and where the Chiefs and 49ers go from here. Pat and Michael also discuss Tom Brady's future plans, and how the NFL CBA could put a hold on that and Patrick Mahomes' new contract for the time being (26:31-41:49). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion and current Head Coach of the Detroit Lions, Matt Patricia joins Pat and the boys from Radio Row. He breaks down what it's like coaching in the Super Bowl and how your preparation and mindset going into the game is unlike anything else, how excited he is to be coming back for another year in Detroit and why he still thinks he can be successful there, whether or not he has had any communication with Calvin Johnson recently and if he would entertain trying to bring him back, and his thoughts on the NFL changing into a more offensive minded league (51:04-1:03:11). Make sure you tweet your favorite moments of the NFL season to @PatMcAfeeShow for a chance to be featured on the year end NFL recap video. Enjoy today, it's our last taste of the NFL for a long time. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
