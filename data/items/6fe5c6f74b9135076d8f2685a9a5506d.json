This week we learn that in typical Sofia fashion, not only is she a felon, but she’s now been denied global entry! Guess she’s really staying in Utah forever. The girls then take us down memory lane recalling one of their finest nights when Sofia lost ALL motor skills due to a little ketamine/cocaine mix up…it could honestly happen to anyone right? We also get some tips on how to achieve your BEST orgasm and even a recollection of the girls best orgasms to date. Overall, things are going well for the girls, but it just wouldn’t be normal if there wasn’t some *chaos* sprinkled in the mix. \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nEpisode promo codes:\nBetter Help: http://www.betterhelp.com/SOFIA\nAthena Club: http://www.athenaclub.com promo code: SOFIA\nStitch Fix: http://www.stichfix.com/SOFIA\nFunction of Beauty: http://www.functionofbeauty.com/SOFIA\nLiquid IV: http://www.liquidiv.com promo code: SOFIA\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
