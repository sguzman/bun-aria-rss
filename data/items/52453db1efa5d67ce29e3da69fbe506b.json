  "title": "Episode 251: Tara Calico",
  "description": "The Tara Calico case is one that will have your mind going for days. This is a very prominent case in the true crime world, and for good reason: it’s still unsolved after 33 years. Tara Calico was 19 when she went missing after heading out on a routine bike ride. For years no one was entirely sure what to make of the case, especially when a polaroid showed up and the woman in the photo bore a striking resemblance to Tara. However, as this case unfolds, small town secrets start to surface and many are convinced the answer has been around for years but covered up by the very people claiming to want justice. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.taracalico.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br>\nhttps://www.taracalico.com/<br>\n</a><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/tara-leigh-calico\" target=\"_blank\"><br>\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/tara-leigh-calico</a>\n\n<br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: Get up to fourteen free meals—including free shipping!—when you use code morbid14 at <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid14\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid14</a><br>\n<br>\nBetterhelp: Special offer for Morbid listeners: get 10% off your first month<br>\nat <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">betterhelp.com/MORBID</a><br>\n<br>\nHunterDouglas: Visit <a href=\"http://HunterDouglasdot.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">HunterDouglasdot.com/morbid</a> TODAY for your free Style Gets Smarter design guide with fresh takes, creative ideas and smart solutions for dressing your windows.<br>\n<br>\nEdmunds: Shopping for a car can be overwhelming, but Edmunds is here to guide you to your perfect vehicle.
