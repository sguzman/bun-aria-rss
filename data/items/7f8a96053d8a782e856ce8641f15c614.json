    "media:description": "Amazon's ABOMINATION known as The Rings of Power has been a MASSIVE loss for the corporation. How much? Time will tell. It has also been the frontlines of the Pop Culture War of late. Delivering a catastrophic loss to the activist Access Media. The damage control and cope has just begun.  The good news is we won't see a season 2 for over 2 years. By then, this show will be lost in the void. In this video we cover the single worst defense of this show since it was announced. \n#theringsofpower #LOTRonPrime #Amazon\n\nBecome a Nerdrotic Channel Member\nwww.youtube.com/c/sutrowatchtower/join\n\nSubscribe to The Nerdrotic Network:@Nerdrotic @Nerdrotic Live @Nerdrotic Daily \n\nEdited by @1/4 Black Garrett \nThumbnail @Pierry Chan \nNerdrotic Merch Store!\nhttps://mixedtees.com/nerdrotic\n\nFNT T-Shirt!\nhttps://mixedtees.com/nerdrotic/friday-night-tights\n\nSponsored by GEEK GRIND!\nNerdrotic Blend Coffee from Geek Grind\nUse Promo Code \"Nerdrotic\" for 20% off:\nhttps://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/...\n\nNerdrotic Coffee Cup from Geek Grind:\nhttps://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/...",
