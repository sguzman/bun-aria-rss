  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about how Spectre and Meltdown mitigations are proceeding, with many successes (but some blue-screen-of-death failures, too). Psiphon looks like the souped-up VPN of choice for Iranian dissidents, as that country's Internet crackdown continues. Pop-up ads infest mobile devices as an old tactic finds new scope for its misapplication. Olympic phishing targets South Korean companies. China moves to stop illicit cryptocurrency miners. Jonathan Katz from UMD on bitcoin mining power use. Guest is Udi Yavo from Ensilo on Process Doppelganging. Is there an alt-coin bubble? Sure looks like it.",
