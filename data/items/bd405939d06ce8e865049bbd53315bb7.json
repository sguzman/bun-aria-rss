  "description": "<p>This week, we take a stroll down the path of complete human disaster with a man who let his love of cocaine, and cocaine related idiocy destroy every one of his many opportunities for success. He took the chance to be a Super Bowl hero, and flushed it directly down the toilet, then things somehow got worse... His needs took him down a sad, sordid trail of living in his car, bagging groceries, and crime, that culminates in a lengthy sentence. Stay tuned for the end of the episode to hear what his son, Stanley Jr has done in recent months. Let's just say that the fun definitely doesn't skip a generation. It's a father-son extravaganza of athlete crime!Blow off the Super Bowl, find yourself some cocaine, and lock yourself in the bathroom with Stanley Wilson!!Check us out, every Tuesday.
