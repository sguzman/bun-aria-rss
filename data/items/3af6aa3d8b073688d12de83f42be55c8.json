He breaks down why he thinks he was disrespected by Baker Mayfield at the beginning of the Browns v. 49ers Monday Night Game, and everything surrounding the dap up. He also chats about the 49ers success so far this season, what it's like playing for Kyle Shanahan, and why he thinks things got blown out of proportion with the DapGate situation. Lastly, Sherman issues an apology to Baker Mayfield (1:51-18:41). Also joining Pat and the boys for the remainder of the show live from the box truck in Raleigh, NC, is Thursday cohost and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck. They chat about their \"report card\" thus far from ESPN for the Thursday Night Football games, Pat and Matt discuss how exhilarating it is to catch a foul ball at a baseball game as Pat recounts Foxy getting absolutely BODIED trying to get one while the boys were at the ALDS game between the Yankees and the Twins. Hasselbeck also gives his thoughts on some of the things happening in the NFL including Duck Hodges getting his first start, whether or not Dak stinks, if the 49ers are real or not, and delivers an interesting take on the referee situation in the NFL. And per usual, Matt tells a few incredible stories that you won't hear anywhere else (28:36-01:44:23). Today's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
