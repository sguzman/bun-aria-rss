  "description": "This week on The Colin and Samir Podcast we talk about realizing our dream of making a movie. We’ve had this dream for a while and we’ve talked about it quite a bit, we’ve always wanted to make a documentary, screen it in front of people and then have millions of people watch it….and all of that happened, within a week. \nHere's the link to the film: https://youtu.be/8cvhwquPqJ0\nOn this episode we talk about how it happened, how we felt during the process and how it feels now to reflect back on realizing a dream of ours. Alright so this episodes opens up in Colins apartment as we reflect on making our first movie. \nWe're incredibly grateful to the boys from Yes Theory, everyone who came to the premiere and to everyone who has watched the film so far - we are so excited about the response and can’t wait to make our next film. \nSome big takeaways from this experience - be present in the moment, a lot of times if you put your mind to It, your dreams will come true - but not exactly how you thought they would, or when you thought they would - they might look completely different from how you imagined them, but it’s important to try and recognize when they actually might be happening. \nMake sure to review the pod, like I mentioned, we are now on Anchor which means you can send us a voice message, we’d love to try that feature out and see what kind of voice messages we get from you guys.",
