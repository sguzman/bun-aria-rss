Plus, CBS Sports analyst Danny Kanell swings by to explain how he ended up being a star quarterback at Florida State even though he didn’t start playing football until his junior year of high school, how playing baseball and basketball as a youth helped make him a better football player, why he believes Trevor Lawrence should be excited about the possibility of getting drafted by the New York Jets, why he’s so excited for this weekend is SEC championship game between Alabama and Florida, why he believes this would’ve been the perfect year to have an expanded College Football Playoff field, why he doesn't expect Cam Newton to be the New England Patriots starting quarterback next season, why he believes Jim Harbaugh will be back at Michigan next season, and much more! Later, Jason closes the show with a very special College Football and NFL Weekend edition of the Best Bet. He's been riding a hot streak as of late so you better get on the money train!</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
