  "description": "<p>At any moment, your could life could turn upside down. When tragedy strikes, what do you do?</p><p>How you navigate events beyond your control reveals character. And character is something today’s guest possesses in abundance.</p><p>Faced with a rare form of deadly cancer,&nbsp;<strong>Tommy Rivers Puzey</strong>—affectionately revered across the world as ‘Tommy Rivs’—refused pity. Instead, he doubled down on gratitude. He chose to learn from his suffering, expand his capacity to love, and more than anything, see the pain he endured as a teacher.</p><p>A poet of endurance and philosopher of the human spirit, Tommy is a highly credentialed elite marathoner and ultrarunner with many victories and accolades to his name. He’s also an anthropologist, linguist, doctorate of physical therapy, and massage therapist who has worked with some of the best endurance athletes in the world. But more than anything, he’s a man who is universally beloved for his kindness, generosity, and soulful grace.</p><p>In the summer of 2020, Tommy fell gravely ill with an extremely rare and advanced form of lung cancer that very nearly killed him—and most likely would have killed anyone else. But Rivs isn’t just anyone. Rivs is Rivs. He survived.</p><p>Today Tommy shares his potent story, beautiful perspective, and copious wisdom in a beautifully vulnerable and heart-centered conversation for the ages.</p><p>Without mincing words, this is an extremely real conversation about what it’s like to approach death.</p><p>It’s soulful, at times emotional, and overall, a celebration of the human spirit in all its boundlessness.</p><p>It’s a reminder that life itself is an absolute miracle.</p><p>And it’s a powerful testament that gratitude, positivity, service, community, and love—<em>mostly love</em>—are what life is all about.</p><p>To read more <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/tommy-rivs-648/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
