  "description": "<p>We find that all Feynman integrals (FIs), having any number of loops, can be\ncompletely determined once linear relations between FIs are provided.\nTherefore, FIs computation is conceptually changed to a linear algebraic\nproblem. Examples up to 5 loops are given to verify this observation. As a\nbyproduct, we get a powerful method to calculate perturbative corrections in\nquantum field theory.\n</p>",
