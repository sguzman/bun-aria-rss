  "description": "<p>This week Louise is joined by American artist Jane Davies for a wide-ranging conversation around the topic of exploration. Jane is a true explorer, always experimenting and seeking new ways to access her creative instincts, resulting in fresh and exciting work that never stands still. &nbsp;In this candid conversation, we discuss the role of intuition and the value of constant experimentation but we also admit to going off track sometimes and getting stuck in conventional ways of thinking or working. This isn't just a philosophical conversation - we also share some of our own ways of getting unstuck, including two different very practical collage exercises. If you are feeling stuck or bored, we hope this lively conversation helps you to shake things up again - after all, what's the worst that could happen!?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Jane Davies website <a href=\"https://www.janedaviesstudios.com/\">https://www.janedaviesstudios.com/</a></p>\n<p>Jane on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/janedaviesart/\">https://www.instagram.com/janedaviesart/</a></p>\n<p>Jane on Youtube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/jdaviesVT\">https://www.youtube.com/user/jdaviesVT</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
