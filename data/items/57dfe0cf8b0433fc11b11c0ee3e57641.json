I’ve been holding this in for almost 2 years and, well I could use a debrief so to speak. Love your podcast, it’s helped me a lot as I’m equally obsessed with Bigfoot as I am terrified.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness last night and he jumped out of his truck to go pee. When he jumped back into the truck a very large creature came out from behind the dumpster and stopped and just looked at him. The witness said “I was in shock and terrified, he stood there looking at me…”</p> <p>There are many more details the witness will share with us.</p>",
