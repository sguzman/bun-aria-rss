  "title": "Game Day: Minihane v. Robinson",
  "description": "<p><p>It's Game Day. The most important tennis match in the history of organized athletic competition happens today, in Sudbury, MA, at 1:30pm. The stakes are clear. If Robinson loses, he sits for a lie detector test. If Minihane loses, he must go ice fishing in Madawaska. Looming over the entire affair the the question of whether anyone will ever see the match thanks to the prowess of audio visual whiz Dave Cullinane. It's no coincidence, by the way, that on the eve of such an important match, Blind Mike has decided to drop his journalistic investigation into Red Robingate. What is Robinson hiding, and why? Also today: NESN After Hours keeps getting worse, a 49ers radio guy is suspended for an interesting observation, Howard Stern slobbers all over Hillary Clinton, and Minihane checks in with Tubegalore.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
