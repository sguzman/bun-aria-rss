  "description": "Calm down.   We don’t mean “Trumpocalypse” as in the end of the world.  We mean it in the sense of the end of the Trump presidency.  Who knows, with some luck this could be Trump’s last State of the Union.  And that would be good on so many levels.  For example, as our experts Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake and Ed Luce note, it would save us from having to listen to the inevitable tedious and misleading stories about how the U.S. president has become more presidential and is getting the hang of his job.  He’s not.  And listening to this episode of Deep State Radio will help you understand why…and why you should be thankful that the State of the Deep State is strong.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
