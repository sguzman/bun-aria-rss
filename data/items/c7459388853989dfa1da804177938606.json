  "description": "<p>Meditation: Receiving Life in Open Awareness (2016-10-05) - Our habit is to try to manage our experience from a mental control tower. This meditation awakens us through the body, and then invites us to rest in that vast presence that includes the changing flow of life. When we inhabit that openness, there’s a natural arising of peace, wakefulness and tenderness.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p> <p> </p>",
