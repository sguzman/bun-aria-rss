  "description": "Anti-semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and other parts of the world.\n6 people died this week in Jersey City, New Jersey, in a shootout at a kosher supermarket. The two gunmen appear to have been motivated by anti-semitism and anger against the police. Britain's Labour Party has been rocked by widespread reports of anti-semitism. Labor's second most powerful leader has apologized to the Jewish community and admits the controversy may affect the result of this week's U.K. election.\nOur guest in this episode of \"How Do We Fix It?\" is Bari Weiss, an opinion writer at The New York Times, who covers culture and politics. We discuss her new book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism (Crown, 2019).\n\"When anti-semitism is rising it is the number one sign that a society is dying or maybe is already dead,\" Bari tells us. \"The proximate victims are Jews themselves, but the bigger and overlooked victim, if you look at history, is the surrounding society.\"\nBari mentions this article by the anti-racist scholar and activist Eric Ward: \"Skin in the Game. How Anti-Semitism Animates White Nationalism.\"\nRichard Davies and Jim Meigs are the host of the terrific podcast “How Do We Fix It?,” on which they talk to the world’s most creative thinkers about, well, how to fix things. Lots of things. Important ones. Highly recommended. You can find “How Do We Fix It” on Apple Podcasts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
