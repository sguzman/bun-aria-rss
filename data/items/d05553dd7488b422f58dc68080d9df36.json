  "description": "This episode I describe how we see, meaning how our eyes focus, convert light information into electricity the rest of the brain can understand and how our brain creates the incredible thing we experience as “sight”. I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and whether eyesight, young, adult-age or advanced age.\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:04:51) Protocol: Concurrent Training For Endurance, Strength, Hypertrophy\n(00:07:24) The Senses, Vision, Seeing & What We Should All Do To See Better\n(00:10:35) Our Eyes: What They Really Do, & How They Work\n(00:14:30) Converting Light Into Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion Cells\n(00:17:00) We Don’t See Anything Directly: It Is All A Comparison Of Reflected Light\n(00:19:35) Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View Of The World)\n(00:24:05) Everything You See Is A Best Guess, Blind Spots\n(00:25:50) Depth Perception\n(00:28:00) Subconscious Vision: Light, Mood, Metabolism, Dopamine; Frog’s Skin In Your Eyes\n(00:32:00) Blue-Yellow Light, Sunlight; & Protocol 1 For Better Biology & Psychology;\n(00:35:00) Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours Per Day\n(00:42:00) Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Your Pupils & Your Bendy Lens\n(00:48:50) Protocol 3: Distance Viewing For 20min For Every 90 Minutes of “Close Viewing”\n(00:52:20) Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Yourself Through Space Daily\n(00:54:26) Protocol 5: Be More Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Up Versus Down\n(00:59:21) Protocol 6: Sleep In A Very Dark Room To Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness)\n(01:02:55) Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,\n(01:04:32) Protocol 7: Keeping Your Vision Sharp With Distance Viewing Every Day\n(01:06:05) Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit\n(01:08:48) Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times a Week\n(01:13:33) Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol To Improve Photoreceptors & Vision\n(01:16:20) Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11\n(01:18:40) Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity; Protocol 12\n(01:24:48) Protocol 12: Determine Your Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training\n(01:27:57) Visual Hallucinations: The Consequence of An Under-Active Visual Brain\n(01:29:47) Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: A Simple, Cost-Free Way To Test & Maintain Vision\n(01:33:00) Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow\n(01:44:20) Summary of Protocols, Vital Point About Blood & Oxygen For Vision\n(01:46:00) Episode Length, Captions, Zero-Cost Support, Instagram, Searching Topics\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
