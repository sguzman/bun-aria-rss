In this episode of CyberWire-X, we’ve invited subject matter experts, Amanda Fennell, the Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer of Relativity, and Galeal Zino, CEO of episode Sponsor NetFoundry, to the Cyberwire Hash Table to discuss all the ways to think about the solution in the modern era: Software Defined Perimeter (SDP), Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), identity and authorization, and private WAN, all through a First Principle lens.",
