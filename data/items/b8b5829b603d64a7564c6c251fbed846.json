  "description": "<p>Brains On listeners have LOTS of questions about the human body so we’ve decided to answer nine – count em NINE – of these questions in one go. The terrific topics tackled: Hiccups, yawns, getting dizzy, goosebumps, fingerprints, limbs falling asleep, brain freeze, chattering teeth and why your voice sounds different when it’s recorded.</p>\n<p>Plus: Our Moment of Um answers the question: “Why do we have two lungs?”</p>\n<p>Today’s episode is sponsored by Quip (getquip.com/brainson) and Build-A-Bear Workshop (buildabear.com).
