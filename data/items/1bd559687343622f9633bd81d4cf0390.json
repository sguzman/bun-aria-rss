  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether we recognize it or not, social media is changing us. It changes how we interact with people. It even changes our motherhood—what we buy, what strategies we use, and where we go for hope and help. In the first episode of our social media mini-series, Laura and Emily invite us to wake-up to the impact of social media on our lives. If we want to know how to swim in the waters of social media, we need to take a hard look at it’s risks and pitfalls. But as we bring the gospel to bear on our social media use, we can ask God to shape our desires and impulses for what brings the longest good to our families.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">__</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway,</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">publisher of</span> <em><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Deeper: Real Change for Real Sinners</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Dane Ortlund.
