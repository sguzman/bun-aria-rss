Brief discussion of what is equipossibility. Basket ball inflation analogy used to help visualize the issue. Positing polarizers produce a population of photons with different wave component orientations with different ease of passing different orientations of polarizer, rather than a uniform population. In this way talk of the necessity for faster than light communication or need to abandon local realism becomes superfluous. Relevant to Bell's inequalities.\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n   "
