He has engaged in arguments with camps and tribes throughout the space, remaining unapologetically independent and committed to his values. Though a Bitcoiner at heart, Eric has come around on Ethereum as the ecosystem has matured.</p> <p>In this episode, we dive into values and the ethos of crypto that Eric fights for. As a principled believer in trustless systems and decentralization, Eric walks through many of the big-picture obstacles and accomplishments of the crypto space. Viewing this landscape with a digital biologist's lens, we address these projects as digital organisms, following many of the same laws we see in nature. Wherever organisms exist, Darwin is nearby.</p> <p>Eric brings a refreshing and unfiltered set of takes to the Bankless Podcast, reminiscent of other independent thinkers we've had on like Hasu. Regardless of your opinions on Eric, he represents an important part of the blockchain conversation. He serves as an ideological razor, giving no one the benefit of the doubt and prioritizing accountability and earned legitimacy.</p> <p>------</p> <p>Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:45 Eric Wall, the Altcoin Slayer<br /> 7:45 The Term “Trustless”<br /> 16:58 Eric’s Approach to Crypto<br /> 22:50 Networks are Organisms<br /> 31:50 Survival of the Fittest<br /> 41:50 Bitcoin vs Layer 2<br /> 59:15 Tribes vs Facts<br /> 1:06:30 Eric’s ETH Journey<br /> 1:21:43 Thoughts on Proof of Stake<br /> 1:31:14 Is ETH Money?<br /> 1:40:58 What ETH Gets Wrong<br /> 1:53:55 Navigating the Frontier<br /> 2:01:00 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Eric on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ercwl?s=20\">https://twitter.com/ercwl?s=20</a> <br />  Proof of Stake is Less Wasteful<br /> <a href= \"https://ercwl.medium.com/proof-of-stake-is-less-wasteful-b2854a191766#:~:text=Image%20of%20a%20diesel%20generator,ever%20had%20on%20the%20platform\"> https://ercwl.medium.com/proof-of-stake-is-less-wasteful-b2854a191766#:~:text=Image%20of%20a%20diesel%20generator,ever%20had%20on%20the%20platform</a>. <br />  ETH is Irreplaceable<br /> <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/eth-is-irreplaceable\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/eth-is-irreplaceable</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
