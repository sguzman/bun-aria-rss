  "description": "Jeff Tweedy doesn’t spend a lot of time reflecting on the past. But he awakened a whole lot of it while writing his new memoir. That means he has fresh thoughts on his mind about Jay Farrar, Uncle Tupelo, the early days of Wilco, and coming into his own as a musician and producer, which is on display in his new solo album, Warm. Jeff also talks with Marc about his experiences with mood disorders, painkiller addiction, parenthood, and converting to Judaism. This episode is sponsored by YouTube Music, <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/nightflyers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nightflyers on SYFY</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Music</a>, <a href=\"http://getquip.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quip</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps?referrer=mat_click_id%3D0e537bde55bf16e86294d91f266e7f29-20181128-16948&utm_campaign=marron&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tune_test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the New York Times Crossword App</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
