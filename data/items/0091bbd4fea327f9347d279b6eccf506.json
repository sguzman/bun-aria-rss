He wasn’t the kind of kid you’d pick to one day be an elite boxer, yet he went on to become the only undefeated heavyweight champion in boxing history.

And what happens to a man when fame and fortune are suddenly thrust upon him?</p><p>My guest today explores those questions in his new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1627799192/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1627799192&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Unbeaten: Rocky Marciano’s Fight for Perfection in a Crooked World</em></a>.
