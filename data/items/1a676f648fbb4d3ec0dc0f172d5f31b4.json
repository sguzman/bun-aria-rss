  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, put yourself in Taiwan's shoes, what would you do? What did another tiny country like Israel do? You stay on offense and don't wait to react to an incoming attack. Ukraine's military is way smaller than Russia's and they are not equipped to retaliate if attacked. Perhaps, these little countries should attack smaller targets within their enemy's larger territory and not wait for the slaughter of their people. Then, many immigrants reject Marxism. Whether it's Hispanics or Asians an increasing number of immigrants are voting Republican and standing up against the tyranny of the left. These San Francisco patriots led a recall on school board members and won by an overwhelming margin. Later, why is the government of Canada imposing vaccine mandates on truckers when they're being lifted in the most leftwing cities in America? What's going on in Canada is the disintegration of freedom. Afterward, the CEO of YouTube says that they will implement the government's laws on censoring speech online. Jen Psaki still won't answer questions about the unauthorized surveillance (spying) of President Trump. Finally, Congressman Lee Zeldin calls in to discuss his campaign for Governor of New York.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
