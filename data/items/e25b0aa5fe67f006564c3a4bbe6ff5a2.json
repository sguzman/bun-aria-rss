Presented on 10 December 2016 at the Immersive Environments Colloquium at Vanderbilt University. The high definition, closed captioned presentation briefly introduces viewers to activity theory before drawing parallels between game-based and real-world activity systems. The presentation then details the creation of a 3D digital game-based language learning environment before concluding with a description of how this environment was evaluated and what students learned by being immersed in it.",
