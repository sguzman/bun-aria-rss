  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Initiation, our journey begins now. This episode can really only be defined as \"the works\", we get introduced to Pretzel Day, Schrute Farms, and Mose and we're going to talk about them all. We check in at Stamford and that squeaky chair and a fun Jim-Pam background catch. Then we explore Stanley's love of Pretzel Day and the unexpected bond between him and Michael. Finally, we are joined by two of the best in the biz, BJ Novak and Rainn Willson, to get the inside scoop on all those iconic Ryan, Dwight and Mose moments from this episode. We hope you don't crash too hard after this episode. </p>\n",
