  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we're headed for a recession, businesses can't find employees, there are food shortages, the cost of energy and goods are up because President Biden and the Democrats are imposing a third world economic plan on the United States. The White House supply chain task force is made up of people who've never actually worked in the private industry and don't recognize the severity of their actions. Yet, the White House says that now is the time to fundamentally transform the U.S economy. Then, Democrats will reduce the final dollar amount of their debt proposal to get it through. While extending the end dates of certain programs to hang this future debt on our children and grandchildren. This is partly the result of Democrat governors shutting down their state economies and subsidizing unemployment so people could stay home. Later, natural immunity continues to be ignored by Biden, the CDC, and Anthony Fauci. New studies are finding that antibodies are stronger than previously thought. What difference does it make who's vaccinated as long as you are? Afterward, a Loudoun County dad, whose daughter was raped in a school bathroom, was arrested at a school board meeting last June after the meeting was deemed an unlawful assembly by county sheriffs. He was dragged out for speaking against transgender policies allowing biological boys to enter girls' bathrooms.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
