  "description": "Believe it or not, the summer entertainment season is half over. Fall TV will be firing up in just a few short weeks, and the summer movies of 2018 have just about run out. (Mission: Impossible — Fallout is the only big release still coming.) That makes it a great time to check in on some of the biggest pop culture items of the summer, in this special episode with two different segments.\n\nFirst, Salon's Melanie McFarland and Vanity Fair’s Sonia Saraiya join Todd to talk about the second season of Hulu's The Handmaid’s Tale, which all of them liked until they found certain elements of its ending deeply polarizing. They’ll talk about the baffling moments of the finale, the show’s depiction of racial issues, and where they think it might be going in season three.\n\nThen, Vox's Karen Han and The Undefeated's Soraya Nadia McDonald join Todd to talk about the summer’s biggest movies, from blockbusters to smaller films you might have missed. If you’re looking for something to see at the multiplex this weekend, this is a must-listen, so check it out.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
