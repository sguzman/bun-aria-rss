And I tell you all about it in today's podcast.</p> <p>Some of you will be like me and just get mad when you don't feel good. Others will feel sad and just shut down. And a lot of us will turn to food to make us feel better.</p> <p>Today we talk about really noticing your habits when you don't feel well. We teach you how to pause and ask yourself to be honest about what you really need. Sometimes it's rest, sometimes it's easier tasks, but it's usually not chocolate or cheetos or ice cream.</p> <p> </p>",
