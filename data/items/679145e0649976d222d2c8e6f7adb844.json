  "description": "<p>Simon's problem is a standard example of a problem that is exponential in\nclassical sense, while it admits a polynomial solution in quantum computing. It\nis about a function $f$ for which it is given that a unique non-zero vector $s$\nexists for which $f(x) = f(x \\oplus s)$ for all $x$, where $\\oplus$ is the\nexclusive or operator. The goal is to find $s$. The exponential lower bound for\nthe classical sense assumes that $f$ only admits black box access. In this\npaper we investigate classical complexity when $f$ is given by a standard\nrepresentation like a circuit. We focus on finding the vector space of all\nvectors $s$ for which $f(x) = f(x \\oplus s)$ for all $x$, for any given $f$.\nTwo main results are: (1) if $f$ is given by any circuit, then checking whether\nthis vector space contains a non-zero element is NP-hard, and (2) if $f$ is\ngiven by any ordered BDD, then a basis of this vector space can be computed in\npolynomial time.\n</p>",
