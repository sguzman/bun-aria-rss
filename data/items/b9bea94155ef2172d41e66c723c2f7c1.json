  "description": "Interior Designer Tammy Connor’s goal is to make hard work look easy and to focus on implementing more about what her clients really love vs. what’s in trend for the moment. Tammy joins the show this week to talk about her signature style of real, livable homes, how she ended up going from working in Alabama to Atlanta, and why rules really are meant to be broken when it comes to design. Tammy also talks about her projects including The Sword Gate House in Charleston, her Seaside Cottage, and Sewanee Cabin. You’ll also hear Tammy’s tricks of the trade to creating the perfect “man room”, and yes - it involves leather.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nTammy’s goal is to help her clients make their home look less perfect, and more like they just have great taste and have collected beloved pieces over time.\n\nTrends may come and go, but a believable color scheme and authentic use of a home will always stay in vogue.\n\nTammy feels we must know the rules before we break them, and you can follow what you love rather than jumping on every latest trend.\n\nThe advice Tammy would give to young entrepreneurs from opening up her own business at 25, and what she may do differently if she had a second chance.\n\nTammy loves working with people on their first home, but by the time they get to their second or third, the wheels are already set in motion and they trust her vision much more.\n\nMore about her first client, The Sword Gate House in Charleston, and how she landed the chance to work on this historically significant home.\n\nThe differing approach Tammy had for projects such as a Central Park Apartment, her Showhouses, and the Historic Hunting Pavilion.\n\nWhy it’s important to have a thread throughout rooms that both ties them together and gives our eyes a place to rest.\n\nWays Tammy uses proportion and 3d to work with small and large spaces that can have challenging spacial issues.\n\nNeutral upholstery can serve to highlight other objects and put the focus on other things in the room.\n\nMentioned In This Episode: \nTammy Connor Interior Design \nHistoric Hunting Plantation\n@tammyconnor \nSewanee Cabin \nDecorating Dilemma \nTwo things you can do. You can keep the red brick and paint the rest of the trim to match the windows and doors. Or, if you wanted to do a whitewash on the brick and paint the trim green instead of blue. A good green is...wait for it... Charleston Green! We love what you have done so far, and you are really stepping up that ranch!",
