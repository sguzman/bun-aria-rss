  "description": "<p><em><strong>Unified - Part Three: Treating Symptoms & Roots</strong></em>. Mike continues with the concepts of ‘Bounded, Fuzzy & Centered’ sets <strong>(as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker) </strong>and how they pertain to Church Discipline and leaving behind the judgment of Bounded Churches. Critiquing a Bounded Church is not a critique of boundaries; boundaries are often healthy expressions of care - without limits children do not thrive. While boundaries are good things, a Bounded Church twists and misuses them. A Bounded Church is one whose identity is <strong>defined by the boundary line</strong> and who uses the boundary line to self-righteously divide the included from the excluded.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Discipline in Bounded Churches: Focus is boundary. Not much grace for failure and the focus is on externals, not internals. Exclusion and Shame.</li>\n <li>Discipline in Fuzzy Churches: Avoid most judgment altogether (except for the people who do draw lines). Avoid making someone else feed bad.</li>\n  <li>Discipline in Centered Churches: Deal with each case individually. Deal with roots, not symptoms. Relationship building; mutual learning and transformation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
