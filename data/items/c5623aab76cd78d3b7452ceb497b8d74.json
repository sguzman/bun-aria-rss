  "description": "<p>Someone important has already come, and is coming again. Have you told your children? Despite the busyness and the expectations around us, Advent is a perfect time to rest the hearts of our family on the Savior. But how exactly can we do that with small children or less-than-ideal-circumstances? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the opportunity we have to point our children to Jesus during Advent. They also share practical ideas for engaging children in the Christmas story, and encourage moms who feel like they can't live up to the Pinterest-perfect standards. Ultimately, it's the most wonderful time of the year, not because of the presents or the decorations, but because of a person.</p> <p>Like what you hear?
