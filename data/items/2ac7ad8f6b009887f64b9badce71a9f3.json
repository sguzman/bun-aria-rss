  "description": "<p>English is my second language, which will be obvious to readers of this page \nbecause sometimes I screw up. It is what it is.</p>\n<p>There are people out there that think that the <em>cryptospace</em> is something \ncompletely useless, but I must thank it publicly for teaching me things about \nEnglish that I didn't know before.</p>\n<p>For example, there's the word \"scam\". It's already pretty short, but it turns \nout one can shorten it even more by writing it as \"NFT\". Amazingly, when \npronounced, the shorter version is longer. Isn't it great?</p>",
