  "description": "<p>Welcome to the wide world of alternative relationship models. Opening up, threesomes, and swinging are increasingly becoming more mainstream, so naturally, we’ve got questions. Some of us do better with monogamy, but some of us thrive with a little variety - and no matter where we land on the spectrum of relationships and sex, we can always gain vocabulary to explore our desires, and act on our pleasure.</p><br><p>So on today’s show, I take your questions on open relationships and we get into it. First, we tackle open relationships when we’re already partnered. How do you establish the ground rules? What do you do when your partner has a date but you don’t, and you feel that jealousy coming on? Next, threesomes and swinging: how do you practice safe sex in a <em>group</em> sex situation? Finally: when you’re the third party, what’s the best way to talk to the partner of your partner? In this case, and truly all others, the key is becoming a grade A communicator – because if there’s one thing you can count on in an alternative relationship, it’s lots and lots of talking.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1128665.Opening_Up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Up: A Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships by Tristan Taormino</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
