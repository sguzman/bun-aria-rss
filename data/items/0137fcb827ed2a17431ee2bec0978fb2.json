  "description": "Technically, this episode is not just about the Tennessee coaching search. We do talk a little bit about the Big 12/Big Ten/Pac-12/SEC Championship Games. We do try to understand the doublespeed mind of Jimbo Fisher. We do guess if Herm Edwards is older than Notable Old CFB Dudes. But most of this is about Tennessee continuing to bumble through a coaching search - and, yes, we DID finish recording right before the Mike Leach rumors all broke.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
