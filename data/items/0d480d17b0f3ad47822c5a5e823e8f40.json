  "description": "With DJ traveling for multiple pro days this week, Bucky Brooks is joined by Lance Zierlein on today’s show to discuss Montez Sweat’s heart condition (14:00), what Ryan Fitzpatrick’s signing with Miami means for the QB market in the draft (18:00). Then, the guys debate which prospect they would have No. 1 on their positional “big board” with QBs Kyler Murray vs. Dwayne Haskins (23:20), WRs D.K. Metcalf vs. Marquise Brown (26:10), Edge Rushers Nick Bosa vs. Josh Allen (31:00), LBs Devin White vs. Devin Bush (34:00). Bucky caught up with all 4 Clemson starting defensive linemen early this month (40:20), and to close the show, the guys put on their scouting caps to hypothetically address if Zion Williamson would enter the draft, would he be a first round pick?
