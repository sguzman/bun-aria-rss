He began his entrepreneurial career by hosting LinkedIn meetups around the country, and co-authoring the successful book LinkedWorking. He has hosted over 400 webinars, spoken to thousands at conferences and events, and educated career professionals and business owners around the world on the power of LinkedIn.</p><p>Not enough?&nbsp;He's also a member of the U.S. National Team Handball squad.&nbsp;He loves CrossFit too.&nbsp;Don't worry, we get into all of it.</p><p>Oh yeah, he's also the host of <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-school-of-greatness/id596047499?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">The School of Greatness Podcast</a>, currently blowing up charts on iTunes.&nbsp;I was honored to be a guest on his show a couple weeks back and am pleased that he joined me for an enlightening and inspiring chat about discovering, unlocking, and unleashing your best, most authentic self – my favorite subject.</p><p>I hope you dig the show and end up as inspired as I was sitting down with him in person.</p><p>Enjoying the podcast and want to support the show?
