  "description": "The UCI hosts a dataset of wine measurements that is fantastic for demonstrating the importance of feature scaling in unsupervised learning . There are a bunch of real-valued measurements (of e.g. chemical composition) for three varieties of wine: Barolo, Grignolino and Barbera. I am using this dataset to introduce feature scaling my course on DataCamp. &#8230; <p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https://building-babylon.net/2017/01/17/wine-dataset-demonstrates-importance-of-feature-scaling/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Wine dataset demonstrates importance of feature scaling\"</span></a></p>",
