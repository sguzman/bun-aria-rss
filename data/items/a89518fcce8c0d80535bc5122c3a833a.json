  "description": "Well, if there is one word that sums up this particular interview on the Old Man & the Three, it’s “real”. As in, keeping it real. And the person behind that word is the one and only Gabrielle Union - the superstar actress, best-selling author, and wife and partner of Dwyane Wade. In this raw, brutally honest and often times hilarious conversation, she lays it on the line and doles out some truths on several topics, including what it’s like being a black actress in Hollywood, how her acting career got started, why she decided to write her books, how emptying her “fucks” basket changed her life, and much more. Plus, she talks about her new book “Got Anything Stronger?”, which is a follow up to her best-selling initial release “We’re Going to Need More Wine”. It’s a spectacular discussion that you do not want to miss. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
