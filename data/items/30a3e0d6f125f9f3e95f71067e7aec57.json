  "description": "<p>When Kurt Andersen started working on his new podcast, Nixon at War, he thought he knew a lot about Richard Nixon’s presidency, especially the bookend events of his 1968 campaign and his 1973 resignation. Devastating events with far-reaching consequences but unrelated - or so he thought. The surprising connections between the two are at the heart of Nixon at War. Kurt Andersen is a prize-winning novelist, historian, and public radio host (<em>Studio 360</em>). His most recent books -- <em>Evil Geniuses</em>, <em>Fantasyland,</em> and <em>You Can’t Spell America Without Me,</em> were all New York Times bestsellers.
