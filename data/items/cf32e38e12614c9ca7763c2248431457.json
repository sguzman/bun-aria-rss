  "description": "<p>One of the best 80s films is, the envelope please, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. Here's the plot: near the end of the school year, high school senior Ferris Bueller (played by <strong>Matthew Broderick</strong>) fakes being sick to stay home. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeanie (played by <strong>Jennifer Grey</strong>, the baby you don’t back into a corner) is not convinced. Ferris persuades his best friend Cameron (<strong>Alan Ruck</strong>) to help lure Ferris' girlfriend (<strong>Mia Sara</strong>) out of school and let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari. Spoiler:  that Ferrari tumbles out of a really cool Modernist house, much to the chagrin of Cameron and his dad. Our pal <strong>Bob Langford</strong>, who pretty much knows every line in the movie, drops by to help us examine this cultural icon with guest <strong>Meghann Salamasick</strong>, who with her husband Chris are the owners of the that now-famous Modernist house. Later in the show, with apologies to <strong>Wayne Newton</strong>, it's George and Bob and Tom serenading Meghann.</p>",
