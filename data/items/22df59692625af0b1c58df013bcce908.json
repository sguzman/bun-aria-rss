This begs the question: what is the cure?</p><p>Welcome to the mind of&nbsp;David Sinclair, PhD,&nbsp;one of the world’s leading scientific authorities on longevity, aging and how to slow its effects.</p><p>A&nbsp;professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, David obtained his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney in 1995 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher&nbsp;at M.I.T. where, among other things, he co-discovered the cause of aging for yeast.</p><p>The co-founder of several biotechnology companies, David is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal&nbsp;Aging. His work has been featured in a variety of books, documentaries, and media, including&nbsp;60 Minutes, Nightline&nbsp;and&nbsp;NOVA. He is an inventor on 35 patents, has been lauded as one of the&nbsp;Top 100 Australian Innovators, and made&nbsp;TIME&nbsp;magazine’s list of the&nbsp;100 most influential people in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>In addition, David is the author of the forthcoming book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501191977/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1501191977&linkId=8ea96c523b2cd4a3ca2b0dc44650d195\" target=\"_blank\">Lifespan: The Revolutionary Science of Why We Age — and Why We Don't Have To</a>*&nbsp;which hits bookstores on Sept. 10 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501191977/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1501191977&linkId=8ea96c523b2cd4a3ca2b0dc44650d195\" target=\"_blank\">is currently available for pre-order here*.</a></p><br><p>This is an absolutely fascinating conversation on all things human lifespan, aging and longevity. We&nbsp;begin with the specific scientific mechanisms that contribute to biological degeneration. Then we dive deep into the hard science David and his peers are examining to better understand what contributes to aging and how to prevent it.</p><p>According to David, the prospect of living to 200+ is not a pipe dream, but a very possible reality.
