Nick, Pete and Will then hit on the Saints surge (32:56), Adrian Peterson's impressive Arizona debut (37:52), whether to sell Redskins stock despite a win (40:44), and if the Ravens are dead (44:17).\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
