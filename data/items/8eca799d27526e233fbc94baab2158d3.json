It seems as if they are, it's as if the only thing holding NFTs up in value is the hype surrounding them, the perceived value, which is fragile to say the least. What happens when the hype dies down?\n\nVideos mentioned:\nWhy are NFTs so Ugly?: https://youtu.be/wDtt24RxdLk\nWhat the hell are NFT's?: https://youtu.be/XwMjPWOailQ\n\nPeople also have the opinion that NFTs are stupid, or dumb and I feel the same way instinctively, but only time will tell if any of that is true. Large companies are now minting NFTs like Ubisoft Quarks, McDonalds with the McRib and many more. NFTs are plaguing the gaming industry and that's something that we will need to look into in more detail.",
