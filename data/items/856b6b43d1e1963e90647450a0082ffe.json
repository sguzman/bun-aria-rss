  "description": "Over the weekend Bolt CEO Ryan Breslow wrote a big thread on why he thinks Y Combinator isn&#039;t worth it. We break it down point by point and assess the validity of the claims (7:07). Right before we started recording, news broke that Breslow was leaving the CEO role to assume the executive chairman position, so we cover that too (2:11). Then, we cover Joe Rogan’s expla-nology (explanation/apology) video regarding his COVID-related interviews that have upset many. We react to his response, Spotify&#039;s new COVID policy and reflect on the risks to Spotify’s business overall (44:32).",
