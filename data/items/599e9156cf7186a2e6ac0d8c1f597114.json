  "description": "Clever Hans is clever. He knows the best way to store needles and knives and how to carry a goat in your pockets on long walks through the country. He's even getting married to Gretel, and we'll see how taking advice on wooing your fiancee from your mom can end up in way too much mutilation. The second story is also about Hans! A different one. It's about cat chefs and following voices down into the dark places under the earth. The creature is why you'll want to pack a lunch and brush up on some cicada-speak (protip: it's just buzzing) the next time you plan on stealing from the guardians of the forest.
