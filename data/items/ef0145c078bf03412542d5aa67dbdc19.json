We're taking our mission into communities by partnering with educational and cultural institutions like National University, the San Diego Museum of Art, the State University of New York at Potsdam, Ferrum College, and literacy organizations. And we're working with high school students.\n\nA Way with Words receives no money from any radio station or government agency. No NPR funding. Nothing from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or from stations that air the show. Instead, we rely on your tax-deductible donations.\n\nIn fact, A Way with Words is one of just a handful of independent national shows on public radio.\n\nWhy do we create and distribute the show at no cost to stations?\n\nBecause we believe everyone should be able to learn more about language, no matter who they are, or where they are.\n\nWe're creating a place to tell stories about language and share linguistic heirlooms. We're supporting literacy and lifelong learning. We're supporting better human understanding by encouraging better communication. Help us keep making a difference.
