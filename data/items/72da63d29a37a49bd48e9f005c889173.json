While reports of UFOs and close encounters are littered with dates, times, and descriptions, they rarely focus on the people who’ve had the experience. Could both the positive and negative implications, whether subtle or revelatory, further our knowledge of what these phenomena represent? <br>\n<br>\nRyan is host of Somewhere in the Skies podcast every Monday, and co-host the television series, 'Mysteries Decoded' on the CW Network for their UFO episodes.  <br>\n<br>\nGet the book here:  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/36E7dQo&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3dLd_UU2TL7udGnWoTzbtl\">https://amzn.to/36E7dQo</a></p>\n\n<p>Visit his site here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://t.co/lCADtNnkeO?amp%3D1&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw1Qw36wHF2BDSHKw06Emtyk\">http://somewhereintheskies.com</a><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n",
