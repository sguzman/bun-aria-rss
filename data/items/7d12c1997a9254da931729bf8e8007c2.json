  "description": "Most books on the psychology of love relationships emphasize feelings, but Michael and Sarah Bennett‘s new book F*ck Love: One Shrink’s Sensible Advice for Finding a Lasting Relationship (Touchstone, 2017) takes a uniquely business-like approach to the topic. In so doing, these authors make a compelling argument for why long-lasting relationships depend more on quality of partnership than romance, and they offer concrete, practical guidelines for establishing and maintaining solid partnership. The book is humorous in tone but serious in purpose, as you’ll hear in our interview. They talk with me about the clinical work and personal experiences which inspired their approach and offer sage advice about relationships.\n\nListen to the interview by clicking below.
