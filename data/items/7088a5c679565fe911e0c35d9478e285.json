  "description": "Today on the podcast we are exited to have Dr. Cynthia Shafer-Elliott, Associate Dean and Associate Professor in the School of Theology at William-Jessup University.  But that’s not all!  Dr. Shafer-Elliott is also is an experienced field archaeologist in Israel and is currently part of the archaeological excavation team at Tell Halif, Israel. Dr. Shafer-Elliott discusses her findings in the field and why context is important to the Bible.  In this conversation we also explore how the smallest artifacts tell the biggest stories, and that how we do anything is how we do everything.   Dr. Shafer-Elliott brings such a unique perspective to the Biblical story, as well as being an accomplished woman in the field.
