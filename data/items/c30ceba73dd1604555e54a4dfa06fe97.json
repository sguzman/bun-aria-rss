  "description": "One of ET's favorite quotes and one he lives by is, \"Where your focus goes, your energy flows.\" On today's podcast, CJ plays a clip of a viral ET moment where E calls out multiple excuses given for why he can't be successful. These excuses are all based on emotion instead of rational thought. Right now, across the country and the world, emotions are running higher than usual and, given current events, this is understandable and, expected. But, we know from experience that decisions and actions taken based on emotion instead of facts and principles don't always give us the outcomes we've sought. Today, ET and the guys offer tangible, strategic steps to creating real and, sustainable change whose roots are anchored in facts, not feelings.\n The Secret to Success Topics:\n  [05:05] - Trey’s Comedy Corner\n [09:35] - Happy Birthday Avery\n [20:55] - I Get It\n [30:00] - The Wrong Key\n [40:00] - Accusations\n [52:00] - My Own Rules\n [1:10:00] - Decision\n [1:35:00] - Ask ET\n  Listener Perks:\n  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success.
