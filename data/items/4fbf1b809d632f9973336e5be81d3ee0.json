MIchi and Aja agree and discuss how the lime light comes with a lot of perks but also a lot of pressure from the outside as well as the pressure put on ourselves to fit a certain mold and live up to expectations. Kijafa and Terricka felt the public pressure during their husband's football careers and experienced the fallout of what was going on at the time on the field, in their personal lives.</p><p>The ladies also share their fashion inspiration and how what they wear often emulates their moods and creates a chance to express certain personality traits. </p><p>Chef Lowe changes it up and serves the ladies southern comfort food as a treat from the usual healthy options he makes for his athlete clients. The ladies ask him if his new position in the spotlight has brought unwanted attention or negativity in his life which he responds that at first it did but he immediately tuned it out not to let the bad takeaway from the good he was experiencing through these opportunities.
