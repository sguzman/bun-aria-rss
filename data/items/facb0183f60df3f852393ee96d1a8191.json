  "description": "<p>What if melting down after a failure was actually a good thing? Or doing what you love, as a side hustle, was the best way to do it? That's what we're talking about on today's episode.</p><p><strong>Good Life Riff:&nbsp;</strong>Today, we've got a special guest riff, featuring friend-of-the-pod, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, <a href=\"https://sidehustleschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">podcaster</a>, world-traveler and entrepreneur, Chris Guillebeau. In his new book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2wI6yaJ\" target=\"_blank\">Side Hustle</a>, Guillebeau takes a contrarian view of entrepreneurship, arguing many of us are better off doing that thing that blends passion with money not as our day jobs, but on the side. He shares why, along with a few great case-studies, in today's riff.
