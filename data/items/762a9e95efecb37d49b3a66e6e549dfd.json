  "description": "Hour 1:\n\nMike Broomhead joins the program to tell you the truth about what has been going on behind the scenes of the Trump impeachment proceedings. President Trump’s judicial appointments now make up a full quarter of the judiciary. Will the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg drive the Left to take drastic measures? The Democrats’ potential gross abuse of the 25th Amendment could have dire consequences. The Obama White House’s abuse of investigative power prior to the 2016 election has come full circle.\n\nHour 2:\n\nMany Democrats made doomsday predictions when President Trump was elected. Now, three full years later, why are so many STILL in denial about how well the economy is doing? Unemployment has plummeted while the Dow Jones has soared – Americans should be dancing in the streets. Will the president be able to get through to people in the Midwest with his message of “promises made, promises kept”?\n\nHour 3:\n\nThe Steele dossier remains completely unsubstantiated, so why has it been treated like doctrine in a court of law? Why do the FISA courts even exist? Because those engaging in surveillance were putting your rights on the back burner. Virginia is on the brink. The very purpose of the Second Amendment could be on display if sweeping gun control measures are implemented by force.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
