  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s Taboo Romance week! We’re thrilled to be joined by Nikki Sloane, whose books we’ve adored for years here on FM. We talk about what makes a romance taboo, about why readers are drawn to taboo stories, and about whether taboo romance is empirically erotic. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Cat Sebastian’s wonderful <em>Unmasked by the Marquess</em>.

Her latest release in the Filthy Rich Americans series, The Redemption, won&nbsp;<a href=\"https://virginiaromancewriters.com/2021-holt-medallion-finalists/\">the Holt Award</a>&nbsp;from the Virginia Romance Writers Association and has been nominated for the inaugural Vivian Award from the Romance Writers of America.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We had an episode about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/4/5/s0333-age-gap-romance-interstitial\">age-gap romance</a>, but when the woman is older sometimes we use the phrase Cougar,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Woman-is-a-Cougar\">which I do not recommend googling!&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Taboo romance is difficult to define. But on the episode, we talked about three major ideas: it explores power dynamics, it contains an element of the forbidden, and is makes readers viscerally feel that the relationship is “wrong.” However, Nikki also used the phrase “universal taboos” to describe topics so forbidden--beastality and incest--that they could never be a part of romance.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In a Florida high school,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/23/us/yearbook-photos-st-johns-girls-altering.html\">the necklines of women and girls were photoshopped (without their knowledge) if there was too much cleavage.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’ve been digging the priest taboo since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thorn_Birds\">The Thorn Birds</a>, and it was revived in pop culture by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/842997/what-fleabags-hot-priest-storyline-gets-right-about-sex-love\">the TV show Fleabag</a>. We discussed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/11/4/s029-priest-by-sierra-simone\">Sierra Simone’s Priest</a>&nbsp;in season two.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As we reckon with #MeToo,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/catharine-mackinnon-what-metoo-has-changed/585313/\">we are all thinking about and redefining power dynamics in our culture</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.thegothiclibrary.com/gothic-tropes-incest/\">Incest is a common trope in horror and other gothic stories</a>, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themarysue.com/flowers-in-the-attic-celebrates-40-years-of-being-a-weird-piece-of-teen-sexual-awakening-culture/\">didn’t originate with Flowers in the Attic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Don’t forget to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shop.wordbookstores.com/SarahMacLean\">preorder signed copies of Bombshell from Word in Brooklyn.</a></p>",
