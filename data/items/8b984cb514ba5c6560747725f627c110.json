  "description": "<p>Convenience (and the products and services that make it possible) has infiltrated it’s way into our daily spending - so much so, that it’s become our default option. Who doesn’t want things to be a little easier and a little more accessible? Convenience <em>can </em>be a nice perk of our modern economy, but it can also come at a high cost. And the big problem here is that American consumers are spending more money than ever on different conveniences without giving it a second thought. We’re being parted with our money without even realizing it! So our goal for this episode is to shine a light on the different reasons that we often go with the more convenient option. And then we’re also going to suggest some simple solutions for us to overcome these costly options. By recognizing our natural tendencies, hopefully we can resist these urges which will also allow us to save money. We don’t want to take the easy and more expensive way every time we’re faced with a decision.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Chimay Grand Reserve!
