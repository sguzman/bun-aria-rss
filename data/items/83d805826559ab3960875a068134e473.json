    "media:description": "This video was made by Prof. Jonathan Hopkins at UCLA in response to a special talk invitation at the Spring 2021 Materials Research Society (MRS) virtual conference during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nThe talk is about how the Freedom and Constraint Topologies (FACT) design approach can be used to design architected materials (a.k.a. mechanical metamaterials) –particularly those that achieve desired directional compliance. The basic principles of the FACT approach are reviewed.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more, I recommend reading the following Nature Communications journal article:\n\nShaw, L.A., Sun, F., Portela, C.M., Barranco, R.I., Greer, J.R., Hopkins, J.B., 2019, “Computationally Efficient Design of Directionally Compliant Metamaterials,” Nature Communications, 10(1): 291 (13 pages)\n\nA link to the paper is here: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08049-1 \n\nDisclaimer: Responsibility for the content of this video is my own.
