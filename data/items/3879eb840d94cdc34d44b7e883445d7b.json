Taylor/Tayla has become TAYLORA with the re-release of her iconic album Red and Las Cultch is TALKING ABOUT IT in gorgeously excruciating detail. Also, no big deal but Bowen kinda sorta hung out with Tay a little bit and you will not believe her reaction to the Taylor/Tayla binary when it was explained to her. Matt & Bowen deep-dive on this last glorious ~scarlet week~ and talk \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version\"), the short film, favorites from the re-release and what this album means to Swifties. Also, Blake Lively as director, Adele's Oprah special, Ego Nwodim's star turn on Love Life season two, new Pokémon on the way, and the fact that Britney is now FREE. And you know we do a deep dive on the latest installment of the Real Housewives of Potomac reunion and wade into the iconic true crime waters of the last Real Housewives of Salt Lake City episode. All this, a The Morning Show plot update, karaoke culture, \"having fun\" culture, what it feels like to go on a great fucking date, and a live, in real time confirmation of an upcoming Las Cultch guest that will leave readers breathless.
