  "description": "<p>The McInteer Villa began as a grand home for the McInteer family and over the last century it has been a place of comfort for many people. For several decades it was a boarding house and then eventually it became a private home once again. Through that time, it has not only been a place for the living, but also for, reputedly, the dead. Join me and the owners of the McInteer Villa, Stephanie and Jeff Neal, as we discuss the history and hauntings of this historic home! The Moment in Oddity features the Human Fly dying at the Rutherford County Courthouse and This Month in History features the Reuben James torpedoed.
