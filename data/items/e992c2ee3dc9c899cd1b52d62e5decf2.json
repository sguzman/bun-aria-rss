  "description": "<div>In this week’s episode of The Green Room, Deputy Editor of The Spectator's world edition Dominic Green meets the author Sohrab Ahmari for a chat about his new book, <em>The Unbroken Thread: Discovering The Wisdom Of Tradition In An Age Of Chaos</em>.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>In it, Ahmari, a writer and <em>New York Post</em> op-ed editor, makes a compelling case for seeking the inherited traditions and ideals that give our lives meaning, via 12 fundamental questions that challenge our modern certainties. Among them: Is God reasonable? What is freedom for? What do we owe our parents, our bodies, one another? Exploring each question through the life and ideas of great thinkers, from Saint Augustine to Howard Thurman and from Abraham Joshua Heschel to Andrea Dworkin, Ahmari invites us to examine the hidden assumptions that drive our behaviour and, in so doing, to live more humanely in a world that has lost its way.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<em>Don’t forget to subscribe to </em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-green-room/id1436027050\"><em>The Green Room</em></a><em> for a weekly dose of books, arts and everything else that makes life worth living.
