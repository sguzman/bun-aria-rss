  "title": "PODCAST 2-01-2018: Jim Lobe on Neoconservatism",
  "description": "I'm proud to bring you our first interview! Veteran reporter Jim Lobe joins me to talk about neoconservatism, a subject on which he has been reporting and lecturing and giving interviews for many years now. We talk about defining neoconservatism, about its development from a niche intellectual movement on the leftish side of the spectrum into perhaps the dominant foreign policy ideology on the right, and about its ability to thrive despite its close association with the bar-none worst foreign policy decision in modern American history.<p>Jim's website, which you should know if you read my work, is <a href=\"http://lobelog.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lobelog.com</a>, and the piece he references on Sheldon Adelson and Donald Trump is <a href=\"https://lobelog.com/has-trump-become-adelsons-perfect-little-puppet/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
