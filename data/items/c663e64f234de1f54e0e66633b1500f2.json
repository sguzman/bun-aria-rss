  "description": "<p>Dr. Gabor Maté (addiction, stress, and childhood development speaker & bestselling author) joins us to explain which groups of people tend to be most prone to chronic illness, practical ways we can prevent these diagnoses, and the link between childhood trauma and mental & physical health conditions later on in life. He details health conditions you may not know have stress-related causes and explains why healthy attachment and meeting a child’s needs is even more important than we think. Dr. Maté identifies characteristics of those who are prone to chronic illness, reveals why autoimmune diseases predominantly affect women, and discusses the dangers of systematic denial of our emotions. He and Mayim consider the ways well-meaning loving parents can unintentionally create lower level trauma in their kids, how feelings of being unwanted can lead to workaholism, and the limitations of a traditional nuclear family. They discuss Dr. Maté’s time working at a supervised injection site, why most people in the prison system are highly traumatized, and why trauma goes hand-in-hand with addiction.</p><p>Dr. Gabor Maté's New Book, THE MYTH OF NORMAL: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608273/the-myth-of-normal-by-gabor-mate-md-with-daniel-mate/\">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608273/the-myth-of-normal-by-gabor-mate-md-with-daniel-mate/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
