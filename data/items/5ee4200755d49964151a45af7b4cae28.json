  "description": "<p>The only thing Leonardo da Vinci wasn't good at was raising his kids. And only because he didn't have any. He seemed to master just about everything else. He may have known more than any other human had ever known up until the time of his life, the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He may have been the smartest human being to ever walk the Earth, including anyone who was born before or after him. He was an incredible painter, engineer, scientist, inventor, sculptor, military strategist, and more. He epitomizes the term \"Renaissance Man\" and we suck the life of arguably the greatest export from the Italian Renaissance ever, today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Donating $3000 this month to </strong>the nonprofit - Youth on Record.
