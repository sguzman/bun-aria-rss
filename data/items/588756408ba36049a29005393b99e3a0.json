  "itunes:summary": "In 1940, with the British nation facing the threat of imminent invasion, Winston Churchill became prime minister and delivered a series of rousing speeches by radio which rallied the spirits of the people. His words have become legendary:\n‘We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be… We shall never surrender,’ he said. And, ‘Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, “This was their finest hour.”’\nChurchill’s words sing in a way that English-language leaders and politicians have tried unsuccessfully to match ever since.\nNevertheless, for all of us, words are powerful. Your words are powerful. With kind and encouraging words, you can change a person’s day – or even their entire life.",
