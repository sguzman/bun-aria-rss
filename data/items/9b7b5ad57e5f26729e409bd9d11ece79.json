  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with social activist Ashley Spivey about how American Samoa became a U.S. territory. While we all grew up learning facts about states in our history and government classes, U.S. territories are often left out of the conversation. Sharon talks about how American Samoa became of interest to the U.S., and how the South Pacific Ocean archipelago is represented in government. Of course, no Sharon Says So episode would be complete without a few fun facts, and Sharon has plenty to share about this tropical territory!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
