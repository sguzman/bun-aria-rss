  "itunes:summary": "With the inauguration of Joe Biden as President of the United States in January of this year, the tumultuous ‘America First’ foreign policy mandate of the Trump administration finally came to an end. For many of America’s traditional allies in the liberal international order, the past four years under President Trump have been a difficult period, marked by a retrenched global presence, disruptions to free trade, strained relations, and moonlights with authoritarian regimes from a once reliable and steadfast ally.\n\nNo doubt recognizing this, Biden would waste no time in heralding “America is back” and signing executive orders returning the US to the previously abandoned Paris Accords mere moments after being sworn in. But one can’t help but wonder if Biden’s plans for a renewed American presence in the world can ever erase the sting of “America First”.\n\nWhat is the Biden doctrine of foreign policy, and how does Joe Biden seek to build bridges after four years of America building walls? To answer these questions and more I am joined by Professor Aaron Ettinger. Aaron is a professor with the Department of Political Science here at Carleton University specializing in global governance and American foreign policy.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CU_PoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
