  "description": "When we hear about our kids being teased, bullied, or left out, it tends to bring up painful memories from our own childhoods. As a result, we often jump to helping our kid get out of that awful experience, saying things like \"Say this to stand up for yourself!\" or \"You don't have to hang with those kids!\" But these responses make a child feel even more alone. In this week's episode, Dr. Becky offers guidance to three parents on how to talk to their kids about bullying. She explains why confidence and connection are the best ways to support a child who is being bullied, and offers practical strategies to help your child believe in themselves no matter what others say.<p/> \n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
