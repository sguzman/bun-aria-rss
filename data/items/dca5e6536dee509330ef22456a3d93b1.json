  "description": "<p>We compare numerical relativity (NR) data on the scattering of equal-mass,\nnon-spinning binary black holes to various analytical predictions, based on\npost-Minkowskian (PM) results. While the usual sequence of PM-expanded\nscattering angles shows a rather poor convergence towards NR data, we find that\na reformulation of PM information in terms of Effective-One-Body radial\npotentials leads to remarkable agreement with NR data, especially when using\nthe radiation-reacted 4PM information. Using Firsov's inversion formula we\ndirectly extract, for the first time, from NR simulations a (radiation-reacted)\ngravitational potential describing the scattering of equal-mass, non-spinning\nbinary black holes. We urge the NR community to compute more sequences of\nscattering simulations, so as to extend this knowledge to a wider region of\nparameter space.\n</p>",
