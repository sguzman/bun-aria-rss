  "description": "While we are only two months into the new administration (and it is getting good marks for those two months) it is never too early to start kibbitzing about how to do better. Can we go too far in direct our economic attention inward? What old policy positions can we let go of? How do we fix our defense planning and spending? Is there anything we can teach Europe to help them with their troubled vaccination roll outs? Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School offer their thoughts on areas we can do even better...and then they turn their attention to the great American infrastructure songbook. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
