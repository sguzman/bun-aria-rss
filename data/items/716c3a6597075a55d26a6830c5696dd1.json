  "description": "<p>This week, we have wall to wall crime, as we discuss a most horrid individual. A man who went from the highs of being a Super Bowl champion, to the lows of working the overnight shift in a small town gas station, repeated arrests for the most terrible of crimes, selling his championship ring on eBay, and finally earning a prison sentence that won't have him free for decades. This episode is so jam packed with crimes, you will be amazed that a person could be free long enough to commit all of them. It's as crazy an episode as we've had, on one of the worst people. Return a punt for a touchdown, have a ridiculous amount of children, with a ridiculous amount of people, and force yourself on anyone within reach with Dave Meggett!! Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!</p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br> </p><p>New episodes every Tuesday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Crime in Sports!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Small Town Murder</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/crimeinsports\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/crimeinsports</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CrimeInSports\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: <a href=\"mailto:crimeinsports@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">crimeinsports@gmail.com</a></p><p>Donate on Patreon: patreon.com/crimeinsports</p><p>PayPal: paypal.me/crimeinsports</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
