  "description": "<p>\"We started hearing a loud grunt. We could hear it walking in the tree line down about 30 feet away from us. We never saw it not at first. This lasted about 35 minutes on this trail. Then we stopped, we couldn't hear any birds, squirrels nothing. As we walked the trail got thicker and deeper in the woods. I stopped and waited for about 5 minutes looking around and listening. We heard nothing. I removed my machete and I told my GF to hold her knife in her hand. The one she had was only 6 inches long. It was better than nothing. I walked first with her hanging on with her left hand on my pack. As we walked through the thicket that was now almost as tall as us. We heard something walking through the trees and bush above us on our left. About 20 feet away. Then we heard a loud whistle to the right of us. She was almost in tears. I had the feeling of were not going home today. I was scared. All I knew was that I would try my best to protect my girl. Shortly after this happened we picked a nasty smell, like a wet dog and trash is the only way I can describe it. It was foul. We were trying to decide at this point if we should turn back but we knew we had gone in pretty far. We decided to keep walking through the bush.\"   https://sasquatchchronicles.com/  </p>",
