This week the members of The Cigar Authority discuss the cigars they have been smoking and our selection might just inspire you on cigars to request or give for Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we discuss those cigars while we smoke a cigar from The Cigar Authority Care Package for December. That cigar is the original Guardian of the Farm.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we have a Yankee Swap and we gift each other cigars in the spirit of Christmas. We will also attempt to make a dent in all the viewer mail that has come in over the course of the year throughout.</p>\n<p>We will do all of this while Barry takes the day off to have lunch in a van? Will he come back or has he had enough of the madness known as The Cigar Authority.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
