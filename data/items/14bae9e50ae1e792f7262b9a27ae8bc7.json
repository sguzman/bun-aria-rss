  "title": "222.2 VOX Mini - Feedback on Frow",
  "description": "A couple of weeks ago we interviewed Alan Frow (Episode 219), a pastor from Orange County, CA who is also a Complementarian.  It was great to interview someone with an opposing viewpoint, but also who upheld kindness and a respectful demeanor towards women, unlike  recent examples of some well known Complementarians (Episode 218).  In this episode, we dive into a few emails we got in response to Frow including a question regarding planting a church with someone who holds an opposing view: Is it possible to do church ministry together while fully honoring both parties?  Take a listen to see what we say, as well as our answers to a few other questions on the Women in Leadership subject.\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
