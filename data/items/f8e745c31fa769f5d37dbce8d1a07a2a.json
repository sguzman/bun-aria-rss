In the past decade, gaming has grown from a niche hobby into a global, culture-defining phenomenon.</p><p>Not only are the games themselves becoming increasingly immersive, the way we develop and discover them has fundamentally changed. In contrast to the hits-driven business model of the past, now games are shaped in real time by player feedback. And thanks to the rise of influencer gamers, the experience of finding new games has become organic and social.</p><p>In this episode, a16z general partner <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/andrew-chen/\">Andrew Chen,</a> deal partner <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/jonathan-lai/\">Jon Lai</a>, and host <a href=\"https://a16z.com/author/lauren-murrow/\">Lauren Murrow</a> discuss how gaming is dominating not only the entertainment industry, but also pop culture at large.
