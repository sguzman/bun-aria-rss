  "description": "<p>When your thoughts have torn at the lining of your strength, take heart, be still. There is grace for this. No matter how things go from here, you are not the sum of what happened. You have grown. You have changed. You are still headed in the direction of where you are meant to be. You are stronger. You are wiser. Even when it is hard to believe, allow yourself to show up; allow yourself to breathe. In all of the chaos and imperfection, allow yourself to just be in this moment, for no matter what happens from here, you have already made it further than you thought you would.</p><p>Thank you for listening!
