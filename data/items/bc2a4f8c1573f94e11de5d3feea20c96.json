  "description": "During an Oct. 21 interview on Wharton Business Radio, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard shared his views on various aspects of the U.S. economy and monetary policy. He said strong labor markets are giving the Fed some leeway to fight inflation. He reiterated his view that the FOMC should get to a level of the federal funds rate that puts meaningful downward pressure on inflation. Bullard also discussed GDP growth in 2022, low productivity numbers, various measures of inflation, the yield curve inversion, and the slowdown in money growth",
