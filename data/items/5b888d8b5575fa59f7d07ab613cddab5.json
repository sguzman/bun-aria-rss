  "description": "<p><strong>FIRST THING:</strong> We couldn’t contain our excitement when award winning actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth stopped in to talk with Amy! I mean how can you not love Kristin’s amazing and unique voice whether on a Broadway stage, the screen or in her latest album, we just cannot get enough of her. Amy & Kristen talk about how her upbringing in rural Oklahoma shaped who she is now and her latest album \"For The Girls\". <strong>SECOND THING:</strong> With Hallmark Christmas movie watching season just around the corner, we had to get the scoop on Chenoweth’s first ever Hallmark movie (YAY)! After hearing about the movie and that Kristin co-wrote one of the songs she performs, we have to say that we are already planning on having the movie on repeat after it airs in November. <strong>THIRD THING:</strong> As if we didn’t already love her enough, we can’t help but be just a little obsessed after hearing about her heart for giving back! The Kristin Chenoweth Arts & Education Fund was set up in her hometown in Oklahoma to help cultivate young artistic expression through education, entertainment and experience. <strong>FOURTH THING:</strong> With such a full career and life, we couldn’t wait to hear what Kristin was most grateful for! Warning, things may get just a little emotional while Amy & her talk about family and adoption. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
