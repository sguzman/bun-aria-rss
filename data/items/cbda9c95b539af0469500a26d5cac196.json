  "description": "<p>NOTHING SHOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR STORY. We've had some pretty amazing women on The School of Greatness. I've learned a lot from each of them. In fact, I learn a lot from all the women around me (almost my whole team is women). Today's guest is no exception. Male, female, old, young - we could all learn from this incredible businessperson. Not only is she the youngest self-made female billionaire in America (wow, right??), she is also the mother of four young kids, the wife of another podcast guest, Jesse Itzler, and the founder and CEO of the massively popular women's apparel brand SPANX. In this episode, I got to sit with and learn from a legend among entrepreneurs: Sara Blakely. During this interview, I kept finding out new things to admire Sara for. She struggled a lot in school (me too!). She sold fax machines door to door FOR 7 YEARS before she had the idea for Spanx. She was rejected by every manufacturing company she took her idea to. But she didn't let any of that stop her. Sara's hustle and can-do attitude is just one thing I learned about her in this interview. We dive into dealing with grief, how to scale companies the right way, what it's like to be mentored by Richard Branson, and much more.

(44:47)<br />\nWhat is more challenging for you – running a billion-dollar brand or being a mom? (49:46)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhat happened in Sara’s life to prepare her for entrepreneurship before she had her big idea (7:12)<br />\nThe list of possible product names Sara considered before she decided on Spanx (11:46)<br />\nThe hardest part of getting her company off the ground (15:55)<br />\nHow Sara guerrilla-marketed her first order of Spanx in Neiman Marcus (20:01)<br />\nWhy being kind to yourself is so important (32:15)<br />\nHow Sara got Warren Buffet to paint his belly for her new book (36:32)<br />\nWhat grief and loss can teach us (43:01)<br />\nPlus much more…<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/893 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
