  "description": "<p>What is the cleverest thing hippos can do? This week we’re answering seven quirky questions about animals! Why do elephants like peanuts? Why do cows put their tongues up their noses? Has anyone ever ridden a tiger? How do woodpeckers cling to trees? Why is some bird poop black and some is white? Why do people make animals like sharks and bears sound way scarier than they are?

A dung midden is a place where an animal repeatedly goes to drop their dung. The dung middens act as a way that hippos can keep track of the other hippos in the area.

And just in case it wasn’t totally clear, a midden is basically a waste pile. So a dung midden is kind of like a toilet or an outhouse. It’s where the hippos go repeatedly to poop.

Rhinoceroses do this too! Other animals, like dogs, cats, rabbits and monkeys also sniff feces and urine as a way to learn about their fellow species, but they don’t always leave their “messages” in the same place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://butwhykids.org/donate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Support But Why</a> |<a href=\"http://vpr.us1.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=ab1a703905d19f426745609a0&id=3977beaf72\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Newsletter Sign-Up</a></p>",
