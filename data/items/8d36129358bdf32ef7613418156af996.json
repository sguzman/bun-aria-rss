He is interested in a wide range of research topics most of which involve the development, evaluation, implementation, or application of Bayesian methods.  He is the author of the R package brms and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, Paul studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).</span>\n\n<b><br />\nDescription: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The workshop will be about Bayesian multilevel models and their implementation in R using the package brms. At start there will be a short introduction to multilevel modeling and to Bayesian statistics in general followed by an introduction to Stan, which is an incredibly flexible language to fit open-ended Bayesian models. I will then explain how to access Stan using just basic R formula syntax via the brms package. It supports a wide range of response distributions and modeling options such as splines, autocorrelation, or censoring all in a multilevel context. A lot of post-processing and plotting methods are implemented as well. Some examples from Psychology and Medicine will be discussed.</span>\n\n<b><br />\nMinimal registration fee: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20 euro (or 20 USD or 750 UAH)</span>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<b>How can I register?</b>\n\n<br />\n\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Go to </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or  </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and donate</span><b> at least 20 euro</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.</span></li>\n    <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Save your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)</span></li>\n    <li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fill in the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYf9tIVNe073eNQBccwKgMpdSB2937HXCVpn63HlssxNy6_g/viewform\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">registration form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<br />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free.
