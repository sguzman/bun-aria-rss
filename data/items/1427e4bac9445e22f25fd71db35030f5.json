  "description": "<p>In this 120th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss the definition of woman. What are women? Adult human females. What are adults, and humans, and females? Are we suffering a plague of sophistry? (Yes.) Must we turn this around? (Yes.) Are humans ever hermaphroditic? (No.) What about banana slugs? (Yes. What about them?) And clown fish? (Also yes—again, so? They’re clown fish, not humans.) We discuss the evolution of sex and sex roles (aka gender). We talk about Genetic Sex Determination and Environmental Sex Determination. We discuss anisogamy and monoecious and dioecious plants, and it’s interesting and not full of uninterpretable words. We do not discuss the paired hemipenes of snakes and lizards. Our apologies.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Blinkist: Learn big ideas fast from best-selling non-fiction.
