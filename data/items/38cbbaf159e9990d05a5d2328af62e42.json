  "description": "In today’s episode, Sharon talks with 7-time Emmy Award winning news anchor, Emma Jade, about the evolution of journalism and news in the age of social media. After working hard for a successful career in traditional television journalism, Emma realized that she wanted better balance between her work and family, which led her to explore new ways to communicate the news to others, specifically mothers. She created her own daily newscast from her home, Momcast, and now curates news on her independent social media platforms. Sharon and Emma ponder the future of independent journalism, and what having freedom from corporate rules and interests might mean for how news is shared–the pros and the cons.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
