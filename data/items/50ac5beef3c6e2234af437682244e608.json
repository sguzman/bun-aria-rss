  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking to take your marketing to the next level, Joshua Centers is the man to talk to. It took him a while to discover his passion for marketing, but now there’s no turning back. After high school, Josh didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, except that he wanted to start his own business. He figured if he could make it in the Army as an infantryman, and work on his mindset, he could do anything. After 8 years of service, Josh got out, still not certain what he wanted to do. He got into sales and found himself getting a new job every 6-8 months. Eventually, he came across a webinar about starting a Facebook ads agency. He got excited and remembers rushing home to tell his wife they’d be making $10,000/month within 90 days. It wasn’t quite as easy as Josh expected, and it ended up taking him 2 years to reach that level of success. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josh was thankful for that 2 year journey, however, because it gave him a chance to build up his resume and find his passion. In addition to his marketing agency, Josh also has a company called Ready, Launch, Scale, where he helps others to achieve their dream business. He recalls when he was learning to market there were endless terms and strategies, and that shiny object syndrome actually held him back. He came to realize there are some basic principles that lead to success, and that if you keep things simple with marketing, and position yourself to sound the best in your niche, you’re going to be successful.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many things helped Josh to get to where he is today. From watching his father's hard work as a farmer, to learning to implement processes in the military, to offering solutions in the life insurance industry. One of his biggest lessons learned was the importance of setting yourself apart. For example, he says most agencies will charge an up front fee, so he decided to do something different. Josh created a program where they're so confident in what they bring to the table, that they don’t charge an upfront fee. Being different from competitors really helped them to take off.  </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josh has gotten excellent at creating lead magnets. He says it’s the content before the funnel that really sells. He’s confident that Zach could sell numerous tickets to his next event with a video highlighting some of his most famous interviews, with a snapshot of his event, and a funnel that goes straight to a checkout page. For anyone who starts filling out the form but doesn’t finish, Josh recommends then making a follow-up call. Another good idea would be an email blast to all of his long-time listeners. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building your business without paid ads is very possible if you solve a specific problem. Going with the status quo isn’t something Josh recommends. He says when you get to a point of starting to build a team, operations are important. Having standard operating procedures for everything has made all the difference for Josh. He always says that setting expectations is key. You have to be as clear as possible while also understanding that it’s going to take your team a few times to get it. A good rule of thumb is, don’t expect what you don’t inspect. When creating a standard operating procedure, always ask yourself, will my team understand how to do this? Then, test them to see if they do. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, you have to do something you’re passionate about. However, even with passion, numerous people will get derailed by imposter syndrome in the beginning. Josh recommends finding the most influential person you can serve, and show them how you can make them more money. Offering your services for free is beneficial because when they win, you also win by having their influence behind you. Get some results and credibility under your belt, and then you can confidently sell your skills.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why mindset is so important for an entrepreneur. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What app Josh recommends for building standard operating procedures.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to combat Imposter Syndrome.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nobody is going to build your business for you, you have to blueprint everything yourself.” -Joshua Centers</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Connect With Josh:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.joshuafcenters.com/\"><strong>Digital marketing</strong></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/jfcenters\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/readylaunchscale\"><strong>Ready, Launch, Scale</strong></a></p>",
