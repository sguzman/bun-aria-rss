    "media:description": "LONG BEACH, CALIF. - SEPT. 25, 2019. Four years after a marine survey warned that the Queen Mary's state of decay was \"approaching the point of no return,\" new inspection reports revealed some areas of the ship are still suffering from deterioration. In a June report, an inspector wrote that his findings caused him to have \"significant doubt about the maintenance and safety upkeep of the property.\" (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times)",
