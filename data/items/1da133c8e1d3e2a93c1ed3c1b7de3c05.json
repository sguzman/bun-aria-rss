These problems have also given me the opportunity to really think about how computers work, since Julia allows the programmer to pass type declarations to the just-in-time compiler (JIT).</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve been working on optimizing my Julia code, I decided to figure out how fast this problem can be solved using any of the languages/techniques I know. So I decided to benchmark one of the Project Euler problems using <a title=\"Julia language\" href=\"http://julialang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Julia</a>, <a title=\"Python language\" href=\"http://python.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>, <a title=\"Numba\" href=\"http://numba.pydata.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python with Numba</a>, <a title=\"Pypy\" href=\"http://pypy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PyPy</a>, <a title=\"R\" href=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">R</a>, R using the <a title=\"R compiler\" href=\"http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/compiler/html/compile.html\" target=\"_blank\">compiler</a> package, <a title=\"pqR\" href=\"http://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2013/06/22/announcing-pqr-a-faster-version-of-r/\" target=\"_blank\">pqR</a> and pqR using the compiler package. Here’s what I found…</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"problem\">Problem</h2>\n\n<p>The problem I’m using for the benchmark is calculating the smallest number that is divisible by all of the numbers in a factorial. For example, for the numbers in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5!</code>, 60 is the smallest number that is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 5. Here’s the Julia code:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-julia\" data-lang=\"julia\"><table class=\"rouge-table\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter gl\"><pre class=\"lineno\">1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"k\">function</span><span class=\"nf\"> smallestdivisall</span><span class=\"x\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">::</span><span class=\"kt\">Int64</span><span class=\"x\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">factorial</span><span class=\"x\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"x\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">n</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">break</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">elseif</span> <span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n                <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">end</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">end</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">end</span>\n<span class=\"k\">end</span>\n</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>All code versions follow this same pattern: the outside loop will run from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code> up to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n!</code>, since by definition the last value in the loop will be divisible by all of the numbers in the factorial. The inner loops go through and do a modulo calculation, checking to see if there is a remainder after division. If there is a remainder, break out of the loop and move to the next number. Once the state occurs where there is no remainder on the modulo calculation and the inner loop value of j equals the last number in the factorial (i.e. it is divisible by all of the factorial numbers), we have found the minimum number.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benchmarking---overall\">Benchmarking - Overall</h2>\n\n<p>Here are the results of the eight permutations of languages/techniques (see <a title=\"GitHub Gist for JIT test\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/randyzwitch/6341926\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> GitHub Gist for the actual code used, <a title=\"compiler results\" href=\"http://randyzwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jit.csv\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> for results file, and <a title=\"ggplot2 code\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/randyzwitch/6414244\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> GitHub Gist for the ggplot2 code):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jit-comparison.png\" alt=\"jit-comparison\" /></p>\n\n<p>Across the range of tests from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5!</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">20!</code>, Julia is the fastest to find the minimum number. Python with Numba is second and PyPy is third. pqR fares better than R in general, but using the compiler package can narrow the gap.</p>\n\n<p>To make more useful comparisons, in the next section I’ll compare each language to its “compiled” function state.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benchmarking---individual\">Benchmarking - Individual</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"python\">Python</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/JITpython-e1378131849775.png\" alt=\"JITpython\" /></p>\n\n<p>Amongst the native Python code options, I saw a 16x speedup by using PyPy instead of Python 2.7.6 (10.62s vs. 172.06s at <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">20!</code>). Using Numba with Python instead of PyPy nets an <em>incremental</em> ~40% speedup using the <a title=\"autojit example\" href=\"http://numba.pydata.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@autojit</code></a> decorator (7.63s vs. 10.63 at 20!).</p>\n\n<p>So in the case of Python, using two lines of code with the Numba JIT compiler you can get substantial improvements in performance without needing to do any code re-writes. This is a great benefit given that you can stay in native Python, since PyPy doesn’t support all existing packages within the Python ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rpqr\">R/pqR</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/JITr-e1378132951124.png\" alt=\"JITr\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s understood in the R community that <a title=\"Why are R loops slow?\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7142767/why-are-loops-slow-in-r\" target=\"_blank\">loops are not a strong point</a> of the language. In the case of this problem, I decided to use loops because 1) it keeps the code pattern similar across languages and 2) I hoped I’d see the max benefit from the compiler package by not trying any funky R optimizations up front.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, pqR is generally faster than R and using the compiler package is faster than not using the compiler. I saw ~30% improvement using pqR relative to R and ~20% <em>incremental</em> improvement using the compiler package with pqR. Using the compiler package within R showed ~35% improvement.</p>\n\n<p>So unlike the case with Python, where you could just use Python with Numba and stay within the same language/environment, if you can use pqR <em>and</em> the compiler package, you can get a performance benefit from using both.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>For a comparison like I’ve done above, it’s easy to get carried away and extrapolate the results from one simple test to all programming problems ever. “<em>Julia is the best language for all cases ever!!!11111eleventy!</em>” would be easy to proclaim, but all problems aren’t looping problems using simple division. Once you get into writing longer programs, other tasks such string manipulation and accessing APIs, using a technique from a package only available in one ecosystem but not another, etc., which tool is “best” for solving a problem becomes a much more difficult decision. The only way to know how much improvement you can see from different techniques &amp; tools is to profile your program(s) and experiment.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing that I took away from this exercise is that no matter which tool you are comfortable with to do analysis, there are potentially large performance improvements that can be made <em>just</em> by using a JIT without needing to dramatically re-write your code. For those of us who don’t know C (and/or are too lazy to re-write our code several times to wring out a little extra performance), that’s a great thing.</p>"
