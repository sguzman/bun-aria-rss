  "description": "Tasia and Camo are back with more stories where they had brushes with death and others that are just plain embarrassing. Tasia talks about her days of doing drugs with the wrong people, ending up having to call her mom to bail her out of a meth den and a creepy old man rubbing up on her, as well as a multi-day bender that she barely remembers. Plus, Tasia discusses getting to a point of doing drugs to the point of not caring if she lives or dies. Camo talks about the time he possibly met a serial killer through Grindr while on a family vacation and how a simple DoorDash delivery ended up with a few guys threatening to shoot him dead. But even with all these traumatic experiences, they talk about how their past doesn't define them and neither should your past define you.\nDownload Switchcraft for free on Apple App Store or Google Play and unlock the magical mystery!\nCheck out AdamAndEve.com today, select one item and get 50% off including FREE shipping when you enter offer code UNFAZED\nGo to elfster.com or download the Elfster app to create a FREE gift exchange to make gift-giving easier!\nWatch \"Unfazed and Unbothered\" on YouTube\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
