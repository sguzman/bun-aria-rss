  "description": "In this episode, Sharon chats with Barb Schmidt, better known to her many social media followers as @peaceful_barb. Barb and Sharon talk about ways we can feel less overwhelmed by the news and negativity and be more confident with being ourselves (the world needs YOU, not a duplicate of someone else!) Barb also shares how she likes to combat repetitive negative thinking. There’s no use in wasting our precious, finite energy on negative things that, ultimately, aren’t going to help us live the lives we want to live. Instead, Barb champions getting to know ourselves well enough that we can make wise decisions and recognize our stressors in the moment so we can know our next step forward. That next step is important, and while it isn’t feasible for most of us to lighten the suffering of many, we can choose to use stressful moments to ease the suffering of someone around us with a smile, a positive thought, or a simple action.
