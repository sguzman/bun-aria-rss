  "description": "<p>This week, we explore a tale of mild success, hilarious failure, and pure evil. A man who was one of the worst fighters in the history of UFC, but didn't let that stop him from having a memorable role in a blockbuster hit movie, and being one of the worst human beings we've ever come across. His crimes are absolutely hideous, and the first one took place on Christmas Eve, making anything the Grinch ever did look like rip roaring Christmas cheer. He almost gets away with it, but a stupid mistake is his ultimate downfall. He's a sadistic, murdering, torturing monster. Join us in the holiday spirit! Attack a movie star, lose all your fights, then deny science with Joe Son!! Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!</p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br> </p><p>New episodes every Tuesday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Crime in Sports!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Small Town Murder</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/crimeinsports\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/crimeinsports</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CrimeInSports\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: <a href=\"mailto:crimeinsports@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">crimeinsports@gmail.com</a></p><p>Donate on Patreon: patreon.com/crimeinsports</p><p>PayPal: paypal.me/crimeinsports</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
