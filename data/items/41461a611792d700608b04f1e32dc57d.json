  "description": "<p>The Green Fairy is the nickname for a once illegal liquor known as absinthe. There are a few places in New Orleans where one can get a shot of absinthe. The most famous place is the Old Absinthe House, but there are also the Mahogany Jazz Club and Pirate's Alley Cafe. These locations have not only that spirit, but some human spirits too. We figured, why not put together a legendary drink that claims to cause hallucinations with tales of ghosts? Join us for a jaunt down the streets and alleys of the French Quarter in pursuit of a special fairy and the ghosts connected to it! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Justin Rimmel and features unexplained sleeping deaths that inspired Wes Craven and This Month in History features Jones and Morrison dying on same day, two years apart.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is HelloFresh.
