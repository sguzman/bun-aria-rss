  "description": "In this episode I address the constantly changing stories by the anti-Trump schemers and why they all vindicate President Trump. I also address the hypocritical campaign of Bernie Sanders, who remains a one-percenter. Finally, I address a massive error by the CBO that should be headline news. News Picks:Bernie Sanders is a total fraud. He lives like the 1% he decries.\n\n \n\nLunatic liberals demand that a pro-police flag be taken down in Connecticut.\n\n \n\nThe CBO really blew it on Obamacare. Why should we trust them?\n\n \n\nWhy can’t Andrew McCabe keep his story straight? \n\n \n\nCopyright Dan Bongino All Rights Reserved.\n\n \n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
