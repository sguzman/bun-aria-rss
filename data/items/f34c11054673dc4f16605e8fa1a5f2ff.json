  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives announced that July would be known as Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. This resolution would honor her work as an advocate for mental health awareness, particularly in the Black community. The goal for the month is to enhance public awareness of mental illness among minorities. </p>\n<p>In keeping with this sentiment and Mrs. Moore’s legacy, Therapy for Black Girls takes the opportunity to dig deeper into broadening the conversation around mental health and mental illness each year in July. To kick us off for our month-long commemoration and raise awareness, we’ve created an oral history detailing the creation of Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. </p>\n<p>In this week’s episode, I'm joined by Dr. Linda Wharton Boyd, the convener of the Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Task Force, and Albert R. Wynn, a former U.S. House of Representatives member. Dr. Boyd and Congressman Wynn were instrumental in creating Minority Mental Health Awareness Month after Bebe Moore Campbell’s passing in 2006. Our conversation explores the process of bringing Minority Mental Health Awareness Month to life, the impact Minority Mental Health Awareness Month has had over the years, and Bebe Moore Campbell’s continued legacy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>. </p>\n<p>Join us for our Minority Mental Health Month programming at <a href=\"https://therapyforblackgirls.com/capes\">therapyforblackgirls.com/capes</a>.</p>\n<p>Attend the <a href=\"https://bebemoorecampbell-erasethestigma.cventevents.com/event/30fa9fd9-7cda-4f08-9877-0663627edd64/summary\">Bebe Moore Campbell Virtual Symposium</a> on July 7th, 2022 </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.namiurbanla.org/\">NAMI Urban Los Angeles </a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
