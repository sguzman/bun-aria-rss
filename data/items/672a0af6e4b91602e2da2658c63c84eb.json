  "description": "How are the far-away, invisible landscapes where materials come from related to the highly visible, urban landscapes where those same materials are installed? Reciprocal Landscapes: Stories of Material Movements traces five everyday landscape construction materials – fertilizer, stone, steel, trees, and wood – from seminal public landscapes in New York City, back to where they came from.\nJane Hutton's new book Reciprocal Landscapes: Stories of Material Movements (Routledge, 2020) considers the social, political, and ecological entanglements of material practice, challenging readers to think of materials not as inert products but as continuous with land and the people that shape them, and to reimagine forms of construction in solidarity with people, other species, and landscapes elsewhere.\nJane Hutton is a landscape architect and Assistant Professor in the School of Architecture at the University of Waterloo Ontario, Canada.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
