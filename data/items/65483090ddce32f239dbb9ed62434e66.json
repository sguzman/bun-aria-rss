This week Dan talks with Fernando’s son, Carlos Frías, who’s now the food editor at <i>The Miami Herald</i>. Carlos was close with his father until he was tragically murdered two years ago. In his grief, Carlos sought a new connection with his father by writing about Miami’s first ventanita. </p><p>The Sporkful production team includes Dan Pashman, Emma Morgenstern, Andres O'Hara, Tracey Samuelson, and Jared O'Connell, with editing help this week from Kimmie Gregory.</p><p>Transcript available at <a href=\"https://sporkful.com/after-his-fathers-death-carlos-frias-found-solace-in-miamis-ventanitas\">www.sporkful.com</a>.</p>\n",
