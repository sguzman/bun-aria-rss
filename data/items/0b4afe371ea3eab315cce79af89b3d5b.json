  "description": "<p>\"Shut Your Mouth and Wash Your Hands!\" Hope everyone is staying sane as best they can with the Covid-19 Pandemic, and the ensuing Quarantine we're now under. On this episode, Avery & Codie are joined by Jake Wynn of \"Pennsylvania in the Civil War\" & \"Wynning History\" to discuss the 1918 outbreak of the Spanish Influenza around the world, and the response of the military to combat it. The guys talk about the extent of the epidemic's toll on the world population, and how it tied in with the climatic ending of World War I. They also talk about current events and hopefully help put things in perspective for all of us going through this major historical event. Here's something to pass the time. Enjoy!</p>",
