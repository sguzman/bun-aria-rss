  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We got a whopper! Comedian and mom Ms Pat join comedian and America’s dad Bob Saget, comedian and dad Rich Vos, comedian and father of a son who loves me more than him Robert Kelly, and fatherless multi-time abortionist, me, as they talk about what it’s like to have and raise a child. We cover such important topics as when to beat your children (Pat and I agree on this one but I probably say to do it more than she says), the hemorrhoids women get during childbirth (I am a mother in this way), and what it’s like at Ms. Pat’s house with all her lesbo and hetero kids running around. Saget and I had both been over there. I got crushed at spades by her daughter and Bob had narrowly escaped getting beaten up after being mistaken for a banker. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was recorded live at Skankfest South, the greatest comedy festival on the earthly planet. It is a pure expression of the joy of live comedy. Get tickets to next year’s event. I won’t be there.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big announcement of how I beat covid during the intro. And stay tuned for the outro where I break down what a jerk Dumbledore was to Harry Potter and how much I wanted to beat on the fans at Universal Studios. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this episode finally helped me figure out how to properly do a live episode of Skeptic Tank. It’s gonna be a fun, lighthearted topic, and I have to get out of the way of the other comics and just let them go off. My job on these is as a producer and I’ll just snipe away a little ala Mark Normand. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://bit.ly/ShaffirYT\">Watch on YouTube</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"http://www.arishaffir.com/tour/\">Ari Shaffir - Upcoming Shows</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/skeptictank\">Patreon</a></span></p> <p><strong>Follow our guests!</strong></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ms. Pat:</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/comediennemspat/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/comediennemspat\">Twitter</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://linktr.ee/mspat\">Ms. Pat - LinkTree</a></span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Saget:</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/bobsaget/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.bobsaget.com/\">Bob Saget: Website</a></span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich Vos:</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/rich.vos/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.richvos.com/\">Rich Vos: Website</a></span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly:</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/robertkellylive/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/robertkelly\">Twitter</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://robertkellylive.com/\">Robert Kelly: Website</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to our sponsor!
