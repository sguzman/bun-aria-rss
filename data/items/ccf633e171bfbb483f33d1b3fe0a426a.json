  "title": "Vagabonding by Rolf Potts",
  "description": "Vagabonding is defined as the ‘act of leaving behind the orderly world to travel independently for an extended period of time.’ The book describes how modern society has convinced us that long-term travel is only for the super-rich and students. However, what is evident in this book is that this is not the case. Long-term travel is affordable, accessible and realistic if you want it to be. The book explains how vagabonding is a mind-set to how we see the world, not only during our holidays, but in our day to day lives. This book is a practical guide to planning and preparing your long-term travels, but it also gives the reader an insight into vagabonding that many people miss. Adventure can be experienced anywhere, but the impact an experience has is dependent on the open mindedness of the traveller. This book is designed for those wanting to learn about how to incorporate vagabonding into their lives. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
