  "description": "Any Democratic president would immediately work to reverse the damage that the Trump Administration has done to climate and environmental policies in the U.S. But there are signs that a Biden Administration may represent a major change on these policies even when contrasted with its Democratic predecessors. The climate crisis has worsened, a rising generation sees climate as a top priority, Biden has begun to listen carefully to green leaders from the progressive wing of the party and major, essential progress seems possible. We discuss the damage Trump has done and what that progress might look like in the latest edition of our Agenda 2021 series of conversations with two of the foremost climate, environmental and energy policy leaders in the Democratic Party, Carol Browner, who served as head of the EPA in the Clinton Administration and head of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Policy during the Obama Administration and David Sandalow who has served in top energy and environment related posts in the White House and at the State and Energy Departments. Don't miss this important conversation.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
