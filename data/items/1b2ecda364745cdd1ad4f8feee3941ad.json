  "description": "<p>In this 147th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we discuss Colombia—what was it like in the 1990s, versus now? Building on our experiences in Latin America for the last few decades, and Bret’s trip to Colombia last week, we discuss approaches to Covid, to food, and to life. Also: hummingbirds. We also discuss the American Federation of Teachers, and PEN America—an organization that supports literature creation and production—and how their political biases are badly affecting their ability to report on mis- and dis- information. In related news: Elon Musk has taken custody of Twitter, and some people are freaking out. Finally: how are Donald Trump and Elon Musk not the same?<br/><br/>Our store:  https://www.darkhorsestore.org<br/><br/>Our book: A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-Gatherers-Guide-21st-Century-Challenges/dp/0593086880/).
