  "description": "<p>Dr. Christina Delimitrou is an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University. Prof. Delimitrou has made significant contributions to improving resource efficiency of large-scale datacenters, QoS-aware scheduling and resource management techniques, performance debugging, and cloud security. She received the 2020 IEEE TCCA Young Architect Award for leading research in ML-driven management and design of cloud systems. She talks to us about datacenter architectures, cloud microservices, and applying machine learning techniques to optimizing and managing these systems.</p>\n",
