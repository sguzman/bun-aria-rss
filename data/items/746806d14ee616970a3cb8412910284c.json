So, I finally invited a good friend to turn the mic on me and explore this incredible journey of both life and GLP TV. We go deep into a number of topics I've never spoken about and share amazing moments, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes of the project.</p><p>Now, what about the major announcement?</p><p>You may notice in the image above, I'm wearing headphones and speaking into a radio-style microphone. Hmmmm, we've never done that before. What gives?</p><p>Well, the big announcement is that the video part of the project is going on hiatus. We'll still air episodes on youtube as audio-only, but the next phase of the project is all about audio. This is actually a giant win for you. It's going to allow us to have conversations with a wider range of people, more often and with a level of depth and intimacy that'd hard to create when you've got a full crew and cameras rolling.</p><p>I explain this evolution and what's driving it a lot more in the final 20 minutes of this week's episode. And if you're thinking about producing a podcast or web-series, be sure to tune in to that part of the conversation.</p><p>And, if you want to keep jamming with me every week, I STRONGLY recommend that you <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project-podcast/id647826736\" target=\"_blank\">head on over to iTunes and subscribe to the podcast today.</a> We've got an extraordinarily moving episode coming up next week that you absolutely won't want to miss.</p><p>With gratitude,</p><p>Jonathan</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
