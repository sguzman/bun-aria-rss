  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p> </p><p>On this week’s episode of Where My Moms At, Christina P catches up with the Booth Boys and a couple of your favorite Bears stop by (briefly) to talk about what turns them off. Listeners write in with their deal breakers or “vag-dryers”, as they’re called in Studio Jeans. Birkenstocks, Turkey Trots, and Disney Adults are just a few of the things that make the list. We also get some new Pazsitzky Effects, a What Would Christina P Do question, and a couple philosophy references for a good mix of everything the show has to offer. Plus, the Booth Boys discuss their mom’s “bush” so there’s that. Enjoy!</p><p> </p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends.
