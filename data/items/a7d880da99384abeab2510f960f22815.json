However, in just a few minutes we'll learn how linguists classified them into just five families. Once we meet Africa's language areas, the five families begin to fall apart.\n\nWe'll leave with a complicated picture of families, hypothetical groups and many isolates and debated classifications. Along the way, come to appreciate Africa's diverse peoples and languages.\n\n~ Credits ~\n\nArt, narration, animation and some of the music by Josh from NativLang\n\nSources for claims made, and full credits for music, fonts, sfx:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hihfgik9supmLFEnyMmQF9iKgnmX-M1hSJG20TgseTM/\n\nMusic:\nPlease see my doc above.
