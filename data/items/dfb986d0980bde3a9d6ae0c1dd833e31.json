  "description": "CEO Daymond John turned a forty dollar budget into the 6 billion dollar FUBU clothing empire. This is a man who grew up in Hollis, Queens, who didn’t see anyone who he could call a role model in the world of fashion, and who was told he would never amount to anything. So when he says, “If I could do it, you can do it”, he knows what he’s talking about. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Daymond John shares the practical advice and no-nonsense wisdom that has made him incredibly successful. He discusses the three critical steps to negotiation, advises entrepreneurs to take what he calls “affordable steps”, and strongly advocates constantly seeking out new mentors.
