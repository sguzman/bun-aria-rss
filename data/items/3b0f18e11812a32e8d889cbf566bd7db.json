  "description": "<p>South American serial killer Pedro \"Monster of the Andes\" Lopez was convicted of killing 110 girls in Ecuador in 1983. He claimed to have killed roughly 350 between Ecuador, Peru, and his native Columbia. He spent only fourteen years in prison for those 110 Ecuadorian murders and then another three years in a Columbian psychiatric ward for additional murder conviction in that country, and then he was set free in 1998. He may still be alive and free today. Find how this dirtbag was able to walk free after so much death, and hear what conditions helped created the Monster of the Andes, today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE TAKE THIS SURVEY!</strong> (maybe win that $100 gift certificate) <a href=\"http://podsurvey.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>http://podsurvey.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a></p>\n<p>We're donating $1600 this month to the <strong>Cancer Research Institute</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearch.org/\"><strong>www.cancerresearch.org</strong></a> to donate!</p>\n<p>Upcoming<strong> Tour</strong> dates:</p>\n<p><strong>February 26 Birmingham, Alabama </strong>- Stardome Comedy Club <a href=\"https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/4285274/dan-cumminsthe-happy-murder-tour-20-general-admission-hoover-stardome-showroom?language=en&country=US&searchType=organization&\"><strong>CLICK HERE </strong></a>for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>February 27 Atlanta, Georgia</strong> - The Punchline Comedy Club <a href=\"https://www.punchline.com/shows.asp?showdate=2/27/2019&month=2&year=2019\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>Feb 28 - March 2 Nashville, Tennessee</strong> - Zanies Comedy Club <a href=\"http://zaniesnashvilletickets.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=516607\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>March 3 Huntsville, Alabama </strong>- Stand Up Live <a href=\"http://standuplivehuntsville.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=517152\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the best of my standup on Spotify!</strong> (for free!) <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d\"><strong>https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the following <strong>sponsors</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Marvelous LIght! </strong>To buy Timesucker Paul Frank Spencer's new book, visit any online book retailer or you can click <a href=\"https://www.bygraceforglorylit.com/marvelous-light\"><strong>HERE</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Indochino!</strong> To get ANY PREMIUM INDOCHINO suit for just $359 enter TIMESUCK at checkout when purchasing at <a href=\"http://Indochino.com\"><strong>Indochino.com</strong></a> </p>\n<p><strong>Quip!</strong> Quip starts at just $25 and if you go to <a href=\"http://getquip.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>getquip.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a> right now, you get your first refill pack for FREE with a Quip electric toothbrush!</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on Youtube (new and improved audio!): </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Mj8bPKESjPo\"><strong>https://youtu.be/Mj8bPKESjPo</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
