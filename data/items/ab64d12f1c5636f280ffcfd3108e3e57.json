  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, we thank the Democrat Party for finally killing any impeachment hearings with the Mueller hearings today. The Democrats should be ashamed of themselves for putting him up to this. It's clear that Mueller's top attorney Andrew Weismann was the invisible hand behind all of the Mueller Report. The strategy Weismann used to destroy Arthur Andersen is the same legal strategy used in this case and it has Weismann all over it. Mueller proved that he was incapable of managing this investigation let alone trying to prove that there was any corrupt intent in President Trump's decision-making. The Constitution and the law on the President's side in this Mueller investigation. Then, Trump has criticized Rep's. Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff today and it's notable that, consequently, neither of them are women of color. Later, Rep's Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Louie Gohmert call in to recap their lines of questioning in today's hearings.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
