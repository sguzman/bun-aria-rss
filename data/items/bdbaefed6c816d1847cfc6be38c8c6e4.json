career has been exceptionally varied and diverse;  he began as a Guardsman in a Rifle company, but soon demonstrated that he had the skill set to specialize in other areas.  He seized the opportunity early and became a ski instructor and then spent his first two winters in Germany posted to <a href=\"http://www.bavaria.com/en-ca/age_check?destination=site\" target=\"_blank\">Bavaria</a>.  On returning to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">England</a>, he joined the <a href=\"https://www.army.mod.uk/rolefinder/role/182/close-reconnaissance-soldier\" target=\"_blank\">Reconnaissance Platoon</a> and completed two tours in Northern Ireland; one as a patrol team member working with an intelligence group and the second in the Close Observation Platoon working in support of <a href=\"http://www.eliteukforces.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Special Forces</a>.  It wasn&#8217;t long before he was promoted again and spent two years as an instructor at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick as a Section Commander.  When he finished at the ITC, he joined the Battalion on a tour in Iraq.  He had already qualified as a Sniper earlier in his career, so after completing the Platoon Sergeants&#8217; Battle Course, he was then promoted and given the Command of the Sniper Platoon in charge of some of the best and most highly trained soldiers in the Regiment.  Being the man he is; when a volunteer was needed to take away a Platoon of Coldstreamers to Afghanistan attached to the right flank of the Scots Guards, he obliged.  He then completed a six-month tour in command of a Rifle Platoon of 30 soldiers living and operating in the harshest conditions.  Whilst on this tour of Afghanistan, he was given a Joint Commander&#8217;s Commendation for his actions carried out in a Taliban ambush.  Within 18 months, he found himself with the remainder of the Battalion going again to Afghanistan.  By now Baines was a Senior Sergeant and still in Command of the Sniper Platoon and deployed to one of the most hostile areas of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_province_campaign\" target=\"_blank\">Helmand</a>.  This operational tour would prove to be exceptionally brutal with many members of the Battalion returning seriously injured and a number of fatalities.  WO2 Baines was awarded the Military Cross for actions carried out under enemy fire.  Shortly after returning from Afghanistan, Baines was promoted and posted to Sierra Leone for 14 Months as an Infantry Instructor at the <a href=\"http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-abroad-past/op-sculpture.page\" target=\"_blank\">International Military Training and Advisory Team</a>.  He worked with the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, the British Embassy and other non-governmental run agencies proving that he could communicate well with a whole spectrum of people and their cultures.  He returned to Windsor and joined the Battalion where he was placed in to a Company Quartermaster Sergeant&#8217;s role where he administered a company of 150 soldiers.  WO2 Baines assumed the position of Regimental Recruiting Warrant Officer and records show that in 2014-15, the Coldstream Guards recruiting tame had hit 98% of its recruiting target; this was testament to his hard work and dedication.</p>\n<p>WO2 Baines was medically discharged from the British Army in 2015 with an exemplary assessment written by his Commanding Officer.  Paul collaborated with members of his Regiment, before and after his release to produce a book; the Commemorative Album entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.coldstreamguards.org.uk/shop-2/10-years-in-afghanistanquot.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 Years In Afghanistan; Guardsmen&#8217;s Stories</a> </em>which is available for purchase at the Regimental on line shop.  All proceeds of this book go to injured and struggling veterans of the Coldstream Guards.</p>\n<p>Paul resides in <a href=\"http://www.villageoftorquay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Torquay</a> with his wife and is pursuing an apprenticeship as a plumber.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1042-7\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CMHP-Episode-051-WO2-Paul-Baines.mp3?_=7\" /><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CMHP-Episode-051-WO2-Paul-Baines.mp3\">http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CMHP-Episode-051-WO2-Paul-Baines.mp3</a></audio>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2357.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1043\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1043\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2357-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF2357\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2357-300x225.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2357-768x576.jpg 768w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2357-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sergeant Paul Baines in Afghanistan where he and his comrades were awarded the Military Cross.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1049\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1049\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"DSC00207\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207-300x225.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207-768x576.jpg 768w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC00207.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Paul Baines serves as a Lance Sergeant while deployed in Iraq.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photo-0054.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1044\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1044\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photo-0054-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Photo-0054\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photo-0054-300x225.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photo-0054-768x576.jpg 768w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photo-0054.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Paul Baines training in the UK as a Lance Sergeant;
