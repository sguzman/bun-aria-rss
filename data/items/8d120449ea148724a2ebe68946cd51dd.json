We discussed reasons why the history of the Proto Indo-Europeans––the linguistic ancestors of nearly half the world's population––remains obscure to the general public. If you think it has something to do with racist, pseudoscientific scholarship that led to the concept of the Aryan race during World War II, we think so too.</p> <p><br /> <br /> For the video of our conversation, follow this link:<br /> <br /> <a href= \"https://www.crowdcast.io/e/intelligentspeech/40\">https://www.crowdcast.io/e/intelligentspeech/40</a></p>",
