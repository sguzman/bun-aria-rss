  "title": "Ep. 924 - They Hate When We Call Them Groomers, So Keep Doing It",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the people who’ve been calling us Nazis for decades are now concerned that “groomer” is a vicious, unfair label. After years of labeling everyone in sight, they are finally getting a taste of their own medicine and they don’t like it. The only difference is that, unlike Nazi, the groomer label is actually true. Also, the pro-life group that blew the whistle about illegal abortions in DC held a press conference yesterday. Some of the additional details they revealed are absolutely bone chilling. Plus, the only Joe Biden video that might actually make you feel sorry for him, if fleetingly. And if you thought Woke Oreos were bad, wait until you see what the latest virtue signaling snack company has come up with.\n\nThe magic has left the kingdom. It’s time to build new things that we can believe in. Subscribe to The Daily Wire today with promo code BUILDTHEFUTURE for 45% off: https://utm.io/uesif .\nLearn more about your ad choices.
