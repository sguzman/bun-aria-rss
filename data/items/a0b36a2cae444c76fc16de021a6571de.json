  "description": "<p>Connie Lim, whose artist name is MILCK, rose to widespread attention after a video of an a capella performance of her song \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_(MILCK_song)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet</a>\" on the street at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Women's March</a> exploded into the public’s consciousness going viral and becoming embraced as an anthem for the movement. That moment and the impact and reach of the song led to a major record deal and collaborations as a songwriter that launched the career she’s been working to build for years. But that career almost never happened. MILCK grew up in an enclave of LA, the child of immigrants from China, and was drawn to music from her earliest days. She wrote her first song at 7 years old and studied classical piano and opera. Yet the pressure of intense perfectionism and the expectation she’d eventually leave music behind to follow the family tradition into medicine led her into years of profound emotional struggle.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, she hit a point in college where she decided it was time to choose herself over the expectations of others, as well as the burden of perfectionism that had caused so many years of suffering and harm. MILCK left college and went all-in on music, performing as an independent artist for years, slowly building her name, before that fateful day in 2017 that changed everything. She’s now deep into writing, producing and performing her own work, while also writing with and for other artists and focusing on not just sharing her own creative voice, but also gathering community and shining the light on truth and inequity along the way.</p><p>You can find MILCK at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.somebodysbeloved.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.somebodysbeloved.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/milckmusic/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/milckmusic/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;<strong>Sparketype</strong>&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
