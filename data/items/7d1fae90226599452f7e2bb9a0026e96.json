You know, make enough money to pay the bills, have a living, and make a career...provide for yourself and the family. And maybe if you work hard enough, catch the right breaks, make the right moves...you will make that happen. You'll be successful and it will all seem worth it.\n\nOther times...just when you are on the way up, about to have that big break...or maybe you already have...you end up dying. \n\nAnd that sucks...\n\nBut...weirdly,  in some cases you end up being up more successful in death then you were in life. You end up making far more money after you shuffled off this mortal coil then you did on it. \n\nAnd that's not really fair now is it?\n\nHere's a look at some cases where death turns out to be an interesting career move.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
