  "description": "<p>The expansion of the Universe is observed to be accelerating, with the\nsimplest solution being a classical cosmological constant. However, this\nreceives contributions from the quantum vacuum, which are predicted to be many\norders of magnitude larger than observations, and suffers from radiative\ninstabilities requiring repeated fine tuning. In this paper we present a\nminimal, self tuning scalar field model that can dynamically cancel a large\nquantum vacuum energy, avoiding Weinberg's No Go Theorem, and produce\naccelerated de Sitter expansion at a lower energy scale as a solution to the\nproblem. Our minimal model, which contains a non canonical kinetic energy and a\nlinear potential, belongs to the Kinetic Gravity Braiding subclass of Horndeski\ntheory which is not observationally excluded, and lies outside of the known Fab\nFour or Well Tempered models. We find analytic solutions in the limits of slow\nroll and fast roll, and numerically solve the equations of motion to illustrate\nour model. We show that the model allows for a matter dominated era, and that\nthe attractor solution is stable under a phase transition in the vacuum energy\ndensity. We also consider the energy scales required to match observations. Our\nmodel shows the existence of a wider class of successful self tuning models\nthan previously assumed.\n</p>",
