  "description": "Andrew Horowitz, founder of Horowitz & Company, host of The Disciplined Investor podcast, and fan-favorite guest, starts the show with a New Year’s resolution that’s going well… [0:30] Usually, Andrew’s a laid-back guy… but the Fed has him fired up. He shares the only solution to higher inflation—if the Fed doesn’t screw it up. [3:05] Next, we discuss the huge moves in Meta (FB) and Amazon (AMZN)... and what they say about the current market environment. [11:00] Another thing that’s got Andrew fired up: SPACs. He breaks down how these companies use gimmicks to drive up prices… and calls out one popular hedge fund manager for screwing over individual investors. [16:10] As always, Andrew shares some of his favorite stock ideas—including one company poised to benefit from the massive metaverse trend. [20:40] To wrap the interview, Andrew shares what’s catching his attention outside the U.S… why diversification is critical, especially in today’s markets… and what to watch out for if the U.S. dollar starts rising. [26:25] Super Bowl weekend is almost here, which means it’s time for my yearly tradition: breaking down the matchup to pick a winner. I’ve been doing this for years, and my system has an 80% win rate. I share some interesting stats on this year’s teams—the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals… and which one I believe will be this year’s champion. [30:40] Finally, as you probably know, our  security is now trading on the  (Alternative Trading Platform) under the ticker CURZ. [47:55] Enjoyed this episode?
