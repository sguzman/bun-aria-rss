  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Aaron Rodgers touching down in Green Bay and reporting for camp for the Packers, and how the way some of the media is talking about the situation is ridiculous, Randall Cobb being moved from Houston back to Green Bay, and they speak at length about The World Games, and the heroic actions of Simone Biles withdrawing from the team competition after not feeling like herself and not wanting to put her teammates in jeopardy. Joining the program LIVE from Steelers camp to do a victory lap in relation to the Aaron Rodgers situation is NFL Network insider, Ian Rapoport to chat about all the different things going on around the NFL, what he's learned so far from Steelers camp, Randall Cobb back to Green Bay, Chandler Jones being unhappy in Arizona, and much more (1:00:45-1:23:59). Pat and AJ also shoot the breeze about Aaron Rodgers being back in Green Bay, why it's a win for both sides, and how long AJ knew the outcome, if he ever did.
