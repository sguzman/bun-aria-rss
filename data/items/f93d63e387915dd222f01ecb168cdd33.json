  "description": "<br><center>narrated by Chris Gratien<div class=\"moiwnames\"> featuring Fahad Bishara, Jeannie Miller, and Mohamad Ballan </div></center>  <div class=\"hidden_synopsis\">  | During the early 8th century, less than a century after the creation of the first Muslim communities, Islamic armies crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and quickly conquered most of modern-day Spain and Portugal. Muslim life in what became known as &quot;al-Andalus&quot; would last about eight centuries, reshaping the politics, culture, and landscapes of the Iberian Peninsula in numerous ways.   In this episode, we&#39;re exploring the first centuries of Muslim life in al-Andalus and the legacies not just for Iberia but also for the rest of Europe and the Islamic world. We&#39;ll examine the distinctive Andalusi identity that emerged out of centuries of Muslims, Jews, and Christians living under Islamic polities. And we&#39;ll also consider the literary impact of Arabic on European culture and consider the historical significant of ecological exchange between the broader Islamic world and Iberia before the momentous date of 1492.  </div>  <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/11/andalus.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
