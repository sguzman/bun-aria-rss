    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Robert M. Avram talks about the consequences of effect models.\n\nFull Presentation Description\n\nThe very essence of functional programming relies on a fairly simple premise: write side-effectless programs, so that you can reason about them equationally. Side-effects however are predominant in every program that . . . well, does something useful. In light of this, the modelling of effects in functional programs has become a fairly active domain of study. From stacked effects, to horizontal ones; from transformers to free monads and so on. Every effect model, though joyfully they may seem, have some rather unfortunate consequences. In this talk, I'd like to share with you some of these effect models and exemplify both their joyful and unfortunate nature.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/amrobert11\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
