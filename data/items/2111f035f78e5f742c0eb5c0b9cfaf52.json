  "description": "<p>Dave Kellett and Fred Schroeder created the movie <em><a href=\"http://www.strippedfilm.com/\">Stripped</a></em> about the past, present, and future of comic strips and their creators. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davekellett\">Dave</a> is the creator and cartoonist of two webcomics titles, <em><a href=\"http://www.sheldoncomics.com/\">Sheldon</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.drivecomic.com/\">Drive</a></em>, and the co-author of <em>How To Make Webcomics</em>. He is one of a small but growing group of webcomics artists who are self-sufficient. <a href=\"http://fredschroeder.com/reel.html\">Fred</a> is a veteran cinemographer, nominated for Best Cinematography at Sundance for his work on <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893331/\">Four Sheets to the Wind</a></em>. He has been shooting commercials for much of his career.</p>\n\n<p>Together, they matched Fred's filmmaking skills with Dave's personal knowledge of the field and his contacts to create the first feature-length documentary on the topic, funded in part through two Kickstarter campaigns. They don't pull punches about the difficulties of being a comic-strip artist, but they show all the joy and love that goes into the work along with many potential bright lights already illuminating parts of the field and shining on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p><em>This episode is sponsored by:</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mediatemple.net/?utm_source=thenewdisruptors&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=mar_podcast&utm_campaign=general\">Media Temple</a>: Web hosting for artists, designers, and Web developers since 1998.
