  "title": "Quickie: 2 Virgins, 1 Night",
  "description": "<p><p>Straight from the KFCR Mailbox: A few years ago in high school, two of my guys friends (they were best friends) both lost their virginity to the same girl in the same night. For almost a year, I was the only person outside of guy #1 who know she'd hooked up with both of them. When it came out, and to this day, guy #2 is mad at me for not telling him. Personally I think guy #1, HIS BEST FRIEND, should have been the one to break that news. Let me know your thoughts.</p><p>@JayHayKid pops in to tell a great threesome story.</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
