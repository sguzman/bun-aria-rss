  "title": "121. Answering Your Questions About Owning a Dairy Cow | Angel Turner of Rosehill Farm",
  "description": "<p>I have been so excited to bring this episode to you all because I get so many questions about our dairy cow!&nbsp; Angel Turner was the perfect person to join me in this conversation. She has gained a great deal of experience with dairy cows in just a short time.&nbsp; It has been less than a year since Angel brought home her first family milk cow, and since then, she has taken on the task of halter breaking over 15 milk cows and matching them with families.&nbsp; We could have talked forever about all things dairy cow, but we managed to address the most frequently asked questions in the time we had together.&nbsp; If you are considering whether a family milk cow might be right for you, this episode will give you a peek into both of our journeys of getting started with owning dairy cows.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we cover:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>What it’s like owning your first dairy cow</li>\n <li>The one thing you should always do before buying a cow</li>\n <li>Preventing and treating mastitis</li>\n <li>How much land you need to own a dairy cow</li>\n  <li>Breeding considerations</li>\n  <li>Calf sharing and weaning</li>\n  <li>Making the most of the acreage you have</li>\n  <li>Feeding your dairy cow: grass, hay, grain</li>\n  <li>Learning as you go in homesteading</li>\n  <li>The economics of owning a dairy cow</li>\n  <li>What it looks like to travel when you own a dairy cow</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>GUEST BIOGRAPHY</strong></p>\n<p>Angel and her husband Gabe started homesteading on a very small scale. A few chickens, a small garden, a lamb or goat here and there. But as they grew their family in their 10 years of marriage, they began to see the importance and benefits of the homesteading lifestyle for so many reasons. Angel and Gabe are passionate about taking their family back to a more simple way of living that connects them with the land and animals. They are now pursuing farming full-time and very much in the beginning stages of that journey! They also want others to see their potential no matter where they are, so they have begun teaching homesteading skills on their blog.</p>\n<p><strong>RESOURCES</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162062.Keeping_A_Family_Cow\"><u>Keeping a Family Cow by Joann S.
