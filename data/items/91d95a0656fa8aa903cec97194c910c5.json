  "title": "Feathered Dinosaurs",
  "description": "In a programme first broadcast in 2017, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the development of theories about dinosaur feathers, following discoveries of fossils which show evidence of feathers. All dinosaurs were originally thought to be related to lizards - the word 'dinosaur' was created from the Greek for 'terrible lizard' - but that now appears false. In the last century, discoveries of fossils with feathers established that at least some dinosaurs were feathered and that some of those survived the great extinctions and evolved into the birds we see today. There are still many outstanding areas for study, such as what sorts of feathers they were, where on the body they were found, what their purpose was and which dinosaurs had them. \n\nWith \n\nMike Benton\nProfessor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Bristol\n\nSteve Brusatte\nReader and Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Edinburgh\n\nand\n\nMaria McNamara\nSenior Lecturer in Geology at University College, Cork\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
