    "media:description": "Since I am still getting over Covid I kept my participation to less than an hour and only rode an ebike for a bit while also some light walking and chillaxing on the Park Avenue medians. It allowed me to continue to have made at least one Summer Streets event every year they have been held.\n\nHere's a quick montage. It shows just how crowded it is getting. We need it to run for longer mileage, longer in time and many more events during the Summer - at a minimum.",
