  "description": "Today's guest is Seattle designer Brian Paquette. He joins us to talk about his brand new book At Home: Evocative and Art-Forward Interiors, as well as his unconventional path to design, his love of art, and why he finds so much inspiration in an earthy palette.\nWhat You'll Hear on the Show:\n\nHis unconventional background into the design field\n\nWhy it's important to listen when working on a clients design (or your own home)\n\nWhy he typically favors weaves over patterns in his more permanent pieces\n\nWe talk about his book (why Karen loved his captions)\n\nSense memory in a room and why Brian loves to speak to a client's sense memory\n\nWhy Brian creates a signature scent for each of his clients' home\n\nBrian thinks listening and inferring information is his super power\n\nWhy asking about a paint color someone used in their home isn't a smart way to choose a paint color\n\nWhy he likes a monotone palette for media rooms and bedrooms\n\nWhy Brian leaves art to chance in his design projects\n\nWhy a home should age and we should accept and enjoy the aging process\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nBrian suggests switching your throw pillow inserts to Trillium which is a down alternative. This is what Brian uses for all of his clients! For the rest of the room, own the blue sofa! Add more blue in with two club chairs to coordinate with your sofa -- it could be pillows, some cording on the chairs, or a similar but different blue fabric on the chair. You're almost there. Just two more chairs will tie it all together.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nBrian Paquette Interiors\n\nBrian Paquette on Instagram\n\n\nAt Home: Evocative & Art Forward Interiors, by Brian Paquette\n\nTrillium pillow inserts from PillowFlex",
