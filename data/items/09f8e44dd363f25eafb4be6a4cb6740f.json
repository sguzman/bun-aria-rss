  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin show, disagreeing with the President is very different from trying to sabotage the President. Democrats are taking advantage by including more than necessary in each new spending proposal. Yet, not a single elected official, Democrat or Republican, took action in late February to stop the spread of the coronavirus — not a single one — except for President Donald Trump. Democrat Governors across the country have mismanaged their state budgets and now expect President Trump to clean up their budgetary messes. Now, the New York Times falsely alleges that the Trump Administration was slow to act. Then, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been downplaying the coronavirus since January, yet the media wants to blame Trump for not taking enough action. Trump has simply been taking the advice of the scientists and public health experts since the very beginning. Despite being wildly inaccurate and taking responsibility for nothing, Fauci simply blames the scientific modeling. Later, former New Times writer Alex Berenson calls in to challenge the scientific models used, and the excuses given, by the CDC.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
