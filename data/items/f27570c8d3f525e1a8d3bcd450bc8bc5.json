Laura and Sara share how event planning mixes with design, the home decor they are seeing used in events, and all you need to know about registries.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nLaura and Sara’s combined experience of working both as an Executive Assistant to a CEO and planning over 2,000 events.\n\nHow we can plan smaller events such as a baby shower and have it be just as beautiful and memorable as a huge one.\n\nHow to curate a theme and weave in personalized decor and keep it elegant instead of cheesy.\n\nWhat things we can think about to combine both beautiful decor and a comfortable guest experience.\n\nIf there is an alternative to flowers, and what other home decor items Laura and Sara see currently at events.\n\nRegistries — what you should pick and how, what you shouldn’t pick, and how we all feel about going off the registry to purchase your gift.\n\nWho puts their China in the dishwasher, and why.\n\nHow to set the lighting and mood at an event, why this can make or break the night, and why it’s crucial to use a dimmer.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n\nMagnolia Celebrates\n\nBallardDesignsRegistry\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nWe suggest making things a tad less busy by taking the dark green from the wall paper and implementing it also on the vanity, molding and crown. Add a more modern light fixture, along with some cool abstract art and acrylic frames. If you could install a toilet paper holder on the side of your vanity, that will help declutter. Update your faucet and hardware, and take it from Taryn — you can get a pretty sweet one for$40!",
