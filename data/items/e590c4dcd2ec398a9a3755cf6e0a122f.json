  "description": "Guests Christine Schmidt and Rudy Lucas join co-hosts Patty Olwell and Sue Marriott in a wide-ranging discussion on racial identity just after the election. Privileged white people talking about race can be awkward – we discuss how our natural sense of safety is part of our privilege and letting ourselves step out and get uncomfortable is necessary to even begin to dig in and get the compassion, understanding and necessary context to be able to be useful in these times. The safety bubble has popped and it could not be more obvious given the current political climate of division that a shaking and awakening is necessary.\nWhat is Racial Identity\nRudy and Christine walk us through some of the steps necessary to look at aspects of racial identity, both white and black. We discuss immunity by color, invisibility, access, race avoidance, colorism, recommended study and literature, history and context, and we barely scratched the surface with this conversation.\n\nThis quote stands out because of it’s clarity and it’s importance!\n\nIn response to question about reverse racism, Rudy responded:\n\n“There is no such thing as reverse racism, because the determining factor is access to power. Oppressed populations never have been known to have any kind of power sufficient to have their feelings thoughts and wishes codified into the law….” \n\nAnd he concluded –“People can be guilty of prejudice, discrimination, judgement… but racist they cannot be in the absence of power. “ \n\nRudy Lucas\n\nRacism must have the weight of history and institutional power under it to exist. Which is why those of us with history and the laws on our side can’t complain now that we are uncomfortable and see it as equal to an oppressed person’s suffering.\n\nThe conversation ranged and covered many topics but Christine and Rudy recommend as next steps that you view these two videos:\n\n \tFusion Video-How Microagressions Are Like Mosquito Bites \n \tJay Smooth-How to Tell Someone They Sound Racist\n\nRESOURCES:\nAdditional resources for this episode:\n\n \tJanet Helms-Black and White Racial Identity: Theory Research and Practice \n \tPeggy McIntosh- White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\n \tPaula Rothenburg-White Privilege: Essential Reading on the Other Side of Racism\n \tJanet Helms and Donelda Cook-Using Race and Culture in Counseling and Psychotherapy \n \tJay Smooth – cultural commentator check him out!
