  "description": "<p>The world was gifted with one of the greatest episodes of \"Real Housewives of New York\" ever — perhaps the best one since \"December: Berkshires County\" (and on a show whose worst episodes are better than many franchises' best, that says something).  Luann's high horse tramples over Barbara and Sonja's meltdowns, leading Bethenny to scream in her face while simultaneously spiraling about Dennis.  It's compelling, hilarious, sad, and instantly iconic.
