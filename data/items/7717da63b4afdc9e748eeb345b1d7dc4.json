  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the (hopefully) end to the Antonio Brown saga with his joining the New England Patriots. Brown has agreed to join New England after being waived by the Oakland Raiders, who had guaranteed the wide receiver about $30 million. The rift between the Raiders and Brown had grown beyond repair. Also discussed is how TV’s national Nielsen ratings -- the metrics used to set rates with advertisers -- will soon include what’s known as out-of-home viewers. That includes places like bars, restaurants and hotel rooms. It’s a boon for sports leagues and their broadcast partners, who would like the audience measurement to include as many people as possible. And also talked about is the Boston Red Sox’s firing of executive Dave Dombrowski. The Red Sox won the World Series last year but will likely miss the postseason with baseball’s highest payroll.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
