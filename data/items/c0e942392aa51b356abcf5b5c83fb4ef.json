  "description": "<p>Are you happy with the current state of your real estate business? If you’re like most people, the answer is no. On today’s show, we interview property management superstar&nbsp;<strong>Jesse McCue</strong>&nbsp;and dig deep into how he’s became Maine’s top property manager as well as a successful RE investor along the way. Jesse shares how he formed a partnership with a successful business to become an owner of the company, as well as how he bought a 67-unit hotel off of a tip from his electrician for half of its appraised value! You’ll be amazed as he describes a strategy that is “better than BRRRR”—and most importantly, the number one question you&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to ask a property manager to find out if they are the right choice for you. If you want to learn how to put fundamental business skills to work in your investment business, this is a show you do not want to miss!</p><p>In This Episode We Cover:</p><ul><li>How Jesse was bitten
