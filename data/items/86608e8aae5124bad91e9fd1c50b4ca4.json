  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the DOJ seeks more than 130 new attorneys to prosecute more January 6th cases. Most of these charges are for trespassing on public land but carry charges that are more severe and carry stiffer penalties for those that don't take the government's plea deals. One such matter is the latest false claim against top Trump staffer Dan Scavino for potentially having advanced knowledge of the Capitol attack. Then, the federal government is using extra-constitutional parallel path like a handpicked congressional committee and overreaching subpoenas to circumvent the DOJ's legal limitations in order to get information they otherwise could not get. Biden and the Democrats are skirting the legal system by using Congress as the investigative arm of the Department of Justice and cherry-picking what they leak to the media. Meanwhile, Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to defend the rights of parents and school kids from the aggressive transgender and homosexual lobby injecting their material into kindergarten classrooms. Disney is pushing to repeal the parental protection bill and never once tried to defeat it when it was in the legislature. Afterward, Harriet Hageman joins the show to discuss her campaign against Liz Cheney in Congress. Hageman blasted Cheney for using a congressional committee to destroy Trump's chances of running for office in the future.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
