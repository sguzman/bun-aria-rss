  "description": "Who is Joe Burrow? Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks take a deep look at the likely No. 1 overall draft pick of the upcoming 2020 NFL Draft in their annual 360 series. The two scouts look past the tape and talk to those closest around Burrow. What was he like as a kid? Did he want to play basketball instead of football? What was he like at OSU? The guys first talk to his dad, Jimmy Burrow (3:46) and his brother, Dan Burrow (18:25) as they learn more about what Joe was like as a kid. Did he compete? What sports did he play? DJ and Bucky got to chat with his first college football head coach, Urban Meyer (24:12), about what he was like in those early days. Speaking of OSU, have you seen that tire drill he did while there? His former teammates J.K. Dobbins (26:50) and Chase Young (28:07) sound off about it and why they're not shocked he is who he is. Who could forget about what he did at LSU this year? Certainly not his teammates as Bucky got a chance to sit down with Clyde Edwards-Helaire (29:29), Thaddeus Moss (32:46), Justin Jefferson (34:35) and K'Lavon Chaisson (36:26). Kirk Herbstreit (40:54) joined DJ to talk about what he saw from Joe during his 2019 season, while Bucky caught up with Jordan Palmer (46:05) at the Combine to talk about how Burrow's always had the abilities he showed off in '19. Finally, NFL Network's own Colleen Wolfe and Andrew Hawkins got to chat with Joe Burrow (54:02) at the 2020 NFL Scouting Combine.<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
