Next, 3x Pro Bowl Quarterback, and former Packer, Seahawk, Titan, Colt, and current ESPN analyst, Matt Hasselbeck, joins the show to chat about The Brand's tough day, what he thinks about Odell Beckham's recent comments, playing when almost dead in Houston, and who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl (20:00-44:02). To close out the show, the most electric tag team in the WWE, Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods of The New Day stop by in studio for a hilarious conversation.

Come laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
