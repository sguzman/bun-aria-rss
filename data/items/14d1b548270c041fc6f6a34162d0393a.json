  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the president doesn't have to answer any inane questions with respect to the imminent nature of future attacks, he simply does not. The consequences of removing the American presence from Iraq and other regions will destroy our human intelligence gathering ability.

Democrats Pete Buttigieg and Jackie Speier have also hinted that President Trump is to blame for Iran's killing of 170 passengers aboard a commercial Ukrainian airplane that was destroyed by Iranian missiles. Also, despite the claims that Speaker Pelosi is a brilliant strategist, she has completely bungled the impeachment process in the House in a poorly thought-out attempt to delay the articles of impeachment. Later, California has been enrolling illegal aliens in healthcare programs, New York is moving to resister illegal aliens to vote, and the latest on other sanctuary cities.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
