But if your needs are incredibly specific and crazy, sometimes the tests have to be, too. In this talk, I show a test suite that I recently used for exactly that reason. Only it's testing an entire GPU render pipeline. And the entire pipeline is running inside of a browser. And the test suite, console, and render canvas are also inside of a browser. How did I become a C++ front-end developer?\n---\n\nJacob Rice \n\nJacob Rice is a Software Engineer at Genki Instruments in Reykjavik, Iceland.
