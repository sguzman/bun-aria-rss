They include type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, and dozens of others, but they all have one thing in common: The body attacks itself. Conventional medicine uses pharmaceutical drugs to treat autoimmune disease but fails to answer one simple question: Why is the body out of balance to begin with, and how do we help it regain the proper balance? Functional Medicine, on the other hand, applies a personalized approach to treating autoimmune disease providing a map to find the root cause underlying autoimmune disease.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Todd LePine to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to treating autoimmune disease, and lupus specifically.</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Dr. LePine is the head of the Scientific Advisory Board for Designs for Health and a consultant for Diagnostic Solutions Laboratory. He enjoys skiing, kayaking, hiking, camping and golfing in the beautiful Berkshires, and is a fitness enthusiast.</p><br><p>In this conversation, Dr. Hyman and Dr. LePine discuss:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Common indicators of lupus</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Traditional treatments and medications used to treat lupus</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Pharmaceutical triggered lupus&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Pre-autoimmune disease and preemptive personalized medicine</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>How Dr. LePine treated a patient with lupus&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>The connection between Epstein Barr virus and autoimmune disease</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Five main triggers of autoimmune disease</li><li>Lectins and mannose binding lectin deficiency</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Ozone therapy</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>The relationship between lupus and hormones</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Foods to eat and to avoid for autoimmune disease</li></ul><p><br></p><p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://drhyman.com/uwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drhyman.com/uwc</a></p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by AirDoctor.
