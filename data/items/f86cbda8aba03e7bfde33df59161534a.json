  "description": "Pat and Stu wonder if they’ll be able to trust the GOP and President Trump not to back down on “red flag laws.\" The president said he would rather take firearms first and go through due process second, but he’ll probably change his stance shortly. The guys have a good laugh (and maybe a cry) over a twenty-something employee who was incredibly offended by being told that there is no \"p\" in “hamster.” Why have the Democrats completely abandoned the (very electable) pro-life and pro-gun rights positions? And now, they're running an entire campaign on a lot of the things that were included in the suspected El Paso killer’s manifesto.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
