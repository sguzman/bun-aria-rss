  "description": "Hey Trumpcast listeners! Your host Virginia has some big news. Her next podcast—After Trump—is a guidebook alongside legal scholars Jack Goldsmith and Bob Bauer—both former Trumpcast guests—to reforming our laws, norms, and ethical codes so we never get in that fix again. After Trump is coming soon to a podcast app near you. To learn more, go to AfterTrumpPod.com.\n \nBut first, Virginia is here to introduce an episode of a show she hopes you'll check out: What Next, a daily news podcast from Slate. In this episode, host Mary Harris talks to guest Jimmy Vielkind, Wall Street Journal reporter covering New York politics & government, as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo faces calls to resign over accusations of sexual harassment and allowing a toxic workplace culture to persist. To the people who know him best, it’s unlikely the governor will ever bow to those demands. \n\nIf you like what you hear, subscribe to What Next. You'll get a short episode every weekday taking on ONE story, and going deep, behind the headlines. What Next is news you’re not going to get just scrolling through your phone. Subscribe on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen. \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
