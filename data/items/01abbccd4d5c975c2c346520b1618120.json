  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat joins AJ Hawk and the boys live from the set of College GameDay in Knoxville, Tennessee as they discuss last night's Steelers v. Browns game and the heartbreaking way in which Pat's SuperBoost did not hit in one of the worst bad beats of all-time, what to think of the Browns, if Mitch Trubisky should continue to be the starting Quarterback for the Steelers, how much of an impact losing TJ Watt has had on the Steelers, and everything else as they preview and make their picks for every game of the Week 3 NFL slate (36:51-1:39:59). Also joining the progrum to chat about last night's game and the most pertinent injury news as we head into this weekend's NFL games is NFL Network Insider, host of the weekly Wrap-Up with Rapsheet & Friends (us being the friends), Ian Rapoport (18:18-36:49). Later, 14 year NFL veteran at Quarterback, Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Matt Cassel joins the progrum to chat about how important having confidence is when playing Quarterback when discussing last night's game, his expectations for Tom Brady this weekend with a depleted receiving core, his thoughts on the Patriots offense and play calling situation, and how difficult it is for a backup Quarterback to come in and take the reigns when the franchise QB goes down with a serious injury (1:40:01-1:59:33). &nbsp;Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show.
