  "description": "<p>Shannon separation theorem lays the foundation for traditional image\ncompression and transmission schemes, which consist of JPEG type image\ncompression methods and the usual channel coding schemes such as Turbo and LDPC\ncodes. One of the advantages of the separate design is that each of the two\ncomponents, channel coding and source coding can be handled independently\nwithout considering the other, which is the base of decades-long technologies.\n</p>",
