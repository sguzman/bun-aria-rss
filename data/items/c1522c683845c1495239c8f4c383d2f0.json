While she once had a promising future, Camille had been on a downward spiral for quite some time. Unfortunately, it took months to report Camille missing, and the police didn’t seem very interested in looking for her. Camille’s mom moved to Las Vegas and began spending her free time searching for her daughter, but no one had seen Camille. Mysteriously, Camille’s missing person’s case was closed by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department months later and wasn’t reopened until the early 2000s, when a friend began seeking answers. Today, the search for what happened to Camille continues with her daughter, Ashley, who was just a young child when her mom vanished. During this renewed search, they have found was that in the lead-up to her disappearance, Camille was involved with some violent men, had ties to organized crime, and was possibly working as an informant.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Camille Dardanes Dotson, please call the Las Vegas Metro Police Department at (702) 828-3111.</p><p>You can follow developments in this case on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/camilledotsonmissing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Camille Dardanes Dotson - Missing Person</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p>DoorDash- Download the DoorDash App and enter promo code VANISHED to get $5 off your purchase of $15 or more.</p><p><a href=\"http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://headspace.com/THEVANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace.com/THEVANISHED</a>&nbsp;for a free one-month trial with access to Headspace's full library of meditations for every situation.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
