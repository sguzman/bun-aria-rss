  "description": "<p>Meditation: Being Here (with OMs) (2019-03-20) - We miss many moments of this precious life drifting in a virtual thought world. This meditation helps us collect and calm ourselves with the breath; relax through our bodies; and then include the changing dance of  sounds, sensations and feeling in open awareness. Our practice is to recognize the quality of Hereness, and when we drift, return again to this open presence, relaxing with the changing flow of life. </p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
