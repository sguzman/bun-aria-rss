  "description": "In his book Peacemakers: American Leadership and the End of Genocide in the Balkans (University of Kentucky Press, 2017), Ambassador James W. Pardew describes the role of the U.S. involvement in ending the wars and genocide in the Balkans. As a soldier-diplomat, Pardew reminds us of the human nature of diplomacy. Pardew was the one of the major players in U.S. policy making, leading Balkan task forces. He was also a policy advisor to NATO. His book reflects the perspective of an experienced soldier who led the peace-making process through his use of compassion when dealing with mass murdering despots. He refocuses the nature of the dissolution of the Yugoslavia as a humanitarian crisis that could not be settled without dealing with all of the participants. His work is inspiring in the face of the senseless destruction of 100,000+ dead and thousands more displaced. He proves that the good guys can win without dropping down to the levels of the tyrants.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
