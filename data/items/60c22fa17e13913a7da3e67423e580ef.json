  "description": "Last week, after 4 long, divisive and tragic years, we witnessed the continuation of a 244-year-old American tradition.\nIt was not a peaceful transfer of power. As incoming White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain correctly noted, “there was nothing inevitable about this day.”\nNonetheless - last Wednesday we watched a quadrennial ceremony that Ronald Reagan once called both “commonplace and miraculous” - commonplace because it has happened every 4 years for the 244 - and miraculous because it has happened every 4 years for the last 244.\nIt was, as John F Kennedy said exactly 60 years earlier- “not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom.”\nIt is a ritual that in the past many of us had taken for granted. Not this year - if the last 4 years have taught us anything it is that words truly do have power and they have consequences.\nNot since Abraham Lincoln, had a new president given an inaugural address to a more divided nation while under the real threat of armed conflict.\nAnd Joe Biden rose to the occasion. \nLet us never forget how close we came to last week NOT happening and as Lincoln said at Gettysburg – rededicate ourselves to a new birth of freedom – where truth, facts and power of words are given their proper place. #WordsMatter\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
