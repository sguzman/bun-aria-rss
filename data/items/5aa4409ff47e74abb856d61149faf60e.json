  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. There is an information war going on, and we were warned about it by none other than Ronald Reagan. The media is leading this charge, constantly covering for President Biden after a year of lying about Donald Trump, proving they are the enemy of the people. Also, things are out so of control in New York City that Biden had to visit and blame lack of funding among other things. This comes after years of the pro-crime Left's push to defund police. Crime rates are skyrocketing thanks to liberal policies and lawless District Attorneys, especially in NYC, where two officers were recently murdered. The left has abandoned blue-collar workers.  Later, parents need to keep standing up for their children and speaking up at school board meetings. Teaching our kids to be ashamed of their skin color cannot take place in our classrooms. Finally, the White House is reporting on a Russian false flag attack to frame Ukraine and justify an invasion, and the Biden Administration can’t provide one example of proof.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
