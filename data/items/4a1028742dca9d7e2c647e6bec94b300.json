  "description": "<p>My buddy Lewis Howes wrote a book called The Mask of Masculinity. He joined me in the studio and we talked about how getting honest and transparent and dealing with your sh*t will help you succeed. We also talked about how being vulnerable doesn't make you a p*ssy, but actually helps you be even more driven and competitive. This is one of my favorite episodes ever.  Listen and learn.</p>",
