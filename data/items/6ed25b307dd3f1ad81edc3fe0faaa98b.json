  "description": "<p>he elongated skulls of Paracas in Peru caused a stir in 2014 when a geneticist that carried out preliminary DNA testing reported that they have mitochondrial DNA “with mutations unknown in any human, primate, or animal known so far”. Now a second round of DNA testing has been completed and the results are just as controversial – the skulls tested, which date back as far as 2,000 years, were shown to have European and Middle Eastern Origin. These surprising results change the known history about how the Americas were populated.</p> <p>Paracas is a desert peninsula located within Pisco Province on the south coast of Peru. It is here where Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello, made an amazing discovery in 1928 – a massive and elaborate graveyard containing tombs filled with the remains of individuals with the largest elongated skulls found anywhere in the world. These have come to be known as the ‘ Paracas skulls ’. In total, Tello found more than 300 of these elongated skulls, some of which date back around 3,000 years.</p> <h2><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/The-Expert-Analysis-DNA-Results/dp/B07BMG6WV7/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538952837&sr=8-1&keywords=EXPERT+ANALYSIS+DNA+RESULTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check Dr. Warren’s book here</a></h2>",
