  "description": "We're turning over the podcast for a special occasion and a special episode. Broadcasting legend Lesley Visser takes the reins from Will Brinson and welcomes on Hall of Famer and Super Bowl hero Marcus Allen for a lengthy chat on one of the most famous runs in football history. Marcus recalls the vivid details of that \"17 Bob Trey 0\" call that cemented his place in Super Bowl folklore. He continues to discuss the personalities on that Raiders team, the best defenders he ever matched up against and how the game has changed over the years. Allen also addresses the ugly end to his Raiders tenure but expresses that he doesn't hold a grudge against Al Davis or the organization. We hear about his time in Kansas City and his thoughts on Super Bowl LV.
