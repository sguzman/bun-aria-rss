  "summary": "<p>I recently submitted a scikit-learn <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/1732\">pull request</a>\ncontaining a brand new ball tree and kd-tree for fast nearest neighbor searches in python.\nIn this post I want to highlight some of the features of the new ball tree and kd-tree\ncode that's part of this pull request, compare it to what's available in the\n<code>scipy.spatial.cKDTree</code> implementation, and run a few benchmarks showing the\nperformance of these methods on various data sets.</p>",
