  "description": "<p>This first episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast features an interview with Dr. Anthony Cashio of the University of Virginia at Wise, on the topic of the relevance of Plato's Cave today, in the time when \"there are no facts,\" we've been told. The audio quality gets better in the first several episodes, and starts here with not the best online voice quality. Subsequent episodes get much better in quality, but if you bear with us, you can still enjoy a fun conversation with a lively philosopher who after Episode 1 serves as co-host for the show. Listen for our \"You Tell Me!\" questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called \"Philosophunnies.\" Reach out to us on Facebook <a href=\"http://Facebook.com/PhilosophyBakesBread\" target=\"_blank\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href= \"http://Twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href= \"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com,\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
