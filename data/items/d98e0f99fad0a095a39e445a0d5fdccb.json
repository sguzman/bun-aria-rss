  "description": "One hundred tonnes of cosmic dirt rains down on us every day, so there’s a good chance you have a meteorite on your roof... well, a micrometeorite. The team explains how you can find one yourself, and explore the surprise link with Norwegian jazz musician Jon Larsen. They also question whether <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24833121-600-you-are-not-one-person-why-your-sense-of-self-must-be-an-illusion/'><em>you </em>really exist</a>, or at least the version of you that you recognise to be yourself. There’s also more news of space rocks coming to Earth, but this time returning from the super speedy <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2261810-chinas-change-5-is-bringing-back-the-first-moon-rocks-in-44-years/'>Chang’e 5</a> moon mission, and from the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2262019-the-hayabusa-2-spacecraft-is-about-to-deliver-asteroid-rocks-to-earth/'>Hayabusa-2 spacecraft</a> which has visited the asteroid Ryugu.

On the pod this week are Rowan Hooper, Tiffany O’Callaghan, Joshua Howgego, Chelsea Whyte and Leah Crane.
