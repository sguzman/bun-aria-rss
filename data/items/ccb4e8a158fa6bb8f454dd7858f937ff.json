  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys discuss the grassroots guerilla campaign to get Pat into the Monday Night Football booth that started on Twitter yesterday and ended being a top 3 trend in the United States. They also discuss their thoughts on the NFL combine and how entertaining it was, and chat about some other NFL news as we get closer to free agency and the NFL draft. They also dive in Leaving Neverland, the HBO documentary about the Michael Jackson sexual abuse allegations and how disturbing it was, whether or not this effectively ends Michael Jackson, and how it seems to tap into the same formula that has been present in some of the most talked about documentaries of the year. To close out the show, Pat welcomes Super Bowl Champion, 1st and 2nd Team All-Pro, former AFC Defensive Player of the Year and 2013 sack leader, 5x Pro Bowler, future Hall of Famer and former teammate Robert Mathis to the show. They chat about his role with the Colts now as a pass rush consultant and what he's doing with Gridiron Gang, his own football training service. They also discuss some of the guys that impressed him at the combine, how he and Dwight Freeney pushed and made each other better, whether or not he thought Pat was a good teammate, which quarterback he hated the most, and he answers some questions in the \"the room wants to know\" (1:05:47-1:36:39). It's a great time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
