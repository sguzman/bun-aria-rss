Are you dealing with mental fog most days, crashing in the afternoons and just blaming it on lack of sleep or stress? Cognitive decline is known to begin as early as your 30s and has become the accepted norm with aging, yet many of us don’t even recognize it at its onset. In this episode, international expert in neurodegenerative diseases, Dr. Dale Bredesen, talks with Tom about the reversibility of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. While Alzheimer’s disease is well known as a progressive disease impacting seniors, too many people are missing the opportunity to course correct and reverse the effects of cognitive decline leading to Alzheimer’s disease in their younger years. Dr. Bredesen explains simple ways for you to improve these conditions, avoid them altogether, and enhance your mental cognition. He discusses the importance of reducing toxins and exposes four factors that are largely responsible for the decline in optimal cognitive performance.   Pre-order Dr. Bredesen’s Book “The First Survivors of Alzheimer’s”  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/First-Survivors-Alzheimers-Patients-Recovered/dp\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/First-Survivors-Alzheimers-Patients-Recovered/dp</a>/0593192427    SHOW NOTES: Alzheimer’s |  Relationship between cognitive optimization and Alzheimer’s [1:17] Cognitive Supply & Demand | Factors that affect the brain’s plasticity network [2:38] Brain Assaults | Dr. Bredesen reveals the kind of assaults causing injury to your brain [6:10] Amyloid Plaque | Dr. Bredesen explains the role of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer’s [7:20] Brain Shrinkage | Dr. Bredesen explains the problem with the brain chronically shrinking [9:23] Alzheimer’s Subtypes | What’s destroying your brain and subtypes of Alzeheimer’s [10:10] Leaky Gut | The relationship between leaky gut, inflammation and cognitive decline [10:59] Insulin | Dr. Bredesen explains insulin resistance associated to cognitive decline [11:55] Alzheimer’s Survivors | Dr. Bredesen’s upcoming book about survivors of Alzheimer’s [15:53] Enhanced Cognition | Dr. Bredesen on enhancing normal cognition [17:01] Detox | Ways to get rid of toxins and who benefits from detoxing [18:15] How to Get Alzheimer’s | Dr. Bredesen discuss ways to give yourself Alzheimer's [22:28] Toxins Balanced | Dr. Bredesen explains the dynamic balance of toxins in your body.
