  "description": "<p><p>Lil Jon joins the show to talk about Dave Chappelle's impact on his career, whether wine can make you an alcoholic, and how he trader in tequila shots for cayenne and ginger. Later, Waka Flocka reacts to the Prozingis trade as it happens, explained that music is just a hobby, that his true goal is to be a tech mogul, and how he is down to start wrestling with Gronk. KFC and Feits discuss the Super Bowl and the postgame celebration that left John literally stinking. Also no one jerked off for a week in the Super Bowl house and it took it's toll. Voicemails include: girl talk, alternate passwords, adjusting the scale, and betting on teams you hate.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
