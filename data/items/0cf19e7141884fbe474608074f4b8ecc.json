  "description": "<p>On this special episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie dives into a subject very close to her heart: colon cancer awareness. After Katie’s first husband Jay died 23 years ago, she’s been a fierce advocate for early screening and regular colonoscopies — she even, you might recall, got one on live TV. There’s a reason Katie goes to such lengths: early screening saves lives. In this episode, we first hear from a stage 4 cancer fighter who is living that lesson. Then, Dr. Edith Mitchell of the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, helps to answer the question, why are Black people, Black men in particular, so much more likely to get colon cancer and also die from it (hint: it’s systemic). Finally, Katie talks with oncologist Dr. Charlie Fuchs about the state of colon cancer detection and treatment today. </p><p><strong>LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS EPISODE:</strong> </p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://standuptocancer.org/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=SU2C_Brand&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_6jo6yiHymNY9nVB-i0MvoawmlihSmcaDaZrp7n5svV8ZVZrFEdZusaAuBqEALw_wcB\">Stand Up To Cancer</a>, Katie’s cancer-fighting non-profit, for reliable resources and institutions.</p><p><a href=\"https://pledge.getscreened.org/?c_src=MAR2021search_google&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Pledge2021_REV&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmIuDBhDXARIsAFITC_4z9fuWRPrz38FpMV6hLoNm3hn3GpblWi-suuERe87y86NvHOU2T7saAmciEALw_wcB\">Take the pledge to get screened for colon cancer</a></p><p>Read more about some of the health disparities Dr. Mitchell mentioned, <a href=\"http://healthlibrary.brighamandwomens.org/Wellness/Smoking/NewsRecent/6,1650177634\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jtocrr.org/article/S2666-3643(20)30155-7/fulltext\">here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/hot-topics/understanding_healthcare_disparities_in_colorectal_cancer\">Watch a video</a> on understanding healthcare disparities in colorectal cancer.</p><p><strong>GUESTS FEATURED IN THIS EPISODE:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.thebridgesrsf.com/contact\">Donna Otis</a>, CCM, CCE Chief Executive/General Manager of the Bridges at Rancho Santa Fe, California.</p><p><a href=\"https://sidneykimmelcancercenter.jeffersonhealth.org/?article=2016-dedicating-a-career-to-diversity-and-disparities-dr-edith-mitchell-featured-in-medpage-today\">Dr. Edith Mitchell</a>, MD, MACP, FCPP, FRCP, is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology and is Clinical Professor, Department of Medicine and Medical Oncology at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University and Associate Director for Diversity Programs and Director of the Center to Eliminate Cancer Disparities for the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University.</p><p>Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH, Global Head of Hematology & Oncology, Product Development, Genentech.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
