  "description": "<p>If you are online and especially if you're on social media, it’s likely you’ve engaged with people whose opinions are different from your own. While those conversations can sometimes be informative, they often spiral into a vitriolic whirlpool of hurtful or even threatening comments. Dylan Marron is the creator and host of “Conversations with People Who Hate Me”, a podcast where he facilitates conversations and tries to explore the humanity of people online. In today’s episode, Dylan talks about why we shouldn’t forget that there are always people on the other side of our screens and shares what he’s learned about apologies, forgiveness, and the benefits of taking the time to explore and establish our personal boundaries. You can listen to Dylan’s podcast wherever you’re listening to this.
