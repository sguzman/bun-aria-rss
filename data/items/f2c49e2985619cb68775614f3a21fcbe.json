  "description": "We start today’s show by comparing recent earnings from Target (TGT) vs. Walmart (WMT)… what they say about how big retailers are handling inflation… and which stock has more upside from current levels. Meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has surged nearly 100% in just five trading days. We highlight what’s behind the massive move (it’s not retail investors)... and share some sobering details about the stock’s fundamentals. Turning to 13F filings, we share where the smart money is investing right now… why these filings need to be taken with a grain of salt… and why Amazon (AMZN) stood out. Activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point just took a stake in Disney (DIS)... I break down why he’s facing an uphill battle… and what I would push for as an activist investor to send the stock soaring. Finally, I’m heading to Palm Beach this weekend to attend the Crypto Connect & NFT Expo… I’d love to see you there. . In this episode  Earnings recap: Target vs. Walmart [1:17] What’s behind the massive surge in BBBY [9:35] What stood out in the recent 13F filings [19:25] If I was an activist investor in Disney [29:42]  [36:40]  Enjoyed this episode?
