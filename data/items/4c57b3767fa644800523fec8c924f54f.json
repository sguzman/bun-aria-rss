  "title": "243: Can You Be OK With Uncertainty? | Jack Kornfield",
  "description": "On this episode, a bad news / good news situation. Let's start with the bad news: human beings are not wired for uncertainty. It short circuits our system. The mind wants to plan, to work things out - and, in a pandemic, that is basically impossible. The good news: meditation is perfectly designed to take the edge off, if not more. Our guest this week is Jack Kornfield, a pioneering meditation teacher, prolific author, a former Buddhist monk, and a clinical psychologist. We talk about: how to use meditation to embrace uncertainty, the importance of getting in touch with your own \"tainted glory,\" and why we shouldn't fear the schmaltz. (That last one was mostly for me.)\nWhere to find Jack Kornfield online:\nWebsite: https://jackkornfield.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JackKornfield\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jkornfield\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jack_kornfield/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5JayBKk-Bynk6XnUnU7vLA\nOther Resources Mentioned:\nLady Gaga Kicks Off ‘One World: Together at Home’ With Performance of ‘Smile’ / https://variety.com/2020/music/news/lady-gaga-smile-together-at-home-1234584282/\nSpring Washam / https://www.springwasham.com/\nRam Dass / https://www.ramdass.org/\nNeem Karoli Baba / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem_Karoli_Baba\nWangari Maathai / https://www.greenbeltmovement.org/wangari-maathai\nPreah Maha Ghosananda / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Maha_Ghosananda\nDolly Parton’s Poem / https://www.instagram.com/p/B-xdJu6FCR9/\nInsight Meditation Society / https://www.dharma.org/\nJack Kornfield’s Meditations / https://jackkornfield.com/meditations/\nTara Brach / https://www.tarabrach.com/\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Health Care Workers, Grocery Store & Food Delivery Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/jack-kornfield-243\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
