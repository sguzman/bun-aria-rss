  "description": "The beginning of a new year is a time to look back and reflect on the previous one. December 31st is also the end date of our annual Krakow Internship Program. Last year's intake was very unique due to the pandemic and the shift towards a remote work environment. Akamai was fortunate to be able to adjust our internship program to be fully virtual and provide this opportunity to students who look forward to this experience.",
