  "description": "<p>On December 7, 2021, Metaverso was held in Puerto Rico as a 1-day conference filled with leaders in crypto culture. We held a panel with Sam Cassat of Aligned Capital, Ben Lakoff of Charged Particles, Andy8052 of Fractional, and Laura Jaramillo of Upshot.</p> <p>In this special edition, we dive into what the conference experience really is. Spoiler: Crypto IRL is amazing. The panel explores the intersection of DeFi and NFTs—what happens when these worlds collide? There are only two types of assets—fungible and non-fungible—but we are seeing these concepts blur together in new and interesting ways.</p> <p>From liquidity to communities, this conversation covers how the Metaverse is bringing DeFi to NFTs.</p> <p>-----<br /> 📣 METAMASK | YOUR HARDWARE WALLET'S BEST FRIEND<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/metamask-shows\">https://bankless.cc/metamask-shows</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini%E2%80%8B\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini​</a> </p> <p>💧LIDO | DECENTRALIZED STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Lido\">https://bankless.cc/Lido</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:15 The Conference Experience<br /> 6:44 TradArt and NFTs<br /> 10:11 Metaverso<br /> 13:14 Crypto IRL<br /> 16:20 The Panel<br /> 19:40 FreeRoss DAO<br /> 21:38 The Panelists<br /> 24:28 The Potential of NFTs<br /> 29:00 More than Fractionalizing<br /> 33:45 Liquidity<br /> 39:33 Pricing Assets<br /> 46:50 Community<br /> 54:34 Regulatory Issues<br /> 1:00:22 Use Cases</p> <p>-----<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Metaverso<br /> <a href= \"https://www.metaver.so/\">https://www.metaver.so/</a> <br /> FreeRossDAO<br /> <a href= \"https://freerossdao.com/\">https://freerossdao.com/</a> <br /> Sam Cassatt<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/samcassatt?s=20\">https://twitter.com/samcassatt?s=20</a> <br />  Ben Lakoff<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/benlakoff?s=20\">https://twitter.com/benlakoff?s=20</a> <br />  Andy8052<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20\">https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20</a> <br />  Laura Jaramillo<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/LauraTJD?s=20\">https://twitter.com/LauraTJD?s=20</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
