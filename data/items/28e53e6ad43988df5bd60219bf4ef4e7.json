  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The culture in many Christian communities and organizations is toxic for leaders, their families, and their faith. This is especially true for female leaders. Jo Saxton is back to talk about her new book, “Ready to Rise,” and how churches neglect God’s gifts when they ignore women’s voices and abilities, and why women suppress their gifts to be seen as “humble.” And don’t miss Jo’s important interpretation of the Mary and Martha story from the gospels—Wow. Also this week: Skye shares his family’s quarantine rules. Scholars are redefining the meaning of “evangelical” away from any shared theology and toward shared politics and media figures. Half of Americans aren’t wearing pants while working at home. Self-cleaning underwear has just arrived and you’ll need it when you see 2020’s latest plague—Murder Hornets.</p>",
