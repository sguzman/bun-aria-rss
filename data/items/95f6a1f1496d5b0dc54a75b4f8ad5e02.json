  "title": "Adam Mestyan, “Arab Patriotism: The Ideology and Culture of Power in Late Ottoman Egypt” (Princeton UP, 2017)",
  "description": "Studies of Arab nationalism populate the field of Middle Eastern studies, perhaps even overpopulate it. However, what Adam Mestyan does in Arab Patriotism: The Ideology and Culture of Power in Late Ottoman Egypt (Princeton University Press, 2017) is very different: he looks specifically at patriotic sentiment, not nationalism per se, and its specifically Ottoman roots. Using archival sources in both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish, Mestyan ties together the public sphere, the press, leadership, and even opera to show us how the homeland is portrayed and thought of in late Ottoman and then later, colonial Egypt. This in turn allows us to understand how patriotism would later influence the development of nationalism in the twentieth century.\n\nAdam Mestyan is a historian of the modern Middle East and is assistant professor at Duke University. He was a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard and taught at Oxford after getting his doctorate in history from Central European University. He is involved in many digital humanities projects, including a bibliography of nineteenth-century Arabic-language periodicals.\n\n\n\nNadirah Mansour is a graduate student at Princeton University’s Department of Near Eastern Studies working on the global intellectual history of the Arabic-language press. She tweets @NAMansour26 and produces another Middle-East and North Africa-related podcast: Reintroducing.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
