Adam expands upon this by talking about his inability to go to sleep early and his desire to satisfy people who have made reasonable requests of him. Adam also recalls some of the behavior he observed when he worked on The Man Show and how it informed his view of people's motivations. Later they turn to the phones and speak with a caller who has thoughts on how narcissism and victim mentality are inherently linked. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nUE.com/fits, promo code ADS\nJustWorks.com\nBlindsGalore.com, tell them we sent you\nPluto.TV",
