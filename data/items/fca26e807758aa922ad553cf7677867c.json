  "description": "Primary season officially gets under way this week. Texas is first up, on Tuesday. For the first time in years, Democrats are fielding candidates in every congressional district there, and in early voting, Democratic turnout surpassed Republican turnout. Also, President Trump has driven a wedge between himself and many of his fellow Republicans by announcing he will impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. And he's not backing down. This episode: host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, political reporter Jessica Taylor, congressional correspondent Susan Davis and editor correspondent Ron Elving.
