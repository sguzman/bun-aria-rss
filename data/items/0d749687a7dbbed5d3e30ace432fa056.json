  "description": "<p>By the time Emilio Estevez was 23, he'd starred in <em>The Outsiders</em>, <em>Repo Man</em>, <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, and <em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em>. As the son of Martin Sheen, he was Hollywood royalty, and as a member of the \"brat pack\" group of early-80s stars, he was a hot commodity. But he started turning down big roles to become the youngest person ever to write, direct, and star in a major motion picture. Estevez tells Alec that his script for that movie was \"terrible,\" -- but it was risky, ambitious movie-making at a time when he didn't have to take risks. Estevez occasionally returned to \"just acting\" after that, for beloved performances in <em>Men at Work</em>, <em>The Mighty Ducks</em>, and more -- but his heart beats for his writer/director projects like 2006’s RFK masterpiece <em>Bobby</em>, nominated for a Best Film Golden Globe. His latest is <em>The Public</em>, about a fictional occupation of the Cincinnati Public Library by the city's homeless. Alec plays the police negotiator. The two actors discuss their collaboration -- plus growing up a Sheen, Francis Ford Coppola's brutal audition process, and whether actors should participate in the fan culture surrounding cult films like <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
