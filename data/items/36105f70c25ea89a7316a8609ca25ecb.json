  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason and Super Producer Rob G (Robert Guerra) kick things off by doing a deep dive into Tom Brady's mysterious training camp absence. Brady spoke about it for the first time over the weekend... and said a whole lot of nothing. Regardless what the exact reason was, it's clear this version of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is nothing like the one he won a Super Bowl with two years ago. In fact, J-Mac says he's officially pivoting to the New Orleans Saints to win the NFC South this year over Brady's Bucs. Later, the guys discuss Jason assertion that Trey Lance could have a Robert Griffin III-esque season this year with the San Francisco 49ers. RG3 burst on the scene as a rookie thanks in large part to a dominant running game which worked perfectly when paired with his own dynamic playmaking; Doesn't that sound exactly like what we expect to see from Lance this year in San Francisco? There's a reason why a handful of recent guests have pegged the Niners as a dark horse Super Bowl contender. Finally, Jason and Rob G close the show by discussing the notion that most NBA 'insiders' don't really know much at all when it comes to offseason movement. Not a single reporter had Rudy Gobert to Minnesota or Patrick Beverley to the Lakers before they actually happened. In fact, you can argue that the more frequently a trade rumor gets discussed the less likely it is to actually happen. </p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p>\n<p>#FSRWeekends #Herd</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
