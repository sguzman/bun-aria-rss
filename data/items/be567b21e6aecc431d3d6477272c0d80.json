  "description": "<p>On this year's Christmas Special, we are joined by special guest Dan Foytik of the <a href=\"http://www.9thstory.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9th Story Podcast,</a> The Wicked Library and The Lift. We discuss some of the history behind Christmas and most importantly, analyze the history of telling ghost stories on Christmas Eve. Most of our Christmas traditions are rooted in Victorian England. Sending Christmas cards and caroling door to door are just a couple of those traditions, but one tradition fell by the wayside and that is the practice of telling ghost stories on Christmas Eve. We are keeping that alive on the History Goes Bump Podcast and The 9th Story Podcast. We told ghost stories last year and we are doing it again this year. Mark Nixon of <a href= \"http://shadowsatthedoor.com\">http://shadowsatthedoor.com</a> joins us to tell one of his own original stories as well!</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p> </p>",
