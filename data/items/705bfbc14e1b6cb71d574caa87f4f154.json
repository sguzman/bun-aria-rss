Teeing off on themes from his new film \"Don't Think Twice,\" Keegan and Anna offer reflections on fame, talent, success and providence. Keegan leaves no doubt that he's among the best improv performers in Hollywood when he and Anna revisit the studio-executive scenario from prior episodes.  His hysterical (and inspired!) pitches for sequels to Titanic and Rosemary's Baby are sure to have you in stitches! Later, they talk to a woman whose high school boyfriend, (the \"one who got away\") surprised her with a romantic - yet ambiguous - gesture nine years after their break-up. It's up to the Unqualified crew to deduce what he meant - and what her next move should be.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
