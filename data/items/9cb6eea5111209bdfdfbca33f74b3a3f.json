Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Darius McCrary for calling sexual abuse victims \"thirsty\" even when he admitted he was touched when he was younger as well. Moreover, after DL Hughley admitted on Angela Yee's \"Lip Service\" podcast that he got his side chick pregnant in the past and was nervous to tell his main chick, even though the baby ended up getting killed, we opened up the phone lines to see if any of the fellas would tell their main chick immediately and for the ladies if they would stay with their man. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
