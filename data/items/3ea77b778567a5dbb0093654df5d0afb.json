  "description": "<p>On this week's show, 2003 Stanley Cup-winning goal scorer Mike Rupp joins the boys to discuss his monster Game 7 in the '03 SCF, his infamous Winter Classic salute right in Jaromir Jagr's grill, Jagr's delayed retort, how Mike Milbury plays hardball, and much more. Ryan opens it up to address the \"fallout\" in Edmonton after he and Colby Armstrong had some laughs on TV about a beloved Oiler getting chirped on-ice years ago. The fellas then answer a few #AllRightHamilton questions. RA closes the show with some talk about his trip to Toronto and compares what $5 (CDN) got you in 1989 Montreal strip joints vs. 2017 Toronto strip joints. Lots of ball-busting on this ep, so enjoy.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
