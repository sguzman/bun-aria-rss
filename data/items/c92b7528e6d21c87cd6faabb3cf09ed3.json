  "description": "<p>The advent of 5G and the design of its architecture has become possible\nbecause of the previous individual scientific works and standardization efforts\non cloud computing and network softwarization. Software-defined Networking and\nNetwork Function Virtualization started separately to find their convolution\ninto 5G network architecture. Then, the ongoing design of the future beyond 5G\n(B5G) and 6G network architecture cannot overlook the pivotal inputs of\ndifferent independent standardization efforts about autonomic networking,\nservice-based communication systems, and multi-access edge computing. This\narticle provides the design and the characteristics of an agent-based,\nsoftwarized, and intelligent architecture, which coherently condenses and\nmerges the independent proposed architectural works by different\nstandardization working groups and bodies. This novel work is a helpful means\nfor the design and standardization process of the futureB5G and 6G network\narchitecture.\n</p>",
