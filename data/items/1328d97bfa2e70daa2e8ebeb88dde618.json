  "description": "In today's podcast we hear more about the Shadow Brokers, who are confirmed to have dropped some genuine zero-days. Most observers now think there was a compromise at NSA; some suspect Russian intelligence services. North Korea is again scrutinized for SWIFT fraud. Operation Ghoul targets industrial intellectual property in thirty countries. We see continued industry churn (including some layoffs as well as M&A rumors). CrowdStrike's Adam Meyers tells us about the Boson Spider gang, and Ben Yelin from the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security weighs in on the Shadow Brokers.",
