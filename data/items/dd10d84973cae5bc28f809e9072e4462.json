    "media:description": "Hydrogen engines can give you the best of both worlds, clean emissions and a nice loud exhaust (it's what enthusiasts crave!). So if everything is going electric, does that mean no more exhaust sounds? Not if hydrogen engines become a reality. There's just one big problem: fuel cells exist. They're basically twice as efficient, and storing hydrogen is already a challenge. It takes up a lot of space! With a fuel cell, you need much less hydrogen onboard, because you can use it more efficiently. \n\nRelated Videos:\nHydrogen Engines = Bad Idea - https://youtu.be/1Ajq46qHp0c\nToyota's Hydrogen Engine - https://youtu.be/3IPR50-soNA\nHow Hydrogen Piston Engines Work - https://youtu.be/l6ECwRnJ0Sg\nHow Hydrogen Fuel Cells Work - https://youtu.be/0jnZFGx_4kY\n\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\nEE Shirts! - http://bit.ly/2BHsiuo\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",
