  "description": "On this second episode of Deep State Radio recorded in the sylvan beauty of Aspen, Colorado during the Ideas Festival, our regulars including Kori Schake of Stanford, David Sanger of the New York Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times, explore a few of the top overheard high up in the Rockies.  Then they ponder the nature of elites at events like Aspen and why it might be that they seem a bit out of touch sometimes with the reality of the average person.  And if you think it's hypocritical for them to do that given that they were at Aspen or frequent events like it, forget it.  The Deep State Radio gang fly commercial.  On this episode we prove yet again that we are the people's elite.
