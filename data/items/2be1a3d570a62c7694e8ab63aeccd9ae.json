Sim and Anna also put Shaq to the test by making him match rap lyrics to the NBA baller who rapped them. Later, the gang gives a male caller unqualified advice about how to help re-build his wife's self-confidence after years of marriage and child-raising have taken a toll. \"ShaqDaddy's\" advice is bound to make you love him even more!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
