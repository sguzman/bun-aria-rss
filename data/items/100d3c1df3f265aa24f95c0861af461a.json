  "description": "Today we’re talking about taking your vision to the finish line, or following through with your dream. We share some insight into a unique, wonderful project we worked on years ago, which the owner didn’t want us to share until just recently. This man wanted us to design a chandelier room, which we felt was a terrible idea, but he insisted it would be great, so we took it upon ourselves to do the best we could and turned it into something amazing. When painting, it doesn’t necessarily cost more because you’re going to have to redo it all anyway, so you’re better off to be courageous and bold when venturing into your new design. “The best color in the world is the one that looks the best on you.” It’s exhilarating to get to do something great and authentic, and it’s like jumping off the high dive as opposed to just the regular diving board.<br /><br />The project we worked on 4:42<br />Have courage and conviction in your design 16:28<br />Reach further than the mainstream 26:32<br />Painting one wall can really make a difference 34:57<br />Surround yourself with bigger ideas than just what are in your head 37:52<br /><br />“I like [the client’s] confidence. Not only to say this to you, to be like this is what this room should be, but also his confidence to not care about what anyone is going to think coming into this space. I think a lot of the time a lot of people let outside opinions outside of their household affect the things they do in their own home.” 14:21<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
