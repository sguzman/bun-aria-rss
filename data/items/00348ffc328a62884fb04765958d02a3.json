  "title": "Episode 203: The Mysterious Disappearance of Brittanee Drexel",
  "description": "Brittanee Drexel was 17 years old when two girls, Alanna Lippa and Jennifer Oberer, invited her to go on spring break with them. The girls were from Chili New York and were planning to head to Myrtle beach for a long weekend. Brittanee’s mom, Dawn Drexel, told her she couldn’t go because she didn’t know the girls Brittanee would be going with and was afraid something bad would happen. Britanee told her mom she was just staying with friends for the weekend instead, but really she went out to Myrtle Beach, and disappeared within 2 days. There are many horrible theories as to what happened to Brittanee that will break your heart. But it’s an important story to tell, in the hopes justice will someday be served. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\nLovebook: Visit <a href=\"http://LoveBookOnline.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">LoveBookOnline.com/MORBID</a> to receive a special 20% discount only\nfor our listeners!\n<br>\n\nThrive Market: Go to Thrive <a href=\"http://Market.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Market.com/MORBID</a>.
