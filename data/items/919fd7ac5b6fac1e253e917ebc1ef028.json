It’s the eighth  straight monthly decline and the 14th decline in the past  15 months. <br /><br />High inventories at many retailers; warehouses  that are generally still clogged (related to high  inventories); the fact that many retailers moved up orders  to earlier in the year to ensure delivery before the holiday  season; and lower port volumes are some of the reasons why intermodal volumes this  year are not as high as they otherwise would be. </blockquote>",
