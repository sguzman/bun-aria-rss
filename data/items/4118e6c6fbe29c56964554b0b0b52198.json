  "description": "Since its inception in 2017, the viral #MeToo movement has called more cultural attention to abusive behavior, creating a much-needed public space for women to speak up about the violence they have endured at the hands of abusers, and for women to speak more openly about their own ambitions, dreams, and desires. For the first time in history, there is a platform for women to speak, and—most importantly—to be heard. In 2019, we can add another voice to this ongoing conversation: Reema Zaman’s radical assertion that “[t]o speak is a revolution.”\nReema Zaman’s bold debut book, I Am Yours: A Shared Memoir (Amberjack, 2019) details what happens when women are silenced by the patriarchy—and what it means to find the power inherent in one’s own voice. As a Bengali woman who immigrated to New York City to pursue her dream of becoming a stage actress, Zaman portrays herself as both driven and fearless, despite the many hardships she endures as a young woman in the city. From navigating toxic relationships with men in the industry to finding the courage to leave an abusive marriage, Zaman touches on both the struggles and beauty of one woman’s journey towards speaking her truth.\nToday on New Books in Literature, join us as we sit down with Reema Zaman to learn more about her debut, I Am Yours: A Shared Memoir, available now from Amberjack Publishing.\nZoë Bossiere is a doctoral student at Ohio University, where she studies nonfiction and teaches creative writing classes. She is also the managing editor of Brevity: A Journal of Concise Literary Nonfiction.
