  "description": "<p>We wrap up our follow-up conversation with Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn with Jim and Laura digging deeper into their case. Jim discusses the unusual dichotomy of the offender’s behavior as both sadistic in nature, and also presenting as a power-reassurance rapist — which could also indicate multiple offenders in this crime. Laura talks about how dangerous perpetrators are able to get out of prison due to both the mistakes by law enforcement and also their cunning in gaming the system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>You can read Denise and Aaron’s book, co-written with investigative journalist Nicole Weisensee Egan \"Victim F\" available now on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3dhzvCJ</a></p><p><br></p><p>#VictimF</p><p>#DeniseHuskins</p><p>#AaronQuinn</p><p>#NicoleWeisenseeEgan</p><p>#believevictims</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CLIPS PLAYED IN TODAY’S EPISODE CAN BE HEARD IN THEIR ENTIRETY HERE:</strong></p><p>Denise Huskins, Aaron Quinn Want Vallejo Police to \"Make Changes to Be Better\" | The View</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/Z0Hc03N9l-E</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'Gone Girl' Case: Break in Bizarre Kidnapping – ABC News</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/IhZxY4cPOwo</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</strong></p><p><br></p><p>GROVE - Choosing products that are better for you and the planet has never been easier.
