  "description": "Security executives need visibility into their real cyber risk in real time. But with the flood of vulnerability alerts, how can organizations pinpoint impactful security gaps? To meet this challenge, security teams are shifting to an exploit-centric approach to security validation to expose potential threats from ransomware, leaked credentials, phishing, & more. \nOn this episode, of CyberWire-X, we explore how automation can help teams make this shift to prioritize remediation based on bottom line business impact. Rick Howard, the CyberWire's CSO, Chief Analyst and Senior Fellow, discusses the topic with Rick Doten, CISO, Carolina Complete Health and CyberWire Hash Table member, while Dave Bittner, CyberWire podcast host, engages with Sponsor Pentera's Jay Mar-Tang, Sales Engineering Manager for the Americas, about automated security validation.",
