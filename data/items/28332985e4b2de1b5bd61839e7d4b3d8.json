  "description": "Larry Wilmore has a resume that could rival pretty much anyone's in Hollywood. Name a show and he probably had his hands in it. He created <em>The Bernie Mac Show</em>, co-created <em>Insecure</em>, wrote for shows like <em>In Living Color</em>, <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,</em> and <em>The Office</em>, and served as the \"Senior Black Correspondent\" on <em>The Daily Show</em>. He also had his own late night show called <em>The Nightly Show</em>.<br/><br/>Now, Wilmore is back in the hosting chair with a new show on the NBC streaming service Peacock. Sam and Wilmore chat about starting a new show from scratch in a pandemic, deconstructing 2020, and why that one episode of <em>The Office</em> probably wouldn't fly today.",
