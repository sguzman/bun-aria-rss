  "description": "<p>Beaujolais is a unique, standalone wine region in central eastern France. Sandwiched between southern Burgundy (the Mâconnais) and Lyon (where it is their preferred wine), these wines and this terroir is like no other on earth. With high elevation from the western Massif Central, east and south-facing slopes, these wines get ripe over a long growing season with good diurnals. The unique pink granite and weathered granite sand, along with mineral rich soils of the northern section of Beaujolais, aren’t something you’ll easily find elsewhere in the wine world. In addition, nowhere else in the world specializes in the Gamay grape.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/023_etienne_ramousse_inter-beaujolais_ete_2018_hd_externe_2018-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"199\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.beaujolais.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.beaujolais.com</a></em></span></p> <p>This grape’s expression in the 10 Crus of Beaujolais – whether it be like iris and violets, tart cherry, blackberry, mineral or intense spice – is always surprising and refreshing due to the high acidity of the wines. The quality for price can’t be beat and as producers embrace traditional vinification rather than carbonic maceration (used in Beaujolais nouveau, which is declining) the wines continue to improve and show what Gamay and the Beaujolais region are capable of. We give you all the details you need to seek out these splendid, undervalued gems.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are 12 Appellations in Beaujolais: 10 Cru and 2 regional appellations</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Beaujolais/Beaujolais Superiéur</strong> are regional appellations. These wines are mainly (99%) red of Gamay. They are required to have a minimum of 10% alcohol (not very ripe!) and are generally made via semi-carbonic maceration. These wines can be red or rosé. The reds taste like red grapes, cranberry, cherry, banana, candied pear, and are light in color, light in tannin and high in acidity. 1% of Beaujolais AOC wines are simple whites of Chardonnay.</p> <p>Added designations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Superiéur:</strong> The wines have lower yields, and 0.5% more alcohol. You can only use this designation for reds.</li> <li><strong>30 specific village</strong> names can be added to the Beaujolais AOC or Beaujolais Superieur</li> <li><strong>Nouveau/Primeur</strong>: released the third Thursday of November, made through carbonic maceration, these wines <img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/beaujolais-villages-chameroy-bouteille1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"91\" height=\"327\" />represent 2/3 of the Beaujolais AOC. All are hand harvested to keep the whole grapes for carbonic maceration</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Beaujolais Villages</strong> are from 38 specific villages that are deemed<br /> extremely high quality and can also be red or rosé although they are mainly red.  These reds are darker in color and less grapey than basic Beaujolais. They have red and black berry, mineral, and spice notes, with more tannin and strong acidity.  Some of these wines are made without carbonic maceration and are more serious wines with complexity, although Villages can be sold as Nouveau as well. </p> <p> </p> <p>Beaujolais Villages Blanc are 100% Chardonnay and are concentrated in flavor, similar to the wines of Mâconnais. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Crus: The 10 best of Beaujolais</strong></p> <p>All wine is 100% Gamay. The pruning methods, vine density and yields are specified by commune. All grapes for the Crus are hand-harvested, most of it is hand-sorted. The best of these wines are transitioning from carbonic maceration to traditional red wine fermentation. The minimum required minimum alcohol is 10%. Although “Cru de Beaujolais” must be somewhere on the label, it is generally in very small print, so you need to know the names of the Crus to find them!</p> <p> </p> <p>The Crus also have special vineyard sites, or climats, which you will see on the bottle and should seek out. Because so few people are familiar with these wines, they are incredibly affordable, with great examples costing less than US$30!</p> <p> </p> <p>From north to south, as we discuss in the show, the Crus are: Saint-Amour, Juliénas, Chénas, Moulin-á-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, Régníe, Côte de Brouilly, Brouilly</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/map-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"316\" height=\"453\" /><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Source: <a href= \"http://www.discoverbeaujolais.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.discoverbeaujolais.com</a></span></em></p> <p>In groups by style, here are the descriptions of each…</p> <p><strong>Light -Medium Bodied: <em>Chiroubles</em></strong></p> <p>These wines are floral, with iris, violet, and peony notes. They also have red berry and baking spice aromas and flavors with a light body and the famed “Glisser en bouche” – glides down the throat – quality. These wines ages 2 to 5 years.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Medium-Bodied</strong></p> <p><strong>Saint -Amour</strong> is made in two styles.</p> <ul> <li><em>Style 1</em>: Light, fruity, grapey, peachy, and like violets/flowers. Acidic and should be consumed within a year or two of vintage.</li> <li><em>Style 2:</em> Medium-bodied, slightly tannic, with sour cherry, ginger, baking spice and a savory, earthy quality that is like Pinot Noir with age. The best can age 10 years.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Fleurie</strong> is elegant and silky with iris, violet, rose, red fruit, and peach aromas and flavors. Fleurie wines can be soft or more substantial with dark fruit notes. They can age up to 5 years<br /> <br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/008_etienne_ramousse_inter_beaujolais_paysage-hiver_hd_externe_2019-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"224\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.beaujolais.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.beaujolais.com</a></em></span></p> <p><strong>Brouilly</strong> is fruit-driven with plum, red berry, cherry notes and sometimes mineral notes. They are have softer tannins and can age 3 to 5 years.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Medium- to full-bodied:</strong></p> <p><strong>Cote de Brouilly</strong> is sourced from the high-altitude areas within Brouilly. The wines are more robust in body with blackberry, plum, fresh grape, iris flower, and black pepper notes. They have strong acidity and mild tannin. They taste better after 4 to 6 years.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Juliénas</strong> is highly aromatic with sweet and tart red berry, violet/dark flower, cinnamon, peach notes, and a mineral earthiness. They have great acidity and can age 6 to 10 years.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Full-bodied:</strong></p> <p><strong>Chenás</strong> is floral with peony and rose aromas. It has a special spicy, woodsy quality, regardless of whether it has been in a barrel. Chénas has some tannin and is ageworthy – it can age 8 to 10 years.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Moulin-a-Vent</strong> is the King of Beaujolais; the pinnacle of the region. When it’s young, it’s like violets, cherries, and plums with a mineral, earth note. With age (the wines improve over 10 or more years), these wines become more like Pinot Noir - Indian spice, sandalwood, and earth.  They are balanced with good tannin and acidity.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Moulin--vent-en-t-Cru-du-Beaujolais-Daniel-Gillet-Inter-Beaujolais-copyright-01mf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.beaujolais.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.beaujolais.com</a></em></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <p><strong>Morgon</strong> is the longest lived of the Cru, with aging potential of 5 to 20 years.
