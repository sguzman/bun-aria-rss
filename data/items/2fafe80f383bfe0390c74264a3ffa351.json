  "description": "<p>Today's show is absolutely LOADED. Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys react to the news that Tyreek Hill has officially been traded to the Miami Dolphins for a 1st, 2nd, and 4th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft and a 4th and 6th round pick in 2023, how crazy this offseason has been, if we'll see more players asking for trades in the coming weeks, everything else happening in the NFL, and how electric the Eagles concert that Pat went to last night was. Joining the program fresh off a first round submission win this weekend, is UFC Lightweight Superstar, Paddy \"The Baddy\" Pimblett to chat about this weekend's win, his rising star in the UFC, when he see's himself competing for a title shot, how much he binges after a fight, when we'll see him in the Octagon next, and more (5:08-33:37). Next, the greatest referee of all-time, current NFL and NCAA Basketball rules analyst for CBS Sports, Gene Steratore joins Pat and AJ to chat about his career as a referee, how he's liking his new gig, his thoughts on today's referee, what it takes to call a game in those massive environments, if he ever has the itch to still ref, and more in an incredible conversation (1:06:12-1:32:55). Later, 3x Pro Bowler and current Quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings, Kirk Cousins joins the progrum to chat about his new contract extension, his relationship with Adam Thielen and Justin Jefferson, what it's going to take to get the Vikings over the hump next year, his conversations with a new GM and Head Coach, at what point in his career he knew he'd be able to be a consistent starting Quarterback in the league, and more (1:32:57-2:00:11). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show, and listen on Sirius XM Channel 82, Mad Dog Radio.
