Who pays a crackhead $11 million dollars?! What are Joe Biden's options for Hunter Biden? Clay says, \"I think one of Joe Biden's final acts may be pardoning his son.\" Department of Homeland Security is warning about \"extremist violence\" that could come from \"either side\" if Roe v. Wade is struck down. Buck says, \"This is not a 'both sides' issue. I'm sorry -- we're not gonna play this game.\" Rapper Zuby pushes back on Black Lives Matter: \"They're not helping black people in general. They are helping themselves. The way you stop racism is by people not being racist. It's not by calling everyone racist.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
