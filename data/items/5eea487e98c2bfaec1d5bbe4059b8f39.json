Go do that first, then come on back. It will save me some explaining. But as long as we're on the subject, let's recap the situation.</p><p>Josh is a recognized teen behavior expert well known for helping adults understand teens and teens understand themselves. He’s worked with, appeared on and/or contributed to MTV, CNN, FOX, The New York Times, 20/20, Anderson Cooper Live, Oprah.com and Good Morning America. In 2009 Josh was named to <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/30under30/2009/profile_hey_josh.html\" target=\"_blank\">Inc. magazine's “30 Under 30″</a> of successful entrepreneurs. He has lectured at Harvard, Stanford, UCLA and MIT, starred in two documentary-style television series&nbsp;and authored two books: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312641540/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312641540&linkCode=as2&tag=ricroloffweb-20&linkId=YSRRZLEK5IQAMGON\" target=\"_blank\">The Teen's Guide to World Domination</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312646739/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312646739&linkCode=as2&tag=ricroloffweb-20&linkId=ID4UKHVZLA3KXTAM\" target=\"_blank\">Jump Ship</a>.</p><p>If you did listen to my intro and outro to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll116\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, then you know Josh challenged me to remove e-mail and social media from my iPhone as a means of increasing my overall productivity and enhancing the quality of my interpersonal interactions. Today is day 3 and as Josh so adeptly predicts in this second part of our conversation, I am indeed twitchy.&nbsp;A little anxious. Scattered and basically just uncomfortable with the whole idea. Why? Because&nbsp;I like being connected at all times. I like the buzz and anticipation of checking social media. And I can easily justify it as part of my job.&nbsp;But this does not mean it's healthy because it isn't. My relationship might not fall into Her (the movie)&nbsp;territory, but it's definitely&nbsp;obsessive compulsive, if not just a downright addiction.</p><p>What does this remind me of?</p><p>Rehab.</p><p>Weathering a detox — or in this case an&nbsp;iDetox –&nbsp;isn't fun. But for me it's familiar territory. I know that if I stick with it, it will pass. I also know that the simple fact I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms is a pretty good indicator that I am onto something. Something I need to do if I want to grow.</p><p>Monday night I fired an e-mail off to Josh to thank him again for doing the podcast and to let him know Part 1 was live. I closed the note with the following:</p><p>“P.S. –&nbsp;deleted Twitter, Facebook AND e-mail from my phone. Think I’m going to have a panic attack. Tell me I’ll be OK.”</p><p>The next morning, Josh replied:</p><p>“Imagine having Doritos and a green drink sitting in front of you.&nbsp;If you're new to eating clean … you'll grab the Doritos every time, even though you know better.&nbsp;But when the ONLY option is the green drink, you are at first forced to go for it, but then later choose it.&nbsp;We should choose real humans, friends, family, etc. first. But social media is the Doritos.&nbsp;As sad as this is, we have slowly trained ourselves to go to real people LAST instead of first…&nbsp;This is a way of reprograming ourselves.”</p><p>So true. I've decided to undergo this #iDetox&nbsp;for me, but&nbsp;I also know I'm not alone.
