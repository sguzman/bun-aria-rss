  "description": "<p>How can print media stand out in 2014? What sets a publication apart from its peers in an overcrowded landscape of mediocre writing and photography? Find out on a new episode of <em>Eat Your Words</em> as Briana Kurtz is joined by James Casey, founder and editor of Swallow Magazine. In their own words — Swallow is the anti-foodie food magazine, a palate-pleasing respite from gastronomic faddism. Each issue is akin to the perfect dinner party where the food is central to the event, but the conversation veers wildly around the table from topic to topic before eventually returning to the procession of morsels at hand. Released in a high-end format comparable to a coffee table book, Swallow ventures far beyond the culinary realm and features notable contributors more often found within the worlds of art and fashion. This program was brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.EdwardsVAHam.com\">Edwards VA Ham</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://cdnimages.uniquemagazines.co.uk/Large/SwallowMagazine2.jpg\" />\n<h4>“New York is not necessarily what New York once was.
