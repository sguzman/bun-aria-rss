We say something nice about the Dolphins. The Browns are back to being Super Bowl Champs. Is Jameis Good? Chase Daniel redeems all Chases, and we discuss if you can have Zane as a kicker. Who's back of the week (72:20 - 85:06). Football guy of the week (85:06 - 93:12). Uhh ya think, and a Monday Reading about a guy obsessed with Virgins vs Chad memes (94:19).
