  "description": "<p>In this 51st in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss Bret’s recent Facebook ban. What are the implications for democracy when social media platforms are in the business of deciding who gets to speak? In the second half, we discuss Eric Hoffer’s 1951 book, The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements. Are there two mass movements currently competing with one another for adherents? Can creativity provide people with the power to resist such movements? What might good leadership look like?<br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com).
