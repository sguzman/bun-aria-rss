  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, Angelina and Cindy interview Caitlin Bruce Beauchamp. In addition to being a homeschool graduate and a lover of the humanities, Caitlin is a busy wife and a mother of young children. In their conversation, Angelina, Cindy and Caitlin dive into the deep end from the start, discussing the purpose of beauty. They talk about Caitlin’s early reading life and how she came to love books. She shares how she had to learn some humility in her reading life as an adult.</p> <p>Angelina asks Caitlin how she finds the time to keep up her reading life amidst the responsibilities of mothering. Cindy and Caitlin talk about the importance of feeding your mind with other people’s ideas instead of taking the road to self-pity. The ladies discuss the timing of reading certain books to children and the great joy of watching children blossom as they listen to the right kinds of stories. Caitlin shares some of the books she reads to get out of a slump, as well as some other favorites and current reads.</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>In the Bleak Midwinter</h3> <p><em>by Christina Rossetti</em></p> <p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,<br /> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;<br /> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,<br /> In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p> <p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;<br /> Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.<br /> In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed<br /> The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p> <p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,<br /> Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;<br /> Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,<br /> The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p> <p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,<br /> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;<br /> But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,<br /> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.</p> <p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?<br /> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br /> If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;<br /> Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</span></em></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/35LPZgK\">The Reading Life</a></em> by C.
