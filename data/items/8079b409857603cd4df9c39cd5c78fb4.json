  "description": "<p><p>Blind Mike puts in another all-star performance at a business lunch, while Steve Robinson is sorely disappointed, yet again, with a restaurant meal. The dream team of Jim Braude, Margerie Eagan, and Trenni Kusnierek reunited on WGBH for an orgasmic lovefest over Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy and Red Sox owner John Henry (00:24:32). Last week, Kirk Minihane questioned the reporting of Greg Bedard over a thinly sourced claim about Bill Belichick. Bedard's reaction to a 98.5 caller who called him out does not inspire much confidence (00:49:30). Minihane begins to wonder when all the outraged sports fans will start to wonder who is paying to advertise with the ethically challenged Red Sox?

An instant classic parody song today -- much to the chagrin of the Sox clubhouse.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
