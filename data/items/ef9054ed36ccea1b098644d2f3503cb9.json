  "title": "ICYMI: Chance The Rapper, Kehlani, & The Shifting Sound of R&B — with Oak Felder",
  "description": "The sound of R&B is difficult to pin down. Since the 1950s, the label has been used both as a genre and as a catch-all for the entirety of black popular music. Soul, funk, disco and even hip-hop have at times been covered by this \"R&B\" umbrella. On Chance The Rapper's new album, The Big Day, all of these influences come through—and he's not alone. On recent Kehlani records, 90s R&B and 2000s trap both play a role. But both these artists are a far cry from the 50s R&B sounds of Sam Cooke. To understand how R&B has changed over time, we consult with Trevor Anderson, manager of Billboard's R&B/Hip Hop chart. Then we speak with R&B super-producer Oak Felder to understand how R&B is progressing and what it might become.\nSongs Discussed\nChance The Rapper – Hot Shower\nChance The Rapper – I Got You\nSam Cooke – You Send Me\nElvis Presley – Crying In the Chapel\nThe Temptations – I Can’t Get Next To You\nMtume – Juicy Fruit\nBiggie – Juicy\nToni Braxton – Breath Again\nJanet Jackson – That’s The Way Love Goes\nBoys II Men – I’ll Make Love To You\nLauryn Hill – Doo Wop (That Thing)\nDiddy – I’ll Be Missing You (feat.
