  "description": "Today, we talk to one of the biggest up and coming distilleries in Bardstown...and that's the Bardstown Bourbon Company. We covered the business side in a past episode, but this time we look at operations and the two guys responsible for filling thousands of barrels per year. Steve Nally and John Hargrove sit down with us to talk about their background in distillation. Spoiler alert, Steve Nally is kind of a big deal. We also touch on what the process is like for a customer to work with them as they choose a mash bill, yeast strain, barrel location in the rickhouse, and where they see the market in 5 years. If you are on the bourbon trail, be sure to stop at BBC for lunch and a dusty pour.\nShow Notes:\n\nJim Beam Cheat Sheet:  http://bourbonr.com/blog/jim-beam-distillery-production-cheat-sheet/\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about Bolivia.\n\nWhat was your first taste of bourbon?\n\nHow did you get into working in the bourbon and spirits industry?\n\nHow was it going from Maker's to a start up distillery?\n\nDo you have a formal education in science or did you learn on the job?\n\nHow did they convince you to come to BBC?\n\nWhat was the initial BBC strategy?\n\nWhat is your distillery capacity?\n\nDid you see the need for contract distilling?\n\nIs it difficult to produce so many mash bills?\n\nDo clients have a mash bill in mind or do you help coach them?\n\nWalk us through the process.\n\nCan you pick your own yeast strain?\n\nCan you sample the yeast strains?\n\nDo you guide customers on wood?\n\nHow long is your wait?\n\nHow do you allocate floor levels in the warehouse?\n\nWhat's the craziest demand from a customer?\n\nIs it more efficient to have a contract distiller?\n\nWhat are you distilling for BBC?\n\nTalk about the risk of experimenting with products.\n\nWhere do you see bourbon in 3-5 years?\n\nAny plans for other spirits?\n\nTell us about the decision to allow customers to customize the process.\n\nDo you bottle and help with packaging?",
