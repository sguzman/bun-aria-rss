  "description": "This week Colin and I talk about a recent experience that turned out to be one of the most nerve-wracking experiences we’ve had in a while. It all revolves around a pitch for our show The Breakdown - and we’ll get into more specifics about the opportunity and the experience in the episode itself.\nThis podcast recording was actually the first time Colin and I talked about the experience and it led to a lot of interesting topics in our conversation. We talk about how each of us felt before, during and after the pitch experience, we talk about the concept of comparison and imposter syndrome and we even talk about morning routines and how we each try and set ourselves us for success in the mornings.\nThis is probably one of our most revealing podcasts - I think even we were surprised about where the conversation went.",
