  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Smackdown on Friday night and how Pat shaved for the first time in a very long time, what movies and documentaries he watched this weekend, and everything that is going on in the sports world currently. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and friend of the program, Adam Thielen joins the show to chat about making waves with his recent comments about Lambeau Field, what he's heard about when they might be going back to work at the facility, what he's been doing in the offseason, and how his golf game currently is (18:18-36:17). Pat and AJ Hawk also chat about a variety of different things including the whole Adam Thielen situation, Bob Baffert allegedly being a cheating scumbag, players changing their jersey numbers, the Jaguars zeroing in on signing Tim Tebow to play TE, and much more (38:34-1:28:26). Later, Pat and AJ are joined by NBA Insider for The Athletic and Stadium, Shams Charania, to break down everything we need to know about the NBA as we head into the playoffs including when LeBron is coming back, what the status of the Nets is, if people are still pissed about the play-in game, and more (1:29:45-1:43:48).
