  "description": "The Winchester Mystery House is a tale that’s been told countless times. The house is featured on tons and tons of Top 10 haunted lists and over the years the house has become the focal point of the lore. We felt it was really important to tell the story not only of the house but of the woman who created it: Sarah Pardee Winchester. There were countless details that we didn’t realize about her or the house and through our research, we really began tearing back the layers of this story!
