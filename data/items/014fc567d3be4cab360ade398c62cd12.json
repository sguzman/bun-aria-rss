Benjamin and I cover an enormous amount of ground in our wide-ranging interview: we touch on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principal as a way of his writing; the failure of our societies to make room for overlapping, sometimes contradictory histories; his distaste for genre categories; the inevitable loss involved in translation; Chile’s frightening presidential election; and much much more. I know that you will be as enthralled and challenged and delighted by Benjamín’s capacious mind. \nBenjamín Recommends:\n\nJuan Forn, Los Viernes\n\n\nRoberto Calasso, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony\n\n\nPascal Quignard, The Last Kingdom\n\n\nElliot Weinberger, An Elemental Thing\n\n\nJ.A.
