You also ask us lots of questions about why and how animals got their names. So today we're going to introduce you to the concept of taxonomy, or how animals are categorized, and we'll also talk about the difference between scientific and common names.

Or bald eagles that very clearly have plenty of feathers on their heads. Or guinea pigs, which aren't actually pigs!<br>\n<br>\nAnd then there are animals with awesomely silly names. Have you ever heard of the umbrella bird? How about the sparklemuffin peacock spider!  Or the monkeyface prickleback, the sarcastic fringehead, and the white-bellied go-away bird!<br>\n<br>\nHow do animals get their names? Well, there are two types of animal names: Scientific names and common names.<br>\n<br>\nScientific names are used as a way to categorize all living things, so even if you don't know a lot about an animal, you can learn a lot about them by knowing their scientific name. There are eight different levels that living things get grouped into: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.<br>\n<br>\nThe broadest category is called the domain. There are three domains: archaea, bacteria, and eucarya. Bacteria and archaea are both categories of micro-organisms. All animals and plants belong in the eucarya domain.<br>\n<br>\nBelow domain is kingdom. There's a kingdom for animals called Animalia and a kingdom for plants called plantae. (And a few others as well.) As you go through the classification system it gets more and more specific. So, take humans: we belong to the eucarya domain, the animalia kingdom, the chordata phylum (because we have a backbone), the mammalia class (because we're mammals), the primate order, homonidae family, <em>homo</em> is our genus and <em>homo sapien</em> is our species name.<br>\n<br>\nAll species have two official scientific names, kind of like how you have a first name and a family name. So the species name for humans is <em>homo sapien</em>. The species name for a common black rat is <em>rattus rattus</em>. An Asian elephant is <em>elephas maximus</em>.<br>\n<br>\nThose names sound fancy, and originally the scientific names of animals were in Latin or Greek, but they don't have to be Latin or Greek anymore, they just have to sound like they are!<br>\n<br>\nBut we don't typically call all animals by their scientific names. We often refer to them by their common names, which are kind of like nicknames! Common names can be different in different languages. Like, the scientific name for a wolf is <em>canus lupus</em>. That would stay the same no matter what language you're using. But in English we tend to call it a wolf; in Spanish you'd call it <em>un lobo</em>, and in Welsh it would be <em>blaidd</em> (pronounced \"blythe\").<br>\n<br>\nEven within the same language, an animal can have lots of common names. Here in Vermont, where I live, we have an animal called a groundhog. But most people around here call it a woodchuck. And others call it a land beaver, or a whistle pig! Common names were often in use long before animals go their specific scientific names.</p>",
