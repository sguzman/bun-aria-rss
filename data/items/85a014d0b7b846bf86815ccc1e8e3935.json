  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the less-than-stellar ratings for New England's 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl. The game posted a 44.9 overnight rating on CBS, which is the lowest since the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals in 2009. Also discussed is what may happen during the offseason, including a possible change in how instant replay is utilized for questionable calls and non-calls like the pass interference that wasn't in the Rams-New Orleans NFC championship game. Also talked about are developments in the sale of Fox's 22 regional sports networks. Among the bidders are <a>Apollo Global Management</a>, <a>Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.</a> and <a>Major League Baseball</a>. Other interested parties include Platinum Equity and Liberty Media Corp. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Bob Bragg</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
