  "description": "With every mistake, there are great learnings. On this show, our staff share some quilting errors that taught them important lessons. And we hope the lessons help others, too! We touch on what to do when your blocks aren't all the right size (bigger? smaller? both? We have solutions!). We also share how to troubleshoot problems with your machine's foot pedal and some great things to know about English paper piecing templates and stitches. And if you're in need of a new project, we give details about a sew-along based on Barbara Brackman's \"Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns.\".\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-509-fix-blocks-that-arent-the-right-size\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
