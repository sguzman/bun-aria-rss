Not only do we discuss developing a business and being a leader but Jordan admits to me something incredibly personal and there's just no words to describe the way it made me feel. Intent is the game my friends and doing the right thing is just always the right thing. Drop me a line and let me know what you think about this one. <3 </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5223188.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
