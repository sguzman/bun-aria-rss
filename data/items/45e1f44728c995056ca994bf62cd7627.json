  "title": "A Very Square Peg: A Podcast Series about Polymath Robert Eisler. Episode 9: Vanity of Vanities",
  "description": "In this episode, I look at Eisler’s last days in England, where he found that the Oxford readership he had been promised before being sent to Dachau was taken by someone else, a paper shortage had put a stop to academic publishing, and that foreign Jews without visas were being imprisoned in a British internment camp on the Isle of Man. I also talk with astrology scholar Dr. Nicholas Campion about Eisler’s scathing criticisms of newspaper astrological columns and unpack Eisler’s final scholarly works on folklore, philology, and ethics. This episode officially concludes the story of Robert Eisler, but there will be a tenth and final episode in the near future that reflects on this project and academic podcasting as a whole after I have had time to hear some feedback. On that note, now that you have heard the story, I would love to hear what you think about it!\nGuests: Steven Beller (independent scholar), Nicholas Campion (Principal Lecturer in History at Bath Spa University and Director of the Sophia Centre for the Study of Cosmology in Culture)\nVoice of Robert Eisler: Caleb Crawford\nAdditional voices: Brian Evans and Chiara Ridpath\nMusic: “Shibbolet Baseda,” recorded by Elyakum Shapirra and His Israeli Orchestra.\nFunding provided by the Ohio University Humanities Research Fund and the Ohio University Honors Tutorial College Internship Program.\nSpecial thanks to the Warburg Institute and the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford.\n \nBibliography and Further Reading:\nCampion, Nicholas.
