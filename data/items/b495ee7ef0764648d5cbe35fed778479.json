  "summary": "<p>This week, for part of a textbook I'm helping to write,\nI spent some time reading and researching the history of Python as\na scientific computing tool.  I had heard bits and pieces of this in the past,\nbut it was fascinating to put it all together and learn about how all the\nindividual contributions that have made Python what it is today.\nAll of this got me thinking: for most of us, Python was a replacement for\nsomething: IDL, MatLab, Java, Mathematica, Perl... you name it.\nBut what will replace Python?\nTen years down the road, what language will people be espousing in\nblogs with awkwardly-alliterated titles?  As I thought it through, I\nbecame more and more convinced that, at least in the scientific computing\nworld, Python is here to stay.</p>",
