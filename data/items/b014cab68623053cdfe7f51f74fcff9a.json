  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden seems to have glossed over Memorial Day and gone straight back into racism, excessive government spending, and how else the Democrats can control our lives. We can’t fix our history in Tulsa's greenwood district. But we can't pretend that program after program and more government intervention will change what happened 100 years ago. That's a damnable lie. This push for racism, after all of the good progress America has made in the civil rights movement, is unraveling the country. The Party that is led by White liberals is reconstructing its constituent groups and trying to rewrite history to advance a foreign concept to destroy American exceptionalism. Then, Biden says that empathy is the fuel of democracy, but he's wrong, it's liberty that is the fuel of this republic. The left self-righteously slaps the label of \"reform\" on anything that they wish to destroy. If the problem is the government, why would anyone want more of it? Will trillions of dollars in federal spending eradicate racism? Critical race theory teaches that whites inherently benefit from white supremacy. It focuses on equity measures outcomes, not inputs. This is the racializalization of Marxism. Later, a federal appellate court struck down a provision of Biden's plan to grant special treatment to specific racial groups and genders. The Democrats' institutionalized racism is being disguised as righteousness. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
