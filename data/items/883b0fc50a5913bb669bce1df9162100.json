  "title": "Ep 300 | Jase Gets a Black Eye Without Leaving the House & What NOT to Do When Someone Is in Pain",
  "description": "Jase walks through a closed door, and Missy didn't quite have the reaction he was hoping for. That leads to a discussion on marriage, people who choose not to marry, and temptation before marriage. Al admits he moved his wedding date up because biology was about to take over theology. Jase learned the hard way that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Phil doesn't believe Jase's story about a girl who came on to him in high school. The guys discuss what people miss about predestination, why Jase believes in God-orchestrated encounters, and remembering to look at things from God's perspective, not yours. Al closes with the best advice you'll ever hear about how to help people who are hurting and what kind of help they DON'T need.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
