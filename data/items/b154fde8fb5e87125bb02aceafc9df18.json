  "description": "<p>After a history making day yesterday we're back for another day where other stuff happened as we go over everything from day 9 of Beijing 2022! Is Australia still buzzing after winning a medal in skeleton? Is Canada still buzzing after nearly getting their bronze medal record they're so desperate for? Which sport do we call out for being lazy? Which sport do we call out for being the complete opposite of lazy and one that needs more love? Are we satisfied with how Ben the bobsled went today? Why are we finding our potential prom king and queen of the Olympics? And which country might be about to resort to giving other athletes heart attacks to help them win medals? It's all in this episode and more so get to listening and make sure you slide your way into entertainment!</p>",
