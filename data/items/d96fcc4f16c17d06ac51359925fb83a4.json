  "description": "<p>At 1:40AM on February 2nd, 1980, a group of inmates at the New Mexico State Penitentiary attacked three guards doing their nightly count. What followed was one of the deadliest prison riots in US history.  Drunk and angry inmates seized the prison, and 36 hours of Hell on Earth followed. 12 guards were taken hostage, 33 inmates were killed, and over 200 people were raped.<br />Inmates were lit on fire, beheaded, and brutally tortured. When it was all over everyone wanted to know- what led to such carnage? What created such extreme feelings of rage and frustration within some of the inmates at the New Mexico State Penitentiary?
