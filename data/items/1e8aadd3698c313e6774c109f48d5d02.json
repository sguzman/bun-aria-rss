  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, not a single media outlet acknowledged that this program in March of 2017 pieced together the public reporting and deduced that Trump and his campaign were spied on. At the time the cowardly media lambasted this program as engaging in tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. Shame on them. China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia are not our friends despite what the Russis-philes in both political parties, on radio, and on television say. President Biden capitulated to Iran agreeing to their nuclear deal, and after being tested by Iran he's bent over backward to accommodate Putin as well. Biden has the power to destroy the Russian economy and the Chinese economy but has chosen to destroy the U.S economy instead. The U.S needs to take an offensive posture to the east of Russia in all NATO allied nations to send the right message, but will we deal with Putin or whine about forever-wars? Prime Minister Trudeau's edict to use government power to force tow truck drivers to haul away tractor trailers that are parked in protest of Canada's vaccine mandate on truck drivers.
