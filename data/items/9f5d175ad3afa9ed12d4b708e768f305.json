  "description": "On this 48th edition of the bourbon community roundtable, we talk about 80's movies. Yes, it may have gone on a bit longer than anticipated, but it may have been the glory years of iconic movies. Then we dive into Blanton’s Straight From the Barrel and get into release season. Will the shift of having online releases be the new way forward?\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about bourbon heritage month.\n\n80's movie showdown.\n\nBlanton's SFTB now available in the US. $150 is a great price point. However, very limited. So why price this higher than BTAC? Was it Ancient Age that dictated it?\n\nThe Party Source tried to sell Blanton's Bourbon online, website crashed. Are there any good alternatives in the current climate?\n\nWhy are distilleries doing special releases on-site/inline only, but not permitting proxies to pick up?\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
