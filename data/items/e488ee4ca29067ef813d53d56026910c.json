Since then he has emerged as one of the leaders of the Intellectual Dark Web. He is very aware of the severe divisions plaguing our society, and understands the energy behind those divisions. On this episode of Conversations with Tom Bilyeu, Bret Weinstein advocates learning to see both individual responsibility and collective responsibility simultaneously. He discusses the Unity 2020 platform, shares some insight on Andrew Yang’s presidency, and talks about what we need to do now to avoid civil war, environmental destruction, and general moral failure.
