For Watkins, black economic advancement can’t be reduced to whether you are for, or against, capitalism, socialism or any other “ism.” Instead, it’s about wielding economic opportunities to empower ourselves and our people.\n \nBlack History Year is produced by PushBlack, the nation’s largest non-profit Black media company.
