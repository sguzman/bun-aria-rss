  "description": "<p>This week, we dig deep on a story so bizarre, unlikely, and just plain insane, that we weren't sure if it was real for minute. Thankfully, it's real, and its's as much crazy as can be packed into one episode. An unknown baseball prospect, from the sugar cane fields of Louisiana, turns out to have more about him that nobody knew, like a lengthy criminal record, that includes everything from the petty, to the truly despicable. It's a story of a man, emerging from the obscure, only to end up infamous. Chop down some cane, learn how to order a pizza, and ruin a good story with the truth with Greg \"Toe\" Nash!!
