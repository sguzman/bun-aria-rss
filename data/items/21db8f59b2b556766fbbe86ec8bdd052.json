  "description": "The land of giants. Jotunheim. The realm of the monstrous \"other\" from Norse myth. Thorstein grew up being told it was only a legend, and he probably thought as much...until he walked into it. This is the epic saga of Thorstein Mansion-Might, a legendary Viking who is bigger than doors. The creature this time is Dr. Big Bird. He's a big bird who is an ancient world doctor. That sounds impressive until you think that probably anyone alive today is qualified to be an ancient world doctor. --- Sponsors: War Dragons: Check out our awesome team, just search for \"TheVolsungs\".
