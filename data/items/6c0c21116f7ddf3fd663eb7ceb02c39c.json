  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Changing Her Luck by Ella Maven!\n\nNarrated by Lacy Laurel and Jack Wesley\n\nI have lousy luck. Like, the worst. I could list all the reasons this is true except my journal is\n\nback on Earth. Where I’m not. Because I fell asleep in the wrong bed and woke up on an alien planet. To make matters worse, a massive blue alien with fangs and muscles takes me hostage. Now I’m stuck on a spaceship with him, but instead of taking off my head, he’s promising to protect\n\nme and care for me. I want to believe him, but my former captors are after us space-chase style.\n\nI wish I could relax with my new blue guy and maybe see what else about him is large and in\n\ncharge, but I’m Lousy Luck Lea. Unless something goes my way for once in my life, we’re doomed.\n\nFREE Ella Maven book!: https://dl.bookfunnel.com/mrtdefzqg9\n\nTHE ALIEN’S RANSOM: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0846CZW6S\n\nTHIS TIME TOMORROW by Tessa Bailey: https://amzn.to/3eIJL56\n\nGIVEAWAY!: http://readmeromance.com\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
