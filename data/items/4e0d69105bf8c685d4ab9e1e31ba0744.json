  "description": "<p>In the three years since our guest’s last visit, Matt and Bow’s octaves may have dropped, but the quality of their conversation with the legendary actor and now-author Betty Gilpin has NOT! The boys waste no time heaping (deserved) praise onto Betty and her new book “All the Women in My Brain,” which you must read and listen to as your Kantian imperative. The three talk about smoke allergies, smoke and MIRRORS, and smoking too much weed during boarding school. Special attention is paid to “The Thing,” an abstract yet undeniable phenomenon that Betty outlines perfectly and which collapses all boundaries for better or worse (i.e. choreography engendering fraternity). All the right questions are asked, including “Does God exist now that Betty has a child?” and “Will Matt sit through a horror film for an actress tour de force?” Many, of course, are answered. Stay till the end for three fab IDTSHs, or else Bowen will stab you in silks.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
