First, Zach Wilson talks to the media after being drafted by the New York Jets (2:51). Then, Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks start by focusing on Zach Wilson's development before he got to college. The guys talk to Wilson's high school football coach at Corner Canyon High School, Eric Kjar, as he hits on how good Wilson was on the basketball court and why it helped him as a football player (10:33). Next, Wilson's high school basketball coach, Dan Lunt, touches on Wilson's athleticism (18:46). Then, former BYU offensive coordinator and current Baylor offensive coordinator, Jeff Grimes, discusses his first impression of Wilson and tells the story of recruiting him (25:27). Now, the pair switch their focus to Zach's college career. Jeff Grimes talks more about how Wilson battled through injury and became comfortable in the offense at BYU (28:28). Following that, BYU head coach Kalani Sitake joins as he emphasizes Wilson's toughness (40:17). Next, BYU wide receiver and Zach's college roommate, Dax Milne, recalls experiences of playing with Wilson (43:39).
