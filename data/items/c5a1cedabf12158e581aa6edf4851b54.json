  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off with a few thoughts on the report that the FBI is investigating Deshaun Watson over his alleged sexual misconduct towards over 20 massage therapists. If the victims' attorney is to be believed, Watson could soon be facing human trafficking charges. If it wasn't clear already, it should be now: Watson's trade demand from the Houston Texans is the least of his problems. Later, Jason does a deep dive into Tim Tebow's release from the Jacksonville Jaguars. Tebow was always a long shot to make the final 53-man roster, even with Urban Meyer in his corner. And yet, so many in the media took his release as yet another opportunity to dance on his proverbial grave. But if you take a step back, you'll see that Tebow is still a winner in all of this. If you would've told a teenage Tebow that he'd win the Heisman trophy and two national championships in college, get drafted in the first round and win an NFL playoff game and eventually play professional baseball, you don't think he'd consider himself a success story? In many ways, his 'failure' was actually a blessing in disguise. Finally, Jason shares a quick thought on the Sacramento Kings' NBA Summer League championship. The win doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it did showcase Davion Mitchell's defensive prowess. With Mitchell and second-year guard Tyrese Haliburton in the fold, is it possible we could see a De'Aaron Fox-for-Ben Simmons trade to balance out the roster?</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
