This week, George Monbiot and Binyamin Appelbaum join the show to uncover just where the dominant economic theory of our time came from and how it took hold.  \nGeorge Monbiot writes a weekly column for The Guardian and is the author of a number of books, most recently ‘Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis’. As an investigative journalist and self-described “professional troublemaker,” George uncovers the complicated truths behind the world’s most persistent problems. \nTwitter: @GeorgeMonbiot\nBinyamin Appelbaum writes about economics and business for the editorial page of The New York Times. From 2010 to 2019, he was a Washington correspondent for the Times, covering economic policy in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. His new book, ‘The Economists’ Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets, and the Fracture of Society’ is a Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller. \nTwitter: @BCAppelbaum\nFurther reading: \nOut of the Wreckage: https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781786632890\nThe Economists’ Hour: https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316512329\nNeoliberalism - the ideology at the root of all our problems: https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\nGames Economists Play: http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/marshall-steinbaum-games-economists-play",
