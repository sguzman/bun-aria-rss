  "description": "<p>Oprah talks about the many ways animals teach and inspire us. Oprah shares the lessons she's learned from her own dogs and from other animals featured on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>. Oprah says one of her greatest teachers was her beloved dog Sophie. Oprah was also inspired by one of her most memorable guests, Faith, the dog who overcame severe deformities to learn to walk on two legs. \"If that little dog can do that, what can you do?\" Oprah asks. Oprah also takes a look back at a ground-breaking program called <em>Puppies Behind Bars</em>, which teaches prisoners to train puppies to become service dogs for wounded soldiers. Oscar-nominee Glenn Close takes us inside a prison to hear how men with histories of violence are being transformed by this amazing program. Finally, Oprah looks back on a touching moment played out in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as Nate Berkus comes to the aid of a survivor unable to part with his beloved dog, Rafiki.</p>\n",
