  "description": "The die is cast. Impeachment hearings are underway. The Trump presidency is in great (and well-deserved) peril. But, getting from where we are to an impeachment vote in the House and a conviction in the Senate will require a completely different tone and conduct from the Democratic leadership. And forestalling the end of the Trump presidency will require a change of pace from the White House. Edward Luce of the Financial Times and Mieke Eoyang, Vice President for National Security at the Third Way discuss and consider what is likely to happen next. Essential listening. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
