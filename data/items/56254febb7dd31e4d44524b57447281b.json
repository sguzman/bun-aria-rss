  "description": "In a very special Earth Month episode, Zack, Jenn, and Alex use Nigeria as a case study to uncover the deep reasons why it’s so hard for the world to quit fossil fuels. Nigeria is a country deeply threatened by climate change, but it’s also one with a major oil industry that hopes to lift millions out of poverty — a feat that has never been done without some degree of reliance on dirty energy. The team explains how these barriers affect the prospects for mitigating climate change in both Nigeria and globally, and talk about what solutions might help overcome these barriers.\n\nReferences:\n\nCheck out all of Vox’s Earth Month podcasts.\n\nThis is Nigeria’s national climate action plan.\n\nReuters reports on how Nigeria’s minister of environment said the country must be ready for oil’s decline.\n\nScience magazine explains how fighting poverty makes it harder to fight climate change.\n\nOlúfẹ́mi Táíwò wrote about the African case for carbon capture for Africa Is A Country.\n\nZack read from this smart paper on home energy needs in Nigeria.\n\nLearn about the problem with “degrowth.”\n\nSupport Worldly by making a financial contribution to Vox! bit.ly/givepodcasts\nLearn more about your ad choices.
