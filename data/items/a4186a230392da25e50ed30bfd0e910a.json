We’ve updated it with new details, music, and our beloved ArtCurious theme— and, per your suggestion, we have split it into two parts for easier listening.

This so-called \"tortured genius,\" it is said, was so broken down by life and failure that he had no choice but to end his life. Right? But in 2011, two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors published a book titled Van Gogh: The Life that stunned the art world. Therein, Gregory White Smith and Stephen Naifeh state that the artist didn't actually commit suicide.\nNo, they say: he was actually murdered.\n \nPlease  SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts!\n\nTwitter / Facebook/ Instagram\n\n \nSPONSORS:\n\nThe Great Courses Plus —for a free 30-day trial\nCare/Of — Use promo code “ARTCURIOUS50” for 50% off your first month’s purchase\nCuriosity Stream — Use promo code “ARTCURIOUS” for your free 30-day trial\nSimpleHealth —Use promo code “ARTCURIOUS” for your first prescription free\nShout-out to Art and Object\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
