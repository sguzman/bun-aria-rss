  "description": "<p>Minifan Justin Durand flew from Tampa to Boston in the middle of a pandemic, abandoning his wife and children, for a chance to co-host the Kirk Minihane Show. The results? Electric. Steve Robinson is back in the producer's booth after a week in quarantine. Intern Justin is fired and rehired. Blind Mike joins by phone to tease some hot new stocks. Kirk weighs in on the Craig Carton v. WEEI feud (0:39:30). Plus, with Warner Brothers sending blockbusters direct to streaming, movie studios are going to have to rethink their business models (0:49:25). Happy Birthday, Larry!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
