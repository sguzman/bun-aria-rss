  "description": "<p>In mid-June of 2017, 36-year-old Antonio Vela spent an evening hanging out at a local bar in Victoria, Texas. He left right before closing and told the bartender that he planned to grab some food and head home for the night. Hours later, Antonio’s roommate woke up and was getting ready for the day when he decided to take the trash out. He exited the home through the garage, where he found a strange scene. Antonio’s car wasn’t there, but his snacks and phone were lying on the ground. That was when he realized that Antonio wasn’t home and that something wasn’t right. Antonio’s roommate started calling around and asking on social media if anyone had seen him. As Antonio’s family learned he was missing, they began frantically searching for him. More than four and a half years have passed, and they are still searching for answers.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Antonio Vela Jr., who also goes by TJ or Speshul Ed, please contact the Victoria Police Department at 361-485-3700 or Crimestoppers at (361) 572-4200.</p><p>To find Claudia Rivero's coverage of Antonio's case, please check out her <a href=\"https://www.claudiariverotv.com/cases/what-happened-to-antonio-vela-jr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A7PRls5qgeY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive Market</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>thrivemarket.com/VANISHED</strong></a>.
