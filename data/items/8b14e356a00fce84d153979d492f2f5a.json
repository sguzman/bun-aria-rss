  "description": "<p>Chico Bean is one of the funniest people on the planet. He has been a star cast member of Wild ‘N Out and is 1/3 of the hottest comedy crew The 85 South Show. Although he’s a star in entertainment, it wasn’t an easy path to stardom. On episode 97, Chico detailed his journey from the streets of DC to MTV, we talked about the entertainment business, mistakes that performers often make, the business of comedy, his thoughts on the Nick Cannon situation with Wild ‘N Out and more. He even turned the interview into an impromptu comedy session. #chicobean #85southshow #wildnout EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com EYL University 40% off Annual Tuition Code: Summer Guest IG: @chicobean --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
