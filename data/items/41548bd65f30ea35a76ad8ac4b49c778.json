  "title": "Dua Lipa’s Disco Fever",
  "description": "Dua Lipa remembers the disco era in her hit “Don’t Start Now.” What may sound like just another dance floor track, upon deeper listening unfolds as a celebration of the genre. References to Gloria Gaynor, Chic, Giorgio Moroder and The Bee Gees are all waiting here for the curious listener to uncover. But so are the Italian and Daft Punk inspired bass lines. Yet the song is more than just one big disco ball cliché. It is brilliantly written too. We asked our listeners to help us highlight the best moments of the song as this is a song that continues to sound anew upon each playback. In 2020, the influence of Disco is still very much alive and Dua Lip’s “Don’t Start Now,” written with Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and Ian Kirkpatrick, is a shining example of a great contemporary disco track. \nSongs Discussed\n\nDua Lipa - Don’t Start Now\n\nGloria Gaynor - I Will Survive\n\nChic - Good Times\n\nGiorgio Mordoer - Baby Blue\n\nThe Bee Gees - You Should Be Dancing\n\nThe Michael Zager Band - Let’s All Chant\n\nMFSP - TSOP\n\nTodd Terje - Strandbar Piano\n\nFred Falke and Alan Brav - Intro\n\nDaft Punk - Voyager\n\nRyan Paris - Dolce Vita\n\nMadison Avenue - Don’t Call Me Baby\n\nMarvin Gaye - Got To Give It Up\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
