  "description": "<p>Have you found your creative well has run dry of inspiration? Especially recently? This week we have two projects to share with you which will help inspire and re-invigorate your art.</p>\n<p>The 100-day project was started by the designer Michael Beirut and has since become an annual free global art project for creatives. Just pick an action, do it consistently for 100 days and share it. Today we meet Lindsay Thomson who has been involved in co-ordinating the project since 2017</p>\n<p>We talk through some tips on how to pick your project - maybe choosing one of the three key areas projects often cover: play, practice or produce. We also discuss how specific to make it, how figuring out your motivation can really help, what your starting point might be, and how to find time. <br>\n<br>\nThe project kicks off on 31st Jan and runs until May 10th.</p>\n<p><strong>What to do now:</strong></p>\n<p>1.
