He is a columnist for The Daily Beast and is a frequent commentator on NPR and MSNBC. In his 'other' career, Jay is an affiliated assistant professor at Chicago Theological Seminary, teaches meditation in Jewish and Theravadan Buddhist lineages, and holds nondenominational rabbinic ordination. And for a decade, he was a professional LGBT activist. Michaelson also holds the special title of Chief Editor in Wisdom Content on the 10% Happier app. Our conversation touches many topics from the overlap of politics and spirituality, to the usefulness of meditation as the parent of a toddler.\n***Please vote for your favorite Health & Wellness podcast in the 23rd Annual Webby Awards.
