The event was held on Friday, Oct. 21 as part of the 2022 Mark S. Cady Day of Public Service.\n\nThe rule of law is the bedrock of American rights and libertiesâ€”in times of calm and unrest alike. The following leaders discussed how everyone can share in the responsibility to help advance the rule of law: Hon. Henry Hamilton III, ISBA President and federal administrative law judge; Emily Chafa, ISBA Diversity & Inclusiveness Committee Chair; and Melvin Shaw, ISBA Vice President.",
