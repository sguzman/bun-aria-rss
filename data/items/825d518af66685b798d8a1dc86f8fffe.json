  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! My new newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory is just a couple weeks away... And to start off today's episode, I need to clear up some confusion. Listeners will hear all about my special offer, how to sign up, and a general description of what the newsletters entails. And as you'll hear, there's more to it than just stock picks... Moving on, today's main segment covers one of the most hated stocks on Wall Street - Target (TGT). All the analyst are negative... the price is sitting at multi-year lows... and the retail sector is spiraling downwards. I always advise my listeners to \"never catch a falling knife\" but for Target, this isn't the case anymore. Tune in as I explain why the risk/reward looks favorable. There are 3 major catalysts that I believe will finally drive this depressed stock higher. Thanks for listening and good investing! Frank Curzio",
