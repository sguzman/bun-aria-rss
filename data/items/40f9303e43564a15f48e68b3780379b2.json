  "description": "<p>Modernism Week in Palm Springs is no weekend tabletop show at the Elks lodge. It takes a huge village, a rather attractive Modernist village with perfect weather, to create an event that sells over 120,000 tickets across 11 days in February. There are hundreds of volunteers, and the week after it closes down, they start planning for the next year.  <strong>George Smart</strong> talks some of the people who make it happen – Modernism Week board members <strong>Maureen Erbe, Anne Rowe,</strong> and <strong>Alan Hess</strong>, plus <strong>Janice Lyle</strong>, the director of the Sunnylands complex, one of Modernism week’s partners and most popular tours.</p>",
