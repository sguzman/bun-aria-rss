  "description": "<p>The access to activity of subcortical structures offers unique opportunity\nfor building intention dependent brain-computer interfaces, renders abundant\noptions for exploring a broad range of cognitive phenomena in the realm of\naffective neuroscience including complex decision making processes and the\neternal free-will dilemma and facilitates diagnostics of a range of\nneurological deceases. So far this was possible only using bulky, expensive and\nimmobile fMRI equipment. Here we present an interpretable domain grounded\nsolution to recover the activity of several subcortical regions from the\nmultichannel EEG data and demonstrate up to 60% correlation between the actual\nsubcortical blood oxygenation level dependent sBOLD signal and its EEG-derived\ntwin. Then, using the novel and theoretically justified weight interpretation\nmethodology we recover individual spatial and time-frequency patterns of scalp\nEEG predictive of the hemodynamic signal in the subcortical nuclei. The\ndescribed results not only pave the road towards wearable subcortical activity\nscanners but also showcase an automatic knowledge discovery process facilitated\nby deep learning technology in combination with an interpretable domain\nconstrained architecture and the appropriate downstream task.\n</p>",
