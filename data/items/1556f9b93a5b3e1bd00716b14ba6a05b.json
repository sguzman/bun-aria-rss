  "title": "Loose Representation & Disrupted Realism with Gabriel Lipper [109]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we are joined by representational painter Gabriel Lipper who has been painting professionally for over 20 years and teaching for more than 15 years. In this conversation, we discuss Gabe's transition from classical figurative work to a much looser style that brings in elements of abstraction and he shares his reasoning for making this move. During our chat, we learn about Gabe's passion for daily drawing an, his desire to portray the beauty of our world, and his commitment to sharing more of himself in his work. (We also discover that Alice has an aversion to the word \"sketch!\") Gabe is about to teach his \"Learning to See\" course, which ran for the first time last year, and we discuss both the course content and his experience of teaching it.
