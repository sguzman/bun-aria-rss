  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image: Part Three - Saved, Continued. </strong></em>This episode, we continue the conversation on what being \"Saved\" means, as we dive into Ephesians 2:8-10:<strong> </strong>\"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been<strong> saved, </strong>through<strong> faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\" Today, we park in Romans for a bit to pick apart salvific language. What are we saved to? How does restoration play in? How do we image creation back to God, rather than image God to creation?</p>\n<p>We also respond to a listener email and to a question on criticism of mission's trips from last episode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to&nbsp;hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=\"https://voxologypodcast.com/\">Voxology Podcast</a></p>\n<p>Subscribe on <a href=\"https://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\">iTunes</a> or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2Mvxz3OQDSkEpHujXiFkkr?si=KJoEXxxxTsqE-HiGL-PfIA\">Spotify</a></p>\n<p>Support the Voxology Podcast on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/voxology\">Patreon</a></p>\n<p>The <strong>Voxology Spotify channel</strong> can be found here: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/nj2l08pd1zt6zk3azs1plhmdy?si=3fb86269da0449ed\">Voxology Radio</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram: @voxologypodcast and \"like\" us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/voxologypodcast\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p>Follow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre</p>\n<p>Music in this episode by <a href=\"https://www.timothyjohnstafford.com/\">Timothy John Stafford</a></p>\n<p>Instagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy</p>\n",
