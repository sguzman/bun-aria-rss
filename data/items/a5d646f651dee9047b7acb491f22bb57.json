What do we make of it? After Jamey and Heath give their thoughts on the Super Bowl, they'll tell you the second half performances they buy (8:33) and the ones they sell (12:45).

At WR (29:30), we discuss Robert Woods, Marvin Jones and a couple of Steelers ... Are Fantasy managers buying into what Logan Thomas did in his last 6 games (39:00)? He was really good! ...
