  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today's guest is Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors. If there’s anyone that knows the global economy, it's Frank. To begin the episode, Frank talks about the reality of deregulation. As we all know, the Trump administration has promised massive tax reforms. But Frank argues that these reforms are going to take much longer than what has been initially anticipated. As Frank says, it’s time investors realize Trumps pro-business reforms will “take twice as long… cost twice as much… and will make everyone half as happy.” In addition, Frank explains his bullish stance on the mining, materials, and energy sectors. According to Frank, the recent cutbacks in supply for several commodities will soon lead to large increases in price. Changing topics, Frank then gives his outlook for the airline industry. Two years ago Frank’s company, US Global Investors, launched what’s now known as the #1 airlines ETF in the world (JETS). And his timing couldn’t of been better… Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, as of last week, is now investing $8M into the airliner industry. This is the same industry he called a “death trap for investors” just 5 years ago. As Frank explains, a lot has changed since then.  Following decades of mergers, bankruptcies, and other disruptions, this sector is finally finding some stability. And current valuations are low – trading at 12 times earnings. Tune in as Frank makes his case for the finest pure-play airliner investment in this rejuvenated sector. Then, to close up the interview, Frank discusses “smart data.” And his methodologies behind emerging market investments in countries like China, India, and Argentina. These are places where so many investors have been burnt – yet where Frank has found so much success. Although there is still money to make in America, Frank shows us little-known ways to diversify our portfolios overseas. Also, I'll be covering this week's interesting short report on Northern Dynasty (NAK). I've been getting tons of questions. And I hope this segment clears up all the confusion. This is one of the most corrupt occurrences in the financial industry... and it's completely legal! Before Frank Holmes signs on - I'll be highlighting the several blatant lies made in this report.   ",
