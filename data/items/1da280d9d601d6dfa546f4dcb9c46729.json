  "description": "Today I will be reviewing 'Start Now, Get Perfect Later' by Robert Moore. Why do we delay what is best for us or that we know we need to do? Procrastination and perfectionism are usually two barriers that many people have to overcome and this book gives steps on how we can all overcome these. Moore explains through the 4 D's, Delegate, Delete, Delay and Do, that tasks can and should be organised to fit into these categories. Creating leverage lists rather than to do lists also puts pressure on the individual to do what is best at that moment rather than what is easy to do. We all know what we need to do but create environments where we are not held accountable for our actions. This book gives the reader the tools to act when falling short of their goals to proceed to action, but there are no revolutionary concepts in this book. It only inspires us to action, which is enough in itself.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
