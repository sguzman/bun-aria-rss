  "description": "A giant otherworldly monster that shoots fire from its mouth. The treacherous chief that killed his father. A super-smart fish dinner. These are just some of the things that Finn MacCool has to deal with as we wrap up the first part of his story and see how he comes to terms with his father's complicated legacy. The creature is the best at what it does, and what it does isn't very nice. Because it involves sneaking into your house at night and stalking you with its beady little insect eyes and razor-sharp claws. --- Sponsors: Tor Books: Check out \"Shroud of Eternity\" by Terry Goodkind, book two of the Nicci Chronicles wherever books are sold!
