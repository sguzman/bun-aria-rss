Traditionally, we view aging as an inevitable consequence that happens to our bodies as we get older. We think that as we gain more years of life, it is a given that we begin to slow down, become less agile, lose our memories, and gain more chronic diseases. We define these things as “aging” when they’re actually signs of dis-ease that can be prevented and often even reversed.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode of my new MasterClass series, I am interviewed by my good friend and podcast host, Dhru Purohit, about creating vibrant, optimal health, to feel younger at any age. We discuss the latest science on whole-body health and longevity and share simple, accessible tips that you can use right now to start feeling younger at any age.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry.
