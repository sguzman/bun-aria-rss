Researchers show you can hack an airliner's avionics. The maritime shipping sector worries that Maerk's experience with NotPetya isn't just a one-off. Ether—the cryptocurrency—is disappearing into the aether (at least this once). Justin Harvey from Accenture on the importance of not failing the basics. Guest is David Barzilai from Karamba Security on the security of embedded systems in automated cars. And we congratulate this year's SINET 16.",
