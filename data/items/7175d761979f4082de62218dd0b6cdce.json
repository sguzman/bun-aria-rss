  "description": "Writer Chuck Klosterman is always thinking. That's a good thing because his latest book is called \"What If We're Wrong?\" and you don't want someone who doesn't think raising that question. Marc and Chuck break down the ideas in the book by going all the way back to Chuck's childhood and leading up to present day to find out if things are better or worse now.
