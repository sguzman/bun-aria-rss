  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, OP takes his dog to visit the animal shelter so he can donate some pet supplies. A Karen at the shelter with her son sees OP's dog and just thinks, \"A dog at a shelter? It must be adoptable!\" She demands to be able to adopt OP's dog, despite OP telling her that his dog isn't up for adoption. Eventually, the shelter employee gets involved and has to tell Karen that she can't just adopt any dog she wants. Lady, you can't just try to take someone's dog. Haven't you ever watched John Wick?</p>\n",
