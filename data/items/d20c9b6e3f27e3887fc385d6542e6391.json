One night, Chris and his Hound Wolf squad raid the house, assassinate Mia, and abduct Ethan and Rosemary. Ethan awakens next to the crashed transport truck in which he was riding and discovers a nearby village terrorized by werewolf-like creatures known as Lycans. Ethan is unable to save the remaining villagers and is captured and brought before the village priest Mother Miranda and her lords: Alcina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau, and Karl Heisenberg. Ethan escapes a death trap made by Heisenberg and ventures into Dimitrescu's castle to find Rosemary, with the support of a mysterious local merchant known as the Duke. Ethan eliminates Dimitrescu and her daughters, finding a flask containing Rosemary's head. The Duke explains that Miranda placed Rosemary's body parts in four different flasks for a special rite and that she can be restored if Ethan recovers the other flasks held by the remaining lords.\n_________________________________\n\n\n🛍  STORE  🛍 \n\nAwesome Shirts and Merch Here: https://www.glpstore.shop/ \n\n_________________________________\n\n🎥 MOVIE LIBRARY 🎥\n\nGame Movies in 4K and 2K.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmRMPVtnAKZitfRGmQ2OGYoZ\n\nOur Recent Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmQOpPYEoDelidg4A3SciA-B\n\nA-D Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmRGd0tq8bezyN0QFHHtnoEe\n\nE-K Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmTi2NRYbW8Y8eMdQzxfkOfr\n\nL-R Game Movies \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmSHy85leC3rx5-E8BwpOgZM\n\nS-Z Game Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1cvljv8vQmSdCiQvhet-r0Cj31KdLvE_\n\n_________________________________\n\n📱 SOCIAL MEDIAS 📱\n\n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@glplayground\n► DISCORD: https://discord.gg/heZNbvGEvb\n► Facebook: http://facebook.com/gLpLayground\n► Twitter: http://twitter.com/GLP_Mike\n► Instagram: http://instagram.com/GLP_Mike\n► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mysterymrr/\n► Outro Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2OhfdEDZ3k\n\n_________________________________\n\n📋 HASHTAGS 📋\n\n#residentevilvillage #residentevil8gold #fullwalkthrough",
