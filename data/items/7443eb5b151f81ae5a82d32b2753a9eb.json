  "description": "<p>The (pre)multisymplectic geometry of the De Donder--Weyl formalism for field\ntheories is further developed for a variety of field theories including a\nscalar field theory from the canonical Klein-Gordon action, the electric and\nmagnetic Carrollian scalar field theories, bosonic string theory from the\nNambu-Goto action, and $2+1$ gravity as a Chern-Simons theory. The Lagrangians\nfor the scalar field theories and for $2+1$ Chern-Simons gravity are found to\nbe singular in the De Donder--Weyl sense while the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian is\nfound to be regular. Furthermore, the constraint structure of the\npremultisymplectic phase spaces of singular field theories is explained and\napplied to these theories. Finally, it is studied how symmetries are developed\non the multisymplectic phase spaces in the presence of constraints.\n</p>",
