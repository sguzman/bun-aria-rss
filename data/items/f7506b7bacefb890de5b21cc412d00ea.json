It is also the root cause of why so many of us are sick. We become stuck in a vicious cycle of cravings; eating sugary foods that spike our blood sugar, thereby lighting up our brain’s pleasure center. This triggers more cravings, and we become powerless against our brain’s hardwired response to seek pleasure. It’s no wonder so many people feel trapped!</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, we revisit Dr. Hyman’s conversation with actors Keegan Allen and Tom Hopper in which they discuss how they broke free from sugar addiction by becoming their own advocates, reading food labels, and choosing real, whole foods.</p><br><p>Keegan Allen is an American actor, musician, photographer, and author. He’s known for his main role as Toby Cavanaugh on the Freeform series Pretty Little Liars.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Tom Hopper is an English actor. He has appeared as Sir Percival in Merlin, Billy Bones in Black Sails, Dickon Tarly in Game of Thrones, and Luther Hargreeves in Netflix’s new show The Umbrella Academy.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Starseed.
