  "description": "Diane Schuler. July 26, 2009. Mount Pleasant, New York. The 2009 Taconic State Parkway crash resulted in eight deaths and three injuries. Half of those who died were young children. At the center of the mystery is a woman who was a successful executive and responsible mother. When toxicology reports indicate that she was driving with a blood alcohol level of 2.5 times the legal limit, many who knew her could not accept the lab results. They rarely saw her drink. They spoke about her character and her devotion to her family. Could she have been a closet alcoholic? Witnesses stated that she had been driving a red Ford Windstar aggressively in the ninety minutes or so before the crash. Could such a responsible person knowingly put so many others' lives at risk? Is there any possibility that a medical issue was behind this? Justin & Aaron discuss the possible scenarios that led to the fatal collision that occurred in 2009 as well as what happened later to those left behind after the deaths of their loved ones.  \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
