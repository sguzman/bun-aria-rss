So the minimum entry requirement is already very high.  But in addition to having to learn 5-10 technologies, this creates another challenge, which is you can‚Äôt just learn them in isolation, but you have to know how to combine them too, how to integrate them together to build those processes.\n\nAnd it doesn‚Äôt stop there. To add to this challenge, the DevOps space is developing really fast and we see new technologies, new concepts emerging all the time, so many engineers feel the pressure to learn new tools to use in their projects. So how can you keep an overview and not get too overwhelmed by these, but at the same time still stay up-to-date and know when a new tool comes up that can actually make your work easier, more efficient, or help you and your team in your software development and deployment process.\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ T I M E S T A M P S ‚è∞  ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n0:00 - Intro - Why it's overwhelming\n01:24 - DevOps ecosystem - Separate Concepts and Tools\n03:32 - How to actually learn?\n       04:01 - Use Cases - What problems the DevOps tool solves?\n       05:31 - How does the tool work?\n       06:10 - Hands-On Practice with a realistic use case\n09:20 - Patience while learning\n10:20 - Embrace lifelong learning\n10:58 - How to stay up to date?\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨  L I N K S  üîó‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \nSign up to get notified about new upcoming courses    ‚ñ∫  https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/course-roadmap\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Want to learn more? üöÄ  ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \nFull Python course                                            ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  ‚ñ∫  https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2W9UEq6\n\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ Connect with me üëã   ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \nINSTAGRAM             ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/32UVSZP\nDEV                            ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/3h2fqiO",
