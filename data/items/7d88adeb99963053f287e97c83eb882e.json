  "description": "<p>It is anticipated that the gravitational radiation detected in future\ngravitational wave (GW) detectors from binary neutron star (NS) mergers can\nprobe the high-density equation of state (EOS). We perform the first\nsimulations of binary NS mergers which adopt various parametrizations of the\nquark-hadron crossover (QHC) EOS. These are constructed from combinations of a\nhadronic EOS ($n_{b} &lt; 2~n_0$) and a quark-matter EOS ($n_{b} &gt; 5~n_0$), where\n$n_{b}$ and $n_0$ are the baryon number density and the nuclear saturation\ndensity, respectively. At the crossover densities ($2~ n_0 &lt; n_{b} &lt; 5~ n_0$)\nthe QHC EOSs continuously soften, while remaining stiffer than hadronic and\nfirst-order phase transition EOSs, achieving the stiffness of strongly\ncorrelated quark matter. This enhanced stiffness leads to significantly longer\nlifetimes of the postmerger NS than that for a pure hadronic EOS. We find a\ndual nature of these EOSs such that their maximum chirp GW frequencies\n$f_{max}$ fall into the category of a soft EOS while the dominant peak\nfrequencies ($f_{peak}$) of the postmerger stage fall in between that of a soft\nand stiff hadronic EOS. An observation of this kind of dual nature in the\ncharacteristic GW frequencies will provide crucial evidence for the existence\nof strongly interacting quark matter at the crossover densities for QCD.\n</p>",
