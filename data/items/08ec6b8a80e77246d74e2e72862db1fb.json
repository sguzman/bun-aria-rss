  "description": "Thomas Merton once wrote, \"Man is not at peace with his fellow man because he is not at peace with himself. And he is not at peace with himself because he is not at peace with God.\" Only when we are in communion with God will we be in communion with ourselves and our fellowman. This simple formula summarizes Israel's mission of gathering all peoples in right praise to God on Mt. Zion. Although the world is divided in countless ways, Israel's gathering mission is realistic because Christ, the Messiah, is Lord, and all things will be gathered in himself. For this we wait in joyful hope.",
