    "media:description": "When learning to program, one of the first advanced projects you'll get is a networking project. You may even have this in your classes right now where you need to send data from a client to a server and vice versa. This isn't an easy task for a new programmer, and while you should definitely learn the C networking API for Linux or Windows, there's an easier way to do this.\n\nZeroMQ or ZMQ is a message queue library that provides an abstraction over the socket API to make networking easier in C, as well as many other languages. In this video, we go over a basic implementation of the ZMQ library, using a request response schema for a basic networking application.\n\nZMQ API: http://api.zeromq.org/\n\n🏫 COURSES 🏫\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-101-for-aspiring-embedded-developers\n\n🔥🔥🔥 SOCIALS 🔥🔥🔥\nLow Level Merch!: https://www.linktr.ee/lowlevellearning\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lowlevellearni1\nFollow me on Twitch: https://twitch.tv/lowlevellearning\nJoin me on Discord!: https://discord.gg/gZhRXDdBYY",
