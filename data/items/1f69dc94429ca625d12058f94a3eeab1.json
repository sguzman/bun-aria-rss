You'll hear about Brent's family \"borrowing\" raccoon hounds, and we'll introduce a new character into the Render who's a Navy pilot who once stiff-armed Clay on a podcast partnership. Mainly, you'll hear the guys discuss episode 9 of the Bear Grease Podcast called \"Moonshine, NASCAR and Bear Hunting.\" The episode is high energy and continues to deliver an unplugged, engaging version of Bear Grease.
