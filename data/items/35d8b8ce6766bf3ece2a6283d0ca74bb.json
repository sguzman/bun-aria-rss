Although the long days might leave a wife stuck in cycles of comparison with other families and even anger, God hasn't left her without hope and help. In this episode, Emily interviews Laura, who shares a bit of her experience as a mom whose husband works long hours. Whether your own husband just misses the occasional dinner, or travels for months at time, you're not going to want to miss the wisdom she shares! The gospel turns \"fairness\" on its head, and offers wives a better way forward - where her husband (or his job) isn't the enemy, and all her needs are met in Christ.</p> <p>Articles & Resources:</p> <ul> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_33717\"><a href= \"http://www.oaklandavenueblog.com/2014/03/let-your-husband-be-best-dad-he-can-be.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href= \"http://www.oaklandavenueblog.com/2014/03/let-your-husband-be-best-dad-he-can-be.html\"> Let Your Husband Be The Best Dad He Can Be</a> - Laura Wifler </li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_36954\"><a href= \"http://www.oaklandavenueblog.com/2014/01/motherhood-is-lonely.html#more\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href= \"http://www.oaklandavenueblog.com/2014/01/motherhood-is-lonely.html#more\"> Motherhood Is Lonely</a> - Laura Wifler</li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_37935\"><a href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/articles/30-day-husband-encouragement-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/articles/30-day-husband-encouragement-challenge/\"> 30 Day Husband Encouragement Challenge</a> - Revive Our Hearts</li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_38979\"><a href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/articles/31-days-of-praying-for-your-husband/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/articles/31-days-of-praying-for-your-husband/\"> 31 Days of Praying For Your Husband</a> - Revive Our Hearts</li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_35366\"><a href= \"http://jessconnell.com/scraps/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://jessconnell.com/scraps/\">Scraps</a> - Jess Connell</li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_36150\"><a href= \"http://jessconnell.com/do-him-good/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://jessconnell.com/do-him-good/\">Do Him Good</a> - Jess Connell</li> <li>Trusting God To Work Through Your Husband - Revive Our Hearts</li> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1493726114256_34631\"><a href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/true-woman/blog/10-things-your-husband-hates/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href= \"https://www.reviveourhearts.com/true-woman/blog/10-things-your-husband-hates/\"> 10 Ways You Might be Disrespecting Your Husband</a> - Kimberly Wagner (many examples that Laura gave on the show regarding lessons she's learned about approaching her husband graciously)</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2pDVmfD\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://amzn.to/2pDVmfD\">The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment With the Wisdom of God</a> - Tim Keller w/Kathy Keller </li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2qo2opq\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://amzn.to/2qo2opq\">1 Peter: A Living Hope in Christ</a> - Jen Wilkin (a great bible study to help you process identity in Christ and how that impacts your relationship w/your husband and others)</li> <li>Verses Laura has memorized / used to remind her of truth in hard moments (ESV):</li> </ul> <p><strong>-- Proverbs 16:24</strong> Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.</p> <p><strong>-- Proverbs 31: 10-12</strong> An excellent wife who can find?
