    "media:description": "Laws, Light Years, and the Universe in 1741.5MB.\n\nThe Solar System is mysterious, there's no getting around that. It's a collection of trillions of balls of stuff that don't seem to have a reason to exist all circling around a giant cloud of pure, bubbling heat energy. But while we still know a lot about the planets and their moons, all our forays into the final edges of the Solar System have told us is that there's much, much, more we don't know.\n\nIn this video I begin with a short discussion of what space even is, how we define it according to modern law, and how we study it, before delving into its more *mysterious* aspects.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic Credits:\n\nInspired by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired/\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWind Of The Rainforest Preview by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5729-wind-of-the-rainforest-preview\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWholesome by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5050-wholesome\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThe Forest and the Trees by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4494-the-forest-and-the-trees\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nMusic: https://www.purple-planet.com\n\nhttp://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImage Credits:\n\n1) McNaught: fir0002  flagstaffotos [at] gmail.com\n2) Canon 20D + Canon 17-40mm f/4 L, GFDL 1.2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/fdl-1.2.html), via Wikimedia Commons\n3) ESO/K.
