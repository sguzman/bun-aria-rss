Bert went to ye olde sex shoppe in Austin and brought back a bunch of toys for the bears to try out and review! Pumps, plugs, and mold of Christy Mack! Do we need to get Christy's permission to use it? Lets reach out either way! Bert realizes that him and Tom live VERY different lives on the road. We try and figure out how Bert is still alive and if a perspective adjustment is in order. We get into all the insecurities that come with being a comedian and how some people handle them. We then get back into ladies that worked in the adult industry for a couple months that blew up from that. The bears share the difficulties doing improv podcasts and radio appearances.</p>\n",
