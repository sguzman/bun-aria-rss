  "description": "<p>HOW THE WORD IS PASSED is one of our most anticipated books for June 2021 — it’s a powerful portrait of America today, built from our history and Clint Smith’s incredible insight. Writer for @TheAtlantic, teacher and Doctor, Clint Smith is also a poet (Counting Descent) and the host of @thecrashcourse Black American History. Our interview with Clint runs a little longer than usual because there’s so much shared ground to cover.<br /> Featured books: How the Word is Passed by Clint Smith, Long Division by Kiese Laymon, The Other Black Girl by Zakiya Dalila Harris, and The Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw. Hosted and produced by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. </p>",
