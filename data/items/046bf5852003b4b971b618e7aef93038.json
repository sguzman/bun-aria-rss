  "description": "<p>This season we’re looking back at the rise of America’s first influencer. How did the wild child, hard-partying heiress who was “famous for being famous” end up netting more than $300 million on her own? In this episode, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree—and that tree is Big Kathy, Paris’ grandmother, who ends up pregnant but refuses to give up her dream of being famous.&nbsp;Her mantra?&nbsp;“Marry rich and have lots of babies.”&nbsp;All her efforts pay off with the arrival of her granddaughter Star, better known by the name that made her famous -- Paris Hilton. We’ll dig into the fascinating story of how a woman with stars in her eyes and an iron will helped create the 2000s scene queen people loved to hate, but couldn’t get enough of… for good reason. Paris Hilton is hot.&nbsp;</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+. Join Wondery+ for exclusives, binges, early access, and ad free listening.
