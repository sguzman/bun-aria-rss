  "description": "On Fridays Mark Levin Show, all Haitian migrants that had crossed illegally into the U.S, have vanished from the international bridge. Of the 30,000 migrants, more than 12,000 of them were released into cities across our nation. This administration is lying and constantly creating a state of tumult so that they can step in and save the day with big government programs. Yet the media will have you focus on a couple of horses. Then, Democrats are happy to diminish law enforcement agencies like NYPD, Minneapolis Police, and now the U.S Border Patrol but they never criticize the Capitol Police or the FBI. Without any investigation completed as of yet, President Biden says that the horse-mounted border agents will pay. Later, PJ media is reporting that the Arizona audit of the 2020 general election shows discrepancies that leave room for potential fraud. There were 42,727 impacted ballots ranked as “high” or “critical” severity—that’s four times the certified margin of victory. Afterward, why do we care about the wealthy? The left calls whatever amount they determine to be one's 'fair share.' Joe Biden didn't pay his fair share. The redistribution of wealth is going directly to Biden's base in many respects. Biden's federal plan to ‘fundamentally change’ the economy is taking away aspects of what individuals have earned and created, their labor, through confiscatory taxes - this is an attack on your liberty as the central government seeks to control more of your life.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
