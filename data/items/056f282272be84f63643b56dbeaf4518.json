  "title": "Episode 216: Getting Kids in the Kitchen",
  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway chats with authors Ramin Ganeshram and Sarah Elton about sustainable, fresh cooking directed at kids and cooking from scratch. Ramin’s book, “FutureChefs: Recipes by Tomorrow’s Cooks Across the Nation and the World,” is a collection of 150 recipes drawn from the experience and kitchens of young cooks all over America. The book brings real, cooking-obsessed tweens and teens to the page as relatable characters who span a diverse social and cultural experience. Sarah’s, “Consumed: Food for a Finite Planet,” points out that many have lost touch with the soilâ€”few of us know where our food comes from, let alone how to grow itâ€”and we are at the mercy of multinational corporations who control the crops and give little thought to the damage their methods are inflicting on the planet. Our very future is at risk, and the group discusses how the upcoming generations of kids are the key to turning this all around. Tune in to hear the authors’ accounts of getting kids involved in improving food systems around the world.
