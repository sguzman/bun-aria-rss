    "media:description": "The most publicized wrestling rivalry of all time, Andy Kaufman vs Jerry “The King” Lawler, left many wondering where the line between reality and fantasy blurred. Wrestling Historian & Personality Jim Cornette takes us through it all, from Kaufman demanding that women get “back in the kitchen”, Kaufman's public demise at the hands of Foxy, Lawler’s illegal piledriver move that sends Kaufman to the hospital, and coffee thrown across the desk of David Letterman. This abridged tour of the biggest public farce of all time will leave you with a new understanding of the *real* meaning of wrestling.\n\nFrom Executive Producers Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Dany Garcia, and the creators of the groundbreaking DARK SIDE OF THE RING comes the exhilarating new series TALES FROM THE TERRITORIES that reunites iconic, larger-than-life wrestling legends as they relive their most outrageous, jaw-dropping, unbelievable-but-100%-true stories from inside and outside of the squared circle.
