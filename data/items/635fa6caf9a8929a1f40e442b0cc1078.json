  "description": "<p>After a great run, American Innovations has come to an end. But there's another place you can follow Steven's work: he's now the host of the podcast The TED Interview, from the TED Audio Collective. Here's an episode we thought you'd enjoy. Before labor unions fought for them, society didn’t have weekends as we know them. In the 13th century, the average male peasants in the UK only worked 135 days a year. In a post-pandemic and increasingly virtual world, what is the future of labor? Juliet Schor is an economist and sociologist whose research focuses on work and consumer society. In this episode, she shares her thoughts on modern working practices and how her current research on the four-day work week could help address society’s major problems–from burnout at work, to the effects of work on the climate crisis. Juliet also highlights the fascinating ways we have and might continue to reconfigure business in the 21st century, especially as it pertains to the dynamic–and at times predatory–sharing economy. To listen to more episodes from their recent mini-seasons on the future of work and the future of intelligence, follow The TED Interview wherever you're listening to this.&nbsp;</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
