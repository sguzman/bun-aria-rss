  "description": "<p>Our mini series on the great sport of Curling continues as we speak to one of the Olympic pioneers in the sport, the Silver medalist Skip for Team Canada in Nagano, Mike Harris. Mike tells us all about competing in the sport in it's inaugural games, and how late in the qualification process the hope of competing in the Olympics actually felt real to him. Mike also tells us the story about how sick he was during the Semi Finals and the Gold medal game, and how that effected their performance. We also cover how training and conditioning in the sport has changed over the years. Mike also carries us through his transition into broadcasting and how he's kept on the front lines of Curling for the last 20 years.</p>",
