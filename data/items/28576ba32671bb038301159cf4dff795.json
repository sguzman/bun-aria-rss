I'm vegan, because the science led me to where I am today.” [11:42]   “with every single dietary choice, we are contributing to the balance that exists within our microbiome.” [18:33]   “our fiber deficiency is causing us to suffer consequences because our gut microbes are not being fed.” [24:56]   “...the microbiome changes in less than 24 hours, whatever dietary choice you make. So literally, the food that you're eating today will have an effect on your microbiome tomorrow.” [37:04]   “If you are suffering from trauma, and abuse history, whether it was physical, sexual, emotional, psychological. If you don't directly address that issue, you will not heal your microbiome. The stress that is driven by that underlying trauma history is an open wound that persists, and it festers until it is addressed.” [41:30]   Follow Dr. Will Bulsiewicz: Website: <a href=\"https://theplantfedgut.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://theplantfedgut.com/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theguthealthmd/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/theguthealthmd/</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theguthealthmd/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/theguthealthmd/</a>",
