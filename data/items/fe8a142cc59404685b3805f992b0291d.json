  "description": "<p>The average Rayleigh capillary breakup length of a cylindrical Newtonian\nviscous liquid jet moving with homogeneous velocity $\\hat{U}$ (negligible\nexternal forces) must be determined by the selection of normal modes with\ntime-independent amplitude and wavelength (invariant modes, IMs). Both positive\nand negative group velocity IMs exist in ample ranges of the parameter domain\n(Weber and Ohnesorge numbers), which explains (i) the average breakup length\nindependence on ambient conditions (long-term resonance), and (ii) its\nproportionality to the inverse of the spatial growth rate of the dominant\npositive group velocity IM. Published experimental results since Grace (1965,\nPhD Thesis) confirm our proposal.\n</p>",
