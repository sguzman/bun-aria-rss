  "description": "<p>The studies of the complex molecular lines towards the hot molecular cores at\nmillimeter and submillimeter wavelengths provide instructive knowledge about\nthe chemical complexity in the interstellar medium (ISM). We presented the\ndetection of the rotational emission lines of the complex nitrogen-bearing\nmolecule ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN) towards the hot molecular core\nG10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band\n4 observations. The estimated column density of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN towards\nG10.47+0.03 was (9.5$\\pm$0.1)$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with the rotational\ntemperature of 223.8$\\pm$4.3 K. The estimated fractional abundance of\nC$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 was\n1.90$\\times$10$^{-8}$. We observed that the estimated fractional abundance of\nC$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN is nearly similar to the simulated abundance of\nC$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN which was predicted by the three-phase warm-up model from\nGarrod (2013). We also discuss the possible formation mechanism of\nC$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN towards the hot molecular cores and we claimed the barrierless\nand exothermic radical-radical reaction between CH$_{2}$ and CH$_{2}$CN is\nresponsible for the production of high abundant C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN\n($\\sim$10$^{-8}$) towards G10.47+0.03 during the warm-up phases.\n</p>",
