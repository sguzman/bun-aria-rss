  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump has refined his point that Rep. Ilhan Omar should leave the country if she doesn't like the United States. Congresswomen Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Pressley’s repeated anti-American and anti-Semitic attacks go unchecked by the media. It's likely that Trump has had enough of their disdain for their own country and decided to put them in check, irrespective of style and eloquence, Trump made his point. Then, Omar claims to love America more than naturalized citizens and says she's embarrassed and ashamed to live in this hypocrisy. Her lack of gratitude and appreciation for America is repulsive. It’s no wonder why the media, such as the NY Times, love these provocative Congresswomen and it stems from their abysmal failure to the American people on their coverage of the Holocaust. Later, Pastor John Hagee's comments that America is slipping away from Godliness toward self-dealing and secular humanism, which is contrary to the principles of our founding. Finally, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was accused of racism, was defended by Trump, and fired back labeling him a racist today.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
