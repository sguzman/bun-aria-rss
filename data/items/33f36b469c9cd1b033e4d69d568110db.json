  "description": "<p>Atchison, Kansas is famously known as the birthplace of Amelia Earhart.  It was home to the Kansa tribe before settlement began when the territory opened in the mid 1850s. The Finney family were some early settlers to the town and prominent members of the family would live there all their lives. They built several homes and one of those came to be known as the Sallie House. It gained notoriety in the the 1990s when a couple named Debra and Tony Pickman lived in the house. Hauntings were documented in the house at that time and it has become a well known haunted location to paranormal investigators. The stories that the Pickmans have shared about their former home are horrific and terrifying. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Sallie House. The Moment in Oddity features the mystery of Fort Mountain and This Day in History features the attack on Pearl Harbor. Our location was suggested by listener Mitch Guidry.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-168-sallie-house.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-168-sallie-house.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
