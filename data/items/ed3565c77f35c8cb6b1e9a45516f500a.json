  "description": "<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga reminds us of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, in that it feels unsustainably grand. Its creators have crammed nine films worth of characters, planets, and stories, plus winks at corners of the expanded universe, into one game. A report on crunch at the studio, however, raises serious questions about its leadership's decisions to make the game bigger and bigger and bigger. What does it mean for good games to be made in bad ways? Individual creators have filled Lego Star Wars with charming references, clever stages, and some genuinely funny writing. People clearly cared about their contributions to this project. So, this week, we try to parse our feelings of this complicated game and its creation.</p>\n",
