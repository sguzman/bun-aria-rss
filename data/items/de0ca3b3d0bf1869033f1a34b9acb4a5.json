  "description": "<p>💬 How do we become better learners? &nbsp;It’s a question that we all want the answer to. Becoming better learners means we can acquire skills quicker and put them into practise to gain a competitive advantage. 💯 &nbsp;But what are the key steps in becoming a better learner? 🤔 &nbsp;This is what @velznick explains in this book. 📚 &nbsp;What is evident is that there is a systemised way to improve learning. Rogue memorisation can be effective but most of the time it is ineffective in its ability to get the most out of your learning time. 📚 &nbsp;The book is full of wonderful practical frameworks for the reader to apply and is ideal for students looking to improve their retention. But also for readers looking to get the most out of their reading. 👍📚 &nbsp;Video review will be out soon and also our podcast with @velznick is out later on today! 👍📚 &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.
