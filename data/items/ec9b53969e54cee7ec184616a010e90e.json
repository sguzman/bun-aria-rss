  "description": "While we are making some headway on flattening the curve when it comes to coronavirus in some parts of the US, it is clear the one curve that will not be flattened is the president's learning curve. The timeline of this debacle reveals a resistance to knowledge and an inability to acknowledge much less even learn from mistakes that hasn't wavered. So what do we do? The stakes are too high to wait for a leadership miracle that will never come. We discuss the problem and possible solutions with an extraordinary panel including former Baltimore Commissioner of Public Health, professor and emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen, Atlantic columnist David Frum, Washington Post columnist Max Boot and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and co-editor of Just Security. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
