  "description": "<p>Sound the Icon Alert!!! We don't have one? We gotta get one. IT IS TRULY a glorious day because Garcelle Beauvais is joining Matt & Bowen on Las Culturistas! Look at God! And they're asking the hard questions: did her Spiderman: Homecoming character Doris Toomes survive the snap and the blip? Does she even know what any of that means? The answer might not shock you. What do we need to know regarding the&nbsp;BTS of working with Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Michael Jordan and, yes, Will Smith? And what can we espect to go down on the new season of RHOBH? What goes down in ASPEN?!?!? All this, coming to America (lol) from Haiti and discovering R&B music, the visceral movie star sexuality of Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise, maintaining your \"front row\" relationships, finally *some* Oscars decompressing, and the very REAL&nbsp;camaraderie&nbsp;between the ladies of The Real. Garcelle's memoir Love Me As I Am is out on April 12th, and you'll be better for reading it. We have been touched by greatness!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
