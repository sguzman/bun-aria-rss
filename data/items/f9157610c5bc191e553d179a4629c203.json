  "description": "The Eagles are world champions! As many of you know, I’m a diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan. I had an amazing time at the Super Bowl this year – it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To see a few video highlights from the event, check out our Facebook page here. But I’m back with two great interviews for you today… On this episode, I explain why prudent investors love corrections. The market has seen an intra-year correction (10% pullback from its highs) for 37 straight years. Over 75% of the time, the market ended the year higher. You’ll also hear from two amazing guests: First up… Mike Alkin, Editor of Moneyflow Trader. Mike tells us what he’s seeing in the markets (hint: we have different opinions!)... and explains how to profit from a further pullback in stocks. We also get a sneak peak into Mike’s new podcast… (details below). Then I chat with first-time guest, Gianni Kovacevic – author of My Electrician Drives A Porsche. Gianni is one of the leading authorities on electricity analysis. He drove a Tesla across the U.S. to prove the “technology of the future” is here now. You’ll learn why electricity demand is about to skyrocket all over the globe… and Gianni’s favorite way to profit from this global trend…  Tune in to listen to these all-star analysts. Good investing, Frank Curzio  P.S. Our own Mike Alkin is going to be hosting his own podcast, the \"Mike Alkin Show: Talking Stocks Over a Beer.\" We'll be rolling it out soon, but Mike had something urgent to say… so he couldn't sit on it until then. Stay tuned for his timely pre-episode tomorrow.",
