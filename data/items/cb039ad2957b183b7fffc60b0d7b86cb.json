  "description": "<div>Maggie Freleng is one badass journalist. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and producer, she gravitates toward telling the stories of underdogs – specifically the wrongfully convicted. So, when she heard about the 1999 murder of Yvonne Lane – a young mother from a the small town of Alliance, Ohio – and her ex-boyfriend who was blamed for the crime but had maintained his innocence for over a decade, Maggie started digging. And what she’d learn along the way in this investigation would test her mind, heart, and stamina in ways no one saw coming.<br>\n<br>\nThis episode is part of a ten-part series called<em> Let The Women Do The Work</em>.
