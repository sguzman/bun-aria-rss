  "description": "For four seasons – that’s right, four seasons – we’ve learned histories hidden from us, challenged the systemic structures built to subjugate us, and asked those critical questions that can push us towards Black liberation.\nIn season five, those conversations can’t stop–won’t stop!–as we continue using history building toward liberated Black futures.\nThat’s why we're talking about the exploitative rewritings of our narratives, and asking what's required of us to confront an anti-Black system.\nWe’re digging into the culture, too! Don’t miss talks about our holidays, the digital packaging of Blackness, and the Black horror genre in film, literature, and everyday life.\nWhen it comes to Black liberation, we can’t stop and won’t stop fighting.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
