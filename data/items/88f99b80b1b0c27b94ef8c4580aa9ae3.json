He shares some fantastic behind the scenes stories about the scene when Jim came after him for the money. Robert also talks about his career and how he got the role as the ultimate villain in Terminator 2: Judgement Day.</p><p>   Then Michael and Steve break down this week’s episode which is one of the most fun of the entire series. Michael had a blast working with Sir Ben and Lauren Bacall on this one. BTW it was Michael who punched Lauren Bacall…he wouldn’t let anyone else do that.
