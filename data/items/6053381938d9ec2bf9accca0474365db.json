Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by the hilarious and awesome comedian, writer, actor and podcaster JAMIE LEE!</p><br><p>Brett’s been taking care of business out in LA for a few months, and as such has managed to get some heavyweight podcasts in the armoury as you will have witnessed recently and will witness in the future, and this week it is the turn of the always fantastic Jamie! You may have seen her online, or indeed on TV/film, but if not this is a perfect primer and certainly grounds for making Jamie your new friend. She was recently a major part of the Pete Holmes / Judd Apatow HBO series ‘Crashing’, but have a peep at her IMDB for some further gold nuggets of goodness. Brett has only been working with Jamie for a good 7 weeks, but they are already fast friends which, as discussed, was sped along by seeing each others’ standup sets, so along with a myriad of excellent in depth film picks you can hear all about Jamie’s incredible fantasy death scenario, problematic mermaids and a whole world more.
