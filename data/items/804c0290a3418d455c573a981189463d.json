  "description": "As you know, it’s my mission to help teach you how to build the MINDSET and SKILLS that will help you live an extraordinary life - and over the last few months I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to help create a brand-new tool that will help you do that. It’s called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life.

The good news is that you’re not alone. Right now, even if you’re not watching the news or following every political conversation, you know the tension is there. With everyone, including you walking on eggshells, how do you make good decisions?<br /><br />Chances are you don’t think of your decisions in terms of being ethical or not, but in the grand scheme of life as a citizen of planet Earth, every decision you made so far today has been ethical or unethical. Dr. Susan Liautaud is an Ethics Expert who advises global leaders and international businesses how to develop strategic solutions to the complex ethical challenges they face. In this conversation she and Tom get deep into the weeds of what an ethical framework is, if “Cancel Culture” and the massive division we’re experiencing is ethical, and how you can live your life well and make better ethical decisions.<br /><br />A few key thoughts from Dr. Liautaud to help you live a more ethical life:<br />Instead of canceling people, cancel language and behavior<br />Someone or something is going to be impacted by every decision you make<br />Practice really listening to what people are saying to you<br /><br />We can’t create a perfect life. Dr. Liautaud explains why perfectionism is a dead end path.
