  "description": "Over this past year, the Taliban have broken their promises to allow girls to continue their schooling and women to keep their jobs. Many girls and women are disappearing — arrested for violating the morality code, or abducted and forced to marry one of the Taliban. We talk with British/Iranian journalist Ramita Navai, who went undercover to speak to women who were victimized by the Taliban, and women working underground to help women escape brutality. Her new PBS Frontline documentary is called <em>Afghanistan Undercover</em>. <br/><br/>Also, we talk with Will Bunch, author of <em>After the Ivory Tower Falls</em>, about how college tuition became so expensive, driving students and parents into debt. <br/><br/>Justin Chang reviews the film <em>Ali & Ava</em>.",
