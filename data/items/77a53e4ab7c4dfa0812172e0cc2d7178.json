  "description": "<p>This week we’re discussing the idea of success… what does it mean to be a successful artist and how do you know if you are achieving your goals? Many of us shy away from numbers and spreadsheets, but we both believe it’s vital to track key metrics in order to measure your progress. These metrics change at different stages of our career - in the early stages we can track the numbers that tell us if we are showing up consistently (things like hours spent painting and number of social media posts). Later on, we might be more interested in sales, expenses, web traffic, and social media engagement. But before you can decide what numbers to track, you really need to understand what success looks like for you - everything else flows from that key decision. Are you more interested in selling your work or in living a fulfilling creative life (or both)? Once you know where you are heading, you can determine what to measure.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Abigail Bowen Dark Days <a href=\"http://www.abigailbowen.com/\">http://www.abigailbowen.com/</a></p>\n<p>Hicks Gallery <a href=\"https://www.hicksgallery.co.uk/abigail-bowen-dark-days/\">https://www.hicksgallery.co.uk/abigail-bowen-dark-days/</a></p>\n<p>Jackson Pollock documentary Mural <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY9leqZUMIk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY9leqZUMIk</a></p>\n<p>Yvonne Lyon <a href=\"https://yvonnelyonmusic.com/\">https://yvonnelyonmusic.com/</a></p>\n<p>Susan Hart <a href=\"https://www.susanhartart.com/\">https://www.susanhartart.com/</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
