  "description": "There's lots we don't know about how things are going to shake out in the small constellation of scandals that surround America's president.  But there is one thing that's clear.  The cloud Donald Trump wanted James Comey to help remove is not going away anytime soon.  Does this mean America's president is no longer the most powerful man in the world?  Is Trump the least influential American president since Hoover?  And has Rosa Brooks found a used Canadian missile silo?  Regulars Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Kori Schake of Stanford, and David Sanger of the New York Times are joined by the Financial Times' America columnist Ed Luce and host David Rothkopf in this the third episode of Deep State Radio.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
