  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Mark will be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame and it’s all thanks to you. This program wouldn’t have the ratings it has without Levinites listing on AM, FM, satellite, the Mark Levin app, and podcast. This vote isn’t about Mark but about us, our principles, our values, and our beliefs. Also, President Obama and Jeh Johnson had detention centers and separated children from their illegal alien parents, yet nobody compared them to Hitler like what is being done to President Trump. Johnson has said that we can’t have catch and release, except that is exactly what Democrats want – utter and complete lawlessness. The media never attacked the Obama administration or demanded to see their detention centers, which proves this entire debate is a fraud. Later, driving up the cost of things like steel and aluminum hurts manufacturers, which hurts consumers and everyone else downstream. The price of production goes up, which causes the price of the product to go up, meaning you pay more. This is exactly why tariffs are a bad idea. Finally, San Francisco was once a beautiful city until left wing kooks got a hold of it, and now it’s filled with homeless camps. This is just another example of what happens when progressives have full control.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
