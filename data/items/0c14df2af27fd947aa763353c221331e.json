  "description": "<p>Back-to-school jitters are in the air as many schools across the U.S. welcome students back to in-person learning for the 2021 to 2022 school year. But, after more than a year of pandemic-related disruption and the more recent emergence of the highly infectious delta variant, excitement to get back into the classroom is met by significant concern for student health. Dr. Alok Patel speaks with a leading expert in aerosol transmission of infectious disease, an education researcher and specialist in individualized instructional interventions for students, and a developmental psychobiologist studying stress in young people. They share insights into strategies to reduce viral spread in schools and mitigate the pandemic’s effect on students’ learning, mental health, and overall well being.
