  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery once again is solo for his third installment of the Korean War series. Currently in its 70th Anniversary, the Korean War was only a few weeks old by this point in July of 1950. Things were not going well for United Nations forces on the ground who were fighting against the North Korean People's Army. For the American units arriving on the Korean Peninsula, they were unprepared, poorly trained and ill-equipped for what awaited them. As August loomed closer, the American & South Korean forces had to fight more delaying actions to buy time for a massive defensive line to be set up in the valleys and mountains around the southeastern port city of Pusan (present-day Busan). Avery briefly describes the events that led to the climactic battle at the Pusan Perimeter, and points out some of the more overlooked aspects of that dark summer month of July 1950. Enjoy!</p>",
