  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing a recent comment by Scott Adams before transitioning into a conversation about Adam's 'Crate Training' theory as it applies to America's youth. Adam goes on to recount an interaction he had recently with his kids' school nurse that he believes could get him dubbed 'World's Worst Father'.  As the show wraps up the guys get fired up about some of the ridiculous behavior on display at the Super Bowl where no one, including the Mayor of LA, wore masks despite mandates and pleas from officials. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nCon-Cret.com/podcast\nTrueBill.com/ADS\nMagBreakthrough.com/AdamDrew\nPluto.TV",
