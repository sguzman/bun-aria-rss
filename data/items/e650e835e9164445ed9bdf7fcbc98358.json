  "description": "<p>Discipline is often associated with all kinds of negativity. But, what if I were to tell you that healthy discipline was the key to creating the life of your dreams? Not your ethnic background, not your socioeconomic status, not your sex, not your age, not any of that stuff. Discipline is the key to getting you from where you are to where you want to be.</p> <p>Now, this isn’t just a hypothesis. I’ve got the proof to back it up. In fact, I’ve got the ultimate case study. My guest today is largely considered to be one of the most successful fitness entrepreneurs in the world. And he definitely didn’t have the odds in his favorite when he started out. As you’ll find out today, I think it’s suffice to say that he actually had the odds stacked against him. He found a way to make his mark. And discipline took him from good to great.</p> <p>Bedros Keuilian is the definition of a living legend. But he’ll be the first to tell you that you are here to create your own personal legend.
