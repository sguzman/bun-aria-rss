    "media:description": "There was some mention of applied category theory outside of the recording, interested people might want to look at this book on the topic: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316\nYou can also find lectures that go with this book here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s097-applied-category-theory-january-iap-2019/\n\nIn this video we define what a simplicial object is, and give an important example for algebraic topology. Following this we define co/limits of functors, and see that this encodes some of the universal properties that we discussed in an earlier lecture.\n\nWe wrap up by mentioning categories of categories, and give a definition of comma categories.",
