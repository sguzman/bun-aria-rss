  "description": "<p>Common envelope (CE) evolution, which is crucial in creating short period\nbinaries and associated astrophysical events, can be constrained by reverse\nmodeling of such binaries' formation histories. Through analysis of a sample of\nwell-constrained white dwarf (WD) binaries with low-mass primaries (7 eclipsing\ndouble WDs, 2 non-eclipsing double WDs, 1 WD-brown dwarf), we estimate the CE\nenergy efficiency $\\alpha_{\\rm{CE}}$ needed to unbind the hydrogen envelope. We\nuse grids of He- and CO-core WD models to determine the masses and cooling ages\nthat match each primary WD's radius and temperature. Assuming gravitational\nwave-driven orbital decay, we then calculate the associated ranges in post-CE\norbital period. By mapping WD models to a grid of red giant progenitor stars,\nwe determine the total envelope binding energies and possible orbital periods\nat the point CE evolution is initiated, thereby constraining $\\alpha_{\\rm CE}$.\nAssuming He-core WDs with progenitors of 0.9 - 2.0 $M_\\odot$, we find\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CE} \\! \\sim \\! 0.2-0.4$ is consistent with each system we model.\nSignificantly higher values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{CE}}$ are required for higher mass\nprogenitors and for CO-core WDs, so these scenarios are deemed unlikely. Our\nvalues are mostly consistent with previous studies of post-CE WD binaries, and\nthey suggest a nearly constant and low envelope ejection efficiency for CE\nevents that produce He-core WDs.\n</p>",
