  "title": "How You Can Avoid Asking THIS Question About God | Sadie Robertson Huff + Kathie Lee Gifford",
  "description": "Sadie is delighted to speak with TV talk show veteran, author, and actress Kathie Lee Gifford. Kathie Lee is passionate about what she's learned from so many years in the entertainment industry, how her faith has kept her grounded, and why she considers Hollywood to be her mission field. She shares encouragement for anyone feeling discouraged about unrealized dreams and talks about why asking how a loving God could allow something bad to happen is the wrong question. Plus, for the first time, Sadie gets lost in thought during the interview and it yields an incredible moment of revelation for both women. \n\nhttps://www.audible.com/SADIE — Visit the link OR text SADIE to 500-500.
