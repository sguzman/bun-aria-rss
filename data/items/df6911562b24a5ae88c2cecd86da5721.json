Fundamentally, there&#8217;s a huge part of creativity involved there. And personally I believe the human creativity is almost limitless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I spent a lot of my career building tooling and infrastructure for data scientists and researchers. So while I&#8217;m not a super expert on Api design, I know a few things about building developer tools and thinking in terms of usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Einstein allegedly said something like &#8220;My pencil and I are smarter than I am&#8221;. So computers, and various technologies are only part of a long standing interaction between humans and tools. I&#8217;m fascinated by some of the literature on the effect of the light bulb on human cognition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been recently looking at <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALLE</a> by Open AI and I think the same as Mark here. These tools will unlock a lot of human creativity. One challenge is the question of whether it &#8216;replaces&#8217; human creativity. I&#8217;ve found in the past that a lot of creativity tools need prompts, there&#8217;s something about writers block, or as someone said &#8220;there is nothing scarier than a blank page&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These new AI content creation tools are going to be jetpacks for the mind. Steve Jobs famously called the computer a bicycle for the mind,and it enabled a lot, but this feels like the true next step. <a href=\"https://t.co/6al8hdWf0j\">https://t.co/6al8hdWf0j</a></p>&mdash; Mark Cummins (@mark_cummins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_cummins/status/1512438921627676674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div><figcaption>There are all sorts of questions, about what this will lead to. However, I expect it&#8217;ll be a different set of skills. I repeatedly think about tools as unlocking latent demand, and this is often what tooling excels at. It&#8217;s what I saw with <a href=\"https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/\">PyMC3</a> and what I also think about <a href=\"http://www.api.audio\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"www.api.audio\">Api.audio</a> is unlocking. <br><br>And fundamentally, I think the Steve Jobs quote &#8220;a computer is a bicycle for the mind&#8221; is underappreciated. We see this with the rise of the Creator Economy, and I&#8217;m very excited about the dynamism that this enables both economically and also in terms of creativity. <br><br>I love speaking about stuff like this.
