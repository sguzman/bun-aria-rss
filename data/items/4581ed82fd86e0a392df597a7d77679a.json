  "description": "<p>Talk about guns is now shorthand for a certain kind of American: white uneducated racists. But conversations and action around gun control often hurt those most vulnerable, including those who can't count on the police for their own protection because of their race, class, or past interactions. How do we bring sanity to the conversation around guns, and now that militias are cosplaying civil war, some police are on unofficial strike, and violent crime is increasing, is now the time to get a gun? Jessa speaks with Zach Toman who runs the Gun Penguin youtube channel and owns a gun shop in South Carolina about gun culture.</p> <p>Support this podcast: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/publicintellectual\">http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></p> <p>http://jessacrispin.com</p>",
