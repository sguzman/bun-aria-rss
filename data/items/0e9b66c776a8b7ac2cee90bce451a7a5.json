  "description": "<p><p>Blind Mike has finally harpooned his white whale - Mike Francesa - and on an important day for the legendary broadcaster. Kirk Minihane makes a bold statement about who Entercom should choose to replace Francesa when he retires to anonymity on the Radio.com app. Project Veritas releases damning video of host Amy Robach explaining how she had the Jeffery Epstein story nailed three years ago but it was spiked by corporate. Obviously, little Alex Jones has some theories. The Boston Globe's Renee Graham wrote a column that caught Minihane's eye. And neither Shirley Leung nor Bob Murchison have responded to our peaceful overtures. A parody song threatens to begin a new era of the Kirk Minihane Show.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
