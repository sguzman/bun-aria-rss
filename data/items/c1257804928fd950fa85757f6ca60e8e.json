  "description": "<p>Today’s show is all about exploring sexual attraction; what it means and how does it fit into romantic love. By the end of today’s episode, you’ll better understand how and why YOU may feel sexually attracted to another person and how that can sometimes be distinct from feelings associated with long-term love. Plus, I take your questions! What to do when you’re straight, but kinda wanna hook up in a non-straight way, what to do when you and your partner are both submissive (and both crave dominance), how to bring back the spark, and when you should hang onto a friend with quality benefits – and, when to let them go.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/sex-drugs-and-the-side-effects-of-birth-control-with-ricki-lake-and-abby-epstein/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sex, Drugs and The Side Effects of Birth Control w/ Ricki Lake & Abby Epstein</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sexandpsychology.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">For More Studies From Justin Lehmiller </a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
