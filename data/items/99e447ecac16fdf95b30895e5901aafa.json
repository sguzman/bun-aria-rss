You'll probably know Jessi best from Overhaulin', Mythbusters and All Girls Garage but she came in to school us on chasing speed records at Bonneville in turbine powered batshit fueled \"cars\" that are way faster than anything you've ever driven. In addition we talk a bit about fabrication, her time working with Chip Foose and Chris Jacobs and possibly most impressive of all her win at King of Hammers. All of that plus the usual idiocy you've come to know us for.</p>\n",
