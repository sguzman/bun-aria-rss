  "description": "<p>So much crazy in one episode. In 1692, the residents of Salem Village became obsessed with the idea that the Devil himself was in their midst and that he was being helped by an army of witches looking to bring down all of New England. A special court was created to bring these witches to justice, and residents were hanged because another resident claimed they saw them doing witch stuff in a dream. A dream!! So nuts and one of my favorite, if not my very favorite, episode of Timesuck so far. Enjoy! </p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
