  "description": "Today we’ll be talking about The Magic of Math (Basic Books, 2015)by Arthur Benjamin. This is a book that has the gee-whiz feeling you got when you first encountered George Gamow’s classic One, Two, Three … Infinity, but brought up to date and with much more in the way of solid mathematics that students can actually use. What makes this book especially appealing is that Benjamin emphasizes the magic that can be found in the mathematics that students study as they proceed through elementary and secondary schools. Students study arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, but too often the way these courses are taught resembles hospital food – nourishing but tasteless. Every teacher should have a copy of The Magic of Math to help combat the blandness and boredom that students too often experience in the classroom.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
