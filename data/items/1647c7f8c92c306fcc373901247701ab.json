  "description": "Hello, everybody! I'm Jane Coaston, senior politics reporter at Vox with a focus on conservatism.\nToday, I'm speaking with Conor Friedersdorf, a staff writer for the Atlantic, who has been navigating the fractious divides within the conservative movement since long before 2016.\nFriedersdorf is extremely hard to pin down. His intellectual hero is Friedrich Hayek and he believes the Supreme Court “ought to thwart the will of democratic and legislative majorities.” He’s also staunchly anti-war, an outspoken critic of police brutality, and has even occasionally praised Bernie Sanders.\nThis is what makes Friedersdorf so interesting to talk to: He doesn't fall neatly along partisan lines. We discuss a lot here: the importance of police reform; the way the term “racism” is used and misused in American politics; the future of the GOP; and what it means to be politically homeless in Trump's America.\nReferences:\n\n\"A question for conservatives: what if the left was right on race?\" by Jane Coaston, Vox\n\"What Ails the Right Isn’t (Just) Racism\" by Conor Friedersdorf, the Atlantic\nBook recommendations:\n\nThe Authoritarian Dynamic by Karen Stenner\nKindly Inquisitors by Jonathan Rauch\nThe Constitution of Liberty by Friedrich A.
