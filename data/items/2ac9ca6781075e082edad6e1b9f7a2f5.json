  "description": "<div>24-year-old Lindsay Buziak loved her job as a Vancouver Island real estate agent and was looking forward to carving an impressive career for herself. So in early 2008, she was eager to please when she received a phone call from a woman who had recently relocated to the area and wanted Lindsay’s help in finding a one million dollar property that was available immediately. <br>\n<br>\nOn February 2, Lindsay organised to meet the woman and her husband at a house in the suburb of Saanich. She was a little sceptical as to why the couple had sought her help in particular and as a safety precaution, she asked her boyfriend Jason Zailo to wait in his car outside. It turned out that Lindsay was right to be concerned.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-28-lindsay-buziak/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-28-lindsay-buziak\">casefilepodcast.com/case-28-lindsay-buziak</a><br>\n</strong></a><br>\n\n</div>\n",
