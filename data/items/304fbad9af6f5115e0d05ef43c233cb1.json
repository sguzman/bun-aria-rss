  "description": "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is under fire from the race-focused Left for once again snubbing performers of color in the Oscar nominations. But in the Academy’s defense, there will at least be more black candidates in the running at the Oscars than there will be at tonight’s all-white Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa. We will examine the incoherence and hypocrisy of racial identity politics. Then, Bernie Sanders says a woman can’t win in 2020, according to a new report from CNN and the Warren camp. We will revel in the circular firing squad.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
