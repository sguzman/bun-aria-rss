    "media:description": "In an exclusive interview with Daniela Cambone, billionaire philanthropist, Frank Giustra lays out his thesis for the global monetary reset already underway. We're at the beginning of a currency war, \"and I'm absolutely certain we're heading into a global monetary system reset,\" warns Frank Giustra, CEO of the Fiore Group. He tells Daniela Cambone, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, \"have made it very clear they want an alternative to the U.S. dollar,\" after being held hostage by the currency for so long. Predicting that the dollar will lose its status as the world's reserve currency, Giustra says China will be victorious in its efforts to solidify a new central bank currency backed by gold. \"Everybody, and I mean everybody, should own physical gold,\" he says when asked about the increasing privacy issues posed by technology. \"I think the pivot is around the corner, the [Fed's] math doesn't make any sense,\" claims Giustra when asked about the rate-hike cycle currently underway for the central bank. \"The Fed is trying to talk inflation and something is going to break, they've ruined the American dollar,\" he concludes.\n\n#gold #digitaldollar #thegreatreset\n\n⭐️ Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  https://danielacambone.com\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research\n\nChapters: \n\n00:00 Italy’s new government's stance towards euro\n4:21 The future of the euro system\n5:31 Are we in a currency war?\n9:00 Gold as the world’s dominant reserves\n10:04 The future of de-dollarization\n12:46 Gold’s future position in the new monetary system\n17:54 Why hasn’t the price of gold depressed?\n20:14 Why should investors allocate to gold?\n22:00 Is this a reset for gold?\n23:35 Cryptocurrencies as a digital currency\n24:59 Privacy and digital currency\n27:15 Should miners hold physical gold?\n29:16 Bitcoin’s price fall\n30:12 How long can the Fed keep raising interest rates?\n32:05 Can the U.S. still remain the world's leading superpower?\n32:32 Frank’s interest in olive oil\n33:49 Frank’s early experience with gold\n35:07 Can America’s economy be saved?\n41:03 Will blockchain solve the world’s problems?\n41:55 Frank’s success story\n43:35 Frank sharing life wisdom\n45:19 A tour of Frank’s olive oil factory",
