  "description": "The National Report Card came out Monday and paints the broadest picture of student achievement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report finds children have suffered record declines in the past few years. Head of the National Center for Education Statistics Dr. Peggy Carr joins us. Then, we reflect on what the U.S. can learn from the Cuban Missile Crisis, 60 years later. As the war in Ukraine weathers on and North Korea threatens missile usage, tensions are heightened yet again. Senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Security Studies Program Jim Walsh joins us. And, it's Black In Physics week and NASA scientist K. Renee Horton is carving out a space for Black and disabled people in STEM fields. Horton herself experiences hearing loss and will soon embark on a special flight with other people with disabilities. She joins us to talk about her career and advocacy work. ",
