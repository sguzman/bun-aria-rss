  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything from week 16 of the NFL season as a few more teams clinched playoff berths, which teams are starting to look like the real contenders, who we should be worried about, Aaron Rodgers setting the franchise record for touchdown passes against the Browns on Christmas Day (ensuring a SuperBoost win), the Chiefs turning things on, if the Steelers are dead, the Colts looking like an absolute wagon, and much more. Joining the show with Pat and AJ Hawk is ESPN NFL Analyst, 12 Year NFL Quarterback, and friend of the program, Dan Orlovsky. Pat, Dan, and AJ chat about some of his early season predictions coming to fruition, which rookie QB's he likes after almost a whole season, which teams he thinks are poised to make a run, if the Cardinals are dead, and everything else happening around the league (45:47-1:22:00). Later, joining the show as he does every overreaction Monday, 9 Year NFL veteran at Defensive Back, host of the Man-To-Man podcast, friend of the program, Darius Butler. Pat, Darius, and AJ Hawk chat about his biggest takeaways from the weekend, if he believes in the Rams, why Rasul Douglas is such a monster for the Packers, if the Cowboys can win a Super Bowl, and much more (1:52:22-2:07:01).
