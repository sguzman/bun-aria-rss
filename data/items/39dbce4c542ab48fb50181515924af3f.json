  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the reporting on the Trump campaign's legal challenges is just as bad as the reporting on the Russia hoax. CNN and MSNBC don't care about the facts at all. America deserves better. There are two types of challenges being brought: Constitutional challenges citing the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause as referenced by SCOTUS in Bush v. Gore; if there's disparate treatment of votes it's unfair. Period. Plus, there are Article II challenges with respect to who has the authority to make election laws. This can have an effect on results states across the country. Secondly, there are fraud allegations and the quantity of fraud is not the test. The Trump team has multiple affidavits and there isn't even another case in history that even comes close to having this many sworn affidavits. The mere fact of fraud lends itself to voter disenfranchisement and the Court can create a remedy to address that. Then, Sen. Tom Cotton calls in to highlight the importance of truth in American history, unlike the revisionist charlatans who wrote the 1619 Project. Cotton also pointed out how dangerous consent decrees are to the republic. Afterward, President Trump defied the odds, while not only following the science on coronavirus but making strides in science with Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the China virus vaccine creation and distribution.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
