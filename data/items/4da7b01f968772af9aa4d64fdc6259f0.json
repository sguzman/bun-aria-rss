  "description": "Andy Cohen’s tipsy rant about NYC’s mayor must have distracted CNN producers on New Year’s Eve, when several Twitter pranksters managed to get their NSFW usernames displayed on screen. Elsewhere, more details are coming to light about why the former president stayed silent for over three hours as a mob of his supporters ransacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, makes a special visit to the show to talk Omicron, the science behind the CDC’s updated guidance for isolating after a Covid-19 infection, and responds to a recent comment by Dr. Anthony Fauci who suggested Americans may soon be able to test out of isolation after 5 days. And the star of the hit CBS comedy, “Ghosts,” Utkarsh Ambudkar tells Stephen about his role on the show and then treats our host to a freestyle rap about our host’s favorite topic, the “Lord of the Rings” films. Catch Utkarsh every Thursday in “Ghosts” on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
