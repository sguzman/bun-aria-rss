  "title": "PMS 2.0 159 - A Tribute To Kobe Bryant, A Deep Convo About The GOAT.. Also, Brian Westbrook Stops By For Football Chatter",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat reflects on what Kobe Bryant meant to him as the world tries to come to grips with Kobe and his daughter Gianna's death in a tragic helicopter crash on Sunday in Calabasas, California. Pat recounts some of his favorite on court moments from Kobe's career, looks at how his impact transcended basketball and he became a global icon, and looks at the mark Kobe made on current players and coaches careers, as we celebrate the life of one of the greatest basketball players of all-time, who perhaps had his greatest chapter of life ahead of him, and is gone too soon in a day the world will never forget. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, Brian Westbrook joins the show. Brian chats about the Donovan McNabb/TO beef and gives his thoughts on the whole situation, breaks down what it's like to play in Andy Reid's offense and discusses the complexities within it, and dives into what he expects to see from both the Chiefs and 49ers as we gear up for Super Bowl LIV (53:49-1:05:54). Cherish each moment, and remember which things are most precious in life, because tomorrow is never guaranteed. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
