Joining the show is the face of college football, one of the smoothest guys around, friend of the program, Kirk Herbstreit. Pat and Kirk discuss the current state of college football and if he thinks there is anyway teams from the Big Ten will play any type of college football this year, if he's okay with the protocols given that his sons both attend Clemson, why he isn't optimistic that there will be college football at all, and Kirk breaks a little NFL news as well (1:01-20:34).
