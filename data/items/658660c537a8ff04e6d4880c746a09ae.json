  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nMirasia and Kuya Neil talk through the cross over of influences that led them to collaborating, the practice of sampling and how that impacts genre, and their involvement in community music groups such as The House of Silky and Sound School.\n\nExploring the depths between music, dance and community, Mirasia is well regarded as an artist and community leader. Kuya Neil is a heavyweight of Melbourne’s underground hip-hop scene who’s production style blurs the lines of contemporary club and electronic music.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/rp-boo-mirasia-b2b-kuya-neil\n\nRitual Community Music\n03 June 2022\nMiscellania, Melbourne\nPresented by Soft Centre and Liquid Architecture\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
