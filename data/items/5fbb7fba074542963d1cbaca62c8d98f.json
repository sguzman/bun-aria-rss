  "description": "Heath made a trade, and we get to review it! He tells us why he sold high on Aaron Jones and bought low on Cooper Kupp. Then we discuss some potential second half breakouts (10:40) like D.J. Moore and maybe even Joe Mixon ... News and notes (21:50) and a Saquon Barkley vs. Melvin Gordon debate (23:45). And we once again go over players with great upcoming/playoff schedules (30:05). James Conner is set up for a big finish, Nick Foles is interesting and there is a TE who may be available on waivers that could be very productive ... We read your Apple Podcast questions (37:23) and preview PIT-CLE (40:22). Some very tough WR decisions in this game! And when we're done with that we play some Fantasy Jeopardy (49:10) and answer a bunch of your tweets (56:40) ...
