This week, Marissa Martinelli and Heather Schwedel discuss Emma. Though certainly not the first adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel, director Autumn de Wilde’s film humanizes the familiar characters and departs at times from the source material to bring a certain freshness to this comedy. Will Emma’s meddling still result in matchmaking errors? How far does she have to go to right her wrongs? And what’s with the inopportune nosebleed?\n\nYou can read Marissa Martinelli’s review here.\n\nNote: As the title indicates, spoilers galore.\n\nEmail us at spoilers@slate.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
