  "description": "In today's podcast we continue to follow the developing story of the Democratic National Committee hack (Russia denies responsibility, but CrowdStrike stands by its attribution). DNC chair Wasserman Schultz says no financial information was lost, and on cue Guccifer 2.0 produces some. The FBI continues its probe of possible ISIS connections to the Orlando killings. Researchers describe an approach to developing intelligence from social media. FireEye is said to be uninterested in being acquired. Tanium's not interested, either. Some serious bugs are addressed this week. Dale Drew from Level 3 compares honey pots to live data and Craig Smith from Open Garages takes us on the road to car hacking.",
