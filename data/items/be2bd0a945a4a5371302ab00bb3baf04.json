Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by the amazing writer, podcaster and Empire journalist HAYLEY CAMPBELL!</p><br><p>A blissful celebration of cinema and death, and immaculately timed too as Hayley is - at the time of podcasting - writing a book about death AND has had written several powerfully interesting articles about all manner of mortality related subjects. She writes for Empire Magazine too so basically Hayley is the perfect guest for Films To Be Buried With! Enjoy the overflowing awesomeness as the two get down to this whole life and death and film business, getting started on her reasons for not actually going into film production itself (fully understandable and surely infinitely relatable reasons!), her graphic novelist father Eddie Campbell and how he would incorporate her in his own novels from birth to present day (and the ensuing weirdness this brings from some fans), how the book she’s writing about death is slowly messing her up, cremation alternatives and how one can turn one’s self into a bag of white powder after death, Stallone porn and hating your own interests! Oh it’s great, just dive in and enjoy will ya? And of course - be excellent to each other.</p><br><p>–––––&nbsp;–––––&nbsp;–––––</p><br><p><strong><em>LINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:</em></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hayleycampbell\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HAYLEY CAMPBELL on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.hayleycampbell.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HAYLEY on THE INTERNET!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05wxg9q/episodes/downloads\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'UNPOPPED' podcast!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
