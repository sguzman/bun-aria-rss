  "description": "<p>Our guest today, Brandon Copeland is an NFL player, but he’s also so much more than that. He most recently played for our local team, the Atlanta Falcons, last season but he’s won the Alan Page award for community service and we find his off-the-field activities even more fascinating. He runs a non-profit football camp called Beyond the Basics that not only teaches kids the technical skills of being a great football player, but also helps them to reach their full potential off of the field as well. He has a financial literacy course called Life 101 that he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. He has a couple of real estate companies that he runs with his wife as well- it’s safe to say that Brandon is truly an entrepreneur! We talk about personal finances in the NFL, resisting the cultural pull to consume, setting our kids up for success, and much more in today’s episode.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Want more How To Money in your life?
