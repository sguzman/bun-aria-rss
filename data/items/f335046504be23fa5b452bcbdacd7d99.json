  "description": "<p>Justin Aversano is the now-famous photographer behind the NFT project Twin Flames, but that doesn’t even begin to cover it. Starting with his birthday project titled Every Day is a Gift, Justin has relentlessly pursued his creative passions, backed by his own personal journey of grief, healing, and growth.</p> <p>Justin has a unique, powerful, and intense story—the grief of his mother passing from cancer and the trauma of losing a twin in the womb inspired a years-long quest for discovery and healing.</p> <p>You can feel the creativity and emotion in his work, and his Twin Flames project has seen tremendous success in both the physical and digital realm. Describing NFTs as the Digital Twin of the Physical Reality, the cohesion of his work and individuality surface as we explore why art matters, and what drives the creative mind.</p> <p>-----<br /> 📣 METAMASK | YOUR HARDWARE WALLET'S BEST FRIEND<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/metamask-shows\">https://bankless.cc/metamask-shows</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>💰 GEMINI | FIAT & CRYPTO EXCHANGE<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/go-gemini%E2%80%8B\">https://bankless.cc/go-gemini​</a> </p> <p>💧LIDO | DECENTRALIZED STAKING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Lido\">https://bankless.cc/Lido</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE | LEND & BORROW ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Justin on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/justinaversano?s=20\">https://twitter.com/justinaversano?s=20</a> </p> <p>Justin’s Website:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.justinaversano.com/\">https://www.justinaversano.com/</a> </p> <p>Quantum Art Discord:<br /> <a href= \"https://discord.com/invite/quantum-art\">https://discord.com/invite/quantum-art</a> </p> <p>SaveArtSpace:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/saveartspace?s=20\">https://twitter.com/saveartspace?s=20</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
