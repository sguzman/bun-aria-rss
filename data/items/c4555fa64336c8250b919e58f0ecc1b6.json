  "description": "<p>The new trailer for season 10 of Real Housewives of New York is so important to us that we decided to devote an entire episode to unpacking it - shot by shot (and sometimes frame by frame). We manage to pull out over an hour of thorough analysis from only two minutes of video - but hey, that's what \"Watch What Crappens\" is all about. Afterwards, we have fun in the Crappens Mailbag where we discuss the musical \"Chicago\" and of course Kitchen-Aid stand mixers. Thanks for listening - please tell your friends, subscribe to the show, and check us out at live at watchwhatcrappens.com<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
