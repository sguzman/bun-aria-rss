  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the impending massacre Monday that was a bit underwhelming but did see some big time players get released, they sift through the weeds of the report that Tom Brady said he was interested in the Buccaneers acquiring Odell Beckham, Pat's incredible weekend gambling on the UFC, Golf, and more, plus everything else that has been going on in the NFL as we approach free agency. Joining the show is current Head Basketball Coach for the West Virginia Mountaineers, one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all-time, a man on the precipice of 900 career wins, Bob Huggins. Pat and Coach Huggins chat about his career up to this point, what he likes about this year's team, coaching and recruiting during the pandemic, and why he's meant to be coaching at West Virginia (55:22-1:21:17). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about the current landscape of the NFL, if it's going to be Russell Wilson or Pete Carroll who is done in Seattle first, Shinigami's fight this weekend, and the people who have to come and speak in front of and NFL locker room (1:22:40-1:50:28).
