It was important that we learn to do it, but it&#039;s not necessarily helping us now.\n \tThe problem is it was laid down in our bodies so early and really without conscious thought, so even just thinking about it doesn&#039;t necessarily change it. Instead, we adapt to it, repress it, etc.\n \tThis leads to a cycle of recognizing something, acknowledging that it isn’t working, and then repeating the behavior, which is induces shame.\n\nRelief and Frustration\nThese behaviors are implicit (unconscious) not explicit (conscious), which makes them really hard to change.\nThe Process:\n\n \t Community connection\n \t Trying to teach ourselves to do something new\n \t Picking one thing, not everything, with love, compassion, and curiosity\n \t Examine the symptom or behavior that is no longer serving us\n \t Just learning about it and becoming more aware\n \tNot trying to repress or change it\n \tTry something new and continue to learn\n \t Are we resistant to changing? Reluctant to give up the old behavior? Etc\n\nAdjusting the Emotional Health Goal\nSue discusses the zig-zag process of scaling her goal up and down based on her exploration process and how her thoughts about it changed after attending a conference with Bruce Eckert on Memory Reconsolidation. \nTwo Particularly Helpful Takeaways From the Conference\n\n \tWe can’t know our unconscious\n \tSue tests out whether or not The Memory Reconsolidation Technique is something we can do alone\n \tBecause the behavior is implicit, it comes from the unconscious, so there is no way to see it by ourselves.\n \tBut we can still move it by being curious about our responses and what comes up in the feelings of threat.\n \tSeeing the effects of the implicit coming out in our explicit reactions and working to get more comfortable with it invites it in more.\n \tState Dependent Learning\n \tWhen we&#039;re in a regulated state, we have access to all this great knowledge and learned information.\n \tAs we get into a dysregulated state, the neural network shifts and it becomes a different learning. We really actually kind of lose contact for a moment with that more reflective stance. Especially if we come from a neglect or a trauma background or had tough things in life or had adversity.\n \tWe have these learnings that are on their own neural network.\n\nNeural Networks and Changing Symptomatic Behavior\n\n \tThere are 2 different neural circuits, and the only way to change the symptomatic behavior is to access the other neural circuit.\n \tThis has to do with activation, so we have to actually feel the feelings to improve emotional health.\n\nHow Do We know What’s Changing?\n\n \tIt starts with the behavior starts with the symptom. In recognizing the symptom that you want to shift, you&#039;ve gone much more internal and you&#039;ve named one part of it.\n \tIn exploring it, we are un-layering it, and we’re smack dab on our which is to to go deeper and shift to more of a sense of security inside of you.\n\nWho doesn’t love special offers? Discounted course – It’s Not Me It’s My Amygdala!
