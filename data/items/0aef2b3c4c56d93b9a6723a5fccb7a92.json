  "description": "<p>Some things <em>sound</em> really good... until they aren&rsquo;t. Like when your kids say they&rsquo;re going to spend all of their money at the candy store and how they&rsquo;re going to eat ice cream every night of the week. Sure that sounds tempting now, but the reality isn&rsquo;t quite as rosy. As you grow older you realize that there are constraints that prevent you from a diet like that- namely the health issues that would arise! We think that something similar is happening to the Financial Independence Retire Early movement. An idea that sounds really compelling when the market is kicking butt doesn&rsquo;t feel the same once a bear market has ravaged those early retirement portfolios. Not to mention that with inflation on the rise, your dollars aren&rsquo;t getting you quite as far as they used to! So we offer a few alternatives to those who are striving after early retirement, how we would recommend that you think about your work and career, and then we highlight why we think the FIRE movement still has its merits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Just a Kiss by The Bruery!
