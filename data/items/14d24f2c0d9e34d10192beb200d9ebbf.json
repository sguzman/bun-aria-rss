The whole course is done <em>online</em>, coding and all, using DataCamp‚Äôs interactive course interface (like Rstudio, but in the browser) and, while you need a DataCamp subscription to do the full course, you can <em>do the first part for free</em> by just signing into DataCamp! If you feel that‚Äôs too much of a commitment you have the first two videos in the course right here: </p>\n\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Olz1dJM3uLE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></center>\n\n<p>Please try it out and let me know what you think! </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-to-go-after-the-course\">Where to go after the course?</h3>\n\n<p>As always I recomend either of the following two excelent introductions to Bayesia data analysis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1482253445/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sumsarnet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1482253445&linkId=72b763f899422ed939d39d8c5d08a57d\"><em>Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan</em> by Richard McElreath </a></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0124058884/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0124058884&linkCode=as2&tag=sumsarnet-20&linkId=a0241b5529f6736dd6ac5d4e5b5708be\"><em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em> by John Kruschke</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My DataCamp course roughly covers chapters 1-3 in <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> so you‚Äôll already have a headstart on that one.</p>\n\n</body></html>\n"
