  "description": "<p>The fun-o-meter in photography can be quite the rollercoaster. When you buy your first camera, its up high, when you take your first photo with the new camera, its down low, when you pre visualize your shots, its up high, when you look at the photo its low again. Learning your camera settings is important and once you do, if you dont push yourself to keep learning your progress will stall and thats no fun. This week I share 5 ways to introduce more fun with your photography.</p><p><b>1: No Social Media</b></p><p>Social media can be a great source of inspiration if youre looking for it but more often than not its where we see other photographers work and feel like we dont measure up. Getting off social media for a few weeks will help open up the creative side of your brain.</p><p><b>2: Remove all Controls</b></p><p>Use a GoPro or just your phones camera to go out and shoot but dont look through the screen. Look at the world with your eyes and try to place the camera where it needs to be to capture it. This exercise becomes stronger as it forces you to audit your own photos from a critical perspective.</p><p><b>3: Destroy your Photos</b></p><p>As photographers we tend to treat our photos like gold. To really break out of a rut we need to accept that our photos always have room for improvement and not to take them too seriously. I like to shoot in black and white and color on my photos using the ProCreate iPad app. This also helps me to see hidden compositions of color within the frame what I might not have seen naturally.</p><p><figure data-trix-attachment='{\"contentType\":\"image\",\"height\":1000,\"url\":\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/569aeb57fd5d084e149e5469/1635195309476-O94YS2K3KY1XVD7NPATO/IMG_0085.JPG?format=1500w\",\"width\":1500}' data-trix-content-type='image' class='attachment attachment--preview'><img src='https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/569aeb57fd5d084e149e5469/1635195309476-O94YS2K3KY1XVD7NPATO/IMG_0085.JPG?format=1500w' width='1500' height='1000'/><figcaption class='attachment__caption'></figcaption></figure></p><p><b>4: Print your Photos</b></p><p>Printing your photos can make a huge impact on how you shoot.
