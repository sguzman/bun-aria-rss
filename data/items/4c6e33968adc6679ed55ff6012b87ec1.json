  "title": "5 Ways To Prepare For A Marriage and Not Just a Wedding (Even If You’re Married)",
  "description": "<p>Wedding season has officially begun! I’ve been invited to four weddings in the last three weeks and my social media channels have been flooded with all wedding pictures. Weddings mark the beginning of your relationship but it’s very easy to get caught up in all the festivities and forget to focus on your actual marriage. The truth is, we all want to have a marriage more beautiful than our wedding, but our investment is in the wrong place. Remember this: it's better to have a small wedding and a big marriage, than a big wedding and a small marriage. On this episode of On Purpose, I give you 5 ways to prepare for a marriage and not just a wedding, even if you’re already married.</p>\n",
