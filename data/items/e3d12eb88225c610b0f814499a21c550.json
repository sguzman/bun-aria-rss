  "description": "We are so excited to welcome back Erin Gates, of Erin Gates Design, to the show. She joined us for an episode back in 2017 at the beginning of the podcast days! Erin is a true Renaissance woman in the design world. In addition to running her design firm, she has authored two bestselling books, has an extremely popular blog, “Elements of Style”, several product collections, a personal home renovation, and is raising a family! We discuss how to decorate with family in mind without sacrificing style, the resurgence of the home office, and other tips from Erin’s wealth of knowledge.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs about grading the backyard, rodents in the house, and toddler “remodeling”.\n\nHow did Erin make her way into design?\n\nWhat’s next for Erin?\n\nWhat are some misconceptions and tips about decorating with family in mind?\n\nWhich performance fabrics does Erin recommend (and not recommend)?\n\nWhat does Erin look for in rugs?\n\nHow has the pandemic impacted home office design?\n\nWhat are Erin’s best tips for a home office?\n\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Stephanie,\n\nI think with a space like this the most important thing is to create some symmetry so the layout you have is perfect. I would probably do a sectional that has another arm rather than a chaise to get more seating towards the TV. I would also do a 76-80” media console, to not limit your TV size, and hang the TV. Then add a matching pair of taller bookcases on either side. On the taller wall to the left, you could do a really nice symmetrically hung gallery wall or one giant piece of vertical art. You could do anything for a coffee table, but if you wanted to soften up you could try an oval shape. There’s also room to add an accent chair to use when entertaining. You also need some lighting in here! Think all different levels; wall sconces, hanging fixtures, table lamps, floor lamps, etc. We also think you need to pop some color in here! If you really prefer the neutral, definitely use texture and tones to create contrast. Definitely need some window treatments (functional or not) on the sliding doors to soften it up.\n\nLastly, we also noticed that little niche above the doorway. You could totally ignore it, or ideally fill it in with drywall.\n\nGood luck, Stephanie! Thanks for listening and send us the after photos.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nErin Gates Design\nErin Gates on Instagram\n“Elements of Style” Blog\nElements of Style\nElements of Family Style",
