  "description": "<p>I bet you’ve heard of Flat Earthers. But have you heard of… Hollow Earthers?? Variations of Hollow Earth Theory propose that our planet Earth is either entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space. Maybe several spaces. Multiple worlds within worlds. Notably suggested by Edmond Halley in the late 17th century, the notion has been disproved time and time again by, basically, the entire scientific community. But that hasn’t stopped people from continuing to believe in it. Today, we’ll take a look at the mythological origins of the Hollow Earth theory, including many religions’ beliefs that there’s some sort of physically reachable underworld. Then we’ll head to the 16th and 17th centuries when some early scientists - just beginning to explore and understand the cosmos - theorized about the possibility of a Hollow Earth. We’ll touch on some works of subterranean fiction that captivated audiences and fueled hollow earth belief, and we’ll get to know several explorers who were determined to journey to the center of the hollow earth. We’ll even meet a man who started a cult based in part on some very interesting hollow earth beliefs. If the earth IS hollow - what’s inside!?! Cryptids? UFOs? Nazis? Do the inner earth inhabitants ever come to the surface and say hello? So many insane possibilities to go over on today’s wackadoodle-packed, science fiction interpreted-as-truth based, snake and mole people edition… of Timesuck.<br /><br />We donated $7200 to Girls in the Know.  In a world that's hard on women, the mission of Girls in the Know is to empower girls to embrace a strong sense of self.
