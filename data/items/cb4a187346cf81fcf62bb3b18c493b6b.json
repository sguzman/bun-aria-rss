  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Supreme Court has institutionalized chaos and lawlessness. Just forty minutes after the last brief was filed the US Supreme Court denied the Pennsylvania case brought by Representative Mike Kelly and Congressional Candidate Sean Parnell. Similar to Justice Owen Roberts who served during President FDR’s administration, this Supreme Court is fearful of the media chaos. This Court could have stood up before the election compelling states to adhere to state election laws under the state and federal Constitutions. But of course, they did not. The campaign can still make a future request for certiorari. In effect, and as of now, any state supreme court can now legislate from the bench because of their cowardice to uphold the federal constitution. Then, there would be no coronavirus vaccine but for President Trump, operation warp speed and his administration. The nuance of his management style would be the topic of books if he were a Democrat. But the media will do anything to prop up Joe Biden's Administration as it aims to be the most radical leftist government in American history. Later, the Georgia Secretary of State is a coward and has agreed to a deal with Stacy Abrams to significantly weaken the signature requirements that the state's election law calls for. Afterward, China has made inroads with many Democrats. among them Rep. Eric Swalwell and based on a year-long investigation from Axios, Swalwell has some embarrassing spy problems fitting the mold of a useful idiot for China.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
