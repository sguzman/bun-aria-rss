This is the backdrop for Electronic Markets 1.0, when ‘open outcry’ was the norm for the exchange of equities. When internet technology first emerged, it was brought to these markets, such that geographically distinct markets were fused by the instant communication of prices, bids, and offers.</p> <p>New technologies come quickly to the markets, giving an advantage to those who adopt the fastest. Alongside traders and brokers are the technologists, the quants and computer scientists who leveraged their understanding of networks to revolutionize trading. This first wave of electronic markets lasted until the dawn of personal computers, home internet, and E-trade.</p> <p>This second wave further revolutionized modern exchanges, distributing public access while consolidating liquidity. Synergistic with the dot-com boom, this explosion of retail investing once again turned exchanges on their heads. Look around now, and observe that we are in a third wave of new technologies applied to markets: Electronic Markets 3.0. Catalyzed first by mobile phones and now DeFi, the markets have once again been uprooted and fundamentally changed.</p> <p>What does this all mean? Where do we go from here? How do we adjust for scaling complex markets?
