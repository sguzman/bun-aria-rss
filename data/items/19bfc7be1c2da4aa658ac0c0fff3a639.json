  "description": "<p>Susan Block has done everything from organizing orgies to climbing the Golden Gate bridge in the middle of the night. She's an adventurer in many realms, but is most well known for her work in sexuality. She's hosted TV programs on HBO, published books and essays far and wide, is a well-known sex therapist, and puts together one of the most bizzare and interesting parties in Los Angeles every Saturday night in Bonoboville, the former motel she and her husband converted into a suite of offices and studios for her various productions. Our conversation touches on all these things, but we focus mostly on her new book, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bonobo-Way-Evolution-Through-Pleasure/dp/0692323767/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439069684&sr=8-1&keywords=bonobo+way\" target=\"_blank\">The Bonobo Way</a></em>, and the relevance of bonobos to our understanding of human sexuality.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
