  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming several guests to the show tonight who have encountered Sasquatch, including Shawn who writes “Hello Wes, I’ve been very reluctant to share my encounter with people due to the fact that people may think I am lying to them, or looking for attention.</p> <p>After listening to your show every single night for the past year, I still have not heard any encounters quite like mine. I’d rather tell you this over the phone, but I’ll give you a brief summary via email.</p> <p>A few years back, I was living in a rural area called Burnt Ranch, about 22 miles east of Willow Creek CA off of highway 299. The time was about 830 pm give or take a little, the sun was starting to set behind the ridge line. I was driving behind another truck about 6 or 7 miles past Salyer CA headed home on 299 when all of a sudden a huge creature literally jumped from a hillside and landed on the road, the truck in front of me literally slammed on his breaks in attempt to avoid a collision with what I thought was a bear at first glimpse. I also had to slam on my breaks to avoid rear ending the truck in front of me. I had a perfect view of the whole encounter. As the creature landed on the road, I saw it turn its head and looked right at us.</p> <p>This thing reacted so fast, it was so fast….I’ve never seen anything so powerful and agile…anyways, it looked right at us as it landed on the road and at that moment this thing stood up on 2 feet, bent down like a human would who is just about to perform a backflip, and made the most incredible jump into the air, it jumped backwards and stretched its body out in full extension, as it stretched its arms above its head, I could see its whole body in full detail, at this moment I knew I was not looking at a bear...\"</p>",
