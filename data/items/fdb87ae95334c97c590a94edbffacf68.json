  "description": "<p>The Winchester Mystery House or Winchester Mansion is one of the most unique and bizarre homes ever built. The mystery part of the name refers to the interior infrastructure. It truly is a mystery why certain elements were constructed. There are stairways that lead to nowhere, doors that open to walls and windows on the interior of the house. Numerology plays a significant part in the design as well. Legends and rumors permeate the history of the home. Was the weird construction an elaborate attempt to fool spirits to keep them at bay? Many of the rumors about the house include tales of haunting activity. Tours are very popular here and listener Ronda Williams shares her experience with the Flashlight Tour in this episode. Come with us as we explore the mysteries, history and hauntings of the Winchester Mansion. The Moment in Oddity features Scratching Fanny as suggested by Bob Sherfield and This Day in History is Hattie McDaniels Oscar win.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-ep-109-winchester-mystery-house.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-ep-109-winchester-mystery-house.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music used by Kevin MacLeod: \"Smoking Gun\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br /> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>Tour audio featured is from official Lighthouse Tour of the Winchester Mansion.</p>",
