  "description": "<p>Kids these days have it so easy. We live in a world where, with your phone and a ring light, you can start your burgeoning porn empire. Back in my day, I had to walk uphill 3 miles in the snow to take a picture of my cooch. Seattle based comedian Jimmy Sorrentino knows what I'm talking about. In this episode, a 71-year old Jimmy (just kidding) lugs state of the art camera equipment and a willing punk rock goth pixie dream girl to the middle of a cornfield to create some pictures to remember. But a first generation digital camera is the least of their worries, and much like Jimmy's corn field, we're all ears. #Condoms #FloppyDisks #HomemadePorn</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Lovers in the Backseat’ (Scissor Sisters)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>Live Shows are Back! : Our last live/ Livestream Bawdy event was a massive, Sold Out Success - and we only have this gorgeous outdoor Courtyard for two more dates.
