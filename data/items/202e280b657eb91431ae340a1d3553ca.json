  "description": "<p>Readers LOVE Matt Haig's charming, full of heart, and genuinely unputdownable novels The Midnight Library and How to Stop Time and made both of them bestsellers. Like many of us, Matt spent much of 2020 feeling a little anxious, a little frazzled--and looking for comfort, the subject of his latest work, The Book of Comfort. He joins us on the show to talk about hope, change and the importance of weird thinking. Featured books: The Comfort Book, The Midnight Library and Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig, Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke, Winnie the Pooh by A.A. Milne and the 1812 version of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Produced/Hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>",
