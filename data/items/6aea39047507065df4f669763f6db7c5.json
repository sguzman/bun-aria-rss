I remember I hacked the landscape to supercharge it with french startups, and called it <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/kriss/the-number-frenchdata-landscape\">the FrenchData Landscape</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wIRMocftnfpSbkozbqbM9Q.png\" /><figcaption>2014 FrenchData Landscape</figcaption></figure><p>And here comes the 2020 edition, now branded <a href=\"https://mattturck.com/data2020/\"><strong>Data & AI Landscape</strong></a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/709/0*36JtRnmSHa1DOc-y.png\" /><figcaption>2020 Data & AI Landscape</figcaption></figure><p>Quite a crowded one!</p><p>And guess what? <a href=\"https://www.zelros.com/\"><strong>Zelros</strong></a> makes its entry in the Insurance category. I’m very proud to see this logo here — in this landscape that inspired me since almost a decade!</p><p>In 2017, the landscape started to identify groups by industry, showing the beginning of verticalization of AI applications. In particular, a dedicated insurance category appeared, already including the french trailblazer Shift Technology.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GZIKM7XgkJVECoSkcK1_zg.png\" /><figcaption>The landscape insurance category over time</figcaption></figure><p>I’m also glad to see other awesome french data startup enter the landscape this year, like Toucan Toco, Dawex, CybelAngel or Saagie!</p><p>Can’t wait the 2021 edition!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=10b4af352754\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">"
