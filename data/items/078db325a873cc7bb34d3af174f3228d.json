  "description": "<p>No one is as multi-talented and has such a diverse entrepreneurial background as Ty Coy. Ty has had quite the journey and at 26, he has run many businesses and has worn many hats. Ty is the talent behind most of the JZ Styles Co videos and we most recently worked together on The Beauty School Series *launching soon*. We talk about his burning passion to create and his ability to figure anything out. We also talk about his strange link to the Fast & Furious franchise, his love of clothing, and how the man-with-the-plan is planning on winging it when his baby is born! Ty is the CEO of Rogue Film Productions and most recently launched LAKI, a premium activewear company, with his wife! He comes from strong entrepreneurial stock and he's taking us along his journey and talking to us about failure and success and everything in between.</p>",
