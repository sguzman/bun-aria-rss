Then, his fellow leftists turned on him. In his second appearance on the Glenn Beck Podcast, Jamie tells Glenn about how his battle with cancel culture has transformed his life, including about how he discovered spirituality and the kindness of conservatives. And he also discusses the mental health struggles he’s faced — including bouts with depression — why he believes the COVID lockdowns were actually good for him, and the one thing that helped him more than anything.\n\nSponsors:\n\nYou could have a real steakhouse experience in your own home before you know it.
