Of course, <em>who</em> we spend time with evolves throughout our lifetime.</p>\n<p>Using insights from the American Time Use Survey and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our World in Data</a>, we look at who Americans spend the most time with at various ages of their life.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/time-spent-with-relationships-by-age-us\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Adolescence to Adulthood</h2>\n<p>In the average American’s teenage years, they spend most of their time alone and with their family. This makes sense, as the majority of people under 18 still live in a home with their nuclear family unit, meaning parents and siblings. Not surprisingly, adolescence is also when time spent with friends reaches its peak.</p>\n<p>Jumping forward to a person&#8217;s early adulthood, 25-year-olds spend an average of <strong>275 minutes</strong> per day alone, and 199 minutes with coworkers. This aligns with people in their twenties beginning to enter the workforce.</p>\n<p>By age 35, people are still spending the most time with themselves, at <strong>263 minutes</strong> per day. However, time spent combined with children and partners, the runner-ups, adds up to <strong>450 minutes</strong> or around <strong>7.5 hours</strong> a day.</p>\n<p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-1436\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-1436\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Age</th><th class=\"column-2\">Most Time Spent </th><th class=\"column-3\">Second</th><th class=\"column-4\">Third</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">15</td><td class=\"column-2\">Family - 267 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Alone - 193 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Friends -  109 Minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">25</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 275 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Coworkers - 199 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Partner - 121 Minutes </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">35</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 263 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Children - 249 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Partner - 198 Minutes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- #tablepress-1436 from cache --></p>\n<p>Although people are spending more time with kids and partners as they grow older, this trend may shift, as women are having <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/over-a-century-of-global-fertility/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fewer children</a>. More women today are obtaining an education and are entering the workforce, causing them to delay or entirely put off having children.</p>\n<h2>Middle to Old Age</h2>\n<p>Upon turning 45, the average person spends <strong>309 minutes</strong> a day alone, and in second place, <strong>199 minutes</strong> with children. Time with coworkers remains relatively steady throughout someone’s forties, which coincides with the middle of career for most people in the workforce.</p>\n<p>By age 55, time spent alone still takes top spot, but time spent with a partner goes up to <strong>184</strong> minutes, and time with coworkers also moves up, pushing out time spent with children.</p>\n<p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-1437\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-1437\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Age </th><th class=\"column-2\">Most Time Spent</th><th class=\"column-3\">Second</th><th class=\"column-4\">Third</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">45</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 309 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Children - 199 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Partner - 184 Minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">55</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 384 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Partner - 184 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Coworkers - 163 Minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">65</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 444 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Partner - 243 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Family - 65 Minutes </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">75</td><td class=\"column-2\">Alone - 463 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Partner - 253 Minutes</td><td class=\"column-4\">Family - 56 Minutes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- #tablepress-1437 from cache --></p>\n<p>Typically, time spent with children during the mid-fifties tends to see a sharp decline as children enter adulthood and begin to move out or spend more time out of the house.</p>\n<p>Today, more children are staying at home longer or even moving back home. <strong>52%</strong> of adult children in the U.S. today are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/us-young-adults-living-with-their-parents/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">living</a> with their parents.</p>\n<p>As people get closer to old age, around 65-years-old, they spend increasingly less time with coworkers as they begin to retire, and much more time alone or with a spouse. Then, from age 65-75, people consistently spend the most time alone, then with a partner and family.</p>\n<h2>Alone and Lonely?</h2>\n<p>One of the most significant trends on the chart is increased time spent alone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/time-spend-alone-different-ages.jpg\" alt=\"time spent alone by age\" /></p>\n<p>By the time someone reaches 80, their daily minutes alone goes up to <strong>477</strong>. This can be a problematic reality. As the population <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/aging-global-population-problem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continues to age</a> in many countries around the world, more elderly people are left without resources or social connection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while one quarter of elderly Americans <em>live alone</em>, the trend of solo living is going up across nearly every age group, and this trend applies to a number of mature economies around the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/americans-living-alone-by-age.jpg\" alt=\"Chart showing what percentage of Americans live, by age\" /></p>\n<p>A natural conclusion would be that increasing alone time has negative impacts on people, however, being alone does not necessarily equate to loneliness. Our World in Data found that there was <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/loneliness-epidemic#loneliness-trends-over-time-are-people-lonelier-today-than-in-the-past\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no direct correlation</a> between living alone and reported feelings of loneliness.</p>\n<p>One final consideration is the role technology plays in our social interactions. Thanks to smartphones and social platforms, time alone doesn&#8217;t necessarily equal isolation.</p>\n<p>It is not just the amount of time spent with others, but the quality and expectations, that reduce loneliness.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #8FA4A4; background-color: #dadada; padding: 1.2em;\">\n<p><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Source</strong>: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-0319.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American Time Use Survey</a>, accessed on <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Our World in Data</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Notes:</strong> While respondents to the Time Use Survey are tracking their activity, they indicate who was present during each activity recorded.
