  "description": "My friend and colleague Luke Downey—editor of The Big Money Report here at Curzio Research—joins the show to help me make a big announcement... [1:35] But first, Luke shares the story of how he began following the “Big Money”—the growth stock strategy that helped him retire from Wall Street at 31—and what led him to his latest macro prediction… which proved to be spot on. [2:55] It can be hard to commit to buying growth stocks, since they tend to trade at such high valuations… But Luke says you should look past valuations and focus on three other factors instead… [6:20] If you think it takes big money to follow the “Big Money”... think again. Luke gives two examples of how he turned two small positions into massive gains... And shares exactly how he uncovers great ideas like these. [9:05] OK, onto the big announcement… Luke’s new options trading advisory, Big Money Trader, is launching soon. Here’s what subscribers can expect... [15:20] And if you’re not familiar with options, don’t worry: Luke explains why these trades don’t need to be scary. [24:50] Enjoyed this episode?
