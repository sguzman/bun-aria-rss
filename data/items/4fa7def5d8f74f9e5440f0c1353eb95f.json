  "description": "<p>We prove that the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm of the\ncharacteristic polynomial of unitary Brownian motion converge to Gaussian free\nfields on the cylinder, as the matrix dimension goes to infinity. This is the\nnatural dynamical analogue of the result for a fixed time by Hughes, Keating\nand O'Connell [1]. Further it complements a result by Spohn [2] on linear\nstatistics of unitary Brownian motion, and a recent result by Bourgade and\nFalconet [3] connecting the characteristic polynomial of unitary Brownian\nmotion to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. In the course of this\nresearch we also proved a Wick-type identity, which we include in this paper,\nas it might be of independent interest.\n</p>",
