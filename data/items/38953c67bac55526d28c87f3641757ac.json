  "title": "PMS 2.0 155 - Aaron Hernandez Doc Chat.. Also, Legends Dante Hall & Lorenzo Alexander Stop By",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss the new Aaron Hernandez documentary on Netflix and try to process all the information that was presented, and find it hard to break down the situation other than finding it to be very sad and tragic amongst other things. Also joining the show is 2x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, member of the 2000's All Decade Team, the man known as the X-Factor and the Human Joystick, former Chiefs great Dante Hall, joins the show. He and Pat discuss this weekend's Conference Championship games and Dante explains why he thinks despite the Titans having the kind of attack that is poised to win in the playoffs, the Chiefs might have too much firepower. Dante also breaks down the NFC Championship game and whether or not the Packers have enough on the offensive side to challenge the 49ers elite defensive and their dominant front 4. Dante also chats about who some of his favorite returners in the league are right now, and what he thinks of the XFL rules that will allow for more explosive plays on punt and kickoff returns (21:04-36:55). Also joining the program is 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, recently retired Linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, and friend of the show, Lorenzo Alexander. Lorenzo and Pat chat about his retirement and when he first made the decision to hang up his cleats. Lorenzo also discusses Luke Keuchly's retirement and whether or not he was surprised by the move. They also cover each Conference Championship, and Lorenzo explains why it is so hard to tackle Derrick Henry, and what Aaron Rodgers needs to do to try to exploit San Francisco's explosive front 4. Lorenzo also gives his thoughts on how the Buffalo Bills are poised to make a big step starting next year (39:23-48:04). Also included is the new segment, \"Dumb Questions Asked on Sports Shows,\" with topics including Joe Burrow vs. Tua, Russell Wilson attempting to make a \"comeback\" next year, and whether or not Patrick Mahomes will be considered a failure if the Chiefs don't win the Super Bowl. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
