Her new book “My Money My Way” comes out next month, where she helps readers identify a uniquely personal plan that you’ll stick with, which will allow you to crush your money goals. For Kumiko, one of those milestones she achieved was paying off over $77,000 of debt in just 8 months early on in her financial journey and she also recently purchased her dream home with cash! During this episode she shares how you can take the experience and principles she learned, in order for you to take back control of your financial life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Dry Hopped Stillings Street by Trillium Brewing - a big thanks to Ali for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
