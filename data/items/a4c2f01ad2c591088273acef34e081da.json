  "description": "<p>Wine and cheese are perfect partners and knowing more about each will help you go from good to great with pairings! Cheese Master Jill Davis of Murray's Cheese tells us all about cheese and we discuss how best to pair certain types of cheese with wine!</p> <p>Here are the notes:</p> <ul> <li>There is an amazing parallel history of fermented stuff -- we discuss the evolution of wine and cheese and how they are so very similar.</li> <li>Jill gives us a primer on how to make cheese. We talk cows, sheep, goats, and buffalo and how seasons, geography, and diet all make a huge difference in how our cheese tastes. Little Miss Muffet gets a nod in this part of the show too (curds -n- whey, anyone?)</li> <li>We discuss the various categories of cheese --fresh, bloomy rind, washed rind and what fits where. </li> <li>We talk about why European cheese is different/better than the cheese available in the US and UK often.</li> <li>While still discussing cheese making and types, we weave in lots of info about pairing. <ul> <li>Bloomy rinds and Champagne</li> <li>blue and a great sweet German Auslese</li> <li>medium cheeses like wax Gouda with Beaujolais</li> <li>washed rind or aged cheese with tannic, barrel aged reds.</li> <li>And our favorite adage \"what grows together, goes together!\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>Finally, I offer some commentary on how wine may need to become more like cheese to get rid of the snobbery. It's up for debate, but it's food for thought!</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to Jill Davis for her time and deep knowledge and to our sponsors this week! </p> <p> </p> <p>_____________________________________________________</p> <p>Thank you to our sponsors this week:</p> <p><strong>YOU!</strong> The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make <img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/patreon_icon.jpg\" alt= \"\" width=\"67\" height=\"67\" />the podcast possible and who we give goodies in return for their help!Check it out today: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople\">https://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Vivino</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can use the Vivino app to scan and keep track of wines <img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/loge-pno-768x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"77\" height=\"77\" /></li> <li>NOW -- Shop through their web store, which has great prices and a huge inventory!
