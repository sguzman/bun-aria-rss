  "description": "<p>This week, delve deep into a story unlike any other we've done. Sure, his crimes are just as vicious, and definitely just as stupid, but more than anyone else, he didn't have to do any of it. He was an immigrant, from a war torn country, that earned a graduate's degree from Harvard, and millions of dollars, only to have his life devolve into a mess of drug smuggling, running from the law, shooting witnesses, running from the law some more, getting quickie divorces in Haiti, while under suspicion of killing his wife, and ill fated prison escape attempts. You know, the normal life of mathematical genius, race car driver. This episode is jam packed with crime, and has the most interesting ending of any story that we've ever done.A description could never do it justice.Fire up your engine, load up the drugs, and push your spouse overboard with John Paul Sr!!
