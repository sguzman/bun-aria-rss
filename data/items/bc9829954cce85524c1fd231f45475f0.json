  "link": "https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-control-your-metabolism-by-thyroid-and-growth-hormone/",
  "description": "This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanisms and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.\n\nSponsors\n\nFour Sigmatic - http://foursigmatic.com/huberman\n\n\nBlinkist - http://blinkist.com/huberman\n\n\nMunk Pack - http://munkpack.com - Use code: huberman\n\n \nPatreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n \nSupplements from Thorne\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n \nStudy on thermal stress and hormones\nEndocrine Effects of Repeated Hot Thermal Stress and Cold Water Immersion in Young Adult Men\n \nTimestamps\n\n00:00:00 Introduction\n\n00:06:05 Thyroid & Growth Hormone\n\n00:08:44 Food Shapes: Do They Matter?\n\n00:11:43 Stevia: Naming & Impact\n\n00:13:30 Metabolism 101: Your Brain the Furnace\n\n00:17:33 Releasing Hormones From Your Brain, Stimulating Hormones from Your Pituitary\n\n00:21:04 Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair and Energy Consumption of Tissues\n\n00:22:45 Iodine, L-Tyrosine & Selenium: The Trio Essential For Thyroid Function\n\n00:26:05 How Much Iodine Do We Need?
