  "description": "From the Vox Quick Hits archive (Feb. 19, 2021): Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson and critic-at-large Emily VanDerWerff recommend Minari. \nMinari is the story of Korean immigrants Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) who move their two small children (Noel Kate Cho and Alan S. Kim) from California to Arkansas in pursuit of Jacob’s dream of farming. But Jacob and Monica’s marriage is on the rocks, a circumstance that doesn’t improve the way they hoped it would when Monica’s mother (Yuh Jung Youn) comes to stay with them.\nWritten and directed by Lee Isaac Chung (Munyurangabo, Lucky Life) and set in the 1980s Ozarks, Minari feels deeply personal. It’s both a family drama seen through the eyes of a Korean American boy and a moving tale of love and loss in the American heartland, exquisitely told.\nRead Alissa's review of Minari here.\n\n\nHosts: Alissa Wilkinson (@alissamarie) and Emily VanDerWerff (@emilyvdw)\n\n\nEnjoyed this episode?
