  "title": "Scott Hershovitz on Making Philosophy Practical | Assume Everyone Is Lying",
  "description": "<p>Ryan reads today’s daily meditation and talks to Scott Hershovitz about his new book <a href='https://geni.us/6hzzS'>Nasty, Brutish, and Short: Adventures in Philosophy with Kids</a>, the common misconceptions about philosophy, how to apply philosophy to actual life, and more.</p><p>Scott writes about law and philosophy. His academic work has appeared in the Harvard Law Review, The Yale Law Journal, and Ethics, among other places. He also writes occasional essays about philosophy for the New York Times. Before joining the Michigan faculty, Hershovitz served as a law clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court and an attorney-advisor on the appellate staff of the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice.</p><p>The book follows an agenda set by Scott’s two sons, Rex and Hank. He takes us on a journey through classic and contemporary philosophy, powered by questions like, Does Hank have the right to drink soda? When is it okay to swear? And, Does the number six exist? Scott and his boys take on more weighty issues too. They explore punishment, authority, sex, gender, race, the nature of truth and knowledge, and the existence of God. Along the way, they get help from professional philosophers, famous and obscure. And they show that all of us have a lot to learn from listening to kids—and thinking with them.</p><p><a href='http://getkion.com/dailystoic'>Kion Aminos</a> is backed by over 20 years of clinical research, has the highest quality ingredients, no fillers or junk, undergoes rigorous quality testing, and tastes amazing with all-natural flavors.
