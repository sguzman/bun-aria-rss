  "description": "<p>With the unprecedented nature of pretty much everything in the world right now, homeschooling is the one topic that has been coming up more frequently than anything else.  With the uncertainty of what’s going to happen in public schools, more-and-more parents are looking into the possibility of taking their children’s education into their own hands.  While I will be the first to admit that it’s not for everyone, in today’s episode I’m going to walk through some of the incredible benefits of homeschooling as well as some of the potential downfalls.  Find out some good sources for teaching materials, why homeschooling won’t set your kids back, and why you don’t have to have a degree in childhood education to make sure your kids are getting what they need.  Also, I discuss the elephant in the room for every homeschooler; socialization.  Whether or not you plan to homeschool, this episode is sure to offer some great tips on how to make sure your kids get through what is sure to be a strange year.</p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!  Union is a small-town Wyoming company that provides both rural and city folks alike with a landline, cell phone, and Internet options.
