  "description": "<p>11/19 - Today on the show we had the one and only Tekashi stop by and Charlamagne actually apologized for under estimating his career, but of course still letting him know that he is not the best rapper out of New York. Moreover, he spoke about why he fired his team, trolling and more. Also, we had a throwback to when Lil Duval was here speaking on his single \"Smile B*tch\". Also Justine Sky stopped by and spoke to us about being in abusive relationship and more. In addition, we went back to the time Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to people who were reusing condoms. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
