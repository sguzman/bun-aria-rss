  "description": "<p>Today on Switched On we talk with BNEF Wind Industry Analyst Tom Harries, about floating and airborne wind power. These applications are still in their infancy but show promise. Floating turbines can open up new market territory for offshore wind power, allowing for placement in waters too deep for fixed-bottom kit. And airborne wind could potentially provide quick deployment in disaster locations to power relief efforts. But first, costs have to come down at sea and in the air. Switched On is hosted this week by BNEF's Head of Business Development, Dana Perkins.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
