In 30 years, more than 107 million people across the country will deal with those sweltering temperatures. And most of them will probably want air conditioning. But traditional AC units create more carbon emissions, which create more global warming.

He says there are companies working on updating the technology that keeps us cool.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
