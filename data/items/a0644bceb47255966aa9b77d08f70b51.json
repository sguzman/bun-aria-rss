  "description": "The story of a dark (well, dark-ish. Actually, kind of not even that. You'll see.) prophecy, a kingdom overrun by monsters (again, kind of), and one woman's globe spanning quest to do what's right (that's pretty much correct). Also, pig plague parties are only fun if you're a talking swine with a moderately sinister agenda. The creature this time is the Alkutane, from the folklore of the Pacific Northwest, in the US. These creatures will leave fun little baubles by your ear. Oops. My bad, I meant to say bubbles. Bubbles filled with your undigested brains. And they're not fun. Sponsors: Simplisafe! I have, no joke, been using Simplisafe for over a year. It's a fantastic system where you don't have to have someone come out to your house and try to hard sell you on a security system and then lock you in to a contract for years. You set it up yourself, it uses its own cellular signal with a battery backup (in case the power goes out) so you don't need to get an expensive hardwired phone line to your house, and all for $15 a month. Check it out at https://www.simplisafe.com/listen for $100 off the special Safeguard package.
