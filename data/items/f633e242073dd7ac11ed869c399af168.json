    "media:description": "▬▬▬▬▬▬   📝 ABSTRACT & BIO   ▬▬▬▬▬▬\nOrganizations are increasingly using SaaS platforms and external clouds. This makes the principle of least privilege especially important.\n\nIn this talk I would like to talk about how many external platforms (SaaS/Clouds) are related and integrated between them, and how to use PurplePanda, a tool I developed, to easily find paths to escalate privileges within the same cloud and across different platforms.\n\nCarlos Polop\nCarlos has a degree in Telecommunications Engineering with a Master in Cybersecurity. He has worked mainly as Penetration Tester and Red Teamer for several companies, but also as developer and system administrator. He has several relevant certifications in the field of cybersecurity such as OSCP, OSWE, CRTP, eMAPT and eWPTXv2. He was captain of the Spanish national team in 2021. Since he started learning cybersecurity he has tried to share his knowledge with the infosec community by publishing open source tools such as   and writing a free hacking book that anyone can consult at https://book.hacktricks.xyz.\n▬▬▬▬▬▬   🔗 LINKS   ▬▬▬▬▬▬\nhttps://twitter.com/carlospolopm\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-polop-martin/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/carlospolop/\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ 🎥 Producer ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nNancy Gariché                       ►  https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancygariche\n▬▬▬▬▬▬   🎙️Hosts   ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nNikki Becher                           ►  https://twitter.com/thedeadrobots \n▬▬▬▬▬▬   👋 Connect with Us   ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nYOUTUBE                              ►   https://youtu.be/DHLuUVx32RI\nINSTAGRAM                         ►  https://www.instagram.com/owaspdevslop/​\nTWITTER                               ►https://twitter.com/Owasp_DevSlop",
