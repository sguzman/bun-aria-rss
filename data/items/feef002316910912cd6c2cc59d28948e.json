  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi takes aim at President Trump and locks horns with a reporter before he sharply called her out on it. Trump noted that Pelosi is not the same person she once was and has problems. Clever reporters with stupid questions pursued a line of questioning around treason being punishable by death trying to box Trump into a corner. The reality is that Trump is not involved in the legality or prosecution of the law, so it doesn't matter what he says. Bottom line: the media has been no friend to Trump and turns a blind eye to all of the Democrats despite their misgivings. The American People must go over and around the impediment that the press has become. Then, Wells Fargo and TD Bank have announced that they will honor the Congressional subpoena for Trump's bank records. Later, former GOP chairman Michael Steele sat with Chuck Todd to push the impeachment agenda. Also, Christians are nearly extinct in Iraq. Rev Rashar Warda blames the UK church for not rebuilding after 83% of Christians have perished or been displaced from Iraq. He blames the weakness of the European church for not calling out this Christian genocide out of fear of being called politically incorrect. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
