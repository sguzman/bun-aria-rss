In addition to supporting better aging, fasting has also been found beneficial for autoimmunity, gut issues, reducing belly fat, Alzheimer’s, and much more. While many people associate fasting with restricting eating for long periods of time, there are actually many styles with different timing, which can make fasting a much more approachable practice than you might think. And when done the right way, you won’t even feel hungry.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this minisode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Frank Lipman and Dave Asprey about how fasting works, how to identify the type of fasting that is best for you, and special considerations around fasting for women.</p><br><p>Dr. Frank Lipman is recognized as a vocal pioneer of integrative and Functional Medicine (or what he calls “good medicine”). Dr. Lipman is the founder of Eleven Eleven Wellness Center and the Chief Medical Officer at The Well. He is a sought-after international speaker and the bestselling author of six books—<em>How to Be Well</em>, <em>The New Health Rules</em>, <em>Young & Slim for Life</em>, <em>Revive</em> and <em>Total Renewal</em>—and his newest book, <em>The New Rules of Aging Well: A Simple Program for Immune Resilience, Strength, and Vitality.</em></p><br><p>Dave Asprey is the founder and Chairman of Bulletproof 360, a high-performance coffee and food company, and creator of the widely-popular Bulletproof Coffee. He is a three-time <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, host of the Webby award-winning podcast <em>Bulletproof Radio</em>, and has been featured on the <em>Today </em>show, Fox News, <em>Nightline</em>, CNN, and dozens more.
