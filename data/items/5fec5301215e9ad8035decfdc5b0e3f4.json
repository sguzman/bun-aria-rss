  "description": "It was a day like any other in Southern California; the sun shining and birds singing whilst one queen man-spreads on a couch in stone-washed jeans and another queen sits on a chair with frosted faux bangs and a creepy silk shirt featuring disembodied doll parts. In other words, 'twas a typical day in the life of the fabulously-famous multi-hyphenates Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamo. We could tease you with little juicy tidbits from their conversation about eating pop-rocks edibles, taking VIP showers, and smoking cigars like men do, but we would never dream of doing that.\n\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TrixieKatyaYT\n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
