  "description": "<p><p>Week 14 Fastest 2 minutes. We recap every game from Sunday (2:31 - 9:04). The Rams big win, the Bills fall short against the Dominant Ravens (9:04 - 22:04). Freddie Kitchens is a big dumb dumb (22:04 - 29:21). The Packers offense is weird (29:21 - 36:11). The Vikings bounce back, the 49ers win a shootout and George Kittle is a Beast. Dolphins try to win with only Field Goals, Jameis Winston's Mona Lisa. Drew Lock is for real, the Jaguars quit, and the Titans are the hottest team in the NFL. We finish up the recap with the Patriots vs the Chiefs and Duck's win in the desert. Who's back of the week (99:21 - 104:12). College Football Playoff break down and the Badgers broke Big Cat's heart again (104:12 - 116:12). Football guy of the week and Joe Burrow's swagger.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
