  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ Hawk, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Patriots and Bills and the accompanying Manning Cast, how the Patriots only threw three times and still won, a dominant win for Bill Belichick, if we should be worried about the Bills at this point in the season, and all the other news stories floating around the NFL as we finish week 13 and look ahead to week 14.

Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about his bye week, the 2nd opinion he got on his toe from a doctor in California, what it's like playing in one of those windy games like last night in Buffalo, what he did during his birthday week, if any of the injured Packers are going to return from injury this week, if he actually needs practice at this point, what the next book in the book club is, and much more (24:45-1:00:06).
