  "description": "<p>Spoke to the witness and had a brief conversation, he said \"while driving in York, Pennsylvania I saw this huge creature. It was bent down next to a creek. I stopped to look at it and other drivers pulled over. The creature stood up and had this look like it was upset it had been seen. It had something in its hand. The creature turned and looked at us. It reminded me of a man...a large...hairy man.</p>",
