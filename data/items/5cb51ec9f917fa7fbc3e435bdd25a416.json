  "description": "<p>Have you ever felt like you can't shake the baby blues? Like maybe you've recovered from childbirth physically, but emotionally, you feel like an empty shell of who you once were? It's possible that you are battling postpartum depression (PPD). In this episode, writer and speaker, Lindsey Carlson discusses her struggles with PPD, giving practical insight and gospel-hope to other moms. She answers questions like, \"How do I know if this is PPD or the baby blues?\" and \"What's the next step if I think I might have PPD?\" But most importantly, she reinforces the truth that in Christ, PPD doesn't define our identity and it definitely isn't the end of our story. Whether you are walking through this, or you have a friend or family member with questions, this is a must-listen on a sensitive topic that many moms face.</p> <p><strong>Articles & Other Resources:</strong></p> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.worshiprejoices.com/\" target= \"_blank\">Lindsey's Blog - Worship Rejoices </a></strong></li> <li><a href= \"http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2016/december/in-valley-of-postpartum-depression-christian-women.html\" target=\"_blank\">In the Valley of Postpartum Depression</a> - Lindsey Carlson (article referenced on the show)</li> <li>Immediate Help for PPD or Psychosis:</li> <li style=\"list-style: none;\">​If you or someone you know may be in crisis or thinking of suicide, get help quickly.</li> </ul> </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">• Call your doctor.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">• Call 911 for emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">• Call the toll-free 24-hour hotline of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or 1-800-799-4889.</div> </div> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.ccef.org/counseling/choosing-a-christian-counselor\" target=\"_blank\">Choosing a Christian Counselor</a> - CCEF </li> <li><a href=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/flee-to-the-cross\" target=\"_blank\">Flee to the Cross</a> - Rachel Pieh Jones </li> </ul> <p><strong> For More:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>To subscribe: </strong>on iOS, go to our <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-risen-motherhood-podcast/id1072833310?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">iTunes page</a> and subscribe.
