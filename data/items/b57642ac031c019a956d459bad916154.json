  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is Because You’re Mine by Claire Contreras!\n\nWhen my sister asked me to take a course for her while she went out of town for work, I reluctantly agreed. I wasn’t expecting to step into a university auditorium filled with overactive libidos lusting after the professor. And I certainly wasn’t expecting to become one of those women myself, but there’s something about Lorenzo Costello that makes him irresistible. He’s the kind of man mothers warn their daughters about – mysterious, gorgeous, experienced, wild – and for some crazy reason he wants me.\n\nI should run far away and save myself from the impending heartache. So why am I racing toward him? I’m totally going to get burned. A man like Lorenzo won’t leave me unscathed. He’ll make ashes of me.\n\nBecause You’re Mine is NOT a dark romance! It’s sexy and will keep you listening. \n\nAmazon KU: https://amzn.to/3lXvCnS\nAudio: https://amzn.to/3gshylp\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
