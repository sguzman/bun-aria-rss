  "description": "Hey listener! Did you put on your big kid underwear? WELL, GET READY TO TAKE IT OFF. Ok, it's already getting weird. Gotta set the tone.... \n This week we read Mastered by Her Mates by Grace Goodwin and it was an amazing, wild ride. Aliens have landed and sworn their protection from THE HIVE but, in return, they need soldiers for the front lines and they want brides for their soldiers. Enter Amanda Bryant, a seasoned spy who becomes the first in Earth's Interstellar Bride Program and needs to confirm the threat from The Hive is real and send back any and all intel and technology back to her superiors, all while not getting distracted by her two new, hot mates. That's right: TWO MATES! Will she be able to keep her heart from two warriors who want to share their love and devotion with her? Is appeasing her government really the best course of action? Can we do all of this with magical, orgasm-inducing semen as a factor? Are you ready for the Anal Training Box? Can we get a little more double-penetration up in here? Can I please have my own poop robot? \n I DON'T KNOW WHAT QUESTION TO PRIORITIZE. \n Bonus Content: \n Erin remembers and becomes obsessed with the 1988 classic \"Earth Girls are Easy\" with Geena Davis, Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, and Damon Wayans. It's a recurring theme. Erin recalls the time that eHarmony told her she had literally ZERO matches. No one at all in all the internet. We talk a lot about the merits of a good spy, what's appropriate for a medical examination after you've been reduced to pure energy, beamed across the universe, and then reassembled. We wonder how quiet a poop robot can really be, and generally squee over this book and all it's glory. We also have a hard time choosing a sign off, so you get them all! See our process in action! \n Random Erin Rec: The Demonica Series by Larissa Ione. If you like an incubus, check it out! \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n Erin: Queer Eye Season 2 on Netflix. Watch it and cry with joy and goodness. \n Melody: Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Watch it and remember how funny and capable and fabulous you are. \n  \n Housekeeping: Patreon fam, please send us your mailing addresses!
