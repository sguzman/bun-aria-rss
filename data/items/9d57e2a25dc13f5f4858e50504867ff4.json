  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is chatting with Malin Elmlid, author of “The Bread Exchange: Tales and Recipes from a Journey of Baking and Bartering.” An ode to a life warmly lived, Malin’s book tells the story of one woman’s hunger for greater meaning in her life and how it has been enriched by the sharing of her handmade bread. From her cozy kitchen in Berlin to a flat in London, from a deck in New York City to huddling around a tandoor in Kabul, she shares discoveries, stories, and recipes from her inspiring travels, and highlights it all for Cathy. A busy fashion-industry professional with a bread-baking obsession, Malin tells Cathy how she started offering her loaves to others in return for recipes, handmade goods, and, above all, special experiences that come from giving generously of yourself.
