And in 1993, Toni Morrison became the first black woman of any nationality to win a Nobel Prize.\nThe citation for her award in literature declared Morrison to be an author “who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.” \nIn 2012, Toni Morrison was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\nIn commencement address at Rutgers University in 2011, Toni Morrison encouraged graduates to seek a meaningful life -- something she herself had certainly achieved. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
