For instance, most of us have experience with coming down with a bad cold or flu directly following a period in which we haven’t been eating or sleeping well. The same principle can apply to more severe or chronic disease as well; a dysregulated immune system opens the door for illness.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Jeffrey Bland about how the food you eat and the quality of your sleep, your thoughts and relationships, and more are fundamental when it comes to the regulation of your immune system. He also speaks with Dr. Leonard Calabrese about the role that movement and exercise play in supporting your immune health.</p><br><p>Dr. Jeffrey Bland is the founder of Big Bold Health, a company on a mission to transform the way people think about one of nature’s greatest innovations—the immune system. Through Big Bold Health, Jeff is advocating for the power of immuno-rejuvenation to enhance immunity at a global level, often through the rediscovery of ancient food crops and superfoods. To get there, Jeff is building a network of small farms and suppliers throughout the US that take a clear stance on regenerative agriculture, environmental stewardship, and planetary health. Jeff’s career in health spans more than 40 years. A nutritional biochemist by training, he began in academia as a university professor. Jeff then spent three decades in the natural products industry, working alongside other pioneers.</p><br><p>Dr. Leonard Calabrese is a Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and Vice Chair of the Department of Rheumatic and Immunologic Diseases. Dr. Calabrese is also the director of the RJ Fasenmyer Center for Clinical Immunology at Cleveland Clinic and holds joint appointments in the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Wellness Institute.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by MitoPure.
