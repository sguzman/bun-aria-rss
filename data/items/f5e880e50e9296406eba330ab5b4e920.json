    "media:description": "This video is the introduction to my series on geometric algebra, From Zero to Geo.  In this series, we will build geometric algebra from the ground up, starting from just high school algebra.  My hope is that this series can be used by motivated high schoolers (or anybody above that level) to learn geometric algebra.\n\nAnd yes, I do know that a few of the things I presented aren't quite correct (such as when I reflected a shape across a line or when I divided by a bivector).  The point of this video is just to be an introduction to the series, not to teach anything.\n\nAlso, I can't make videos this fast!  I actually had almost finished this one before deciding to make the calculus one for SoME1.\n\nFull playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVuwZXwFua-0Ks3rRS4tIkswgUmDLqqRy\nNext video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGJRywjjKY\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/3Zj59zA2Rg\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/sudgylacmoe\n\n\"But sudgy,\" I hear you say, \"you haven't finished the series yet!  I want to learn geometric algebra now!\"  If you want to, you can try learning through the materials that I learned from.  I learned mainly from some of David Hestenes' work such as his Oersted medal paper (http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf) and his book \"New Foundations for Classical Mechanics\".  Another very helpful resource for me was Doran and Lasenby's \"Geometric Algebra for Physicists\".  Other books that I've heard great things about but didn't use while learning are MacDonald's \"Linear and Geometric Algebra\" (which is the most beginner-friendly book of the bunch) and Dorst et al's \"Geometric Algebra for Computer Science\".  However, many of the things I've learned about geometric algebra I learned through random papers and discussions with others.  Some of the things I've learned I figured out for myself, too.\n\nTable of Contents:\nChapter 1: Vectors\n - Section 1 (Introduction): https://youtu.be/zeGJRywjjKY\n - Section 2 (Length and Scalar Multiplication): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwkWmpnJ4RI\n - Section 3 (Adding Vectors): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9P4d818rlI\n - Section 4 (Algebra of Vectors): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNnUGAwqy14\n - Section 5 (Spaces/Subspaces): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O40hzr71N0w\n - Section 6 (Linear Combinations/Span): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uByHD38Xsls\n - Section 7 (Linear Dependence/Bases): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZXen-HX7dA\nMore to come!\n\nSpecial thanks to wooden cube for doing the captions.\n\nSections:\n00:00 What is Geometric Algebra?\n01:28 History of Geometric Algebra\n02:57 Why isn't Geometric Algebra used more?\n03:40 From Zero to Geo\n04:16 Why a video series?\n05:04 Flavors of Geometric Algebra\n06:18 Exercises\n08:31 Outline of Series",
