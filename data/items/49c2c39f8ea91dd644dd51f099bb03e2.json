  "description": "<p>Jared \"The Rocket\" Carrabis joins Kirk Minihane in studio to confront Quantum Week host and KMS fill-in producer Matthew Carano. On yesterday's show, Carano said Carrabis has \"no talent\" and now we'll see whether he sticks to that claim or backs down. Carano also attempts to explain why it took him a full five hours to post yesterday's show, thus enraging all Minifans and providing ammo to his legions of enemies. Plus, Kirk let's Carrabis react to Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy's scathing review of his performance during the company-wide Cyber Monday merch push.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
