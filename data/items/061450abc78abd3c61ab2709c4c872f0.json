  "description": "There’s truth in the sentiment, “teamwork makes the dream work.” When team members don’t feel included or heard in their environment, they’re not going to do their best work, so it’s up to managers, supervisors, and even global security directors to foster a workplace and culture that doesn’t allow anyone to be silenced. \nOn this episode, Microsoft’s CISO, Bret Arsenault, sits with his friend and peer, Emma Smith, Director of Global Cybersecurity for Vodafone. Throughout the conversation, they discuss returning to in-person work after over a year of being remote and some of the inherent difficulties that come with the change, especially as they relate to inclusivity.  \n\nIn This Episode You Will Learn: \n\nHow focusing on digital society, inclusion for all, and the planet allows for practical actions. \n\nWhy 5G is so important for a hybrid workforce. \n\nWhy Emma and Bret support eliminating passwords. \n\n\nSome Questions We Ask: \n\nHow does Emma look at inclusion initiatives from an industry perspective? \n\nWhat is ‘withstander’ training and why is it crucial for effective leadership? \n\nWhat are Emma’s three points of wisdom for security practitioners? \n\n \nSubscribe:\nhttps://SecurityUnlockedCISOSeries.com\n\nResources: \nEmma Smith’s LinkedIn. \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-smith-0388aa4b/\nBrett Arsenault’s LinkedIn: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/bret-arsenault-97593b60/ \n\nRelated: \nSecurity Unlocked: The Microsoft Security Podcast\nhttps://SecurityUnlockedPodcast.com\n\nSecurity Unlocked: CISO Series with Bret Arsenault is produced by Microsoft and distributed as part of The CyberWire Network.",
