  "title": "Kimbra reflects on a song that we used to know",
  "description": "Ten years ago the Australian artist Gotye asked New Zealand musician Kimbra to feature on his song “Somebody I Used To Know.” At the time Kimbra had no idea it was going to be a hit. No wonder—the song lacks the trappings of a conventional pop song. The chorus shows up late and it only repeats once in a track composed of an obscure Brazilian guitar sample and nursery rhyme xylophones.  \nBut this slow burner about opposing sides in a relationship's bitter end found a global audience, ascending to No. 1 in more than 25 countries, and accumulating billions of plays across streaming platforms. In 2013, Prince anointed Gotye and Kimbra the Grammy for record of the year (it won best pop duo/group performance as well). The song created many opportunities for both Gotye and Kimbra, but both chose unconventional paths, resisting the industry’s desire to generate the next hit for hits sake.\nReflecting on the song a decade later, Kimbra spoke with Charlie Harding from the podcast Switched On Pop about how this unlikely song inspired her to pursue her singular musical vision, and how it feels to be yet again co-nominated for a 2021 Grammy for her collaboration with Jacob Collier and Tank and The Bangas on “In My Bones.”\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nGotye - Somebody I Used to Know (feat. Kimbra)\nLuiz Bonfá - Seville \nKimbra - Miracle \nKimbra - 90s Music \nKimbra - Top of the World\nJacob Collier - In My Bones \nKimbra - Right Direction\nSon Lux - Lost It To Trying\n\nMORE\nCheck out Kimbra’s course on Vocal Creativity, Arranging, and Production over at Soundfly\nListen to our conversation with Jacob Collier \nLearn more about your ad choices.
