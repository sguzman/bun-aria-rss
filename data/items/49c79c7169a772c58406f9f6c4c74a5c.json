  "description": "<p>r/Tifu Who knew that it's possible to just steal a penguin? Well, it turns out that it's easier than you might think. So easy, in fact, that a kid manages to get his hands on a baby penguin in a field trip, stuff the poor little guy into his backpack, and then sneak back onto the school bus. The other students told on the kid to a teacher, and the teacher didn't believe them! It wasn't until they actually showed the teacher that the kid stole a real life penguin that the teacher had to turn the school bus around so they could return the confused animal!</p>\n",
