  "description": "YouTube wants a piece of that sweet TikTok action, so it’s getting out the checkbook. The most popular creators on YouTube’s TikTok clone — that’s YouTube Shorts, officially — will get a cut that comes from a pool of all Shorts revenue, rather than on an individual video-by-video basis. The company's also introducing a “Super Thanks” tipping feature. Recode’s Peter Kafka talks to YouTube’s Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan about the changes and tries to find out why his YouTube Shorts feed is full of Ben Shapiro videos. We don’t have “Super Thanks,” but feel free to Venmo a tip to our producer Jelani for staying up late to get this one out to you.\n\nFeaturing: Neal Mohan (@nealmohan), Chief Product Officer at YouTube\nHost: Peter Kafka (@pkafka), Senior Editor at Recode\nMore to explore: Subscribe for free to Recode Media, Peter Kafka, one of the media industry's most acclaimed reporters, talks to business titans, journalists, comedians, and more to get their take on today's media landscape.\nAbout Recode by Vox: Recode by Vox helps you understand how tech is changing the world — and changing us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
