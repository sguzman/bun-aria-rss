  "description": "<p>I will be inviting Ken to the show and he had an encounter in 1962 in Montana while hunting. Ken said “I thought it was a man but I knew it was impossible for a man to move like that.”</p> <p>Damien Nott will be returning to the show. I interviewed Damien on episode 723 The Strange Light Phenomena. One of the encounters he had with the lights almost killed him and he has been suffering from what appears to be radiation sickness. I wanted to discuss it on episode 723 but I wanted to make sure he was ready to talk about it.</p> <p>Damien Nott (Australian Aerial Phenomena Investigations) began investigating and researching the UFO phenomenon after a sighting he witnessed at the age of 9. He went public in 2012 after multiple sightings and considerable media attention and has become a passionate voice both nationally and internationally for the phenomenon. Damien regularly gives presentations across Australia showing his UFO captures and speaks about his own experiences and research regarding UFO’s. His goal is educate those who are interested in the phenomena, as well as those who may find themselves having had an experience or encounter of their own.</p>",
