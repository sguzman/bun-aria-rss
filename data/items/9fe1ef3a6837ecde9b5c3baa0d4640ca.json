  "description": "The very first time Tristan Walker shaved, he woke up the next morning with razor bumps all over his face. \"I was like, what <em>is</em> this?\" he remembers saying. \"I am never shaving again—ever.\" He soon discovered that like him, many men of color were frustrated by the lack of shaving products for coarse or curly hair. Fifteen years after that first disastrous shave, and after countless meetings with doubtful investors, Tristan launched Bevel, a subscription shaving system built around a single-blade razor. Eventually his brand Walker & Company grew to include 36 hair and beauty products, used by millions of men and women across the U.S. In 2018, Walker & Company was sold to Proctor & Gamble, and Tristan became P&G's first black CEO. <br><br><em>This show was recorded live at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C in September 2019.</em>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
