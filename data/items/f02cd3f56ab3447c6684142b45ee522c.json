  "description": "With Trump just back from an Asia trip that ran the gamut of outcomes from negligible to awful, the question turns again to what's going on with U.S. foreign policy.  Specifically, we take a look at the gutting of the State Department and the president's pronouncement that \"l'etat c'est moi.\"  (Was that him or Louis XIV?  I always get them confused. Suffice it to say it was someone whose tastes ran toward gold bathroom fixtures.)  We go there--with special guest, former Bush Administration Under Secretary of State and distinguished career foreign service officer Ambassador Nicholas Burns, Stanford's Kori Schake and Georgetown's Rosa Brooks.
