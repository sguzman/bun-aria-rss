  "description": "In this episode, I explain the biological roles of the four major neuromodulators—dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, and acetylcholine—and describe how these neuromodulators impact a wide variety of mental states and behaviors, including focus, creativity, motivation, drive, learning, alertness, mood, relationships, and feelings of well-being. Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Optimizing Neurochemicals to Improve Health\n(00:03:40) Momentous Supplements\n(00:05:30) Sleep & Maintaining Healthy Metabolism\n(00:09:52) Tools: How to Wake Up Earlier, Night Owls\n(00:19:32) AG1 (Athletic Greens), InsideTracker, Thesis\n(00:22:05) Nervous System Overview\n(00:31:32) How Neuromodulators Work \n(00:34:24) Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases\n(00:42:15) Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators\n(00:52:12) The 4 Major Types of Neuromodulators\n(01:01:45) Tool Kit 1: Increase Baseline Dopamine & Focus\n(01:08:52) Tyrosine-rich Foods & Dopamine\n(01:10:59) Dopamine Supplementation: Mucuna Pruriens, L-tyrosine & Phenylethylamine\n(01:16:00) Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n(01:21:12) Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips to Increase Dopamine\n(01:26:10) Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness\n(01:34:34) Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods\n(01:37:29) Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine \n(01:44:47) Tool Kit 5: Behavior to Increase Focus & Acetylcholine\n(01:46:56) Tool Kit 6: Behavior to Increase Serotonin & Feelings of Well-being \n(01:50:51) Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin\n(01:53:31) Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol\n(02:02:14) Use the Neurochemical Toolkit to Meet Individual Goals\n(02:06:44) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
