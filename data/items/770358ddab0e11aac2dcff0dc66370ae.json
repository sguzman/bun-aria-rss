We are going to chat about applique and how her years of living in Alaska formed her color sense.\nwww.happystashquilts.com\n------------------\nWith a website named Quilted Blooms I knew I’d love Paige Alexander’s quilts. She works in a modern style with a base in the blocks and shapes we all know and love. She loves a challenge and shares many of her processes to work on one, which will teach you a lot about how to think and design as you go.\nwww.quiltedblooms.com\n-------------\nLindsay Conner is a super creative gal and fellow Baby lock ambassador. We had a chance to work together this year at the industry event Baby Lock holds for it’s ambassadors called ‘Common Threads’. She was helping me to learning embroidery machine techniques, we had a fun time! Today I’m excited to hear about her NICU smocks charity sew along and she is going to tell me about some of the babylock machines!\n www.lindsaysews.com\n----------------\nI love the writing, sharing and inspiration at Debbie Jeske’s site A Quilter’s Table. She is a long time quilter, and now works in a improvisational manner. She hosts lots of sew alongs, shares her work as she goes and I love her thoughts on how we feel about our work. She keeps it real and you’ll want to start following her!\naquilterstable.blogspot.com/\n----------\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
