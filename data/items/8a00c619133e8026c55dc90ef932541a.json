  "title": "59 - The Shadow People",
  "description": "<p>Welcome to a Halloween edition of Timesuck! Have you ever felt like something in the shadows was watching you? Something ominous. Have you ever woken up to the sensation that a strange, dark, presence was in your room? Or, have you actually seen a shadowy figure, darker than the night around it, a menacing human shape with no eyes or, ever worse, red, glowing eyes? If yes, you have encountered a shadow person. But what even is a shadow person? A demonic entity? An extraterrestrial? Some astral traveller or being from another dimension? Or, was your mind just playing tricks on you? Can science explain this phenomenon? All of this addressed, plus several chilling, first-hand Shadow People stories shared, on today's Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by World of Warships! Download a free-to-play, historical, online combat game from Wargaming and get special bonus content when you go to <a href=\"http://www.commandwarships.com/\">www.commandwarships.com</a>and enter the invite code TIMESUCK17</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by by the socially conscious on-line fantastic mattress store LEESA! Go to <a href=\"http://www.leesa.com/timesuck\">www.leesa.com/timesuck</a>to get $100 off of one of their incredible mattresses and help both the environment and the homeless while doing so!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also sponsored by the wonderful podcast, Hello from the Magic Tavern, a fully improvised comedy chat show set in a magical world, you know, sort of like Narnia or Middle Earth. Arnie Niekamp fell through dimensional portal behind a Burger King in Chicago into the magical land of Foon and instead of going off on adventures he decided to start a podcast interviewing adventurers, monsters and talking plants with the help of his co-hosts: a wizard and a talking badge.
