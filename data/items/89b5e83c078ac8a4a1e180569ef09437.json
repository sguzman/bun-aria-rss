The race that starts in Saint Malo in France and ends in Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe — also known as the queen of transatlantic solo Yacht races — is considered to be one of the most diverse to date due to the wide range of ages and genders of the participants. FRANCE 24's correspondent in Saint-Malo, France, reports.",
