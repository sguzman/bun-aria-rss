  "description": "Alan defends to Jim his ‘wait and see’ policy regarding the church window. He wants to avoid stirring up division in the community. The window might still never be made. He resolves to hold a meeting with Peggy and all the family members, to clarify things, in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect.\nHelen and Lee are looking after Ena the cat for Joy in return for unlimited use of her hot tub. They’ve banned the children from using it so it’s just the two of them. However when the garden goes quiet they wonder what’s going on – until mischievous Jack appears and sabotages the tub with soap bubbles. Lee tries to clear it up but it won’t stop foaming. He judges it more as a mess than anything mechanical. He’ll ensure the tub’s left pristine.\nMia tries to persuade reluctant George to accept her help with his essay writing, as per Eddie’s request. George is having none of it; he reckons he doesn’t need academic success when he has other deals going on. Mia shrugs – okay, if George is happy with that, why should failing all his assignments matter? He soon changes his mind, but Mia’s busy with her own essay. George turns his attention to Brad, enlisting his help instead. Later Mia points out to Brad that he’s been had – George is gone and Brad’s writing his essay for him. She reckons George shouldn’t let Brad walk all over him; he’s better than that. Brad is a little embarrassed and makes a flustered exit.",
