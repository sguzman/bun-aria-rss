  "description": "In 1997, a newly 18-year-old woman headed to San Francisco for the summer to attend UC Berkeley for a Photography course. But after work one afternoon, she seemingly vanished out of thin air. Weeks later, an anonymous call came into a local news station from a man claiming to know exactly what happened to her.
