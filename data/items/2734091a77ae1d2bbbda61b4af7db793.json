  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be chatting with Timothy Renner and Joshua Cutchin. Their book is called \"Where the Footprints End: High Strangeness and the Bigfoot Phenomenon, Volume II: Evidence.\"</p> <p>The guys write \"Despite continued attempts to uncover the truth, proof of the bigfoot phenomenon has eluded researchers and cryptozoologists for decades. Witnesses regularly describe seeing and interacting with something like a large, undiscovered hominid... and yet, such sightings regularly produce evidence directly at odds with conventional scientific explanations. It seems impossible to reconcile these peculiarities—among them mystery lights, UFOs, unusual sounds, mindspeak, cryptic stick signs, and anomalous footprints and trackways—with the notion of flesh-and- blood creatures evading detection in the modern frontier.</p> <p>As remarkable as the discovery of a manlike primate would be, what if bigfoot is something stranger still?\"</p> <p>Also check out Tim's Podcast: <a href= \"https://www.strangefamiliars.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://www.strangefamiliars.com/</a></p>",
