  "description": "In Episode #212, Dr Eric Rawson joins me to examine the muscular and cognitive effects of creatine.\nPerformance supplementation is a flooded field. With supplementation sceptics on one hand and relentless marketing promotion on the other, it can be difficult to know what to believe. Dr Eric Rawson joins me today for an in-depth conversation on creatine, breaking down everything you need to know about this widely studied compound.\n\nIn this episode, we cover the basics of creatine consumption and push deeper into specific, common questions people may have. You will learn about the muscular performance and brain health benefits of creatine for people of different demographics, including age, gender, and diet. Dr Rawson also outlines dosage guidelines, addresses common concerns people may have, and speaks to the evidence we have about safety.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBreakthrough Creatine Research (1:53)\n\nWhat Creatine is (11.00)\n\nIs Creating Essential? (12:48)\n\nTesting Creatine Levels (17:10)\n\nVegetarian vs Omnivore (23:01)\n\nImproving Performance (28:40)\n\nAnalyzing Other Compounds (52:24)\n\nSafety of Supplements (1:05:48)\n\nGender Impact (1:21:30)\n\nCreating Dosage (1:27:50)\n\nBrain Health & Creatine (1:29:06)\n\nOutro (1:57:55)\n\n\nDr Rawson offers specific guidelines that you can action, as well as covering the science behind why. In a world where anyone and everyone online makes nutrition claims, it’s critical to have reliable, rigorous evidence to support these. I hope you found this episode clarifying and useful.\n\nIf you enjoyed hearing from Dr Rawson, you can connect with him via Twitter.
