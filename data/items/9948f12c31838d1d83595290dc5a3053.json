Microsoft patches remaining ShadowBrokers' exploits, even in deprecated systems. The US Congress votes to sanction Russia for election influence operations. Those operations have a long, long history, going back to the 1930s at least. Electrical and natural gas sectors work to protect themselves against CrashOverride.
