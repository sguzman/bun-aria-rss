  "description": "Author and social activist bell hooks died a couple of weeks ago, so we at <em>Book Of The Day</em> thought it would be nice to revisit one of our favorite interviews of hers. In 2000, she discussed her book <em>All About Love: New Visions</em> with NPR's Cheryl Corely. They talked about how most people misunderstand love and the many forms it can take and how transformative and powerful real love can be in all spheres of life.",
