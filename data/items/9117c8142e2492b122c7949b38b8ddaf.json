  "description": "<div>Their crimes resemble high-octane Hollywood action movies: a sports car speeds through a Dubai shopping mall, crashing into the windows of a Graff jewelry store. Masked, gun-wielding men jump out of the car and stuff fistfuls of diamonds into their satchels before screeching off. In London, they took all of three minutes to make off with $30 million in diamonds. Dubbed the Pink Panthers, they're captured - on surveillance tapes that record their astonishing lightning strikes with hypnotic accuracy. We see the tapes and we meet the thieves and hear about their heists in their own words.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
