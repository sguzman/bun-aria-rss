  "description": "<p>Most people think of Foxconn as the company that assembles iPhones. But it's a lot more than that. In fact the company really got started by manufacturing all of the tiny components and connectors for the PC industry around the world, long before the iPhone ever existed.

The potential is massive, and if they get it right, it could be wildly profitable. On this episode of the podcast, we speak to Bloomberg Opinion's Tim Culpan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tculpan\" data-destination=\"https://twitter.com/tculpan\">@tculpan on Twitter</a>) who has followed the company for a long time. He explains how EVs fit into Foxconn's strategy, and how it plans to win in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
