  "description": "Nerd Week is back for Year 2 and no better analytics expert to kick it off with in 2020 than Aaron Schatz of Football Outsiders. Aaron covers basically the whole league with the Pick Six crew of Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech. They discuss Ben Roethlisberger's return from injury (5:00), impacts of COVID-19 on FO projections (8:30), the Lions statement in the podcast title (11:25) and the never-ending Cowboys or Eagles debate (14:45). That's not all! The AFC West (17:30), Bucs vs. Pats (21:00) and the AFC East is all covered before the break. The guys continue to learn about expectations for Kyler Murray (28:00), the likelihood of 3 or 4 playoff teams from the NFC West and why the Jaguars could be slightly sneaky in 2020 (41:00).
