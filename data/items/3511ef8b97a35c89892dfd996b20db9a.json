  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>It’s officially spooky season y’all! For many of us, the idea of gazing into the darkest parts of ourselves is more terrifying than any Halloween thriller or monster movie we could ever watch. It can difficult emotional work to dig up the parts of ourselves that we’d rather bury six feet under. The repressed parts of ourselves often challenge who we think we are and bring up feelings we’d rather forget. But what if we learned to integrate and accept the parts of ourselves we hide in the dark? What if uncovering the parts of ourselves we’re hiding in the shadows will illuminate who we really want to be? </p>\n<p>This week I’m joined by licensed therapist and author of <em>The Shadow Work Workbook: Self-Care Exercises for Healing Your Trauma and Exploring Your Hidden Self</em>, Jor-El Caraballo. Our conversation explores how shadow work allows for more self acceptance and living a more aligned life and the hidden gifts and talents that may be locked away in our shadow selves. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>I'm writing a book!
