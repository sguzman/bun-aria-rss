  "description": "<p>     The one and only Steven Van Zandt joins Michael and Steve this week on Talking Sopranos. Little Steven talks about his early days with Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny and of course the Sopranos. David Chase, the Sopranos creator, saw Steven induct the Rascals into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and asked him to audition for the show. Steven’s answer was “thanks but no thanks”. Eventually he did come around and was actually cast as Tony Soprano. But it was HBO who nixed the whole idea, they wanted someone with more on-screen experience. Steven had already been working on a script about a wise guy named Silvio Dante. David liked it so much he wrote the character into the show. But just when Steven thought he had found his new career, Bruce called and wanted to put the E-Street band back together. Crazy story and a great interview with a man who starred on one of the greatest TV shows in history and plays guitar in one of the greatest rock and roll bands in history.</p><p>     Then it’s Happy Birthday Mr. Tony Soprano as Michael and Steve break down episode #60 “In Camelot” S5-Ep7.
