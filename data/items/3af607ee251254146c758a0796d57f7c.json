  "description": "<p>When you think of the U.K., what do you think of? The Beatles? The Queen? Fish & chips? We, of course, go straight to <i>The Great British Bake Off</i>. One of the show’s most delightful winners, Nadiya Hussain, stopped by Radio Cherry Bombe in person recently to share what she’s been up to. Since we last checked in with Nadiya, she’s written more books, including her latest, <i>Nadiya’s Fast Flavours</i>; visited L.A. and New Orleans for a BBC program about American food; and has been serving as a culinary ambassador for the GREAT campaign, a program to promote what’s awesome about the U.K. She and host Kerry Diamond talk New York City eats (Nadiya is looking for great cheesecake. Any suggestions?), what U.K. food she misses the most when traveling, and her unexpected career as a writer.
