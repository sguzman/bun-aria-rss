  "title": "250: Holding it Together When Things Fall Apart | Pema Chodron",
  "description": "Pema Chodron has seemingly been trying to prepare us for this pandemic for years, through a series of popular books, with titles such as When Things Fall Apart, Welcoming the Unwelcome, and The Wisdom of No Escape. But as you will hear, she is anything but gloomy. Like all of the great meditation teachers I've met, she has a lightness and a sense of humor about her. Notwithstanding her chipper demeanor, she has worked hard to point out to her readers and students that groundlessness and uncertainty are fundamental facts of life - which are becoming increasingly salient in our current crisis. Pema Chodron was born Deirdre Blomfield in Connecticut. She lived a conventional life, going to UC Berkeley, becoming a school teacher, and having a pair of kids. But after a rough divorce, she found herself adrift. During this time, she discovered Tibetan Buddhism, shaved her head, and became a nun. Now in her mid-eighties, she lives in rural Nova Scotia, where she is the director of Gampo Abbey. We connected with her on an old-school landline. We talked about how to actually welcome the unwelcome. We also discussed how to: befriend your demons, sympathize without being stupid, lighten up in the face of fear, and embrace chaos as \"extremely good news.\"\nWhere to find Pema Chodron online:\nWebsite: https://pemachodronfoundation.org/about/pema-chodron/\nTwitter: Pema Chödrön (@AniPemaChodron) / https://twitter.com/AniPemaChodron\nFacebook: Pema Chodron / https://www.facebook.com/Pema.Chodron/\nInstagram: AniPemaChodron (@anipemachodron) / https://www.instagram.com/anipemachodron/\nBooks Mentioned:\nWhen Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times by Pema Chodron / https://www.amazon.com/When-Things-Fall-Apart-Difficult-ebook/dp/B00BBXJH2C\nWelcoming the Unwelcome by Pema Chodron / https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V77TZ33/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1\nEmotional Awareness by The Dalai Lama and Paul Ekman / https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Awareness-Overcoming-Psychological-Compassion/dp/0805090215\nOther Resources Mentioned:\nTheravada Tradition / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation#Contemporary_Therav%C4%81da\nTonglen Practice / https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-tonglen/\nFor a limited time, we're offering a 40% discount on a year-long subscription to the app. Visit tenpercent.com/podcast40 to get your discount and get support for your meditation practice today.\nThis promotion is only available to users without a current Ten Percent Happier app subscription.\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nWe want to deeply thank and recognize healthcare workers, teachers, warehouse workers, grocery and food delivery workers for the essential role that they play in our lives.
