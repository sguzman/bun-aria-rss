  "title": "Bill Burr, If I Had A Billion Dollars, and Stephen Hawking Conspiracy Theories",
  "description": "<p><p>Bill Burr comes through to talk about how the Yankees aren't even really a rival anymore, Tom Brady's late night pillow talk with Gisele and what it's like to perform in front of 20,000 people. Someone is gonna win $1 BILLION and we really need it to be a stoolie. Stephen Hawking is a fraud who should've just started his own religion. Voicemails include: being vegan or fighting Teletubbies, getting deleted on social, and WYR: always have to repeat songs or never be able to repeat songs?</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
