  "description": "Vote for us for Best Sports Podcast and Best Male-Hosted Podcast! http://podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nWelcome to tiers week! And welcome to Scott Fish Bowl week! It's a fun time for Fantasy Football fans, and we're bringing on an awesome guest Joe Pisapia of FantasyPros to talk about quarterback tiers. Heath unveils his tiers and Joe tells us what really stood out at first glance (5:30). We also have some QB news and notes before we get into some observations and strategies (17:00) and the tier that we usually draft from (24:00). Heath and Adam seems to like Tier 2 and Tier 3 in drafts, often snagging Jalen Hurts, Lamar Jackson and Russell Wilson ... We go through Tier 1 (30:45) and Tier 2 (31:15) and discuss what separates them. We spend some time talking about Kyler Murray's upside and Tom Brady's as well. Then we move on Tier 3 (38:30) and get into Joe Burrow a little before getting to Tier 4 (45:30) which is a little bit boring with Matthew Stafford, Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers ... Tier 5 is where things get fun (47:40)! We've got an upside tier with some of the young guys and a floor tier with some veterans. Where does Derek Carr fit in? We finish by talking about Tiers 6 and 7 (53:00) and then Adam ranks the Thor movies in a very controversial way (57:40) before Joe and Heath make their picks in the Scott Fish Bowl (1:05:15) ...
