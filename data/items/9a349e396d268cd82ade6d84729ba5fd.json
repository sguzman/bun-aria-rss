  "title": "Can Chuck Schumer's flip phone save America? | Tell Me More",
  "description": "Democrats have the slimmest of majorities in the United States Senate, and it’s up to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep his caucus together. He has to manage moderates, such as Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, while at the same time dealing with progressives to his left. And, he’s up for reelection in 2022 and would rather not face a primary challenge from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Vox reporter Li Zhou (@liszhou) recently interviewed Schumer. She and host Emily Stewart discuss the New York Democrat’s political style — which includes lots of personal calls to lawmakers on his flip phone — and how he hopes to accomplish “big, bold change” in the coming months.\n\nTell Me More is hosted by Emily Stewart and produced by Sofi LaLonde.\n\nEnjoyed this episode?
