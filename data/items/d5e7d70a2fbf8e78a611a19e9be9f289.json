  "description": "Over the last 50 years an estimated 46 million girls have been aborted in India. \n\nThe cultural preference for boys and the development of pre-natal sex determination tests like ultrasound in the 1980s, meant an increase in the number of girls being aborted.   \n\nActivist Manisha Gupte describes how she campaigned, as part of the feminist movement, against sex-selective abortion - including the use of sit-ins and rallies - eventually raising enough awareness to bring about a national law in 1994 - the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act.\n\nThe legislation has had limited effect in a complex society with entrenched male preference and poverty.\n\nManisha has been speaking to Josephine McDermott. \n\n(Photo: Campaigners rally against fetal sex selection in Mumbai in the 1980s.
