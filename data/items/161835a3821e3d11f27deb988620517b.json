  "description": "Today we talk about the things that really make the open concept work and how to define those spaces. We discuss our opinions on open concept versus segmentation of rooms and the benefits or advantages of each. We bring up the fact that an open concept can often get loud, so we provide solutions for ways to dampen that sound like adding drapes and rugs to absorb the sound. We answer a question about how to create more intimacy in an open floor plan by using rugs and good, creative space planning. We talk about how large rooms usually turn into a space of multiple smaller conversations and how that can help optimize the space. <br /><br />Open concept vs. segmentation of rooms 2:11<br />How to dampen sound when things get noisy 5:13<br />Tips on how to create more intimacy on an open floor plan 14:27<br />The Keeping Room 22:10<br />Should the flooring all be the same? Or should there be transitions between the spaces? 24:42<br /><br />“The more you can kind of angle things in there in an interesting conversation, people can sit down and naturally see each other’s faces and not be squared off like soldiers. And the room should look like it’s having a conversation even without humans in it.” 16:18<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
