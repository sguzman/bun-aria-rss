  "description": "<p>This week we welcome Justo Eiroa from JRE Tobacco to the show for the first time. You may recall he was scheduled to be on the show once before, but with a Hurricane about to hit Miami he flew back to the city to be with his family and we admire that almost as much as the cigars.</p>\n<p>This week we will light up the Aladino Maduro which will get it’s word-wide release on The Cigar Authority. It’s about in four sizes, three of which are box pressed. The lone traditional round format is the Lancero. Which size will we smoke on the show? Tune in to find out as we share our thoughts.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we light up an event only cigar that can be obtained only at JRE Tobacco events. We will share the blend info, and give our thoughts on this rare stick.</p>\n<p>We also have Cigar News, a trip into the Asylum and the Classic 3 Way on the number one listened to Cigar Podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
