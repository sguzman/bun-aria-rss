  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak to Mike who is from Idaho and describes a strange encounter he had with a Sasquatch while out on a hunting trip. Mike just returned from active service and went on a family hunting trip when their tent was pushed over. The men stepped out of the fallen tent to see a creature about 30 feet away. Mike said \"I had no idea what it was, it ran off and I gave chase\"</p>",
