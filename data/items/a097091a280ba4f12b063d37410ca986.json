  "description": "<p>Don't forget to subscribe, rate five stars, and leave a review!\n\nWe kick off today's episode talking about how we feel about recording the podcast in quarantine and whether or not we think people will give up on fashion post lockdown. We explore the hypothetical about genocide. Which show should you watch first, The Office or It's Always Sunny? We talk about how unexpectedly great Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix is. We also bring back f*ck-ems. It's AITA Thursday, this week we have the man who can't stop getting into fight at waffle house and the man who asks his wife to start wearing a maxi pad to bed. Voicemails include: Quarantine Thirst Traps, Fish in the Garbage, and dumb school punishments.\n\nJimmy O. Yang joins the show. We talk about his new stand up special Good Deal on Amazon, his professional ping pong career, and the art he got from the Silicon Valley set. He tells us what it was like working on Space Force and how he was able to help get a role for his dad on it. He also gives us an exclusive look at his band The Yellow Panthers new song.\n\nSnooki & Joey return to the show. Snooki tells us why she left the Jersey Shore, Joey tells an outrageous story about having an \"oopsie\" in quarantine, we talk about Britney Spears casually burning down her gym, and much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
