  "description": "<p>This week on the podcast we are joined by our friend, the truly hilarious actor and comedian Paul Brittain, who you might know from \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Trophy Wife\" or a sketch based on \"Three Men And A Baby\" back in Chicago many years ago that Vanessa is still obsessed with. In that spirit, this episode includes Vanessa and Paul recounting their halycon days of cutting their teeth in the Windy City comedy scene, us all reminiscing about the way that seemingly carefree sitcoms used to tackle serious issues and Jonah being impressed that Paul saw the post-hardcore act Hum back in the nineties. For the main event, we recall the convenience of the print version of TV Guide and the frustration of the endlessly scrolling TV Guide channel, the story of which we hope is someday made into a made-for-TV movie (meta). We also play a captivating round of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" where we discuss grocery store etiquette, loud television commercials and whether baseball players should charge kids for their autographs. We dare you to find another podcast that covers everyone from Mario Lopez to Mike Hargrove, but if you do, we might just buy your ticket to a charity spaghetti dinner. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
