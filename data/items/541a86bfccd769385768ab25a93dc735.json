  "description": "On this episode: Elizabeth, Zak, and Jamilah answer a question from a listener who is feeling left behind by her friends who are parents. She says she’s really tried to be supportive and isn’t receiving support in return, especially when she’s celebrating accomplishments like earning a PhD and publishing her first album. All of this has left her feeling that she’s worth less if she doesn’t have a kid. Is there a way to rekindle the relationships? \nRecommendations: \nZak recommends watching The Lost Daughter. \nJamilah recommends picking up The Emergency: A Year of Healing and Heartbreak in a Chicago ER by Thomas Fisher. \nElizabeth recommends planting a window box with Back to the Roots or Kiwico.  \nJoin us on Facebook and email us at momanddad@slate.com to ask us new questions, tell us what you thought of today’s show, and give us ideas about what we should talk about in future episodes. \nPodcast produced by Rosemary Belson. \nSlate Plus members get a bonus segment on MADAF each week, and no ads.
