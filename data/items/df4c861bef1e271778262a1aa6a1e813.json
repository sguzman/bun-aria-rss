  "description": "<p>Many of us were taught that eating dietary fat makes us fat and leads to heart disease. This assumption has been catastrophic for our health. In fact, fats are essential for optimal health, and saturated fat, specifically, is not the boogeyman we once thought. We know now that there is no monolithic saturated fat. There are many saturated fats, each with its own effects. The saturated fat in coconut, for instance is different from the saturated fat in butter.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman talks with neurologist Dr. David Perlmutter about how saturated fat came to get such a bad rap. They dive into many of the ways the right saturated fats are beneficial to your health and discuss why, what Dr. Hyman calls “sweet fat,” is so harmful.</p><br><p>*A Note on Fat: While a high fat diet does not work for everyone, we now know that fat is not the enemy it was previously made out to be. Some people do well with less fats and some do better with more fats.
