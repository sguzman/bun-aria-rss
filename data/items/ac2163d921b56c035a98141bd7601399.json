  "title": "A Simple Estimate for Pythagorean Exponents",
  "content": "Given the number of runs scored and runs allowed by a baseball team, what's a good estimate for that team's win fraction? Bill James famously came up with what he called the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation\">Pythagorean expectation</a>\" \\[w = \\frac{R^2}{R^2 + A^2},\\] which can also be written as \\[w = \\frac{{(R/A)}^2}{{(R/A)}^2 + 1}.\\] More generally, if team \\(i\\) scores \\(R_i\\) and allows \\(A_i\\) runs, the Pythagorean estimate for the probability of team \\(1\\) beating team \\(2\\) is \\[w = \\frac{{(R_1/A_1)}^2}{{(R_1/A_1)}^2 + (R_2/A_2)^2}.\\] We can see that the estimate of the team's win fraction is a consequence of this, as an average team would by definition have \\(R_2 = A_2\\). Now, there's nothing magical about the exponent being 2; it's a coincidence, and in fact is not even the \"best\" exponent. But what's a good way to estimate the exponent? Note the structural similarity of this win probability estimator and the Bradley-Terry estimator \\[ w = \\frac{P_1}{P_1+P_2}.\\] Here the \\(P_i\\) are what we could call the \"Bradley-Terry power\" of the team. This immediately suggests one way to estimate the expectation model's exponent - fit a Bradley-Terry model, then fit the log-linear regression \\(\\log(P_i)\\) vs \\(\\log(R_i/A_i)\\). The slope of this regression will be one estimate for the expectation exponent.<br /><br />How well does this work?
