  "description": "<p>In this 111th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we talk about Covid, again. We talk about how our public health authorities talk about it, and whether VAERS is reliable, and how we would know. The Oregon Health Authority assures us that we “only have to wait five months” for a booster now. We talk about consilience, and how to assess claims of truth. We show a 2,000 year old skull out of Peru that has been…modified; and we show some street art out of DC. We talk about chicken that is actually plants; the successful Wari empire in pre-Incan South America who threw parties at which a combination of alcohol and hallucinogens were served; sperm whales learning how to avoid whalers; and a vast icefish breeding colony in Antarctica. <br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is available from https://darvillsbookstore.indielite.org, (and everywhere books are sold, including amazon), but they have sold out of signed copies.<br/><br/>Check out our store!
