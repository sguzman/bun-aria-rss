  "description": "President Biden is on his second international trip. He started this weekend at the G20 in Rome and is now in Glasgow for the COP26. The trip has already proven productive with President Biden advancing the global corporate minimum tax and striking a new US-EU Steel and Aluminum trade deal. He smoothed over relations with France. And made it clear the US wants to lead on climate. But what more should be done? What more can be done given US domestic politics? David Rothkopf discusses the near and long-term implications of these meetings with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center, and Ben Pauker of Politico. You won't want to miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
