Rural residents of Oregon are fed up with the entire western half of the state and look to join Idaho. Things get awkward on \"The View\" as Whoopi's former co-star finds out she won't be in \"Sister Act 3.\" And, the Alabama-Tennessee game this weekend actually matters for the first time since before the iPhone came out.\nSponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold & Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU.
