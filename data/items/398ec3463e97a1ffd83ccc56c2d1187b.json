  "description": "I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 17\n\nBrandon Marshall and D.J. Williams welcome Bun B, Arian Foster, Kendrick Perkins and Lil’ Keke to the show as they discuss Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, as well as the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to the music industry. \n\nArian Foster opens up saying he believes Barry Sanders is the G.O.A.T when it comes to the NFL. The group immediately responds with their opinions starting out with D.J. explaining how Tom Brady is an absolute leader and has the seven rings to back him up. Bun B jokes around and says that D.J. has no idea what kind of battery he is putting in Keke’s back right now since Lil’ Keke is a big Tom Brady fanatic. He says “You’re the energizer bunny right now.” \n\nBrandon asks the group which musical artist is most similar to Tom Brady, as well as Aaron Rodgers. Bun B explains how Tom Brady is most related to Jay Z, while Aaron Rodgers is most similar to Naz. He explains how most new quarterbacks inspire to be Tom Brady, similar to rapper inspiring to be Jay Z. He says Aaron Rodgers is most similar to Naz because he doesn’t love the spotlight and then he goes back in the shadows when he’s off the field. \n\nBun B shifts the conversation forward and talks about how easy it is nowadays to get your music to the consumers. He explains how Jay Z used the rap to perpetuate other business details that made him a billionaire. The same thing happened to P Diddy. Bun B says that most people would rather be famous, than be rich. Brandon laughs and says that they might need to break down this show and turn it into a Part 2.\n\n\nWATCH MORE → https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qMMCxdNfU6cwpaXZOyUSg\nSUBSCRIBE → https://www.youtube.com/c/IAMATHLETE\n\nFollow I AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathlete/?hl=en\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/i-am-athlete\n\nFollow HOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/\nHoA Supplements: https://houseofathlete.com/supplements\n\n\n#IAMATHLETE #BiggerThanAPodcast #BrandonMarshall #D.JWilliams#Kendrick Perkins #BunB #LilKeke #ArianFoster\n\n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY)\n \n1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 1-877-770-STOP (7867) (LA), visit OPGR.org (OR), call/text TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).\n21+ (18+ NH/WY). \n\nPhysically present in AZ/CO/CT/IL/IN/IA/LA/MI/NH/NJ/NY/OR/PA/TN/VA/WV/WY only.
