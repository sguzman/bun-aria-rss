  "description": "<p>We propose a new variant of Chubanov's method for solving the feasibility\nproblem over the symmetric cone by extending Roos's method (2018) of solving\nthe feasibility problem over the nonnegative orthant. The proposed method\nconsiders a feasibility problem associated with a norm induced by the maximum\neigenvalue of an element and uses a rescaling focusing on the upper bound for\nthe sum of eigenvalues of any feasible solution to the problem. Its\ncomputational bound is (i) equivalent to that of Roos's original method (2018)\nand superior to that of Louren\\c{c}o et al.'s method (2019) when the symmetric\ncone is the nonnegative orthant, (ii) superior to that of Louren\\c{c}o et al.'s\nmethod (2019) when the symmetric cone is a Cartesian product of second-order\ncones, (iii) equivalent to that of Louren\\c{c}o et al.'s method (2019) when the\nsymmetric cone is the simple positive semidefinite cone, and (iv) superior to\nthat of Pena and Soheili's method (2017) for any simple symmetric cones under\nthe feasibility assumption of the problem imposed in Pena and Soheili's method\n(2017). We also conduct numerical experiments that compare the performance of\nour method with existing methods by generating instances in three types:\nstrongly (but ill-conditioned) feasible instances, weakly feasible instances,\nand infeasible instances. For any of these instances, the proposed method is\nrather more efficient than the existing methods in terms of accuracy and\nexecution time.\n</p>",
