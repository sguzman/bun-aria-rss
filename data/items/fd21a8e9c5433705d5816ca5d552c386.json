  "description": "<p>Many adversarial attack methods achieve satisfactory attack success rates\nunder the white-box setting, but they usually show poor transferability when\nattacking other DNN models. Momentum-based attack is one effective method to\nimprove transferability. It integrates the momentum term into the iterative\nprocess, which can stabilize the update directions by adding the gradients'\ntemporal correlation for each pixel. We argue that only this temporal momentum\nis not enough, the gradients from the spatial domain within an image, i.e.\ngradients from the context pixels centered on the target pixel are also\nimportant to the stabilization. For that, we propose a novel method named\nSpatial Momentum Iterative FGSM attack (SMI-FGSM), which introduces the\nmechanism of momentum accumulation from temporal domain to spatial domain by\nconsidering the context information from different regions within the image.\nSMI-FGSM is then integrated with temporal momentum to simultaneously stabilize\nthe gradients' update direction from both the temporal and spatial domains.\nExtensive experiments show that our method indeed further enhances adversarial\ntransferability. It achieves the best transferability success rate for multiple\nmainstream undefended and defended models, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin of 10\\% on average.\n</p>",
