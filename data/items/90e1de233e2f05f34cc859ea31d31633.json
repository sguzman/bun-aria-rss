  "description": "<p><strong>This week, Connor and Dan are rolling back the clock to the time of antiquity to talk about Hypatia, one of the most famous female philosophers in history.  Oddly enough, Hypatia is almost as famous for her death as she is for what she accomplished in her life. To find out why you'll have to listen! Also discussed: Dan being a baseball boy, Laura Dern's age when she was making Jurassic Park, and whether or not you're allowed to masturbate if you're celibate (really asking the tough questions this week). Enjoy!</strong></p>",
