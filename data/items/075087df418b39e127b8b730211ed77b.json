  "description": "<p>Real estate is sexy… most of the time. But is that really what makes it profitable? On today’s show, we sit down with&nbsp;<strong>Charles Roberts</strong>, an investor and agent from the Denver market. He explains that the secret to success is far more boring than we like to admit. In this episode, we explore Charles’s story and the lessons he’s learned over his 20+ year career, including how his first deal failed miserably, how he helped another investor retire through rentals in just five years, and his strong belief that the deal isn’t as important as most investors think — plus so much more! Charles is incredibly wise, and he has years of experience — so this is one episode that you’ll come back to time and time again.</p><p>In This Episode We Cover:</p><ul><li>How Charles got started by buying his&nbsp;<strong>first duplex</strong></li><li>A&nbsp;<strong>15-year loan</strong>&nbsp;vs. a 30-year loan</li><li>How he managed to go full time as a&nbsp;<strong>fix-and-flipper</strong></li><li>What<strong>&nbsp;went wrong</strong>&nbsp;— despite having 29 properties</li><li>Should&nbsp;<strong>newbies</strong>&nbsp;get into flipping?</li><li>Figuring out&nbsp;<strong>what works</strong>&nbsp;and what doesn’t</li><li>What Charles looks for<strong>&nbsp;in a partner</strong></li><li>The benefits of helping someone else achieve&nbsp;<strong>success in real estate</strong></li><li><strong>Scaling</strong>, and what he thinks about it</li><li>Why<strong>&nbsp;lending</strong>&nbsp;is important in real estate</li><li>Work&nbsp;<strong>harder</strong>&nbsp;not smarter</li><li>Where is he<strong>&nbsp;finding deals</strong></li><li><strong>And SO much more!</strong></li></ul><p>Links from the Show</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/forums\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Forums</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/nomoneysuccess\" target=\"_blank\">Share your story to the No Money Book</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/store\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Store</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.daveramsey.com/mortgage-calculator\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Ramsey’s Calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.sho.com/billions\" target=\"_blank\">Billions TV Series</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/biggerpockets-podcast-274-because-of-these-3-simple-rules-ive-bought-over-600-units-and-never-lost-money-with-paul-morris/\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Podcast 274: “Because of These 3 Simple Rules, I’ve Bought Over 600 Units and Never Lost Money” with Paul Morris</a></li></ul><p>Books Mentioned in this Show</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/richdadpoordad\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em></a>&nbsp;by Robert Kiyosaki</li><li><a href=\"http://get.biggerpockets.com/nomoneydown/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Book on Investing with Low or No Money Down</em></a>&nbsp;by Brandon Turner</li><li><a href=\"http://get.biggerpockets.com/flippingbook/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Book on Flipping Houses</em></a>&nbsp;by J.
