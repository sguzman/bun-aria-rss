  "description": "<p>In this 124th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss the biology, geology, and conservation of the Bahamas, particularly the Exumas islands. How do parrotfish turn coral into sand, what’s up with tropicbirds, and what does it mean that all Caribbean beaches have trash on them? Apologies for the sound quality during the videos.</p><p> </p><p>We also discuss the lifting of federal mask mandates on transportation; the White House arguing that “affirmative care” for children who say they are transgender is “best practice”; the new czar of disinformation, brought to you by the Department of Homeland Security; and whether our President is fit for office. Finally, we spend a few minutes talking about ancient children playing in the footprints of giant sloths, and whether Indiana Jones was correct in suggesting that little scorpions are scarier than big ones.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Ned: is a CBD company that uses USDA certified organic full spectrum hemp oil, and creates specialty blends to help with stress and sleep.
