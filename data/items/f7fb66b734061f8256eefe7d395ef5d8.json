  "description": "An interview with Hillary Jordan and Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, editors of Anonymous Sex, a collection of 27 explicit sex stories unattributed to the 27 writers listed in the byline. Cheryl, Hillary, and I discuss how exactly you get writers like Louise Erdrich, Rebecca Makkai, Helen Oyeyemi, and Robert Olen Butler to contribute a story when the conceit is sex. We talk about the problem with stale erotica and the search for fresh language with which to talk about sex and desire, the necessity of understanding sex as culturally constructed, and so much more.\nHillary Recommends:\n\nMichael Cunningham, Flesh and Blood\n\n\n----. A Home at the End of the World\n\n\nCheryl Recommends:\n\nFumiko Enchi, Masks\n\n\n----. The Waiting Years\n\n\nThe Novels of Muriel Spark\n\n\nChris Holmes is Chair of Literatures in English and Associate Professor at Ithaca College. He writes criticism on contemporary global literatures. His book, Kazuo Ishiguro as World Literature, is under contract with Bloomsbury Publishing.
