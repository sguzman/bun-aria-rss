  "description": "The pandemic has upended the art and business of making music. Producing, performing and releasing — every aspect is new and uncharted. The need for social distancing means that it’s unsafe to collaborate in small studios or perform for large crowds — not to mention finding the right thing to sing about in such a charged moment. We’re telling three stories about how artists are working within these constraints: Ricky Reed and John-Robert have found a way to generate a creative spark remotely, Jacob Collier has defied the laws of physics to master live performance over the internet, and Dua Selah has released a powerful new track that helps support the protests in Minneapolis. Everything is radically different than it was a few months ago, but these stories shine a light on why making music matters more than ever 2020. \n\nLinks to resources discussed:\nhttps://switchedonpop.com/\n\nHost:\nArielle Duhaime-Ross (@adrs), host and lead reporter of Reset\n\nAbout Recode by Vox:\nRecode by Vox helps you understand how tech is changing the world — and changing us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
