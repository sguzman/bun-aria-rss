  "description": "<p>Willie Wright is 63 and lives alone in Cleveland, Ohio while his daughter Lauren lives over 500 miles away in North Carolina. We listen as they talk about the future and how they’ll manage as Willie gets older.&nbsp;Then we meet Iris Yafuso Toguchi, who relies on Kupuna Care, a Hawaiian state program for caregivers, to keep her mother, Irene, at home. Registered nurse Rudy Sukna has spent 20 years working at one of the largest nursing homes in New York.&nbsp;Despite staffing issues, dangerous working conditions, and losing many of his patients to COVID, Rudy still believes nursing homes are a good option for seniors. Finally, we meet Sylvia Mendoza who struggled to find her late mother, Lupe, a nursing home that felt like home... then she discovered The Green House Project.</p><p>Disclaimers:</p><p>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
