  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Mary Challman of the \"Monster Movie Happy Hour Podcast\", Patrick McGuire of the \"History Things Podcast\", and newcomer Kaleb Kuzmierczyk to discuss one of the most interesting topics in the American history field today: the practice of Living History compared to the hobby of war reenacting. All of the guests on this episode have had experience with both topics in the past, and get into an important discussion on the differences between the two, the pros and cons of each, and how both play into this very uncertain present timeline. The banter gets real and ,at times, hilarious. Also, Avery expresses his love for the hit show \"Peaky Blinders\". Enjoy!</p>",
