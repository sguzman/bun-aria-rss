Karen has a space heater, and she keeps pointing the thing DIRECTLY at her computer. She manages to melt 3 separate computers this way, and she also gets annoyed at OP when he shows up to fix it. Is she so stupid that she doesn't realize that she's melting the computers, or is she actually devious because she's doing it on purpose as an excuse to avoid work?</p>\n",
