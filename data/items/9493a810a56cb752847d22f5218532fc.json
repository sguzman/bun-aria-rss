  "description": "With all eyes on the impeachment hearings this week, we take a step back to reframe the discussion about Trump shake-down of the Ukrainian government in terms of the damage that was done to U.S. national security interests and those of our allies.  Congress voted money to Ukraine not as a gift, but to enable them to defend against an active invasion by Russia.  Withholding that money put lives and Ukraine’s stability at risk.  The case is just one illustration of a broader series of decisions by the Trump team that have put America and Americans in danger—from the green light given to the Turks to invade Syria thereby strengthening ISIS, Russia, Iran and the Syrians to seeking to cut a deal and leave Afghanistan to the Taliban, from bungling the North Korea negotiation to gift after gift after gift given to the Russians.  We discuss with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the top Democratic foreign policy leaders and thinkers in Washington.  Don’t miss this special episode of DSR.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
