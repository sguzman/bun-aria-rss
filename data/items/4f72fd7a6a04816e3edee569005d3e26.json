  "description": "<p>In this 87th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss why SARS-CoV2 must be driven to extinction, why the currently available vaccines are unlikely to be able to do so, and why we therefore need additional tools in our toolkit. We address and rebut the recent Quillette article, which contained copious journalistic and scientific errors, and excluded evidence relevant to the questions under discussion. A written response will be published soon as well. Finally, we share an excerpt from A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, chapter 4 (Medicine). </p><p>Get your Goliath shirts right here: <a href='http://store.darkhorsepodcast.org'>store.darkhorsepodcast.org</a></p><p>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
