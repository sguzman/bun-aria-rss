  "description": "Our audiobook this week is LOVE LETTERS by Sarah Ready\n\nEnemies in life…in love by letter. For fans of You’ve Got Mail and The Shop Around the Corner.\n\nDo you remember those stories where a lonely, single, yet surprisingly attractive woman finds a romantic letter and starts writing a hunky man from the past, only to fall in love?\n\nYeah. That’s not this story.\n\nBelieve me. I spend my days archiving stunningly romantic three-hundred-year-old love letters. If it could happen to anyone, it would be me.\n\nBut these archived letters have given me the basis for a list of true-love requirements. The man I fall for must be: sensitive, smart, love history, be kind to little old ladies and stray dogs alike, and…be the exact opposite of Corbin Ryan – lover of finance, efficiency, and crushing dreams.\n\nPlenty of people, aka everyone, says my list is unrealistic. I may have agreed, except I’m holding a letter in my hand. I found it in a library book, written by a stranger, and he’s everything I’ve ever said I wanted.\n\nUnlike all the stories, he’s real. The only trouble is, the more we write, the more I begin to question, can you really, truly fall in love with a man you’ve never met? And what happens when you finally write, P.S. Let’s Meet.\n\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/33Sgx3V\nJosh and Gemma Make a Baby: https://bit.ly/3tZnATa\n\nOTHER BOOKS MENTIONED\nTrilina Pucci - Sinning Like Hell\nMasters of Ménage Series\nColters&#039; Legacy Series\nMunro by Kresley Cole\n\nOTHER MENTIONS\nLove During LockUp\nInstagram: Stephs Romance Book Talk\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
