    "media:description": "“We have been to the moon, we have charted the depths of the ocean and the heart of the atom, but we have a fear of looking inward to ourselves because we sense that is where all the contradictions flow together.” – Terence McKenna\n\nThis one was inspired after a chat I had with the magnificent mystiverse. He makes wonderful stuff  ► https://www.youtube.com/c/mystiverse\nTo hear all this stuff explained better than me (though admittedly with less cats) ► https://youtu.be/uhRhtFFhNzQ\nIt was also heavily influenced by Chrstof Koch’s brilliant ‘Consciousness: Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist’ (which I suggest you give a read if you’d like to) ► https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13557108-consciousness\n\nDiscord server ► https://discord.gg/76ybBSR \nT-shirts, mugs, and sadness ► https://teespring.com/stores/exurb1a (just in case that doesn’t work: discord.gg/exurb1a)\nThe Fifth Science Paperback ► https://tinyurl.com/y5zj33s5 (you may need to change your region accordingly: .co.uk, etc) \nThe rest of my books ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3\nI also make horrendous music ► https://soundcloud.com/exurbia-1\n For sending personalised insults ► https://www.facebook.com/exurb1a/ \nHelp me to do this full-time if you're deranged enough ► https://www.patreon.com/exurb1r?ty=h \n\nThe music was provided by the bad boy of musical impressionism himself, Ravel ►  https://youtu.be/r30D3SW4OVw\n\nAlso, Skinner/Skinner, Seagulls Circling ► https://youtu.be/qNvIbuXQ1Ng",
