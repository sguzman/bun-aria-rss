  "description": "<p>“I feel like very often when we have stories about womanizing characters, whether we piece those stories out, so we see each woman—individually or not, they don't really have stories. They don't really have lives except as they relate to that main character. So, it was always going to be each woman steps forward, each woman gets a chapter.” Laura Warrell takes us behind the scenes of her smart, sharp and deeply resonant debut novel <em><a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sweet-soft-plenty-rhythm-laura-warrell/1140674645?ean=9780593316443\">Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm</a>. </em>She joins us on the show to talk about flipping the script, the women she writes about (and letting her characters be who they are), love and loneliness, her writing process and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer. And we end this episode with TBR Topoff book recommendations from Marc and Becky. </p> <p> </p> <p>Featured Books (Episode): </p> <p><em>Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm</em> by Laura Warrell </p> <p><em>Gorilla, My Love</em> by Toni Cade Bambara </p> <p> </p> <p>Featured Books (TBR Topoff): </p> <p><em>Juliet, Naked</em> by Nick Hornby</p> <p><em>Utopia Avenue</em> by David Mitchell</p> <p> </p> <p>Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang.
