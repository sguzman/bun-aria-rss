  "description": "We know that Americans in blue states are getting vaccinated at higher rates than those in red ones. But that gap obscures another growing divide in America's vaccine campaign — the divide <em>within </em>states between rural and urban areas. An NPR analysis of county-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that divide exists across age groups in almost every state. NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/964574083/austin-fast\">Austin Fast</a> explains why. <br/><br/>The Biden administration says it's making progress on closing the gap. Their focus is on getting as many people vaccinated as possible. But public health officials tell NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/279612138/geoff-brumfiel\">Geoff Brumfiel</a> that the U.S. may never reach 'herd immunity.'  <br/><br/>Additional reporting in this episode from <a href=\"https://www.wlrn.org/people/veronica-zaragovia\">Veronica Zaragovia</a> of member station WLRN in Miami. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
