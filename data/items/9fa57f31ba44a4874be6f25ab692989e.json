  "description": "<p>How can we augment a dynamic graph for improving the performance of dynamic\ngraph neural networks? Graph augmentation has been widely utilized to boost the\nlearning performance of GNN-based models. However, most existing approaches\nonly enhance spatial structure within an input static graph by transforming the\ngraph, and do not consider dynamics caused by time such as temporal locality,\ni.e., recent edges are more influential than earlier ones, which remains\nchallenging for dynamic graph augmentation. In this work, we propose TiaRa\n(Time-aware Random Walk Diffusion), a novel diffusion-based method for\naugmenting a dynamic graph represented as a discrete-time sequence of graph\nsnapshots. For this purpose, we first design a time-aware random walk proximity\nso that a surfer can walk along the time dimension as well as edges, resulting\nin spatially and temporally localized scores. We then derive our diffusion\nmatrices based on the time-aware random walk, and show they become enhanced\nadjacency matrices that both spatial and temporal localities are augmented.\nThroughout extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TiaRa effectively\naugments a given dynamic graph, and leads to significant improvements in\ndynamic GNN models for various graph datasets and tasks.\n</p>",
