We answer that and more on today’s episode of Unapologetic where we defend truth without comprise with Dr Bobby Conway the One Minute Apologist, and Tim Hull. \n\nA Christian member of the Finnish Parliament is facing six years imprisonment for sharing her opinion on marriage and human sexuality on social media, on television, and in a pamphlet. The politician, who is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and former chair of the Christian Democrats, has been under police investigation since June 2019 for publicly voicing her opinion on marriage and human sexuality in a 2004 pamphlet, for comments made on a 2018 TV show, and a tweet directed at her church leadership. This is one of many issues. \n\nOthers include Josh Duggar is being charged with possession of Child Porn, the United Methodist church installs a self-proclaimed drag queen as a pastor, and Hillsong Creative director resigns after an inappropriate photo was discovered. \n\nTake the OMA Mental Health Crash Course <a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/mhcc </a>\n\nTake the OMA Apologetics Crash Course \n<a href='https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc'>https://oneminuteapologist.com/acc</a>\n\n<a href='https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist'> https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteapologist </a>\n\nDo you ever doubt your ability to answer bigger-than-life questions like, “Why do I exist? What is the purpose of life? Can I know God? If so, how? Are miracles possible?” And if God exists what’s with all the evil in the world? Do questions like these ever nag at you? If so, you’ve come to the right podcast. \n\nI too am a fellow wonderer who thinks about stuff like this. I (Bobby Conway) am the founder and host of the rapidly-growing ministry, The One Minute Apologist, which is found on YouTube and at oneminuteapologist.com. Here I provide quick, credible answers to apologetic questions that resource people with a hunger to defend their Christian faith. These videos will often include interviews. I’ve had the privilege of interviewing some of the world's leading Christian apologists. Among them are: William Lane Craig, Josh McDowell, Hank Hanegraaff, JP Moreland, Norman Geisler, Frank Turek, and many more. \n\n#purityculture #apologetics #christianapologetics #oneminapologist #Christianity #God #bobbyconway #doubtingGod #doubtingJesus #doubtingtowardfaith</p>\n",
