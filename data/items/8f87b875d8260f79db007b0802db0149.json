  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mask mandates are returning and you aren’t allowed to question it. This is how “science” works now. Namely, like religious dogma. Also we have our five headlines including the Capitol officers continuing their media tour, a former president of Planned Parenthood says she was shocked to discover that Planned Parenthood only cares about abortion, and gender theory begins to make in roads into medical school. In our Daily Cancellation, I will respond to the outraged masses that have been trying to cancel me over the past two days. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
