  "description": "<p>EPISODE 69 - TURNING THE TABLES - No Country for Old Men</p> <p>Team Deakins has the tables turned on them! Cinematographer Greig Fraser and actor Josh Brolin ask the questions in this episode. We covered a lot about the movie and looked in detail at seven scenes in the movie. The conversation also went in some unplanned areas - we learned, among other things, how Greig hates the script slug line “evening”, what it was like working with Kelly McDonald, how important trust is when working on a film, and what the experience of shooting No Country for Old Men was like for Josh. Happy accidents, our favorite scene in the film, and the relationship between actor and DP were also talked about. And much, much more! There is a companion PDF for this episode that lists the clips we discussed and when they appear in the film. Don’t miss this special episode - there’s a lot in it. <a href= \"https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/teamdeakins/ClipList-NCFOM-sm2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD PDF.</a></p> <p>REQUIRED EPISODE VIEWING: No Country for Old Men</p>",
