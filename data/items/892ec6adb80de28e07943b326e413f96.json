  "title": "Look At Selena Gomez Now with Justin Tranter & Ian Kirkpatrick",
  "description": "Selena Gomez has her first #1 song on the Hot 100. “Lose You To Love Me” is a confessional look at her past five years of heartbreak and health challenges. By contrast, her single “Look At Her Now” is a testament to moving on and moving up. Each of these songs inhabits a different musical and lyrical world and we were lucky to get to speak with her collaborators on the songs to take us behind the scenes of how they came to be. Justin Tranter and Ian Kirkpatrick are two of today’s most in-demand writers. They walk us through how Selena takes her personal emotions and translates them into public catharsis on her album “Rare.”\nSongs Discussed\n\nSelena Gomez - Vulnerable, Lose You To Love Me, Look At Her Now\n\nCrash Test Dummies - Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmmm\n\nDua Lipa - New Rules\n\n\nMore\nWatch Selena Gomez interviewed by Zane Lowe on Beats One.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
