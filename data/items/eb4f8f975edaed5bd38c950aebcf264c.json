  "description": "<p>Our staff picks continue at Here’s The Thing, where every other week throughout the summer, members of our team select their favorite interviews from the archives. This week, we revisit Alec’s 2013 interview with acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Columbus. As a director, Columbus has brought to life some of the biggest American family films in history: <em>Adventures in Babysitting, Home Alone</em>, and <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>. He also wrote the screenplays of <em>Gremlins </em>and <em>The Goonies</em>, and produced and directed the first two <em>Harry Potter </em>films. Despite this success, Columbus admits that he “always, to this day, [feels] like [he’s] gonna walk on a movie and get fired.” He reveals to Alec what it was like working with brilliant improvisers like John Candy and Robin Williams, how he got his start writing while working nights in an aluminum factory and why it’s important to him to keep a low-profile. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
