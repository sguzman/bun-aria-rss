  "description": "<p>Josie Bassett Morris' life epitomised the Wild West. She grew up on a homestead in the late 18th century, in Northern Utah, USA. Their home was situated on the Outlaw Trail and gun-slingers like Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid would stay as they passed through. Her mother was a forbidding cattle rancher and Josie quickly learnt the trade. As an adult, she was known for her quick wit, hardy lifestyle on the land and the many husbands she got through- she was smart, self-reliant and kind; a force they struggled to reckon with. As an older woman, she set up her home in the wilderness of Cub Creek where she lived completely off the land, stealing nearby cattle when she needed meat. When the depression hit, she brewed her own corn whiskey to sell. In the mid-20th century, she became a living legend - a movie starring Doris Day was even made about her- and she remains a legend of the old west to this day.</p><br><p>While in the USA, Dan took a visit to the Uintah Heritage Museum in Vernal, where he spoke with curator LeeAnn Denzer about life on the frontier and Josie Bassett Morris' extraordinary life.</p><br><p>You can find out more about the museum and the history of the frontier at the <a href=\"https://www.uintahmuseum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UINTAH COUNTY HERITAGE MUSEUM website</a>.</p><br><p>It was produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore.</p><br><p>If you'd like to learn more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad-free podcasts and audiobooks at History Hit - <a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?campaignid=11324364895&adgroupid=117838458464&adid=473305596461&utm_term=history%20hit&utm_campaign=OD+%7C+Search+%7C+Brand+%7C+Worldwide&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=7076869466&hsa_cam=11324364895&hsa_grp=117838458464&hsa_ad=473305596461&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-408408651291&hsa_kw=history%20hit&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjw9NeXBhAMEiwAbaY4lgMEKV8eZZQp58c2CfmB3IA4jjzhZE9ZD8LMusfifXDcPJ48Xzx_1BoCwGkQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to History Hit</a> today!</p><br><p>To download the History Hit app please go to the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.historyhit&hl=en_GB&gl=US\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> or <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/history-hit/id1303668247\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> store.</p><br><p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/podcasts-survey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Complete the survey</a> and you'll be entered into a prize draw to win 5 Historical Non-Fiction Books- including a signed copy of Dan Snow's 'On This Day in History'.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
