  "description": "Hello, Secret History fans! Here's an episode of another show we think you might like: Cautionary Tales from Pushkin Industries. \nLearning from our mistakes can be hard. Learning from other people’s mistakes...well, that’s a lot more fun.\nIn Cautionary Tales, from Pushkin Industries, economist and journalist Tim Harford retells true stories of unexpected outcomes, from the development of tanks in modern warfare to the accidental crowning of La La Land at the 2017 Oscars. Some of these tales are tragic, some are comic, but like the great fables and parables, each has a moral.\nTim takes you aboard a doomed airship, sits you on a concert stage in front of a broken piano, and puts you in a room with cult members counting down the final seconds before the end of the world. A cast of actors joins him in telling these stories. You’ll hear the famous Alan Cumming, Archie Panjabi, who won an Emmy award for The Good Wife, and Russell Tovey from The History Boys. \nCautionary Tales from Pushkin Industries. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.
