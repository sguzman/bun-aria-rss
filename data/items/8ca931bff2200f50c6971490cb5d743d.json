  "description": "<p>It’s time to return to the sport of swimming today as we chat with Canadian two-time Olympic medallist Kayla Sanchez about the sport and her amazing journey to getting to the Olympics! We find out just why her progression in the sport meant she had to switch to competitive swimming and which other Olympic sport she very nearly could’ve competed in instead. We also learn more about joining the Canadian squad just after the team’s success in Rio and how inspiring it was to be surrounded by Olympians at such a young age. Added to this we find out more about her experiences in Tokyo as well as the experiences of becoming an ISL champion. It’s an entertaining chat that you should be listening to already! So get to it!</p>",
