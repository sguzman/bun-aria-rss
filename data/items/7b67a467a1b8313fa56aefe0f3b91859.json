Pheidippides' 153-mile, 36 hour run from Athens to Sparta in 490 B.C. wasn't just critical to Greek victory, it's fair to say it spared Western Civilization and preserved the democratic institutions we so value today.</p><p>Finally, the book is a deeply engaging, first-hand account of Dean’s attempt to honor his lauded hemerodrome ancestor&nbsp;by replicating Pheidippides' ancient and historic 153-mile run, training and racing on only the few foods actually available to Pheidippides at the time.</p><p>Beyond fascinating tales from the new book, this is a conversation about curiosity, consistency, and drive. It’s about out-of-body experiences that occur when you are stripped to your very core. It’s about what motivates him to continue pushing the boundaries of human capabilities well into his 50's and how his&nbsp;training, racing and nutrition have evolved to meet that challenge.</p><p>But most of all, this is a conversation about what it means to be truly alive – and the beautiful embrace of discomfort required to explore the outer limits of performance, potential, and human experience.</p><p>I consider Dean a role model. In addition to being one of the great athletes of our time and an inspiration to millions worldwide, Dean is someone I am lucky to call friend and mentor.
