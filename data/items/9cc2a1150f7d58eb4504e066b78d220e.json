  "description": "On today's show, Pat starts by interviewing The GOAT, and now most prolific point scorer in NFL history, Adam Vinatieri. They chat about his mindset during the game against the Raiders, how he's feeling coming off an injury against Buffalo, and he looks back on his career in an incredible interview (0:00-13:10). Then, Pat and the guys dive into their Halloween weekends, look back on last week in the NFL including Pat's experience when playing in London, the players from the Jaguars who were arrested for not paying a $64,000 bar tab, whether or not the league or any team has suspended a player for HGH, Digs' bad quarterbacks of the week, and Pat reacts to Todd Haley and Hue Jackson getting fired from his hotel room in Connecticut. They also chat about the Red Sox winning the World Series, and Pat talks about his upcoming meetings at ESPN this week. It's a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
