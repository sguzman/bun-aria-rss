Swingers put everything out in the open— they share their fantasies with their partner, ask for consent before trying to have with someone, and tell their partner everything. Swingers have so much trust in their relationships because there is nothing to hide. There is no cheating and lying. Although swingers are largely perceived as \"crazy,\" they have some of the most realistic and unrepressed relationships I've ever seen. Even if you don't want partake in the Swingers lifestyle, there are a lot things people can learn from Swingers and people in open relationships. The great part about open relationships is that you get to create your own rules. You decide on things like, are you allowed to kiss another person? If you go sleep with someone, does that mean you spend the night? Setting up rules forces the couple to communicate about what they expect from the relationship. Enough about relationships, let's get to the sex. Holli and Michael give their best sex tips. Holli, a bisexual swinger, and Michael, who has gone down on A LOT of women, give advice on giving women oral sex.
