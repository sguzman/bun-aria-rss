  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has had a tumultuous couple of months at Barstool Sports, but things might be moving toward peace time. That's the key takeaway from Minihane's morning chat with Barstool founder and former dog owner Dave Portnoy. Although Portnoy admits that Team Minihane has been right about every single disagreement and conflict they've had with management since June, he refused to apologize, probably because he's still dealing with the grief of his dog dying -- grief that has been exacerbated by devious Minifans. Also on today's show: Minihane tries to process a vicious and unprovoked attack from podcast titan Ellie Schnitt, Steve Robinson forces some Ben Shapiro on Minihane, and the trial of the century -- Mayor Curtatone v. Minihane -- looms large.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
