  "description": "A special bonus episode of the podcast this week is a discussion I had with my good friend Finn Mckenty who runs a great YouTube/Podcast channel called The Punk Rock MBA. He had me on the show to discuss the business of podcasting and we get real deep on this subject. Considering I get a lot of questions about this, I figured it would be great to post this here.
