  "description": "I spoke with Dr. Amr Khafagy about his recent book The Economics of Financial Cooperatives (Routledge, 2019). Amr is Research Assistant at the Countryside and Community Research Institute of the University of Gloucestershire.\nBuilding on theories of finance and distribution, and the political economy of finance, this book explains the influence of financial cooperatives on wealth and income distribution, and institutional factors that determine the development of financial cooperatives. The book discusses the dynamics of income and wealth distribution with and without financial cooperatives, and defines the economic objective for financial cooperatives. Through explaining the influence of political institutions and regulations on the development of financial cooperatives, this book examines why financial cooperatives grew in some emerging economies and not in other similar ones.\nAmr's current main research interests include rural finance and agricultural productivity, financial markets and distribution, income inequality, and the political economy of the Middle East. His previously worked in microfinance in Egypt and India, where he was involved in designing and evaluating rural finance projects, and worked with a range of stakeholders, including farmers and rural households, government representatives/ministry officials, as well as central bank of Egypt and financial institutions.\nThe book is a useful contribution to the study of a typology of firm that is more important in our markets than generally believed. The empirical work by Amr is very original and helpful because it observed the relationship between the presence of financial cooperatives and income inequality in our economies.\nAndrea Bernardi is Senior Lecturer in Employment and Organization Studies at Oxford Brookes University in the UK. He holds a doctorate in Organization Theory from the University of Milan, Bicocca. He has held teaching and research positions in Italy, China and the UK. Among his research interests are the use of history in management studies, the co-operative sector, and Chinese co-operatives. His latest project is looking at health care in rural China. He is the co-convener of the EAEPE’s permanent track on Critical Management Studies.\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
