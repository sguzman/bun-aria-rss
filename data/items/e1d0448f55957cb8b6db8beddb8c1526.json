  "description": "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices that communicate with each\nother through the internet and provides intelligence to industry and people.\nThese devices are running in potentially hostile environments, so the need for\nsecurity is critical. Trust Management aims to ensure the reliability of the\nnetwork by assigning a trust value in every node indicating its trust level.\nThis paper presents an exhaustive survey of the current Trust Management\ntechniques for IoT, a classification based on the methods used in every work\nand a discussion of the open challenges and future research directions.\n</p>",
