  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the CDC has given us permission to breathe fresh air again. Some of us, anyway. Many people have been waiting for this permission and are grateful that the CDC will allow them to show their faces in public again. It’s a rather pitiful and embarrassing picture, altogether, and we’ll talk about it today. Also Five Headlines including the hackers who caused a gas shortage across the US win a big ransom for their troubles. AOC calls in extra security because another member of Congress yelled at her. And Disney goes for Gold in the woke Olympics with its new cartoon show features interracial gay dads. Finally in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the American Idol contestant who was forced off the show for something he posted when he was 12 years old. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
