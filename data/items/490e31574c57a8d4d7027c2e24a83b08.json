  "description": "<p>In their seminal 'Big Ideas' report for 2022, the ARK team predicts the prices of $1M for Bitcoin and over $180K for Ether. These numbers may seem outrageous in a short time frame, but with a broader perspective about the total addressable market for cryptoassets over the next decade, these ambitious predictions sharpen into something more than exuberance.</p> <p>With paradigm shifts underway, we're bringing on ARK analysts Frank Downing and Yassine Elmandjra to discuss the why, how, and when of these hot price predictions–and why it's more than just the price that matters.</p> <p>How bullish are you?
