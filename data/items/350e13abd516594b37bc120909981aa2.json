With these special episodes, you also get a sneak preview of their latest episode to really wet your whistle to dive into a new pod.

If Tyler and Johnny's personalities don't immediately make you fall for them, their ability to tell a story with compassion, spice and lighthearted humor in all the right places  will have you swooning in seconds. We chatted with these about their relationship, their favorite paranormal happenings and how That's Spooky came to be. Come on it, friends.
