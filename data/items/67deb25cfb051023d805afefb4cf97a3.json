  "description": "<p>After our Darkness Radio Event at the Queen Mary, we witnessed Psychic/Medium Chris Fleming do a bit of channeling aboard the ship.  We asked him on this special two hour edition of the show tonight to talk about the Queen Mary's former resident Psychic, Peter James, and his ability to channel.  What Chris does when he channels, and how it figures into his investigations! </p>\n",
