  "description": "<p>We often like it when things are explained to us clearly, but would you believe that sometimes it's better if you're just down-right confused? You could actually learn more if at some point in the learning process you feel like you don't know what's going on.  In part 2 of my interview with researcher and professor Jeremiah Sullins, we talk about much more you could learn if you spend a little time being absolutely perplexed at what's going on.  You may have heard of this as \"desirable difficulties\", well here we dig in and find out when it's good for teachers (and students) when everything is not completely clear.</p>",
