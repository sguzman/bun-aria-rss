  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you find yourself having a rough go with your business? Or maybe you haven’t even started yet because you don’t know what your business should be? Well today Zach is going to help you get in your lane by figuring out 4 simple areas. Figuring these things out will help us get crystal clear on our mission, we’ll be able to map it out, and give it the time it deserves to flourish.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, you need to find what you’re passionate about. If you want to be able to do something for the long haul, it needs to be something you’re passionate about. You don’t want to do something you hate day in and day out, even if it is making you money. Next, it should be something that has purpose, that fulfills us. Ask yourself if it makes you feel accomplished, or like you’ve given something back. That will tell you if you’re on the right path. Third, you simply have to be skilled at it. Whether you’re naturally good at it, or it’s something you have to build on, skill is necessary to compete. Which brings us to the last area, opportunity. You can be passionate, fulfilled, and skilled, but if you’re not able to make money at it, it’s not really a business. So, is there a market for it that you can see yourself fitting into?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, all of these things are simple, but they’re not necessarily easy. You’re going to have to put time and effort in. When you do find what your thing is, run with it. However, don’t forget to occasionally stop and appreciate where you’re at and how far you’ve come. Sometimes people fall into the trap of thinking they have to constantly be moving the goal post, otherwise they’re complacent.  There is a difference between complacency and being okay with where you’re at right now. You can keep that drive and that fire, but you can also celebrate your wins.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to identify what you’re passionate about.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why fulfillment is so important in business.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What mistake Zach has made in growing his business.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why you need to sign up for the Alpha Underdog newsletter.</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Business is all about helping people, and you do that by having good character and having good skills.” -Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
