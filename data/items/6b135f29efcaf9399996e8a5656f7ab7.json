How much should we share? What can they understand? Will we scare them? In this episode, Emily and Laura interview Tim Challies about how to talk to our kids about death. Tim is a husband, father of teenagers, pastor, and writer who encourages us to bring the conversation about death back to our children’s hearts and the hope they have in Jesus. We don’t need to worry so much about what to say to our kids. God gave us what we need in his word to teach our kids the victory of the gospel in the face of death.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553010519287_8665\" class= \"sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code\" data-block-type=\"23\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-125-how-do-we-talk-about-death-with-our-kids-an-interview-with-tim-challies-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_90095\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_90157\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <h2><strong>MENTIONED ON THE SHOW:</strong></h2> <ul data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TCHoL0\"><em>Devoted: Godly Men and Their Godly Moms</em></a>, Tim Challies</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.challies.com/\">Challies.com</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Tim Challies on <a href=\"https://facebook.com/timchallies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a>, <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/challies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/challies\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_393435\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_393497\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <h2><strong>RELATED ARTICLES, RESOURCES, AND CONTENT:</strong></h2> <p><em>Related R|M resources:</em></p> <ul data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/kidsabide\">Kids Abide Cards for Bible Study</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/abide\">R|M Abide Method for Bible Study</a></p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Around the web:</em></p> <ul data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p><a href= \"https://www.ccef.org/podcast/christian-perspective-grief/\">“A Christian Perspective on Grief” CCEF On the Go</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/5-ways-talk-to-your-children-about-death/\"> “5 Ways to Talk to Your Children About Death”</a> - Jeff Robinson</p> </li> <li> <p><a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/how-being-honest-about-death-brings-hope/\"> “How Being Honest About Death Brings Hope”</a> - Matthew McCullough</p> </li> <li> <p><a href= \"https://www.christianity.com/bible/gospel/how-can-i-explain-the-gospel-to-children-11529399.html\"> “How to Explain the Gospel to Children”</a> - John MacArthur</p> </li> <li> <p><a href= \"http://www.trillianewbell.com/2018/11/17/blessed/\">“#blessed”</a> - Trillia Newbell</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2u7TqNk\"><em>Goodbye to Goodbyes</em>,</a> - Lauren Chandler</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FcjmxT\"><em>Holding Onto Hope</em>,</a> - Nancy Guthrie</p> </li> <li> <p><a href= \"https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/do-pets-go-to-heaven\">“Do Pets Go to Heaven?”</a> - Ask Pastor John</p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_91549\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1552871798425_91611\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <h2><strong>R|M APPLY QUESTIONS:</strong></h2> <ol data-rte-list=\"default\"> <li> <p>Our kids will ask big theological questions.

What examples can you give them to make them most excited to be with Christ?</p> </li> <li> <p>We all feel pressure to have perfect theological answers, because we fear misleading our children or misrepresenting God.

How can we be faithful in sharing scripture’s truths with our children without fear of “messing up”?</p> </li> <li> <p>There are hundreds of resources for how to teach your children, which is a gift from God. But the even greater gift is the gift of his own words in the Bible to train us in godliness and biblical knowledge.
