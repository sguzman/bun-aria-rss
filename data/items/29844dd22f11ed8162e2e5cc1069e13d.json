  "description": "<p>High-velocity spatter found on a shirt worn by disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh may show he was present at the time his wife and son were murdered.   FITSNews is reporting their inside sources are saying that multiple forensics experts, including one at an out-of-state lab,  confirm the preliminary analysis of a significant amount of high-velocity spatter from at least one of their bodies. Alex Murdaugh has since been charged with multiple financial crimes and faces numerous civil lawsuits, since Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were found dead. He's even been named a person of interest, but not a suspect, so far.  Sources close to the investigation told FITSNews that multiple shots from a high-powered rifle killed Maggie Murdaugh, including one that went through her back and another into the back of her head as she was face down on the ground. Paul Murdaugh’s death certificate said the he had two shotgun wounds: one to the head and the other to the chest. At least one of the guns used in the murders belonged to the Murdaugh family. Alex Murdaugh’s attorney has repeatedly said that his client’s whereabouts are “accounted for completely.”     </p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Susan E.
