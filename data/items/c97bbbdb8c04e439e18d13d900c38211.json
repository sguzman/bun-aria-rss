  "description": "Between multi-cloud deployments, more employees working remotely, and increasing use of SaaS applications, the number of entry points for attackers to infiltrate your systems has exploded. But gaining visibility into all these possible attack vectors is time-consuming and often incomplete or just a snapshot in time.\nIf the first rule of cyber is to “know what you have,” how can cyber professionals get a comprehensive, current picture of their assets? How can they feel confident that they understand which assets may be more vulnerable and prioritize defenses accordingly?\nIn the first half of this episode of Cyberwire-X, the CyberWire's CSO, Chief Analyst, and Senior Fellow, Rick Howard, is joined by Hash Table member Jaclyn Miller, the Head of InfoSec & IT at DispatchHealth. In the second half of the episode, Cody Pierce, Chief Product Officer at episode sponsor LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, talks with Dave Bittner. Listen to the discussions about answering the foundational cyber questions (What do I have? Is it protected?), why context is critical, and how an adversarial perspective helps you be a better defender.",
