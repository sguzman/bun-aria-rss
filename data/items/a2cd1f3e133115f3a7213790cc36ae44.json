  "description": "It’s not often I pound the table continuously on a single issue. But for the last few weeks, that’s exactly what I’ve been doing with the coronavirus outbreak. Please pay attention to these warnings! The markets still haven’t priced COVID-19 into the market, which means we’ll be seeing a lot more volatility... and more downside risks. Rather than host a guest today, I bring all of my updated research on the coronavirus… break down the riskiest sectors… and explain how to protect your portfolio in these uncertain times. -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
