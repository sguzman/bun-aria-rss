Dwayne shares deeply personal stories about his life, from his humble beginnings all the way through his blockbuster movie career. For years, Dwayne says, he and his parents lived paycheck to paycheck, moving to a different city every time his dad, a professional wrestler in the '80s, got a new gig. As a high school student, Dwayne started getting into trouble. He was arrested for everything from fighting and stealing to forging checks. Nevertheless, Dwayne says, he was able to start changing his life for the better when he was 16 years old. After playing football for four years at the University of Miami, Dwayne was passed over by the NFL. Although he played for the Canadian Football League for a short time, he was ultimately cut from his team, the Calgary Stampeders. At 23, Dwayne found himself living in his parents' small apartment, battling depression. How he was able to leave his parents' home and eventually become one of the biggest names in Hollywood is a story that is as amazing as it is inspirational. To date, Dwayne's films, such as \"Jumanji,\" \"San Andreas\" and the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, have earned a combined box office totaling more than $3 billion. His current movie, \"Skyscraper,\" is in theaters now. </p><p><br /></p>\n",
