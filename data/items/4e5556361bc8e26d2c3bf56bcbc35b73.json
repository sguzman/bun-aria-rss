  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show harkening back to the 1970s and remembering a product from their childhoods called the 'Pocket Fisherman'. They also examine the instinct that exists in many people to default to a 'what's in it for me' mentality and how damaging that is to the people with that attitude. They then turn to the phones and speak with a caller who is perplexed by a past failed relationship that still vexes him to this day and is looking for some insight. They also speak to a caller who has suffered from all three variants of Covid and was surprised that Omicron hit him hardest. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nJordan Harbinger Show\nTenThousand.CC, code ADS\nJustWorks.com\nGeico.com",
