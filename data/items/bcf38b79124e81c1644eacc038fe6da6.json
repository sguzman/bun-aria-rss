  "description": "<p>Way back in 2019, this week&rsquo;s guest and I dropped our albums on the same day. So obviously, she was destined to be on the podcast. It&rsquo;s <em>Prairie Home Companion&rsquo;s </em>own Erica Rhodes! And yes, you read that right. She&rsquo;s been a voice actor since she was 10, so using her vocal skills to entertain the masses was a natural transition. After you listen to this episode, you&rsquo;ll be hooked, so be sure to download her album <em>Sad Lemon </em>everywhere albums are downloaded! Here are five words to describe this episode: ask for their address first.</p>",
