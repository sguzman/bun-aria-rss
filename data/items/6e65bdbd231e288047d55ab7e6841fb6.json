  "description": "The Senate impeachment trial trudges on, and Sen. Ted Cruz gives a firsthand perspective. But the Republicans have a “secret weapon”: Adam Schiff and the Democrats have made Burisma and Hunter Biden not only relevant, but critical to their whole case! Glenn believes there are two trials going on – against Trump and against the truth. The media is fabricating lies out of thin air, and Congress is using our tax dollars to spread them. Bill O’Reilly breaks down Biden’s corruption so anyone can understand and runs through this week’s biggest stories: Tulsi sues Hillary, Trump heads to the March for Life, and the Australian fires aren’t as big as they seem. Also, Stu has a real problem with the New York Times’ impeachment timeline.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
