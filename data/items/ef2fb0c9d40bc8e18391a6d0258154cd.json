  "description": "<p>April Nalle from <a href=\"https://www.nallewinery.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nalle Winery,</a> who make brilliant Zinfandel (also great Pinot noir, blends, Cabernet and more) in an old-school style, is a good friend with whom I speak often. April has had some really big moments lately, where she’s gone from just being concerned about climate change to being inspired to be a change agent. She’s at the beginning of her journey and I wanted to get her at this point to tell us how it all starts.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this show we talk about how to make a vineyard more environmentally friendly, so we are joined by vigneron Whitney Hopkins of Hopkins River Ranch in the Russian River, who farms the land mainly organically . April and her husband Andrew Nalle buy Pinot Noir from Whitney and her father, who farm the ranch together.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"https://www.nallewinery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/2019_pinot_400_x_348.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"104\" /></a><br /> <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/whap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"375\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Whitney Hopkins of Hopkins River Ranch, Left.

In addition, in areas with wet weather, it can be very hard to commit to only organic practices when doing so may mean that you lose an entire crop.<br /> <br /> Sustainability is a pyramid – social, economic, and environmental concerns are all part of it.
