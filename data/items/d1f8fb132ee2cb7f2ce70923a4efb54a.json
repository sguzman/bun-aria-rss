  "description": "<p>⚠️ PSA: This podcast episode is different from the YouTube channel. This removes the maths and graph, as it requires visualisation. Please check out the<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sLD_jFUFMqA\"> YouTube version</a> for the graph. Otherwise, this episode is good enough to have you an in-depth explanation. ⚠️&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a 2-part series. Part 1 is on the economics and math of TBC and how the curve functions affect the incentive mechanism and what governance can we embed into the function. Part 2 will be on using these functions in projects, and taking a dive at a few projects.</p>\n<p>The episode is split into 2 because it gets quite heavy to digest all the information at once. So part 1 is the more math-y part, for you, as economics designers to grasp. And part 2 is the more application-y part, for you, as economics designers to know how to use it. After all, knowledge is only valuable when applied.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this first part. We understand token bonding curves, the benefits, where the value accrual is derived from and the various functions to consider.</p>\n<p>As much as I wish there is 1 perfect function, the functions really depend on the objective of your system and what it wants to incentive or govern. So choose wisely and have fun playing with graphs!</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Application to token economics framework: 00:38</li>\n <li>What is token bonding curve: 03:53</li>\n <li>4 properties of token bonding curve: 07:50</li>\n <li>Use-cases: 11:38</li>\n  <li>Where does value come from: 13:37</li>\n  <li>Risks and ways to mitigate risks: 18:09</li>\n  <li>4 math functions: 19:30</li>\n  <li>How to calculate total cost of tokens: 28:39</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want more in-depth content?
