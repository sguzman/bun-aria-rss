  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's game between the Packers and 49ers and how incredible the Aaron Rodgers/Davante Adams connection, and they look ahead to some of the juicy matchups in week 9 of the NFL season. Joining the show for an Aaron Rodgers Friday is the man himself, one of the greatest throwers of the football of all-time, fresh off a huge victory over the 49ers, Green Bay Packers QB, Aaron Rodgers. Pat and Aaron chat about last night's game and how good it feels to come out on fire, how special Davante Adams is, why he was excited Marques Valdez-Scantling got going, his thoughts on the defenses effort, what time he got home, and much more (3:36-37:19). Next, a man coming off one of the most athletic accomplishments of all-time, a 2x touchdown scorer last Sunday, Running Back for the Indianapolis Colts, Nyheim Hines joins the program. Pat and Nyheim chat about his past as a parkour athlete and how he pulled off the back flip in uniform on Sunday, what he's learned from Philip Rivers so far, how competitive the RB's room is and how that's helped his play, and if anyone has ever pushed Phil Rivers into swearing (37:21-49:39). Lastly, Pittsburgh radio legend, former WCW commentator, the Super Genius himself, Mark Madden joins the program. Pat and Mark chat about why Mark loves what Pat is doing in NXT so much, his thoughts on Bob Spillane and the Steelers, not being a fan of JuJu's fanbase, and his thoughts on Antonio Brown and the Buccaneers and whether or not it's going to work down there (54:17-1:11:32).
