  "itunes:summary": "You wouldn’t get very far as a basketball player, if you played by the rules of soccer. Can you imagine? Trying to play without touching the ball with your hands? It’d be ridiculous! Actually impossible! And yet, in your creativity, you let other people’s creative rules and values make you feel disqualified all the time.\n\nYou’ve heard it before “the only rule in creativity is that there are no rules”, so why do we constantly feel like imposters who are “doing it wrong”? \n\nI have a hypothesis:\nBecause we don’t realize that creativity means very different things to each and every artist. We all define and value creativity extremely differently, but I don’t think we realize this.\n\nIn this episode I want to help you figure out what creativity is about for you. When you start to figure out why YOU love creative work, you can let go of what OTHERS think it’s about and thrive in your own way.\n\nThis episode is one of my favorites we’ve ever made and I think you’re gonna love it!!!\n\nThis is part 3 of our 4 Part Creative Elixir Series. \nListen to part 1, episode 276, here: https://www.creativepeptalk.com/episodes/276",
