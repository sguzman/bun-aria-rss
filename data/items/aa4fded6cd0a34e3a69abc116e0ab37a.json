  "description": "It's not often in life that we're lucky enough to get something good for no cost at all. But here at the OM3, that rule doesn't really apply. Take today's episode for instance... it has not one but two great guests, and all you have to do is listen. Leading things off is very close friend and former teammate - as well as OG pod host - Matt Barnes. Now, it's no secret to anyone that Matt speaks his mind and takes no prisoners, and this discussion is certainly no different. Imagine yourself sitting at a bar and listening in to a conversation between NBA players in the next booth... that's the vibe for this one, no doubt. Then, as if that wasn't enough, JJ and Tommy welcome in the OM3's brand new correspondent - Mikal Bridges of the Phoenix Suns. He joins the show for some playoff talk, a little music discussion, and the Top 5 Draft. And if there was ever a draft that went off the rails in a hurry, this one is it. The finger is pointed at you, Mr Bridges. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
