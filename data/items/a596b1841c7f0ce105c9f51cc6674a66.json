  "title": "Ep 92 | Can Frustrated Conservatives Learn from the Tea Party? | Matt Kibbe | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "The nation was shocked as the “Save America” rally in Washington, D.C., devolved into a siege of the U.S. Capitol. The day after, as heads were still spinning, Glenn sits down with Matt Kibbe, host of BlazeTV’s “Kibbe on Liberty,” to look at what led to this: Woke authoritarianism is in power, lockdowns are unending, and the Left has finally found out how to weaponize fear. The media is all too happy to watch the country burn, as long as the Left is holding the torch. But Glenn and Matt remember the lessons learned from the Tea Party, Martin Luther King Jr., and other movements that found success through peace. Conservatives and libertarians must find a path forward so we have more 9-12 marches, fewer stormings of the Capitol, and real change from those who believe they rule over us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
