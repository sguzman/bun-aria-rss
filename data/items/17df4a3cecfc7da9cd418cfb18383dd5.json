  "description": "<p>Indiana police say they believe a 14-year-old girl who vanished a month ago is in danger and is likely  no longer in the area.  Aaliyah Ramirez, a dance student in Syracuse, was last seen leaving her home just after 8 a.m. on April 27, on her way to school. She never made it to the bus stop. A neighbor’s doorbell camera captured the last known images of the teenager. Police have mentioned three areas where they believe Aaliyah could be — Marion, Indiana, about 70 miles south of Syracuse; Georgia; and Palm Beach County, Florida — but they’ve released very little other information. About a week after her disappearance, Palm Beach County deputies visited a relative’s home there they did not find the teen. </p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Katie Reynolds - Friend </li>\n<li>Wendy Patrick - California prosecutor, Author: “Red Flags” www.wendypatrickphd.com 'Today with Dr. Wendy' on KCBQ in San Diego </li>\n<li>Dr. Teresa Gil, Ph.D. - Professor of Psychology and Psychotherapist, 25 years Working with Child Abuse and Trauma Victims, Teresa Gil PHD.com, Author: \"Women Who Were Sexually Abused as Children: Mothering, Resilience, and Protecting the Next Generation\"  </li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Featured on \"The Piketon Massacre: Return to Pike County\" on iHeartRadio </li>\n<li>Levi Page - Crime Online Investigative Reporter, Host, \"Crime and Scandal\" True Crime Podcast, YouTube.com/LeviPageTV  </li>\n<li><br></li>\n</ul><p>Anybody with information about Ramirez is asked to call Syracuse police at <strong>574-267-5667</strong>.
