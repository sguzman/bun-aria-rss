  "description": "1. How to find a way to live in peace: to actually love complicated parents without compromising our love for ourselves.\n2. How we can’t change our past—and why Ashley says that forgiveness is accepting the fact that the past is never going to be different.\n3. The importance of being able to hold two truths at the same time: that, for some of us, our parents did the best they could—and it wasn’t close to good enough.\n4. Why Ashley says she struggles, even in adulthood, to accept love and care from people who are not obligated to love and care for her.\n5. Why anger often reveals our passion points—and for Ashley, why that leads her to show up for children.\nAbout Ashley: \nAshley C.
