  "description": "This week promises to be a dramatic on the impeachment front. Is Gordon Sondland going to tell the truth (for the first time) or lie (again)? What about Lt. Col Vindman, Fiona Hill and the others to come? Will there be a game changer? And how will the president throw himself into the mix? More Tweets? More distractions? And speaking of distractions...is impeachment drawing our attention away from major unfolding global crises: in Hong Kong, with the Uighurs in China, in Iran, in Syria, in Latin America, with US-Israel policy? It could make your head spin if you didn't have the cool incisive wisdom of Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and former NSC staffer and current CNN commentator Sam Vinograd to make sense of it all. And that's just what you have here on this not-to-be-missed episode of Deep State Radio.\nWe're extremely grateful to our sponsors, Mova Globes and Better Help.\nMOVA Globes turn all on their own, with or without a base, in any setting with ambient lighting.
