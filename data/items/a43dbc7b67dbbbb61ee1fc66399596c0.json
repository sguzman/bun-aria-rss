You might <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/tell-me-something-i-dont-know-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remember it</a>. It was so much fun that we decided to launch a whole new podcast series. It&#8217;s been in the works for a while and it&#8217;s finally here! A <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tell-me-something-i-dont-know/id1171534532?mt=2&at=1001lrpW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">preview episode</a> of the first season of <em>TMSIDK</em> is now available.</p>\n<p>Please take a minute to <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tell-me-something-i-dont-know/id1171534532?mt=2&at=1001lrpW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subscribe</a><strong> </strong>and, if you like the sound of the preview episode, please please PLEASE leave a rating and/or review on iTunes — it’s really important in helping launch a new show. <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tell-me-something-i-dont-know/id1171534532?mt=2&at=1001lrpW\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-114306\" src=\"https://freakonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Twit-pic-TMSIDK.jpg\" alt=\"twit-pic-tmsidk\" width=\"136\" height=\"181\" /></a></p>\n<p>Like all the Freakonomics stuff we do, <a href=\"http://tmsidk.com/\"><em>TMSIDK</em></a><strong> </strong>is still journalism, still factual — but disguised in the most sparkling conversation you can handle. In each episode, audience contestants get on stage and tell us something fascinating (or earth-shaking, or just plain weird) while a panel of three experts tries to sort out what&#8217;s worth knowing and what&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>The panelists are drawn from an eclectic group of wise people — like Barnard College president <strong>Debora Spar;</strong> New York Public Library president <strong>Tony Marx</strong>; former White House economist <strong>Austan Goolsbee</strong>; the Jesuit writer and thinker <strong>James Martin</strong>; bioethicist <strong>Zeke Emanuel</strong>; former White House chef <strong>Sam Kass</strong>;  Microsoft researcher <strong>danah boyd</strong>; the heart surgeon and TV doctor <strong>Dr. Oz</strong>; poker champ <strong>Annie Duke</strong>; the linguist <strong>John McWhorter</strong>; the <em>Grit</em> author <strong>Angela Duckworth</strong>; and the happiness guru <strong>Gretchen Rubin</strong>.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-76 alignright\" src=\"http://tmsidk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gethard-and-contestants-350x232.jpg\" alt=\"gethard-and-contestants\" width=\"207\" height=\"137\" /></p>\n<p>We also have plenty of comedians and humorists, including <strong>Keisha Zollar</strong>, <strong>Chris Gethard</strong>, <strong>Frank Delaney, Andy Zaltzman</strong>, and <strong>Hannibal Buress</strong>. And occasionally a globetrotting adventurer like author <strong>Simon Winchester</strong>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-69 alignleft\" src=\"http://tmsidk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SJD-232x350.jpg\" alt=\"sjd\" width=\"181\" height=\"273\" />It&#8217;s all hosted by <strong>Stephen J. Dubner</strong>, who is accompanied each night by a real-time human fact-checker to keep everyone (mostly) honest.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tell-me-something-i-dont-know/id1171534532?mt=2&at=1001lrpW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subscribe today</a>, so you don&#8217;t miss a single episode. The first one will be out on November 7. Season 1 will run six episodes — and we&#8217;re already taping Season 2 in New York City (in December and January), so come <a href=\"https://freakonomics.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vaXRylYZkF8rkx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">be a contestant</a> or <a href=\"http://www.symphonyspace.org/event/9484/Other/tell-me-something-i-dont-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get tickets</a> to see the show. You can also follow <em>TMSIDK</em> on<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tmsidk_show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TMSIDKShow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/tmsidk_show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/2016/11/announcing-debut-tell-something-dont-know/\">Announcing the Debut of Tell Me Something I Don&#8217;t Know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com\">Freakonomics</a>.</p>\n"
