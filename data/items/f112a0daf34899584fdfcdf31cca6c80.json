  "description": "<p>Our guest today is Nick Maggiulli. Nick is the Chief Operating Officer for Ritholtz Wealth Management and regularly writes over on his site: Of Dollars And Data. But he wasn&rsquo;t always steeped in the world of finance and investing- before that he was a successful litigation consultant. And even though Nick has always had a heart for personal finance, it&rsquo;s only been in the past 5 years that he began to seriously write about money. And his new book, Just Keep Buying, actually comes out tomorrow! We were lucky enough to get an early copy and couldn&rsquo;t recommend it enough. Nick weaves insightful stories with actionable advice that is going to help anyone who reads it. During this discussion we talk about timing the market, Nick&rsquo;s definition of dollar cost averaging, spending less time on investments and more time on growing income, and much more!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a La Folie by New Belgium!
