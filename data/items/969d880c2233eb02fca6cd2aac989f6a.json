  "title": "EP 102: Creating What We Defend Against (And Other Stuff I Unconsciously Do)",
  "description": "<p>This holiday season, I'm most thankful for my therapist. I have a breakthrough regarding my neurotic need to stop being like my parents. I explore the idea of \"creating what we defend against\" from the Course in Miracles. Also, what does it mean to live small and how do we not do that in 2017? I saw Star Wars and love the Orphan Mythology - how powerful the theme is and how it can be applied to our lives. Also, more on drinking the Motherhood Kool-Aid. I drank more of that shit and found myself deep down a rabbit hole of maternal insecurity. There's so much to get deep on, you may wanna just put on a black turtleneck and beret to listen. Light a cigarette, hide from your boss, LET'S GET DEEP for the last time in 2016!</p>\n",
