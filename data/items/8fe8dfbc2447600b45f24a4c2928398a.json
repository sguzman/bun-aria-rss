  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane's producer tries to put family talk off-limits and Minihane is not pleased. Kingpin Pete returns for more jail talk. What's it like getting arrested with $20k in cash and drugs? What should you smuggle up your ass to get the best value? Which prison work details are the best? What the fuck is mufungo cake? Blind Mike's stand-up routine does not disappoint. Plus Sue O'Connell joins the show for the second time this week, but this time she's facing the imminent cancellation of her own NECN program.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
