  "description": "Today I talked to Minal Bopaiah about her new book Equity: How to Design Organizations Where Everyone Thrives (Berrett-Koehler, 2021).\nRemember the Marlboro Man? Of course you do, as he symbolizes the myth of rugged individualism. Minal Bopaiah is here to suggest that the idea of the “making it on your own” is and has always been a myth. There’s always a social context, which favors one group more than another. It’s not that individual efforts aren’t valid; it’s just that the story is always more complicated, and there are those in positions of power eager to camouflage the degree to which the “game” is tilted by factors involving gender, race, and other factors. Many aspects of this book and discussion are unique when it comes to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). This episode explores the world of non-profits, where “doing good” has aspects to it that should welcome reform. At the same time, how about the 19% of the population that have a disability? Rarely do they get addressed as part of what DEI initiatives should entail. Minal Bopaiah is among the most impassioned, incisive guests the show has had on. Give her a listen!\nMinal Bopaiah is the founder of Brevity & Wit, a strategy and design firm focused on DEI initiatives. She’s written for the Stanford Social Innovation Review and TheHill.com an author, among other activities and career accomplishments.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of nine books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc. (https://www.sensorylogic.com). His new book is Blah, Blah, Blah: A Snarky Guide to Office Lingo.
