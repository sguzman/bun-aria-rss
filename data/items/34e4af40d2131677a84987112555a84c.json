  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah has a new book out, so as is tradition for our last episode of the season, Jen is playing host, and Sarah is playing guest, and we’re talking about journeys vs. quests, how being a romance heroine is political, and why <em>Heartbreaker</em> just might be Sarah’s most romantic book. It’s mostly a spoiler free episode, but you might prefer to finish your read before listening. Enjoy! And don’t miss the first two chapters of the magnificent <em>Heartbreaker</em> audiobook, narrated by the incomparable Mary Jane Wells, at the end of the episode! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you haven’t purchased <em>Heartbreaker</em> yet, you can get it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qePlVn\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://apple.co/3G9MG4Z\">Apple Books</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/HeartbreakerBN\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/HeartbreakerKobo\">Kobo</a>, at <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/5775/9780063056787\">your local indie</a>, or signed and with special swag (and a Fated Mates sticker!) from Sarah’s local indie, <a href=\"https://shop.wordbookstores.com/SarahMacLean\">WORD in Brooklyn</a>!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Alyxandra Harvey, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JK8R4l\"><em>How to Marry a Duke</em></a>; to Amazon’s Kindle Vella, publishers of Rebecca Zanetti’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B09L5C69QK?ref=kv_fm_kea\"><em>Knife’s Edge, Alaska</em></a> series; and to Lumi Labs, creators of Microdose Gummies, for sponsoring the episode.
