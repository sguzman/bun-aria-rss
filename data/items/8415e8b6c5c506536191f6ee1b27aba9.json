  "description": "In this episode of The Readheads the girlies are discussing Run, Rose, Run by James Patterson and Dolly Parton. An epic collab. The Readheads are sharing all the things they loved about the book and some of the things they didn't. As always they share their picks for who they'd cast in a movie adaptation of this book and they share and rate all of the other books they read this month. The next book is Becky's choice and she chose Girls with Bright Futures by Tracy Dobmeier and Wendy Katzman.
