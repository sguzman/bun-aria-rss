Her first romance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ncbRvI\">His Leading Lady</a>, was just released, (<a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/editing-services\">Jen did the final developmental edit!</a>) and she just started&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bonkersromance.com/home\">the Bonkers Romance podcast</a>&nbsp;with Melody from the Heaving Bosoms podcast. Check it out!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Although there is lots of crossover with paranormal or alien, Jenny defines monsters as: creatures who don’t shift into humans, you’d definitely scream if you saw them running down the street, but human enough to be able to bang. Although no one mentioned on the episode, here is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeredithIreland/status/1433861549316349968?s=20\">the single greatest monster explanation ever seen on twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/505/342/d18.png\">The cartoon Sarah refered to</a>&nbsp;is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harkness-test\">The Harkness Test</a>, and it's a reference to Dr. Who.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More about what it means to go into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjpjn4/amazon-erotica-best-seller-rankings-removed\">the Amazon dungeon</a>--this, of course, is related to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa\">attempts to deplatform sex everywhere on the internet</a>. Besialisty cartoon that Sarah is going to look for&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Baby Jenny imprinted on Fantasia, specifically&nbsp;<a href=\"https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Centaurs_(Fantasia)\">the centaurs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Chernabog\">Chernabog</a>. She also loved&nbsp;<a href=\"https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Gargoyles\">the Gargoyles TV show</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Orcs\">orcs in Lord of the Rings</a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://jezebel.com/knotting-is-the-weird-fanfic-sex-trend-that-cannot-be-u-1606931767\">What is Knotting?</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Here’s listener&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeasuredAndSlow/status/1436417087975542787?s=20\">Alyssa Long’s terrific thread about monsters and disability</a>. Often, writers use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mythcreants.com/blog/ridding-your-monsters-of-ableism/\">ableist tropes in their monster-creation</a>, and Alyssa’s thread talks about how and why this is harmful. (Any mistakes in the summarizing of this thread are Jen’s!) In that thread, Alyssa shared&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2016/03/15/the-monster-in-the-mirror-on-horror-disability-and-loving-both-at-once/\">a great article about ableism in the horror genre</a>, and although we loved&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/what-the-witcher-gets-wrong-and-right-about-disabilit-1840609870\">The Witcher, it reinforced some of the most common problems</a>&nbsp;with putting disabilities on the screen.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah is hosting a writing workship to kick of NaNo--<a href=\"https://www.sarahmaclean.net/writing-romance\">register here</a>!</p>",
