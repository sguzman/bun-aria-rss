A famous golfer loved it. And why do we say That's my two cents after offering an opinion? Would it be better to say That's my one cent? Also, GUTs vs. TOEs, how to pronounce buoy, pore over vs. pour over, wally, a surprising pronunciation of prestige, piker, is all, and a brain-teaser about orphan syllables.\nRead full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
