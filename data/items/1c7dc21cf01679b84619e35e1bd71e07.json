Living at the ends of the world's loneliest roads and subsisting off the rugged Alaskan bush, they battle whiteout snow storms, man-eating carnivores, questionable frozen terrain, and limited resources through a long and bitter winter. Some of them are lone wolves; others have their families beside them. All must overcome despairing odds to brave the wild and survive through to the spring. And when spring arrives in Alaska, rising temperatures bring mounting challenges as they work to prepare for yet another winter.\n\n#LifeBelowZero #FullEpisode #NationalGeographic\n\nGet More National Geographic:\nOfficial Site: http://bit.ly/NatGeoOfficialSite\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/FBNatGeo\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/NatGeoTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/NatGeoInsta\nTikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@natgeo\nTenor: http://on.natgeo.com/31b3Koc\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.
