  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Reincarnated: Edgar Cayce & The <em>Unfulfilled Destiny of Thomas Jefferson with guest Joanne DiMaggio</em><br>\n<br>\nOn June 23, 1936, Edgar Cayce, the most documented and renowned psychic of the twentieth century and the father of holistic medicine, gave a Life Reading for two-day old Thomas Jefferson (T.J.) Davis, the nephew of his secretary, Gladys Davis. In this reading, Cayce identified one of the child’s past lives as that of Thomas Jefferson, adding this stunning prediction—that he “may become more important in the affairs of the WORLD than this entity in its previous experience has been to America—Thomas Jefferson.”   <br>\n<br>\nThis is the story of the fate of a child that Edgar Cayce so loved and predicted could be the world’s redemption…<em>If only.</em> Today we take an endearing look at the relationship between Cayce and young T.J., who was tutored by Cayce for nearly the first nine years of the boy’s life in preparation for the great work ahead of him. But it also explores how decisions made by T.J.’s absentee parents put their son’s soul on a totally different path.</p>\n\n<p>Get the book here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bWO4Km\">https://amzn.to/3bWO4Km</a> </p>\n",
