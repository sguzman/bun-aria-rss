Thank you ever so much for downloading/streaming last week’s debut episode with James Acaster, we very much hope you had fun with that one… What better way to follow up such a banger of a first episode than by treating you to a true and living slammer of a follow up - please welcome to the podcast television’s KATHERINE RYAN!</p><br><p>First thing’s first - mention must be made of the fact that this was recorded in a car. This is probably extremely apparent but just in case you’re curious as to why there’s a lot of very motor-sounding background noise, that’s what’s happening. So with that said - you are in for a treat, as Brett and Katherine get down to the real deal serious topics with a grin and a laugh, deliberating and considering topics such as whether they want to buried in the first place, mortality and how having kids can shape one’s view on it, her family film nights showing nothing but the finest in Irish movies, the effects of ‘AALS’ (Altitude Associated Lachrymosity Syndrome - basically getting emotional on planes), and early cinema romances, but SO MUCH MORE! A wonderful backseat chat (they have a driver, don’t worry) with Brett and Katherine, where you can place yourself directly in between them and enjoy the goods therein.
