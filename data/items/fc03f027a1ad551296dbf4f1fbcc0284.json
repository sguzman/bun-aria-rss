Cloud compute environments provide a scalable and sustainable platform that can significantly improve runtimes in Calibre® PERC™ flows and other demanding EDA compute tasks. Running Calibre PERC verification flows on cloud resources to satisfy peak demand usage can increase productivity and expedite turnaround-times. Understanding the cost/benefit relationship of cloud computing helps companies determine the optimal configuration that provides the greatest returns.</p>",
