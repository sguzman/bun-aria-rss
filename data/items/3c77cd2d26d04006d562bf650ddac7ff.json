  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://tristaneaton.com/\">Tristan Eaton website</a><br /> <em>Born in L.A. in 1978, Tristan Eaton started pursuing street art as a teenager, painting everything from billboards to dumpsters in the urban landscapes of the cities where he lived, be it London, Detroit, or New York. He designed his first toy for Fisher-Price at 18 years old and soon became a driving force in the world of designer toys. Eaton's work for Kidrobot, including the famous Dunny and Munny art toys, helped him achieve international renown and an ever-growing fan base. After forming his Creative Agency Thunderdog Studios in New York City in 2004, Eaton became a leader in the advertising and commercial-art spheres, and is regularly commissioned by a roster of clients that includes Nike, Versace, and even Barack Obama.</em></p> <p><em>These days, Eaton is one of the most prominent street artists working today. Eaton’s large scale mural work features a meticulous, visual collage of pop imagery mixed with his unique personal style, all executed with freehand spray paint on a colossal scale. Eaton now focuses on his Fine Art and large-scale mural work full-time, which can be found in dozens of cities across the globe from Paris to Shanghai.</em></p> <p><em>Eaton’s work can also be seen in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection.</em></p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><em>The Midnight Charette</em> is no<span style= \"color: #000000;\">w <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/\"><em>The Second Studio</em></a>.</span></p> <p><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-second-studio-design-and-architecture-show/id1223815551\"> Apple Podcasts</a></span><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUWyNdjf3Gu6_3gpwq9Yu2Q\">YouTube</a></span><br />  <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/3TVq5fuaZPSzlD84bk3Oqj\">Spotify</a></span></p> <p><strong>CONNECT</strong><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> •</span> <span style= \"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/\">Website: www.secondstudiopod.com</a><br /></span><span style= \"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.instagram.com/secondstudiopod/\">Instagram</a><br /></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.facebook.com/secondstudiopod/\">Facebook</a><br /></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://twitter.com/SecondStudioPod\">Twitter</a><br />  • Call or text questions to 213-222-6950</span></p> <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>SUPPORT</strong><br /> Leave a review :)</span></p> <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>EPISODE CATEGORIES</strong><br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/interviews\">Interviews</a>:</strong> Interviews with industry leaders. <br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/after-hours\">After Hours</a> (AH)</strong>: Casual conversations about everyday life.<br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/design-review\">Design Reviews</a></strong>: Reviews of creative projects and buildings.<br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/fellow-designer\">Fellow Designer</a></strong>: Tips for designers.</span></p>",
