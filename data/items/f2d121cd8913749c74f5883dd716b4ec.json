  "description": "In today’s episode, Cori chooses our topic and we go over an article about the top design trends in 2020 according to designers. We go over a plethora of things that are in and things that are out, with most of which we agree, but there are a few trends with which we don’t completely agree and we explain the reasons why. <br /><br />In: Integrated Hardware, Out: Oversized Pulls 1:55<br />In: Floral Wallpaper, Out: Geometric Prints 4:34<br />In: Grand Millennial Style, Out: Grey On Grey 5:39<br />In: Bold Monochromatics, Out: Pale Monochromatics 8:17<br />In: Layering Old with New, Out: Perfection 10:02<br />In: Dark Painted Doors, Out: Standard White Doors and Trim 14:23<br />In: Earth Tones, Out: Cool Tones 16:52<br />In: Fun Bathroom Design, Out: Open Shelving 17:49<br />In: Washing a Room in One Paint Color, Out: Accent Walls 19:36<br />In: Faux Marble, Out: Real Marble 31:30<br />In: Classicism, Out: Industrial Design 34:34<br />In: Real Plants and Flowers, Out: Faux Plants and Flowers 35:53<br />In: Multifunctional, Out: Formal Separation of Spaces 37:50<br />In: Classic Interiors, Out: All-White Kitchens 40:56<br />In: Furniture with Rounded Edges, Out: Metal Framed Furniture 44:42<br /><br />“Another decorator trick is to take 10% or 20% of that wall color and use it on the ceiling. So even if, say, the room is pink, the ceiling isn’t stark white. It’s a really light, light tint of white so that the pink continues on and doesn’t feel like you’ve left out one of the surfaces.” 25:35<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/trends/g29859422/design-trends-2020/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/trends/g29859422/design-trends-2020/</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
