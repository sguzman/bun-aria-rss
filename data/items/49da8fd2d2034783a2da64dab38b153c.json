  "description": "<p>On September 20, 1990, after her usual night shift at the local grocery store in Mendota, Illinois, Veronica Blumhorst clocked out at 1:07am. She walked out to her car with her coworkers, they said goodnight and Veronica headed home. She had mentioned to her coworkers that she was really tired and planned to just go home and go to bed. Veronica's mom woke up around 2am and noticed Veronica's car parked in the garage. She assumed Veronica was in bed and went back to sleep. When her brother woke up that morning, he looked for Veronica because she was supposed to drive him to school. He was confused because her car was there but he could not find his sister anywhere. She was last seen by her coworkers at the grocery store and in the almost 30 years that have passed, Veronica has never been seen again.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Veronica Blumhorst, please call the Mendota Police Department at 815-539-9331. You may also call Special Agent Brian Wentz with the FBI at 708-349-0004.</p><p>If you would like to follow Veronica’s story on social media, you can visit “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/254098139036/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Remember Veronica Jill Blumhorst</a>.”</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
