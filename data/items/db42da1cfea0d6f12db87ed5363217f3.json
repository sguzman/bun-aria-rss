  "description": "My track record of posting here has been pretty poor in 2020, partly because of a bunch of content I&rsquo;ve contributed elsewhere. In general, my guiding principle for posting is to only add stuff I&rsquo;d want to read or cite, e.g., because I haven&rsquo;t seen it discussed elsewhere. Well, no one has compiled a meta-post of my public work from 2020 (that I know of), so it&rsquo;s finally time to publish it myself."
