  "description": "How does your involuntary stress response system affect you throughout life?\nThis episode takes a wide-angle look at attachment throughout one’s life, discusses how one’s environment affects their system’s involuntary response to stress, and how that stress response system impacts us from infancy to the autumn years. In this episode, co-hosts Ann Kelley Phd and Sue Marriott LCSW, CGP discuss attachment across the lifespan, specifically looking at the elder years and how our attachment system affects us as caretakers of our parents or as the senior who may be undergoing the various losses inherent in aging.\n\nFrom toddlerhood, friendships, dating, mating, aging, and even through the dying process our stress response system governs how we manage these important transitions. As physical, mental and financial stress go up as we age, so does our need for security and people to nurture us. Attachment roles may reverse and understanding this deeply may provide openings for changes to close relationships.\n\nNeuroscience continues to document our ability to change and grow throughout our life. This episode takes a wide-angle look at attachment throughout one’s life, discusses how one’s environment affects their system’s response to stress, and how that system impacts us from infancy to the autumn years.  Learn how to adjust set stress “pathways” and move towards more secure relating in adult relationships, and also unravel the parallels that exist between attachment in infants and the elderly.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR LIVE CONFERENCE ON ATTACHMENT APRIL 7, 2018 – Early Bird Discount available now:\n\nHealing Adult Attachment, the 3 Pillars of Integrated Treatment  with Dr. David Elliott (Thank you to our co-sponsor Austin IN Connection.)\n\nEpisode 54 podcast notes:\n\n0:00-10:00\n\nIntroduction & David Elliot conference April 7, 2018\n\nAttachment overall: Our environment directly affects how our system responds to stress.\n\nHow babies are responded to when distressed directly impacts the attachment relationship they develop.\n\nInvoluntary stress response, HPA Axis\n\nSet Points: Cortisol level upon waking (stress response) impacted by attachment status and primary relationships. Even with positive relationships with mothers, surprising study where race of the child affects cortisol and set these kids up for more risk. Epigenetics.\n\nInsecure attachment is actually a very effective coping mechanism and strategy in children in stressful situations. It’s a strategy not a disorder!\n\nKeep cortisol level low – keep those you’re attached to close, eye contact, holding, tone of voice, self-soothing, interpersonal regulation.\n\nAlan Sroufe longitudinal study since 1976\n\n10:00-20:00\n\n“Pathways”: optimal and problematic routes\n\nThose with lower cortisol levels are more likely to ask for help.\n\nEarly caregiving vs. friendship networks\n\nIt’s possible to move pathways from insecure to secure, particularly with strong relationships\n\nSpiritual relationships: secure attachments to spiritual center or community can be a very healing, integrative place\n\nAdult attachment: voluntary relationships and reciprocally dependent, symmetrical not asymetrical like parent-child\n\nCouples therapy and getting people to try to turn to one another, idea of the “soft toss”\n\nRecognizing when partner is in a stress response as being “lost in familiar places”\n\n20:00-32:00\n\nThe aging process: as we mature, we become more secure as we become less anxious regarding how the world views us. Security set point can change.\n\nLearn to turn to people in life events\n\nProcess of attachment affects us all the way from infancy to skidding into the grave, important to keep compassion.\n\nFailure to thrive in infancy, “failure to thrive” in elders\n\nAll people aging do better with emotional support than with instrumental support\n\nTherapy pets and response to stress, attachment doesn’t need to be human-to-human\n\nWrap up\n\nWant more like this?",
