If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.\nWe loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.\nShe just started dating a man that she thinks is great. But before they go on their first date she wants to verify that he is truly single.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
