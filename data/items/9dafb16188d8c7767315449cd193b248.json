  "description": "Hey Trumpcast listeners! Your host Virginia has some big news. Her next podcast—After Trump—is a guidebook alongside legal scholars Jack Goldsmith and Bob Bauer—both former Trumpcast guests—to reforming our laws, norms, and ethical codes so we never get in that fix again. After Trump is coming soon to a podcast app near you. To learn more, go to AfterTrumpPod.com.\n \nBut first, Virginia is here to introduce an episode of a new show from Slate: A Word, with Jason Johnson. \n \nYou’ve heard Jason on Trumpcast several times. Now, every Friday he’ll bring his sharp analysis to discussions with policy-makers, journalists, entertainers, and other experts about America’s challenges around race, and ideas on the way forward. In this episode, Jason is joined by LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, one of the groups that helped Democrats win Georgia at the Senate and presidential level. After historic Black turnout flipped Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed a new law that could hit Black and other voters of color hard. Listen for a discussion on how activists are fighting back against this new controversial law.\n\nSubscribe to A Word right here in your podcast app.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
