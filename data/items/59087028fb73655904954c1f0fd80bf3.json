  "description": "<p>Former Air Force Staff Sgt. Spencer Stone garnered international headlines in 2015 when he and his childhood friends, Anthony Sadler and Alek Skarlatos, thwarted a major terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train. An unarmed Stone rushed toward the danger, subduing and disarming a man wielding an assault rifle, pistol, box cutter and enough ammunition to kill everyone on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Stone and his friends saved hundreds of lives that day. Despite serious injuries as a result of the encounter, Stone provided life-saving care to a man who received a gunshot wound to his throat during the attack. For his heroic and selfless actions, French President Francois Hollande presented Stone with the nation’s highest decoration, The Legion of Honor. Upon his return to the United States, he was honored in a ceremony at the Pentagon and was awarded the Airman’s Medal and a Purple Heart. President Barack Obama also hosted the trio at the White House.&nbsp;</p><p>In a stunning turn of events, just a month and a half after the Paris attack—and three days before Stone was to return to duty in the Air Force–he was brutally attacked in his hometown of Sacramento, CA, while defending a female friend. Stone was stabbed in his heart, lung and liver with injuries so serious that the crime scene was initially declared a homicide. Life-saving surgery followed, and he has since made a full recovery from the attack.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stone, Sadler and Skarlatos released a book detailing their incredible journey, <em>The 15:17 to Paris</em>, which caught the eye of legendary filmmaker Clint Eastwood. Now a major motion picture, Stone and his friends play themselves in the film, which was released in February 2018.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stone and Sadler are contestants on season 33 of Amazing Race on CBS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reality Life with Kate Casey</p><p>Patreon: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.patreon.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Cameo: <a href=\"https://cameo.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://cameo.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.instagram.com/katecaseyca</a></p><p>Tik Tok: <a href=\"http://www.tiktok.com/itskatecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tiktok.com/itskatecasey</a></p><p>Clubhouse: @katecasey&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245</a></p><p>Amazon.com: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.amazon.com/shop/katecasey</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
