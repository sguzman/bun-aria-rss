  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 10/29/22",
  "description": "This week on the Mark Levin Show, the big divide that people keep talking about exists and it's between liberty and tyranny; between law and order and we are on the right side of history. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has pulled the funding from conservative Republican candidates that he doesn't like because if they win, they might not vote for him as leader. The White House has no answers on the Diesel shortage because it's this administration's policies that caused these very problems. The Biden administration used the climate change lie to spend our economy into a recession. Now, none of the Democrats are running on climate change because they know it's not a winning issue at the ballot box. Democrats are damaging the country and the patriots of America must choose liberty, unite, and stop them at the ballot box. Then, if you want to destroy America, in addition to food shortages and diesel fuel shortages, then Vote Democrat. The republic is being destroyed by people who hate our founding and prosperity and that is what this election is really about. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
