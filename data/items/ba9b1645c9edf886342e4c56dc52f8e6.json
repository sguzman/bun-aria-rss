  "description": "Sectors from autos to apparel to semiconductors are warning of the impact inflation could have if it’s not brought under control… and the Fed needs to move aggressively to fight it. Daniel and I discuss whether the market is pricing in inflation… and why we’re skeptical of the Fed doing the right thing. [0:45]  Speaking of higher interest rates, I share my experience getting a construction loan for my new house… and the impact higher rates could have on the housing market. [8:40] Growth stocks continue to be extremely volatile as higher rates loom… And one of Daniel’s favorites has been unfairly hit over the past few months. Daniel explains why investors should be watching this remarkable growth story. [16:45] Crocs (CROX) announced it would be suspending share buybacks to focus on lowering its debt. I explain why I think this is a smart move… and whether Crocs is a buy at current levels. [22:10] Plus, we discuss the impact of easing mask requirements… and the best opportunity for 100% gains over the next year as we continue to adjust to the new normal. [25:40] Enjoyed this episode?
