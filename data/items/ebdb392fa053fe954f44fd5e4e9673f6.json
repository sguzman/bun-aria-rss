    "media:description": "Quirky, edgy, and extremely underwhelming is how I would describe Carolines new underrated (and for good reason) single The Birthday Song. In this updated version of a common classic, Caroline displays none existing vocals, paired with free loops she found off the internet. The visuals that accompany the music are reminiscent of a tired Taylor Swift that has recently weened off a steady meth addiction. Her deadpan expression only reveals that she is trying too hard to be likable. And could somebody please find this girl someone to mix her damn audio. It sounds as though she recorded a drunk voicemail she received from an immediate relative on her birthday, and just put a beat to it. All in all a great listen, and I canâ€™t wait to see what she does next.\n\nTo clarify, this is a parody on bedroom pop artists, and is in no way a real song.",
