The amount of funny memes and crazy moments changed the animation industry entirely. Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, Season 6 are all insane. So today on Spilling The Milk we react to the most cursed episodes of the amazing world of gumball to see what the hype is about, is darwin adopted? are the ships cannon? Should adults be watching it? cringe\n\n#gumball #memes #theamazingworldofgumball",
