  "description": "<p>Starting a homestead can be a daunting task.  It can be even more overwhelming when you compare yourself to a seasoned homesteader such as myself.  While \"how do I start a homestead?\" is one of the most common questions I receive, after living the homestead life for almost 12 years I'm a little disconnected from the startup portion of the journey.  Today I'm happy to announce that my sister Jenna has come to save the day.  Recent life changes have driven her and her husband to buy a 10 acre property and begin their own homesteading journey.  Join us as we chronicle the building of Jenna's homestead from the ground up.  Today's focus is on the  feeling of becoming a first time homesteader.  Jenna realling the moment she realized the whole thing is real was a magical experience.  If you've wanted to start a homestead but had no idea where to start, start here!<br/><br/>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Makerplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps.
