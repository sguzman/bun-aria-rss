  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP has a pokemon-esque encounter with a wild Karen! OP was playing a Pokemon game on her switch while she was on her break at work. A little kid sees OP playing the game and asks to play it as well. OP warns that her break is over soon, which causes the child's mother to flip out on OP and demand that she leaves behind her switch so the kid can play on it. OP doesn't want to just hand over her Switch for obvious reasons, so the Karen calls over the manager to try to force OP into giving the Switch.</p>\n<p>Get $10 in free Bitcoin at Coinbase.com/rslash</p>\n",
