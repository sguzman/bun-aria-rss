  "description": "Free agency has essentially hit the NFL. Sure we may be in the \"legal tampering\" period, but deals are still getting done so we bring in the Pick Six Superfriends for their reactions. The Patriots had a day unlike many other in their franchise history, spending on Matt Judon, Jonnu Smith, Jalen Mills and more. New England did lose a key piece as Joe Thuney signed with the Chiefs. The Bucs continue to bring guys back headlined by Shaq Barrett and Rob Gronkowski (who re-signed just after we finished recording). Much more free agency reaction to come this week!\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
