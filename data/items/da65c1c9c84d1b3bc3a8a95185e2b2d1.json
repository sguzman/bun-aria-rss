  "description": "<p>Tonight we are having a round table discussion with John (a retired police officer), Jack (a current police officer), and Ken (our insider). We will be discussing a government cover-up regarding Sasquatch. This is an interesting discussion because one of the police officers has had direct contact with representatives claiming to be from the Department of the Interior. We will be discussing personal Sasquatch encounters these guys have had and 9-1-1 calls they have been out to. Hang on because this is going to be interesting as the night takes a turn.</p> <p> </p> <p>Visit us at <a href=\"http://www.sasquatchchronicles.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.sasquatchchronicles.com</a></p>",
