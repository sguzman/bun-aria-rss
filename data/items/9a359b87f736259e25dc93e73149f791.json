  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Last week, the S&P dropped the furthest it has since May after Donald Trump's fiery comments about North Korea. Global markets sold off almost immediately, yet only to be met with something we should be all too familiar with… A quick recovery. Over today’s eight-year bull market, there’s been an interesting dynamic that’s played out over and over again, and it has helped keep this rally afloat through some questionable times... But if it’s not Trump that’s pushing the market higher these days… what else is there? It’s questions and times like these that call for a real expert: A guy I can ask anything, who can take a conversation in any direction. From dangerous “buy mode” algo’s, earnings season, and the weakening of the US dollar... to the parabolic climb of bitcoin, and how to protect yourself from today’s recent volatility… Today’s guest and I discuss all four corners of the market.",
