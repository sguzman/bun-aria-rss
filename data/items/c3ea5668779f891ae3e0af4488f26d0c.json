  "description": "<p><p>Step aside Julian Assange. Go fuck yourself Jim Acosta. Who gives a shit about the Pentagon Papers. The most persecuted journalist in America is Kirk Minihane, host of Barstool Sports' The Kirk Minihane Show.</p><p>Following the extraordinarily successful launch of his new show, which immediately ranked #1 in the Sports and Recreation category, Kirk Minihane was the subject of a terrifying campaign of intimidation and anti-First Amendment pigheadedness led by a powerful government official, the mayor of some city in Massachusetts.</p><p>In today's show, Minihane reacts to the news that Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone is suing him and Barstool Sports over his hilarious prank call. From his discovery of the lawsuit to his compelling conversations with his new bosses, Minihane offers the minute-by-minute break down of the most harrowing day of his journalistic career. Will he end up in court? Will he go to jail? Who will his prison boyfriend be?</p><p>To answer these questions, Minihane assembles his crack legal team, including Pats beat writer Dave Brown and the inimitable William Bendetson. Blind Mike joins Minihane in-studio to audition as the most important member of the legal team, courtroom sketch artist. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
