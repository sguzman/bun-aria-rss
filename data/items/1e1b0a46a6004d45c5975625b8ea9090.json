  "description": "<p>Every church has them—ineffective systems. Why? Partly because systems must constantly be evaluated and edited for results. In this episode, Tony and Amy share how to differentiate a systems problem from a people problem, the most common clogged systems churches have (One is vitally important!), and a 6-step process you can follow to fix them.</p> <p>Tony also shares a story about a broken system at a popular restaurant chain. The key phrase was \"clogged beef tube.\" You won't soon forget the analogy. </p>",
