  "description": "<p>This week's episode of \"Watch What Crappens\" is jam packed with goodness. We start with the ladies of \"Real Housewives of New York City\" and their return trip to THE BERKSHIRES. Will Ramona cry? Will Bethenny cry? Will everyone cry? (yes)<br />\nOnce you've digested your raven, get ready to then head over to sophisticated LAWNG ISLAND for the premiere of \"Secrets & Wives.\" It's like \"Princesses: Long Island\" grew up and bleached their hair. This show is hilarious, and we go to town on it.<br />\nWe then wrap up everything with the \"Shahs of Sunset\" season finale and the \"Southern Charm\" reunion.
