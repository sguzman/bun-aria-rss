  "description": "The thing about Jake Johnson is: so. many. people. fancy. him! Is it because he legitimately looks like a guy you might bump into at your neighbourhood bar? Or is it because he serves up a specifically appealing mix of gruff, grumpy heat (with truly *superb* onscreen kiss abilities!) that just makes you want to join him on the sofa and rail at modern life? We discuss his many forms and charms, from New Girl, to Into the Spider-Verse via Easy etc. We also have a couple of original drabbles that might make you sweat a little.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman, and Bim is @bimadew. Our music is by Tanya Morgan. You can find show notes, gifs and so much more on our Tumblr at thirstaidkitpodcast.tumblr.com. Send us your own short drabbles! We’re at thirstaidkit@slate.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
