  "title": "Todd McShay, NFL Draft Week, UFC 261, And Monday Reading",
  "description": "<p>NFL Draft week has finally arrived and Goodell can hug again (3:09 - 13:01). UFC 261 was sick and we talk about the story lines coming out of it (13:01 - 24:40). We give the listeners some homework (24:40 - 37:52). Who's back of the week including Billy padding his stats (37:52 - 51:30). Todd McShay joins the show to talk about the draft on Thursday, QB's at the top, a great anecdote about Devonta Smith and more (51:30 - 88:37). We finish with Monday Reading for the guy obsessed with Disney and how they're ruining his immersion.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
