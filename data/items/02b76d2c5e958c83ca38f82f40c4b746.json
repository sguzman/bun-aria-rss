A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. Its been nearly two weeks since the tragic events at the Las Vegas Concert that has left 58 dead and over 500 wounded. The \"Official\" story is incomplete and the public knows less now than it did when the shooting stopped. So where is the security? Where are the answers? What is the posturing all about? Or do we really want to know the answers?\nPodcast: Galtspeaks.com (wrm.podomatic.com),\nContact: Radio@galtspeaks.com\nFollow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz\nSpreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show",
