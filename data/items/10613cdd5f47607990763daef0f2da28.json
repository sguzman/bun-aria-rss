  "description": "<div>Many of us have been sucked into the abyss of social media over the past decade with the expectation of keeping up with friends, connecting with people from our past, and spying on our exâ€™s. The benefits of this interaction are at the core of why so many people choose to participate.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>However, when the service is free, sometimes that means that YOU are the product, and these social media platforms have used their customers to generate vast amounts of data that is being sold to the highest bidder. This information is used to target advertising specifically to suit the needs of the individual user in hopes that they will buy the product or service being offered.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>The dark side to all of this is that sometimes that information is used for more nefarious purposes and ends up in the hands of social engineers that seek to control humanity. Has social media made society less social, and what are the ramifications of this transformation on humanity?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors:<br>\n</strong>Emergency Preparedness Food:<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com/\">www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com</a><strong><br>\n</strong>Chemical Free Body: <a href=\"http://www.chemicalfreebody.com/\">www.chemicalfreebody.com<br>\n</a>Use the promo code: \"<strong>MACRO\"</strong> for a discount on all purchases!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
