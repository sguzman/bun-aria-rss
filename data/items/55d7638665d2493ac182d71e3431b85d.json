  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the inaugural episode of Monday Night Manning, and how incredible it was to watch Peyton, Eli, and the bevy of guests they had watch the Monday Night Football game, dissect the defenses, and give everyone who watched the game a true education in Quarterback play in the NFL. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk for the 2nd installment of the season, is reigning NFL MVP, Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about the Packers performance against the Saints in Jacksonville, what the mood in the locker room is like, when Aaron and Coach LaFleur will chat about what happened and fix what they saw, if it's even worth addressing all the people who were going to pile on after everything that happened in the offseason, how he thought the offensive line played well, and what they need to do to get back on the right track (27:14-57:00). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, former GM of the Cleveland Browns, special assistant to the New England Patriots coaching staff, author, and host of the GM Shuffle Pod and the Lombardi Line, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Lombo chat about the rumors he's hearing from a credible source that Urban Meyer is going to be one and done in Jacksonville and is going to take the vacant USC job after the season, if Packers fans should be worried at all about their performance on Sunday, how we should prepare for gambling week 2 in the NFL, and his thoughts on the Raiders and Ravens game from last night (59:04-1:13:53). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk welcome 14 year NFL veteran at Quarterback, Pro Bowler, and member of the Tom Brady Kentucky Derby party, Matt \"Cass Dogg\" Cassel, to chat about his thoughts on week 1 of the NFL season, why things are different in New England from everywhere else, he tells a hilarious story about one of his best friends, Mike Vrabel cutting him in Tennessee, and what some of the worst and best places to live were during his time in the NFL (1:34:03-1:55:27).
