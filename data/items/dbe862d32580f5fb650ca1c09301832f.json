  "description": "God wants to increase us, but oftentimes we overlook the small things because we want to go big. We may even think that we don’t have to deal with something small because it’s not going to make that much difference anyway. It’s easy to think that how we’re treating our spouse or all the complaining we do about our job doesn’t really matter. Perhaps there’s a lack of integrity, leaving the office early, thinking the boss isn’t looking. And on top of that, too often we think we don’t have the right education or the finances or the right people connections to achieve our dreams.All of that is small stuff, but God says what we believe and our attitudes are very important. The small things matter to Him, and if we don’t learn to handle the small, we’ll never go big. Perhaps you need to forgive someone or start being on time at work. That may seem small, but it’s only “little by little” that you can go big. You want a great marriage. You want that promotion. You have to do what’s right in the small things. Remember, a majestic oak tree starts with a small seed.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
