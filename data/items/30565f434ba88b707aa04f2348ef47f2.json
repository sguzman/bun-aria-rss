  "description": "“I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.”\nThis is the story of hard fights and harder losses. \nIt’s early 1864, and battle-proven, newly promoted Ulysses S. Grant is now over the whole army, and he’s launching an ambitious plan: the Overland Campaign. He’ll wage several battles in Virginia as other generals strike other parts of the Confederacy. The losses are staggering. Not only will tens of thousands of men lose life or limb, but one particularly influential and beloved Confederate leader won’t make it out alive.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
