  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Historically, Black women are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence. However, the pandemic has exacerbated violence and abuse toward Black women. Due to the health and financial challenges of COVID-19, many Black women have been isolated in their homes and unable to find safety from abusive partners. As we commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month this month, I wanted to make sure you didn’t miss the critical conversation I had with Dr. Shanita Brown in 2019. Dr. Brown is a licensed professional counselor, speaker, educator and trainer in NC that fosters transformative and empowering dialogue about intimate partner violence & mental health wellness. </p>\n<p>She and I chatted about how you can recognize the signs of domestic violence, why it’s important to understand domestic violence in the context of power and control as opposed to anger management, and how you can support a loved one who may be in a relationship with an abusive partner. Plus, Dr. Brown shared tons of incredible resources for anyone seeking additional help.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://www.sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/28/1060057/pandemic-black-women-domestic-violence/\">The Pandemic Created a Perfect Storm for Black Women at Risk for Domestic Violence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/00m092cw2otgjks/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf?dl=0\">The Power & Control Wheel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/0usqe9divj8b0jo/Equalitywheelpdf.pdf?dl=0\">The Equality Wheel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ujimacommunity.org/\">Ujima Community</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acalltomen.org/\">A Call to Men</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drnataliejones.com/podcast/\">A Date with Darkness podcast</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Brown</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.drshanitabrown.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrSBrown\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Dr.ShanitaBrown/\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drshanitabrown\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
