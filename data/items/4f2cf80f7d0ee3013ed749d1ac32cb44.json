  "description": "<div>This week, the gals consider the motives and minds of children who murder. Cases include a 13-year old serial killer, a seemingly sweet little girl with an insidious habit, and a publicity stunt gone horribly wrong. This topic is paired with Cascinacastlet Barbera Dâ€™Asti, so pick up a bottle, make sure there are no murderous minors nearby, and enjoy.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
