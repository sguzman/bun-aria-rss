Then, the guys discuss the one thing the Panthers must do better than the Saints (35:15) and why the story about the drama between the biggest names in New England isn’t news to the Patriots (42:00). Plus, Danny Kelly joins the show with X factors for each wild-card matchup (48:30), including why there might actually be some hope for the Bills (51:00). Finally, the guys predict the winners of each game (59:15), and talk about the matchups for next week’s divisional round (01:01:30).\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
