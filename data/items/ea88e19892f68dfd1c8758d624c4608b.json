  "description": "The country is on the edge of its seat right now, as key battleground states continue to count votes for the hotly contested 2020 U.S. presidential election. No one is willing to make any official predictions right now—which is smart, since nothing about this election has been predictable. Andrew Horowitz, founder and president of Horowitz & Company, returns to the podcast to discuss the potential outcomes of the election… and which state is most crucial right now. Andrew also shares several ideas he likes… and helps explain how to position and protect yourself, no matter who wins this election in the end. [3:03] Plus, why you need to be prepared for the election results to drag out for a long time.
