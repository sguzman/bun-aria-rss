Have you considered how much your identity has been negotiated with others since child-hood in order to be molded to the social norms? Clinical psychologist, Dr.Jordan B. Peterson uncovers the idea of functional identity and ties it to the tendencies you had as a child to self-regulate your behaviors in order to fit in. Your notion of self-identity and ability to leverage beyond the known in a logical landscape that navigates the unknown is anchored to the role you play among your peers. In this episode, you will travel through a conversation with Jordan and Tom that will push your view of peer groups, their role in shaping your identity, and how your responsibilities lie within your willingness to sacrifice and strive for more. Jordan explores the importance of slaying your dragons, and understanding that the ultimate battle is with yourself.   Order Jordan’s Book, ”Beyond Order”: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rkCjE4\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3rkCjE4</a>   SHOW NOTES:   Self-Identity | Jordan explains his theory for how identity is a dramatic role we play out.
