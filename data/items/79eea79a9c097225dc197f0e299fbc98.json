  "description": "<p>Working out offers a healthy path towards self-actualization. But it can also be used to avoid ‘working in’, perpetuating denial of that which must be confronted.</p><p>What’s the difference between the two? Ask&nbsp;<strong>Chris Hauth</strong>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<strong>Caroline Burckle</strong>&nbsp;and they’ll both agree:&nbsp;<em>the answer is intention.</em></p><p>Over the last few years, it’s been a tradition to host periodic performance fitness deep dives with my long-time coach, Olympian, former professional triathlete, and fellow endurance fanatic Chris Hauth in a series erstwhile referred to as Coach’s Corner. Unfortunately, the pandemic derailed the regularity of this institution, our last observance of this sacred ritual conducted exactly one year ago on Zoom.</p><p>In apologetic atonement for this grievous oversight, today we restore balance to the Universe, graced with the presence of not one but two Olympians because Chris and myself are joined by Caroline Burckle—an audience favorite many of you will fondly recall from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/caroline-burckle-565/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #565</a>&nbsp;this past December.</p><p>For those new to the show, Chris is a sub-9 hour Ironman champion, a former Olympic Swimmer, a veteran of many an ultra-endurance challenge, my ÖTILLÖ Swimrun World Championship teammate, and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches.</p><p>Caroline (Burks) is a former swimmer & Olympic medalist with 23 All American titles, 2 NCAA individual victories & NCAA Female Swimmer of the Year accolades to her name. She runs&nbsp;RISE, a mentor program that pairs Olympic athletes with young elite athletes for support and guidance.</p><p>This is a super fun round table discussion on how to bring purpose and intention to our strength and endurance goals.</p><p>It’s about how to create opportunities for personal growth, resilience, and the adaptability that athletic performance and this pandemic present and demand.</p><p>It’s about the power of self-curated adventures in lieu of formal competition. It’s about what sport can teach us about patience, self-love, and discipline.
