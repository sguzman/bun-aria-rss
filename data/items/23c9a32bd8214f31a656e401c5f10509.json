  "title": "Key Person of Influence by Daniel Priestley",
  "description": "A key person of influence as defined by Priestley is a person who is well-known and associated with being a leader in a specific industry. That person enjoys the spoils of being explicitly associated with that industry experiencing the benefits that come with that status. The theme of the book centres on the Five-Step KPI framework that we can follow to be a key person of influence. The five steps are pitch, publish, product, profile and partnership. The book is for entrepreneurs wanting to grow their brand in their own chosen industry. The content described in this book relevant to entrepreneurs and business people alike. If you're a casual reader, I can't see the benefit in reading this. But if you're someone wanting to increase your knowledge about how to grow your brand and business, then this book is definitely for you. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
