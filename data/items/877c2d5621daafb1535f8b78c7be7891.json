  "description": "The Zero Trust security model asserts that organizations should not trust anything within its perimeters and instead must inspect every traffic and verify anything connecting to its systems before granting access. While Zero Trust is generating a lot of buzz in the cyber world, it’s often hard to determine the implications of this security model. \nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, guests will discuss the origins of the model, cut through the hype, and discuss what you really need to know to design, implement, and monitor an effective Zero Trust approach. John Kindervag of ON2IT Cybersecurity, also known as the \"Creator of Zero Trust,\" shares his insights with the CyberWire's Rick Howard, and Tom Clavel of sponsor ExtraHop joins Kapil Raina from their partner CrowdStrike to offer their thoughts to the CyberWire's Dave Bittner.",
