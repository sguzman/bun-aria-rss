  "description": "In today's podcast we review some notes on alleged North Korean involvement in fraudulent SWIFT transfers, and on new US sanctions. We take a look at various corners of the cyber criminal underground, including commodification of both malware and stolen data. Big claims for artificial intelligence are going to involve some big litigation, too. And we hear, again, about the vulnerability of data-at-rest and the importance of encrypting your devices. Ben Yelin from the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland security discusses the potential legal ramifications of a Facebook privacy suit, and Joseph Billingsley tells us about the Military Cyber Professionals Association.",
