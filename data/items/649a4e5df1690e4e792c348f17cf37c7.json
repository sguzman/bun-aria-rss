CNN’s move was prompted by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/technology/facebook-australia-comments.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent ruling</a> by the High Court of Australia in <a href=\"https://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2021/HCA/27\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fairfax Media and Voller</em></a><em>, </em>which held that media companies can be held liable for defamatory statements made by <em>third parties </em>in the comments on their public pages, <em>even if they didn’t know about them</em>. This is a pretty extraordinary expansion of potential liability for organizations that run public pages with a lot of engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>On this week’s episode of Arbiters of Truth, our series on the online information ecosystem, Evelyn Douek and Quinta Jurecic spoke with David Rolph, a professor at the University of Sydney Law School and an expert on media law, to understand the ruling and its potential impact.

What does it mean for <em>you, </em>if someone writes a nasty comment under your Facebook post or your tweet? Why did the court rule the way it did?
