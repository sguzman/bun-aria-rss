  "description": "<p>Today’s book discussion on The Literary Life podcast centers around the book <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3teDNkB\">84, Charing Cross Road</a>.</em> Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks share their first experiences reading this book of letters between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel. Cindy talks about her deep identification with Helene the first time she read <em>84, Charing Cross Road</em> and how much she dreamed of going to England. Angelina and Thomas talk about the characteristics of Helene as a reader and as a person seeking self-education.</p> <p>Come back again next week for a special guest episode look at the literary life of Charlotte Mason! After that, we dig into George Eliot’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3anQDo6\">Silas Marner</a></em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Our Japanese soldiers who came back from overseas were a pitiful sight. They looked thin, weak, and exhausted. And some of them were invalids, drained of color and borne on stretchers.<br /> <br /> But among the returning soldiers there was one company of cheerful men. They were always singing, even difficult pieces in several parts and they sang very well. When they disembarked at Yokosuka the people who came to greet them were astonished. Everyone asked if they had received extra rations, since they seemed so happy.<br /> <br /> These men had had no extra rations, but had practiced choral singing throughout the Burma campaign. Their captain, a young musician fresh from music school, had enthusiastically taught his soldiers how to sing. It was singing that kept up their morale through boredom or hardship and that bound them together in friendship and discipline during the long war years. Without it, they would never have come home in remarkable high spirits.</p> <cite>Michio Takeyama </cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Men are apt to prefer a prosperous error before an afflicted truth.</p> <cite>Jeremy Taylor</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Secondhand booksellers are the most friendly and most eccentric of all the characters I have known.
