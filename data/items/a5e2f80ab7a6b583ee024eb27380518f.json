  "description": "<p>When Laetitia Tamko started making the second Vagabon album, she really wanted to produce the entire thing on her own. It would be a new sound, and producing was still a relatively new skill to her, but she wanted to tackle it head on, and do it all herself. On this song, though, \"Water Me Down,\" Laetitia actually has a co-producer, Eric Littman. It’s the one exception to her otherwise entirely self-produced album. In this episode, she breaks down how she and Eric made the song, and why it was worth making that exception.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/vagabon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/vagabon</a></p>",
