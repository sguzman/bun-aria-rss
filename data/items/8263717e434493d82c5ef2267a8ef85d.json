  "description": "Not only did director and writer Alex Ross Perry work in a video store while he was learning to become a filmmaker, his first film crew was made up of his friends and co-workers at the video store and they remain his crew today. Alex explains to Marc that watching films by directors like David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick made him want to have an immediately identifiable style. He found his style while embracing a true independent film aesthetic, which means virtually no money and very few shooting days. It all culminated with Alex’s most recent film, Her Smell, which he made with his frequent collaborator Elisabeth Moss. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://anchor.fm/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anchor</a> (<a href=\"http://anchor.fm/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anchor.fm/start</a>), <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a> (<a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">squarespace.com/wtf</a>), and <a href=\"http://zinus.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zinus</a> (<a href=\"http://zinus.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">zinus.com/WTF</a>). <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
