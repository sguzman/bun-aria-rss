  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Constitution is the Constitution and that's a fact! Republicans must use parliamentary tools to ensure that they keep Kamal Harris in the Senate breaking ties, for the rest of her tenure.  Democrats are running circles around Republicans and Republicans are allowing a dangerous precedent to be set in their attempt to illegitimately impeach a former President while they are a private citizen. If any president wanted to wage an insurrection, as commander in chief, they would have a lot more than a few hundred anarchists taking selfies, they would have the entire US military at their disposal. To suggest that Trump incited anything is false! The 10 Republicans that voted for impeaching Trump without any hearing or witnesses must be challenged in their primary elections. Later, impeachment against a private citizen completely changes the impeachment clause of the Constitution. It's simply not what the founders intended. If Supreme Court Justice John Roberts doesn't preside over the Senate impeachment trial, Kamala Harris can't either. Then, Joe Biden's plan for vaccine distribution doesn't exist. Even, CNN's Chris Cuomo and Anthony Fauci admit that this reporting is unreliable. Afterward, Democrats want to destroy the economy and that which fuels it. Petroleum fuels most of our transportation and it’s used for products like plastic which will rise in cost.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
