  "title": "281 - Arthur Shawcross: The Genesee River Killer",
  "description": "<p>Arthur Shawcross was born on June 6th, 1945 in Kittery, Maine and he would grow up to terrorize the people of Watertown and Rochester, both in New York. Family, neighbors, schoolmates, and anyone else who met him knew he was \"different\" from an early age. He said odd things, he reacted unnaturally to various situations, he talked to himself, he didn't understand tone, sarcasm, irony, etc. And he was angry. And he was scary when he was angry. Soon, he was torturing  and killing small animals and terrifying children and adults alike. He was setting fires, drilling holes in walls to peep on female family members, and telling outlandish tales. And then, shortly after returning home from Vietnam, and after serving prison time for arson, he raped and killed two children in Watertown. In a heavily criticized plea deal, he was back on the streets less than fifteen years later, his criminal records were  sealed, and he killed at least eleven women in Rochester in less than two years. This tale is a wild one.  And they don't get much darker  and weirder than the story of the Genesee River Killer. <br /><br />The Bad Magic Charity of the month is Love Thy Neighbor! We'll  be giving $15,500 to this Denver-area based 501(3c) nonprofit dedicated to working with local businesses to hand out free food to the homeless.
