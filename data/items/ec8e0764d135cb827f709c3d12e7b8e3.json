  "description": "On Wednesdays Mark Levin Show, with so much at stake we must respond to claims that are inaccurate. Some television judicial analysts, such as Judge Andrew Napolitano, are unfamiliar with the Constitution. Robert Mueller’s appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Given the power that Mueller is exercising and the fact that Rod Rosenstein is not supervising his work directly, it is inaccurate to classify him as an inferior officer in the Department of Justice. He qualifies as a principal officer, a class of federal official like a United States attorney that the Supreme Court has ruled must be appointed by the president and confirmed with consent of the U.S. Senate. Also, Napolitano needs to produce the DOJ memo from the late 1990's that cites a president can be indicted. He can’t because it does not exist. Later, there’s a myth that President Trump somehow violated the norms of the presidency by meeting with Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray and ordering an investigation into how his campaign may have been spied on by the Obama administration during the 2016 election. But past presidents, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and others, have directly ordered investigations because that’s the power of the presidency. Trump has done nothing like Washington, Adams, Jefferson or Jackson did. Not even close, and look how they trash him.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
