  "title": "#125: The Enduring Appeal of The Great Gatsby with Maureen Corrigan",
  "description": "<p>When the Great Gatsby was originally published in 1925, it was a complete critical and commercial flop. It wasn't until after F. Scott Fitzgerald's death that it gained the status of the Great American Novel and it's appeal still endures today. On today's show, I talk to Maureen Corrigan about her book \"So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures.\" We discuss how Gatsby is one of the first hard-boiled novels of the 20th century, why Gastsby still appeals to us today, and what you can do to get more out of your next reading of the Great Gatsby.</p>\n",
