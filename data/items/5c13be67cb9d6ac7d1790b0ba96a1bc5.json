  "title": "68: Sherman's March to the Sea and the Thirteenth Amendment",
  "description": "“I can make the march, and make Georgia howl!”\n\nThis is the story of the March to the Sea and the 13th Amendment.\n\nWilliam Tecumseh “Cump” Sherman describes war as two things: “cruel” and “hell.” Acting under this philosophy, he takes 60,000 of his toughest, most battle-hardened men, and marches from Atlanta to the Peach State’s coast in a show of force meant to break the Confederacy of its will to fight. Cump’s effective--but does he go too far? Americans North and South will debate whether he’s a hero or a villain for generations to come.\n\nMeanwhile, President Abraham Lincoln has grown tired of the fact that the Constitution legally protects the institution of slavery. But the Constitution hasn’t been amended in 60 years; not since Thomas Jefferson was president! Can the Illinois Railsplitter really push through a 13th amendment? We’ll find out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
