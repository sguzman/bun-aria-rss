  "description": "It is possible that in January 2021, America may welcome a president with more foreign policy experience than anyone who has assumed the office in more than three decades. That will be vitally important given the damage that Trump has done to our institutions, relationships and interests at home and abroad. In the first of our \"Agenda 2021\" series of podcasts exploring the priorities a new president ought to pursue, we speak with two distinguished American foreign policy leaders, both who have held the job of Deputy Secretary of State, Ambassador Bill Burns, president of the Carnegie Endowment and the top foreign policy advisor to the Biden campaign Tony Blinken. If you care about the future of America's role in the world, you won't want to miss this.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
