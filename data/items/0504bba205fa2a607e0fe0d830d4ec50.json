  "itunes:summary": "You wouldn’t get very far as a basketball player, if you played by the rules of soccer. Can you imagine? Trying to play without touching the ball with your hands? It’d be ridiculous! Actually impossible! And yet, in your creativity, you let other people’s creative rules and values make you feel disqualified all the time.\n\nYou’ve heard it before “the only rule in creativity is that there are no rules”, so why do we constantly feel like imposters who are “doing it wrong”? \n\nI have a hypothesis:\nBecause we don’t realize that creativity means very different things to each and every artist. We all define and value creativity extremely differently.\n\nIn this episode I want to help you figure out what creativity is about for you. When you start to figure out why YOU love creative work, you can let go of what OTHERS think it’s about and thrive in your own way. \n\nLet these frameworks help define where you’re going next.\n\nThis episode was originally released as 280 in June 2020.",
