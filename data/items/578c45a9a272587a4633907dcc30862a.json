  "description": "<p>Many people accuse the Bible of being a document that promotes oppression and injustice—but that’s not true at all. This text tells us God is a God of justice, and that, to walk with God, we must love mercy (our heart motivation) and do justice (the life we’re supposed to live). Therefore, Micah 6:8 actually summarizes what it means to be a follower of God by saying, “Do justice.”</p>\n<p>This sermon will look at “doing justice” under three headings: 1) The life of justice; 2) The God of justice, and 3) How to live a life of justice before God.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 15, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: Psalm 146:1-10.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
