  "description": "How are businesses able to take advantage of Kentucky's House Bill 100 or better known as the Vintage Spirits Law? Today’s show features two opposite side of the spectrum. We have one side doing retail with Justin Sloane at Justin’s House of Bourbon in Lexington, and the other is on-premise at a restaurant with Larry Rice of the famed Silver Dollar in Louisville. Both of these places are known for having unique bourbons on the menu and we get an inside scoop into how this law has effected their business. We wrap up the show with their greatest dusty hunting stories.\nShow Notes:\n\nTalk about how you got into bourbon\n\nIt seems like many people got started with collecting Maker's Mark. Are any of them valuable now?\n\nJustin, talk about the launching point for The House of Bourbon, was the spirit law a big motivating factor?\n\nWhy did you think a package store would be the best way to capitalize on House Bill 100?\n\nWhy aren't more liquor stores investing in this business model?\n\nLarry, you saw the writing on the wall pretty early and Silver Dollar became a destination for bourbon trail people. What was the idea of having a very large whiskey catalog?\n\nWhere did the honky tonk aspect come from?\n\nWhat is it about vintage or dusty whiskey that they bring to the table?\n\nTalk about how you began acquiring all these bottles\n\nDo you feel uneasy knowing you have all these unicorns and you won’t get to try it?\n\nHow are you managing inventory?\n\nWhat's your target market?\n\nLarry, I think you’re getting locals that are just now getting into the scene but don’t know about the forums.\n\nDo you find it funny that old people thought this was rot gut?\n\nDo you want them to fly off the shelf?\n\nDo vintage spirits have big revenue or is it just value-add?\n\nWill there be an end in sight of getting hands on dusty bourbon?\n\nLets wrap it up with your best dusty hunting story",
