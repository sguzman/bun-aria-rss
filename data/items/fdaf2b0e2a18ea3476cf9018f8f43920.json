  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin, in the latest pseudo-event, Bernie Sanders sounds an awful lot like The Constitution of the Soviet Union (1936). Sanders is lifting ideas from chapter 10 of the USSR Constitution for what he's proposing as his platform for President of The United States. Then, Clinton hitman and pseudo-journalist George Stephanopoulos tries to set-up President Trump with a gotcha question in a recent interview. Trump pushes back saying he'd have to check out the hypothetical information Stephanopoulos mentioned before calling the FBI for simply receiving opposition research. Stephanopoulos never asked Hillary Clinton if he thought it was wrong for Hillary’s campaign to hire a law firm, that hired a consulting firm, that hired an ex-British spy to provide opposition research obtained from Russian's — which actually did happen! Later, former Vice President Joe Biden's son continues to face criticism over dubious dealings with China and Ukraine. Afterward, new information surfaces regarding the involvement of the Obama-era State Department and what they may or may not have known about the dossier.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
