  "description": "This episode I discuss the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. I explain the neural and hormonal basis for \"social homeostasis\" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Social Bonding: Child-Parent, Romantic, Friendship, Breakups\n(00:02:55) Sponsors\n(00:07:08) Social Bonding as a Biological Process\n(00:10:03) Social Isolation\n(00:13:32) Social Homeostasis & Neural Circuits for Social Drive \n(00:18:55) Brain Areas & (Neuro)Chemistry of Social Drive \n(00:22:48) What is Social Homeostasis & Dopamine\n(00:27:00) When We Lack Social Interactions: Short- Versus Long-Term\n(00:28:10) Introverts & Extroverts\n(00:31:00) “Good” Versus “Bad” Social Interactions & Hierarchies\n(00:33:54) Loneliness & Dorsal Raphe Nucleus & Social Hunger \n(00:37:33) Tools\n(00:38:05) Socializing & Food Appetite: Crossover Craving\n(00:42:45) Falling in Love\n(00:45:05) Tools for Social Bonds: Merging Physiologies; Story\n(00:53:54) Childhood Attachment Patterns in Adulthood\n(01:03:45) Attachment Styles: Autonomic Versus Intellectual Attachment\n(01:06:10) Emotional Empathy & Cognitive Empathy, Arguing\n(01:09:45) Allan N.
