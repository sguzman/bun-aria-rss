  "description": "<p>Bowen and Matt are thrilled to welcome the self-proclaimed Martin Luther King of alt comedy to LC. It's the one and only Ziwe! Are you a mononym? Didn't effing think so! So have some respect and listen to our \"iconic guest\" talk about her show <em>Baited with Ziwe</em> (follow @ziwef and tune in every Thursday night at 8 PM on Instagram), her compelling interviews with Caroline Calloway, Alexis Neiers Haines, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan, being a one woman production team, bringing true anarchy to live comedy, pop star aspirations, Stacey Dash in <em>Clueless</em> (and in life!) and much more. Plus, Matt and Bowen's infamous appearance on <em>The View</em> is relitigated, and the three rotted souls get into <em>Real Housewives of Potomac</em>, <em>Beverly Hills</em> and <em>New York</em>, with true fan Ziwe. Is Ziwe Team Candiace or Team Monique? Does she still stand by Denise Richards after recent episodes? Will Ziwe even play by the rules of I Don't Think So Honey? You'll have to listen to find out.
