  "description": "<p>Digital Twin (DT) technologies, which aim to build digital replicas of\nphysical entities, are the key to providing efficient, concurrent simulation\nand analysis of real-world objects. In displaying DTs, Holographic-Type\nCommunication (HTC), which supports the transmission of holographic data such\nas Light Field (LF), can provide an immersive way for users to interact with\nHolographic DTs (HDT). However, it is challenging to effectively allocate\ninteractive and resource-intensive HDT services among HDT users and providers.\nIn this paper, we integrate the paradigms of HTC and DT to form a HTC for DT\nsystem, design a marketplace for HDT services where HDT users' and providers'\nprices are evaluated by their valuation functions, and propose an auction-based\nmechanism to match HDT services using a learning-based Double Dutch Auction\n(DDA). Specifically, we apply DDA and train an agent acting as the auctioneer\nto adjust the auction clock dynamically using Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL), aiming to achieve the best market efficiency. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed learning-based auctioneer can achieve\nnear-optimal social welfare at halved auction information exchange cost of the\nbaseline method.\n</p>",
