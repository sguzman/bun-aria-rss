  "description": "Do you see the value in every opportunity that comes into your life, even if it's not something that was expected or even desired? Do you complain about where you are in life and then not explore the opportunities are presented to you that could possibly begin the process of moving you toward the life you want because they aren't quite what you were hoping for? \n In this episode, the guys discuss respecting unexpected  opportunities and speaking well of them even if they’re not the ones you want. You never know; maybe this opportunity can be the bridge or stepping stone to the  one you want. Like the Good Book says, \"Despise not small beginnings.\"\n  \n Listener Perks:\n Organifi is giving our listeners up to 20% off of their order! Just go to www.organifi.com/success. Their superfood green juice powder allows you to get your greens anytime, anywhere while on the go.",
