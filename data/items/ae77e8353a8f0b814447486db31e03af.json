  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, our hosts wrap up their series on <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vE4Eu0\">The Abolition of Man</a></em> by C. S. Lewis. Angelina kicks off today’s conversation about chapter 3 with more exploration and clarification of the concept of “the Tao.” Cindy talks about the importance of respect for the past and how much we have lost by letting go of that. Thomas highlights the fact that so many education theorists were men who never had reared children and the difference that a mother’s experience makes. One of the main themes of this discussion is the state of education and Lewis’ prescient insight into our current cultural climate. Lewis also goes beyond criticizing scientism by laying out his vision for good science.</p> <p>We will be back next week with a “Literary Life of…” interview with a surprise guest. After that we will take a short break for the conference, and return in April with a read along of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uiLFTs\">The Enchanted April</a></em> by Elizabeth von Arnim.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.
