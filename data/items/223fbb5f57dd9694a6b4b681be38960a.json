  "description": "If you’re an OM3 regular, you know very well that JJ is not afraid to bust on his fellow players and break some major chops. And if you know that, then you also know there’s one player who has taken more heat from JJ than anyone else. I mean, let’s face it… there aren’t many episodes where Joe Ingles name doesn’t come up at one point or another, and suffice it to say the comments aren’t loaded with sunshine and rainbows. But if you listen a little closer, you become keenly aware that it's all in fun and comes from a place of great friendship. Well, finally, the time has come for JJ to face his so-called “nemesis” as Joe joins the show for an amazing discussion that bounces from hilarity to deep and thoughtful discussion. And that’s what makes Joe Ingles so special. You may start out hating him, but invariably you end up loving him - especially if he’s on your team. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
