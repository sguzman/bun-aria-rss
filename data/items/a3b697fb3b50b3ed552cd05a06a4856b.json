It was a quiet uneventful evening, nothing seemed out of the ordinary until 6 am the next morning when a neighbour reported the Freeman house was on fire.</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-03-lauria-bible-and-ashley-freeman/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-03-lauria-bible-and-ashley-freeman\">http://casefilepodcast.com/case-03-lauria-bible-and-ashley-freeman</a></strong></a></p>\n",
