  "description": "<p>We study the chiral feature in a system composed of one two-level emitter\n(TLE) and a one dimensional (1D) dimer chain of coupled resonators with the\nalternate single-photon energies. In the single-excitation subspace, this\nsystem not only possesses two energy bands with propagating states, but also\npossesses chiral bound states. The number of chiral bound states depends on the\ncoupling forms between the TLE and the dimer chain. It is found that when the\nTLE is locally coupled to one resonator of the dimer chain, the bound-state\nthat has mirror reflection symmetry is not a chiral one. When the TLE is\nnonlocally coupled to two adjacent resonators, three chiral bound states arise\ndue to the mirror symmetry breaking. The chirality of these bound states can be\ntuned by changing the energy differences of single photon in the adjacent\nresonators, the coupling strengths and the transition energy of the TLE. The\nchirality behaviour of the ordinary two bound states outside the energy bands\nis quite different from the one of the emerging bound state inside the energy\ngap. The almost perfect chiral bound states can be achieved at certain\nparameters as a result of completely destructive interference.\n</p>",
