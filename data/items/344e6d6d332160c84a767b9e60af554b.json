Andy from <a href= \"http://thepanpsycast.com/panpsycast/\">The Panpsycast</a> joins our two regular hosts from all the way across the pond to discuss their old pal Soren Kierkegaard, his thoughts on Christianity, individualism, and how to be a professional sad-sack. It's a good ep! If you enjoy it, definitely check out Andy's podcast and keep listening to Drunken Philosophy because he will certainly be back!</strong></p>",
