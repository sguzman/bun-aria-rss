  "description": "Phil may not be a ninja, but he knows what it takes to win a fight against the local beavers: It's time for Operation Mother of All Commode Flushes. Phil's dangerous plan from episode 101 gets a reboot, and Phil tells Jase and Al why their advice on beaver dam removal leaves something to be desired. Jase brings up a question about who gets saved and explains why Jesus is so loved and so hated. And Phil looks at our culture and doesn't find a whole lot of Jesus, especially in the schools. \n\nhttps://KEEPS.com/DOOR \n\nhttps://Bambee.com/ROBERTSON \n\nhttps://Adjace.com \n\nSee episodes of \"Unashamed with Phil Robertson\": https://bit.ly/2J4XsiX\n \nSee clips from Phil's TV show \"In the Woods with Phil\": https://bit.ly/2PNM6k1\n \nTo take a FREE 30 Day Trial of Phil's TV show and the rest of BlazeTV: https://www.BlazeTV.com/Phil\nLearn more about your ad choices.
