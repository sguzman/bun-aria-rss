  "description": "Sky Metalwala. November 06, 2011. Bellevue, Washington. Just days after a mediation session grants visitation rights to her husband, a mother of two needs to take her sick two year-old child to see a doctor. On the way, though, her car stalls. She opts to walk back to a gas station with her four year-old daughter. Leaving her younger, sick child behind in the car. When she later returns, the car is empty and her child is nowhere to be found. An investigation fails to support the mother's story, though, and the boy's disappearance begins to look more like foul play. Did a stranger take Sky Metalwala from a parked car? Or is his mother, Julia Biryukova, responsible for what happened to her son?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
