  "description": "Welcome to the tent, bakers! The Ringer’s Kate Halliwell and Amelia Wedemeyer will be here on ‘The Ringer Reality TV Podcast’ every Friday to recap the new season of ‘The Great British Bake Off.’ In this episode, covering “Cake Week,” we first talk about how we got into the show and why we love it so much (0:30). Then we get to the nitty-gritty, digging into a dastardly signature challenge, in which the bakers had to make mini Swiss rolls (14:25), a confusing technical challenge based on Prue’s recipe for malt loaf (20:00), and a gravity-defying showstopper challenge (23:05). Finally, we hand out our awards for the soggiest bottom, the most absurdly British moment, the best Brit fit, and much more (32:55).\nHosts: Kate Halliwell and Amelia Wedemeyer\nAssociate Producer: Sasha Ashall\nLearn more about your ad choices.
