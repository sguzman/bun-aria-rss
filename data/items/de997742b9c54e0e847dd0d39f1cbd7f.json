  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, no one has bulldozed the D.C bureaucracy like Donald Trump did and that is why they weaponized the federal government to destroy him. Yet the Wall Street Journal is now reporting that thousands of government officials have profited from investments that they were personally and professionally involved in. Then, additional inquiry by the WSJ revealed that there were considerable investments made prior to the government scrutinizing oil and gas companies, aerospace and defense companies, and big technology companies such as Google (Alphabet) and Facebook (Meta). Meanwhile, election interference from fraudulently changing laws by circumventing the US Constitution and the State's Constitution suffered a blow when the US Supreme Court vacated an Appellate Court decision to allow undated mail-in ballots to be counted. Barring any future decisions, SCOTUS today rejected the undated ballots from being accepted in future elections. Afterward, Dr. Oz joins the show with an update on his campaign for Senate.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
