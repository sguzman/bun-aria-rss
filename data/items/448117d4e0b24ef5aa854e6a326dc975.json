Do not casually suggest that you have a threesome with her best friend. She's not going to like it. If you want to have a threesome, you must be extremely strategic and cunning. I'll show you how to do it without having it end in a jealous hot mess. Next, I talk about men who prefer to wear women's panties (have no shame, women's undies are just better). Then I answer the question of who I'd rather sleep with, Mike Catherwood or Dr.Drew? And lastly, I tell all the ladies how to have an incredible orgasm during sex, because that's what I'm here for. If women start having more orgasms, I know I'm doing my job. Enjoy your weekend whether you are having a Menage a Trois, exploding with orgasms, or traipsing around in ladies underwear.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
