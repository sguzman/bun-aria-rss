  "description": "<p>This week, we see what happens when a man lives by two rules: Never think before you act, and never, ever take any responsibility for your actions. Living by these simple rules helped him to break nearly every law he could probably think of, including drugs, assault, kidnapping, gunplay, never paying child support, and a slew of other infractions, both scary, and hilarious. A champion o the court, a menace off of it. It's a police pushing, disease spreading, fan punching good time, with one of the wildest criminals we've seen, so far.Drink yourself silly, have more kids than you can meet, and punch anyone within the sound of your voice with \"Mad Max\" Vernon Maxwell!!
