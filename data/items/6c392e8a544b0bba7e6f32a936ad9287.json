  "description": "<p>A massive interview for you today as we get our first ever taste of Beach Volleyball on the show by speaking with the legendary two-time Olympic medallist Kerri Pottharst about her amazing career and Olympic experiences! We learn from Kerri how a random moment from her brother got her into the sport and how that lead to an amazing indoor career throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. We also learn about the transition into beach volleyball, what lead her to partnering up with Natalie Cook and what her experiences were like throughout her three Olympics. Added to this we find out just what it was like to experience that gold medal win in front of 10,000 screaming fans at Bondi Beach and everything else that followed, as well as just where the sport is at now in Australia and how the recent silver medal win in Tokyo by Taliqua Clancy & Mariafe Artacho del Solar will help spur on a new generation of volleyball players leading into Brisbane 2032. It’s an exciting chat with an exciting guest that you won’t want to miss! </p>",
