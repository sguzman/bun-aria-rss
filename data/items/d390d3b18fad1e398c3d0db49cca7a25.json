  "description": "Hear the first episode of the podcast, created with Vermont Public Radio's Erica Heilman, as the band reveals how they made their latest album, <em>Free Love</em>.<br/><br/>Erica Heilman spent hours talking with singer Amelia Meath and synthesist Nick Sanborn. We get a deep insight into how this couple works together — in this case, it began with Amelia's voice memo. It was just her singing, unaccompanied. And though they've made music together for the past seven-plus years, Nick thought it might be the best thing she'd ever done. Give a listen to <em>Shaking Out The Numb</em>, and see how the song unfolds.",
