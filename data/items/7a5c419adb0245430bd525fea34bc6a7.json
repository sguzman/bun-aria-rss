  "description": "<p><em><strong>“You can’t have a thought unless you have a feeling first. So the idea in painting is to freeze the feeling and then let the person have the thought.”</strong></em><strong><br>\n<br>\n</strong>Today we are talking with New York painter Brian Rutenberg about all the way in which artists must show up for their work in order to find a deeper truth. Amidst a currently enforced break from his studio it’s reassuring to hear he has the same fear of starting again. We talk about the arc of creating a painting, how to exaggerate to clarify and if painting serves no purpose why is it ultimately such an essential process in understanding and sharing feeling.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>See Brian's work on his website:<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.brianrutenbergart.com/\"><u><strong>http://www.brianrutenbergart.com/</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Brian's books on Amazon<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brian-Rutenberg/e/B004SRQH4Y%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\"><u><strong> HERE</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Outside the US, Brian's book can be ordered by emailing gallery@forumgallery.com</p>\n<p>Watch Brian’s videos from his studio on You Tube<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thomgains1727\"><u><strong>HERE</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
