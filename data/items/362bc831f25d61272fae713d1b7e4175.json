  "description": "You hear that? Yep, that siren means it's a Superfriends emergency podcast on the Chiefs reaching a 10-year contract extension with Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech (what a day for Sean Wagner-McGough to leave CBS) offer their immediate reactions to the monster deal. The guys speculate what type of money and what type of fine print is attached to the long-term extension. Should the Chiefs have any hesitation over the length? What can Mahomes accomplish over the next decade plus? Will, Ryan and John also dissect whatÂ this means for the future of the quarterback market and Dak Prescott's potential contract.Â \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech\nNominate Pick Six for The People's Choice Podcast Awards: https://www.podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ZUfHFsuQcW7BkTHnXJtqw\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
