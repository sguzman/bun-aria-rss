  "description": "Our audiobook this week is LANE TO FAME by Andie Fenichel\n\nMathew\n\nSadie Baker is the most beautiful, kind, talented, and out-of-reach woman I’ll ever know. Rockstars don’t date small-town photographers. Rockstars date other celebrities and live miserably ever after. I know it, but I can’t get her out of my head. So, when she needs a little time away from the roar of the crowds, I’m all in. I’ll take her to my beach house to write her next album. Forever might be out of reach, but a few stolen moments in heaven is worth the risk.\n\nSadie\n\nMathew Lane is the best medicine for my busted-up heart. With my label looking for the next big album, and my band counting on me to feed their families, I’m torn in a million directions. Songwriting used to be my greatest pleasure, but now I’m in an artistic death spiral. A few days at the beach with a hunk is just what the doctor ordered. It can never last. Nothing ever does.\n\nebook of Lane To Flame: https://amzn.to/3MiqQQl\nMORE Andie Fenichel eBooks: https://amzn.to/3tqRlKB\nGIVEAWAY: https://bit.ly/35ovUSA\nCarnival Lane: https://amzn.to/3sCCUEd\nDad Bod Handyman: https://amzn.to/34bTaTi\nPreorder for Changing Lanes (A May/December Romance)99 cents: https://amzn.to/3vzKz8m\nPreorder for Heavy Petting (A Best Friend&#039;s Brother Romance) .99 cents: https://amzn.to/36N9oDa\n\nOther Books Mentioned\nTAKE A HINT DANI BROWN & GET A LIFE EVE BROWN by Talia Hibbert\nHOW TO MARRY KEANU REEVES IN 90 DAYS by K.
