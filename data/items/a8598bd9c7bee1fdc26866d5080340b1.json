  "description": "The third 2020 debate was last night, but Glenn “sadly” had a parent-teacher conference to attend. Bill O’Reilly provides a recap – it was a good night for Trump, Warren is a hip grandma, and Biden held on. Glenn gets even more coverage from Darin and Gabrielle, the two viewers he hired to watch the debates for him. While there was no clear winner, the candidates tried really hard to make Trump and guns the losers.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
