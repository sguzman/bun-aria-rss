    "media:description": "This is a 5 minute meditation in slow Spanish to create some calm while learning a language. Click on settings on the video toolbar if you would prefer subtitles in English or Spanish. You may also try to listen to understand with the gestures that I provide. \n\nLinguist and educator Stephen Krashen states that fear and anxiety to learn a language creates an \"affective filter\" that obstructs one's ability to learn a language. I hope this Spanish meditation helps to lower your affective filter so that you can absorb Spanish with a calmer mind, body and spirit.\n\nFor more yoga and meditation videos in English, visit:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqbOktTkVMsPBkJDNf0y41w/\n---------------------------\nLinks to the budget-friendly recording equipment used to create this video:\nWireless microphone for recording on cell phone:\nhttps://amzn.to/39OKBOK\nTripod stand for cell phone with ring light:\nhttps://amzn.to/3qvVpad\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. \n---------------------------\nGuest appearance: Salchicha, el perro",
