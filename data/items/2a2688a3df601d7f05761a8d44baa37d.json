  "description": "<p>Some may have noticed that this blog was an utter mess for about two weeks.\nThis was due to an exploited vulnerability in Wordpress leaving my blog \nin a state most curiously difficult to recover from. The only thing not\ncorrupted by this hack was an SQL database dump of my blog\nthat turned out to be inconsistent with a fresh Wordpress install.</p>\n\n<p>The Wordpress support team thankfully pointed me to a number of videos\nexplaning carefully how to move my mouse\ncursor from one point to another. I feel a lot more confident now with the mouse\ncursor. In the\nend, I more or less manually moved my blog to <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> hosted by\n<a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub</a> with <a href=\"http://disqus.com\">Disqus</a> comments.\nIt’s a pretty decent combination that a lot of people seem to be transitioning\nto.</p>\n\n<p>If you ever think about starting a blog, <em>do not</em> go with Wordpress. \nIf you absolutely\ncannot resist the temptation, by all means do not maintain your own Wordpress\ninstall.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wordpress is slow, clunky and insecure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had to install updates\nmultiple times a month and even that was evidently not enough to stay on top.</p>\n\n<p>On a positive note, I appear to be on paternity leave right now—for another\nfive weeks or so—and I hope to write a blog post or two in those moments\nwhen I’m not spending quality time with my bicycles, ehm, and my daughter, of\ncourse.</p>\n\n<p><em>To stay on top of future posts, subscribe to the (new) <a href=\"http://blog.mrtz.org/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>\nor follow me on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/mrtz\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>",
