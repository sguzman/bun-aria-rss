  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 7/23/20",
  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, America doesn't need another stimulus bill, especially not a welfare bill. Washington is funding the wrong things and Senate Majority Leader McConnell is not to be trusted. The government cannot just print money out of thin air. Awarding billions to public schools that will not physically be in session or giving a bailout to universities to teach more Marxism isn't a good use of taxpayer dollars. If we incentivize unemployment no one will get back to work. In turn, this will hurt small businesses. Then, having two types of justice isn't justice at all. Rioters in Portland get away with blinding police and hurling fireworks at them, while others get arrested for painting over a BLM sign in NYC. Biden, Hillary, and RINO's will say anything to paint Trump as a fascist, seeking to use martial law to remain in power. Meanwhile, it's leftist Democrats that foment the violence, hate, and anarchism occurring. RINO race-baiters like Michael Steele misrepresent facts to portray Portland as a Black or Brown city. Later, the new Cato Institute/YouGov poll shows that 62% of Americans are afraid to express their political views. Afterward, a civil lawsuit has been filed against several personalities at Fox News and the media runs with the allegations rather than with the facts. One claimant's allegations are inconsistent regarding her scheduled appearances and undermine her grievance. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
