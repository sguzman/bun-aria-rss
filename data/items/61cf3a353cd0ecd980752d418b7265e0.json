    "media:description": "Shooting: dart, caltrop, steel balls, pens and eggs!\n\nIt is historically described that you can place projectiles at the end of the arrow,\nAnd when the arrow is fixed on the string,  the projectile fly forward.\n\nIt is best if the string height is large and it also works best if the projectile is heavier than the arrow.\n\nWarning!!! shooting with projectiles can cause damage to some bows (I destroyed a 50 pound bow while I was experimenting)\n\nThe Zombi target is just an excuse to shoot pens because it's incredibly fun!!\n\nSurprisingly raw eggs fly far and precisely,\nI had no problems with heavy bow that I would otherwise have thought to break the eggs.\n\n(All historical descriptions are from the book Arab Archery, describing shooting darts, metal balls, caltrop, eggs and flammable eggs www.archerylibrary.com/books/faris-elmer/arab-archery/docs/xliv-4.html)\n\nSincerely\nLars Andersen 2019",
