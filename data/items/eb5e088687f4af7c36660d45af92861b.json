  "description": "As Deep State Radio's resident Constitutional scholar (and Associate Dean of Georgetown Law School) Rosa Brooks explains, the legal threshold for designating behavior as treasonous is quite narrow.  But as she also points out, it would be up to Congress to define what was unacceptable in an impeachment hearing.  As evidence mounts that the Trump campaign was deeply entwined with Russia and the Trump Administration has been taking a straight Kremlin line on everything, we have clearly crossed the \"this is not OK\" threshold and we may be headed for something much more serious than that.  Rosa, Kori Schake, Evelyn Farkas and David Rothkopf discuss this issue and the state of America's alliances with a NATO Summit and a potential meeting in Europe with Vladimir Putin loom in the next several weeks.
