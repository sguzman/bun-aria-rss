  "description": "<p>The trial of the century is set to begin in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone has convinced the Supreme Judicial Court to take up his case against Kirk Minihane, a.k.a. Kevin Cullen. Kirk and Steve receive an insane email from the guy who wants to eat out of the studio toilet for a chance to win tickets to the VFW live show (0:30:00). The Atlantic published a piece of \"journalism\" that would make the aforementioned Cullen embarrassed (1:00:00). Entercom has fired a DC-based sports talk host for saying, well, they're not saying what he said, but we might have found it (1:10:00). An innocent call from a cat owner leads to an insane story from Steve's childhood. The hunt is on for Tig's grave.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
