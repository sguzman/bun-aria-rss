  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin on Memorial Day. The rise of Jew hatred and anti-Semitism is frightening. Open borders in Europe have created no-go zones for Jews and Christians in areas of Paris and London and it looks like the United States is following suit. Bigots like the Rep Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the squad stir the pot and inspire anti-Semitism. This hatred can destroy a country and affects all Americans that believe in a Constitutional system. Later, Sen. Tom Cotton joins the show to reaffirm his support for Israel and question why Biden has been so weak in his defense of Israel. Cotton added that similarly, President Obama was also weak with Iran which has vowed to destroy Israel and the US. Cotton surmised that China's preposterous cover-up about the virus originating from a wet market is steadily being disproved as more evidence emerges regarding the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Afterward, the Biden State Department blocked any additional investigation by the United States into the origins of the coronavirus following Dr. Fauci's admission that his organization did in fact modestly fund some of the research grants at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Biden Administration is now covering it up. Later, the media mocked President Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton for suggesting the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shouldn't the scientists know about which grants they have issued and to whom? However, eco-Health Alliance in New York did receive a grant and used it for gain of function research on the coronavirus. Fauci's response was dishonest.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
