  "description": "Kraken director of growth marketing Dan Held says the Bitcoin (BTC) supercycle theory that he first put forward in 2019 still holds water.\n\nAccording to Held, the theory advances the idea that a perfect storm such as mistrust in governments and institutions, will propel the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and drive up the price of the leading crypto asset.\n\n“If we repeat 2013, we could see Bitcoin hitting between $300,000-$400,000 Bitcoin. Now. history usually rhymes, it doesn’t repeat itself, so it’s probably not going to be exactly that, but if it did, that would be my best price point.\n\nSo my price point, I would say that I think it’s going to land probably between [$100,000 and $300,000]. But if we match 2013 again, it could be [$300,000 to $400,000].”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
