  "description": "<div>On June 28, 2015, Teresa Sievers, a popular doctor and mother of two young children, was found murdered in her Florida kitchen. The house wasn't ransacked and nothing was stolen, so it looked like a murder-for-hire. But who would want her dead? And why? When two suspects are arrested, they have a story to tell, and the twists and turns this story takes will shock you. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/true-crime-live-73308747\">FAM!!
