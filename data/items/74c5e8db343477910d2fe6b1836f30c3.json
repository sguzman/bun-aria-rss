  "description": "<p><p>We're on the road to the Super Bowl in Atlanta with a stop in Philly and Virginia (2:27 - 6:49). The Browns were somehow more of a dumpster fire than previously though and had a porn problem in their office (6:49 -16:50). Roger Goodell hasn't answered the Saints fans yet (16:50 - 22:03). 2X Super Bowl Champion and 2X PMT Lib of the year Chris Long joins the show to talk about his 2 former teams in the Super Bowl, why Tom Brady stays dominant, the double doink, playing against his brother, and the Carson Wentz locker room buzz (22:03 - 65:05). Segments include Respect The Biz Max Kellerman vs Derek Carr, Stay Classy Jamal Adams, James HardOn, Embrace Debate Baseball HoF, and Road Rules with Larry the Bus Drivery</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
