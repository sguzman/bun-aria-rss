  "description": "Next week Iranians go to the polls to elect a new president. But how much of a choice do they really have? All six candidates are men, and all six have been chosen by the unelected Guardian Council.  The members of the Council are selected by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has himself never stood for election.  So how different are the views of each of the candidates and how much power will the next president have to set a new direction for the country?  At a time when the world is looking at Iran following its nuclear deal with the west, Owen Bennett Jones and his guests discuss what difference this presidential election will make.\n\nPhoto: Woman voting in Iranian parliamentary elections 2016.
