  "description": "If you're anything like me, this episode will make you think about the way you shop, learn, eat, parent, and exercise in a whole new way.\nMy guest today is Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California whose most recent book The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class documents the rise of a new, unprecedented elite class in the United States. Previously, the elite classes differentiated themselves from the rest by purchasing expensive material goods like flashy clothes and expensive cars. But, for reasons we get into, today’s elite is different: We signify our class position by reading the New Yorker, acquiring elite college degrees, buying organic food, breastfeeding our children, and, of course, listening to podcasts like this one.\nThese activities may seem completely innocent — perhaps even enlightened. Yet, as we discuss here, they simultaneously shore up inequality, erode social mobility, and create an ever-more stratified society — all without most of us even noticing. This is a conversation that implicates us all, and, for that very reason, it is well worth grappling with.\nBook recommendations: \nJust Kids by Patti Smith\n Art Worlds by Howard S. Becker\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt\nIf you enjoyed this episode, you may also like: \nWhen meritocracy wins, everybody loses\nWork as identity, burnout as lifestyle\nWhat a smarter Trumpism would sound like \n\nMy book is available for pre-order!
