  "description": "<p>This is your chance to hear advice on careers, love and COVID from one of America's best-known doctors, Sanjay Gupta!  Dr. Gupta is not only an Emmy-award winning CNN medical correspondent, he's also a neurosurgeon and was once listed on People Magazine's sexiest people alive.  So, it's safe to say,  he's overqualified to join Tig as they offer guidance to a high school student on how to break it to her mother that she wants to be a TV journalist instead of a doctor. They also help a listener decide whether to stay in their marriage or pursue a crush. And he and Tig discuss the pros and cons about being considered a sex symbol.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br><strong>OUR SPONSORS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Betterhelp</strong> - <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/tig\">betterhelp.com/tig</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Wealthfront</strong> - <a href=\"https://invest.wealthfront.com/TIG?utm_medium=podcast&utm_source=dontasktig&utm_campaign=podcast_invest_q32021\" class=\"default\">wealthfront.com/tig</a></p>\n<p><strong>Nutrafol</strong> - <a href=\"https://nutrafol.com/\" class=\"default\">nutrafol.com</a> and use code “TIG”</p>\n<p>Need advice?
