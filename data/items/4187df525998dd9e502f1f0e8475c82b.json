  "title": "141 - Albert Fish: NY Killer and SUPER Creep",
  "description": "<p>Albert Fish. The Boogey Man. The Werewolf of Wysteria. The Brooklyn Vampire. The Gray Man. The Moon Maniac. A sexual sadist, sexual masochist, kidnapper, con artist, cannibal, torturer, murderer, and the kinkiest mofo I have ever read about. This tale is equal parts dark and captivating. Fish is the train wreck you can't stop staring at. After his capture in 1934, he would claim to have molested and raped around 400 children. He also admitted to killing three children and was sent to the electric chair for one of their deaths. He blew 1930s minds with tales of cannabalism and sexual depravity.
