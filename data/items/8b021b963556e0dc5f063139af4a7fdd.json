  "title": "Kirk & Callahan: Live from the 2021 Step Up for Colleen 5K",
  "description": "<p>Thank you to everybody who came out to support Colleen Ritzer Memorial Fund and ran in the 5K. After the show Team Minihane hung around to catch a reunion show with Gerry and Kirk. Gerry's lunch stipulation was not met before the 5K, so Gerry has it out with Kirk about the events from last August. Finally, it's hard to get these two together without hearing some classic Dino stories & much more. \n\nCheck out Gerry's show on Locals: thegerrycallahanshow.locals.com</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
