  "description": "<p>In this episode, we explore the idea of intuitive painting. What does that term even mean? And how does it relate to what we do? Regular listeners will not be surprised to learn that we have different ideas about the importance and role of intuition, but in the end we agree that there is a difference between pure intuitive painting (aka process painting) and painting that relies heavily on intuition. The former is a process without a desired end result while the latter is a delicate balance between thinking and intuiting. In pure intuitive painting, personal growth is the only objective, whereas our work is designed to communicate with others. Perhaps some of us lean more to one side or the other, but all must find the balance that is right for them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mentioned</p>\n<p>Stewart Cubley's Process Arts <a href=\"\">https://www.processarts.com/</a></p>\n<p>Sally-Anne Ashley <a href=\"\">https://www.sally-anneashley.com/</a></p>\n<p>Cheryle Bannon <a href=\"\">https://cherylebannon.com/what-is-intuitive-art/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
