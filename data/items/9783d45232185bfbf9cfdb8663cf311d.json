  "description": "Another day, another medal for Australia (and a few for Canada too) as Ben & Jarrod return to give their take on another entertaining day of the Olympics! Just why does it matter that Jarryd and Chumpy don't get along? Why does Lydia need to stop apologising and realise how awesome and amazing she is? Why is it sad that Jacqui Cooper isn't being appreciated more as a commentator? Why is the luge relay perhaps the greatest sport that has ever existed? And can we finally break the 3 medal hoodoo and end up with our 4th medal? It's all here and more on our special CHUMPY & LYDIA day!",
