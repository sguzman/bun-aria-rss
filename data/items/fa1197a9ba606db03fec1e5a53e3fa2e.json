  "description": "<p>July 24, 2016. Bend, Oregon. After a night out at her friend’s bachelorette party, Kaylee Sawyer walked down the street outside her apartment and disappeared. Edwin Lara, a campus security guard, kidnapped her in his campus security vehicle, took her to a remote parking lot, and murdered her. This was just the beginning of what would be a multi-day crime spree that ended with his capture. This case was important not only because Kaylee’s killer was identified and captured, but because it exposed serious safety concerns and legal violations within the Central Oregon Community College’s campus safety department.</p><p><br></p><p>Get bonus content from Generation Why at: patreon.com/generationwhy</p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
