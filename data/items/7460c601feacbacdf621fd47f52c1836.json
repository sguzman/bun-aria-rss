  "description": "Today on Dear Alice we will be talking about mixing styles.  The best way to successfully mix an overstated design with a more understated style is to start by neutralizing the colors then start to add the layers back in. An important thing to ask yourself is how your room makes you feel. You want your design to match your personality, and that can even include your children so if it feels good and matches your overall vibe, then it’s right for you. If your style is tradition, try throwing in some modern art and styling pieces to change it up and keep it from being too predictable. Design has evolved over time and with interiors today we try to break the rules and mix old and new, using the best of both worlds. If you are stuck in an era, you can freshen it with a few touches and still honor its history.<br /><br />@Aris_Empire question - how to balance understated style with overstated style 1:11<br />Is mixing styles more of a modern thing? 12:47<br />@northloganrealtor - A table in a traditional house trying to be transitional 20:01<br /><br /><br /><br />“If you are more transitional, but you live in a traditional house, start getting those pieces that feel like you. That feel a little more modern because again they’re going to shine in this traditional shell even more so than they would in a contemporary space, because of that juxtaposition.” 22:04<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
