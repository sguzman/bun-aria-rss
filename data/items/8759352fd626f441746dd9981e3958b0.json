    "media:description": "In this video we take a detailed look at how to construct an orbit of arbitrary shape by using moons upon moons and the mathematical technique of Fourier series.\n\nSupport this channel: One of the most helpful things you can do to support this channel is to share this video with others you think would find it interesting.  It's also helpful if you subscribe.\n\nThanks to Noah Lape for helping record the intro/outro clips, and to Grant Sanderson for creating Manim and being a wonderful inspiration.  (Speaking of which, this video was submitted to #SoME2, a contest being run by 3Blue1Brown.)\n\nLink to 3Blue1Brown video on Fourier series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k\n\nFor those interested in learning Manim, here are two great resources:\nGrant Sanderson's github page: https://github.com/3b1b\nManim community page: https://www.manim.community/\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u",
