  "description": "Former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifies before Congress. Republicans can’t ask about Hunter Biden, Burisma, or other “debunked conspiracy theories,” but the Democrats can.

And a Fox News guest is being called anti-Semitic for bringing up George Soros. But we have proof all he said was true!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
