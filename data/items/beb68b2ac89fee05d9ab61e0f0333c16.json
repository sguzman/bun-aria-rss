  "description": "<p>John C. Maxwell says, “Leadership is influence, nothing more, nothing less.” Everyone has some level of influence, which is why John points out that everyone is a leader. But just because you have influence doesn’t mean you’re a <em>good</em> leader.</p> <p>If you want to influence more people and grow your leadership capacity, you must evaluate the quality of your influence. So, in this episode, we’re helping you do exactly that! (This is one episode when you’ll certainly want to have the bonus resource in hand.)</p> <p>John will walk you through five questions and exercises to take inventory and give you a big picture of your influence. At the end of the episode, you’ll have the opportunity to add up your answers and get a score to determine your measure of influence.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Influence Inventory Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes and exercises from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/influence and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Developing-the-Leader-Within-You_p_671.html\"> <em>Developing the Leader Within You 2.0</em> by John C.
