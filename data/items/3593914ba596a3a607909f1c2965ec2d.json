  "title": "3.6 Why are you in bed? Why are you drinking? Colm Tóibín and Joseph Rezek in Conversation",
  "description": "Colm Tóibín, the new laureate for Irish fiction, talks to Joseph Rezek of Boston University, and guest host Tara K. Menon of Harvard. The conversation begins with Colm’s latest novel The Magician, about the life of Thomas Mann, and whether we can or should think of novelists as magicians and then moves swiftly from one big question to the next. What are the limitations of the novel as a genre? Would Colm ever be interested in a writing a novel about an openly gay novelist? Why and how does death figure in Colm’s fiction? Each of Colm’s revealing, often deeply personal answers illuminates how both novels and novelists work. As Thoman Mann wrote of the “grubby business” of writing novels, Colm reminds us of the “day to day dullness of novel writing.” Insight and inspiration only arrive, he warns, after long, hard days of work.\nMentioned in this episode:\nRobinson Crusoe (1719), Daniel Defoe\nPride and Prejudice (1813), Jane Austen\nThe Portrait of a Lady (1881), Henry James\nThe Wings of the Dove(1902), Henry James\nThe Ambassadors (1903), Henry James\nThe Golden Bowl(1904), Henry James\nThe Blackwater Lightship(1999), Colm Tóibín\nThe Master (2004), Colm Tóibín\nBrooklyn(2009), Colm Tóibín\nThe Testament of Mary(2012), Colm Tóibín\nNora Webster(2015), Colm Tóibín\nThe Magician(2021), Colm Tóibín\n﻿Aarthi Vadde is Associate Professor of English at Duke University.
