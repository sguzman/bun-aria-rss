  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats sit on their hands as VP Harris does nothing while children are being sexually assaulted in federal facilities. They criticized President Trump for his bold action at the border, but never before have we seen a President like Biden who puts the sovereignty of the country in jeopardy because of his weak stance on national security. Biden won't call the border a crisis but he'll say we have a \"gun crisis.\" Then, John Lott, President of the Crime Prevention Research Center, calls in to discuss the absurdity of Biden's comments on gun control. Lott added that crime is increasing due to \"progressive' policies that have let criminals out of prison and back on the street as well as Democrat politicians defunding police departments across the country. Gun control won't stop criminals who don't obey the law. Later, Stanley Kurtz calls in to discuss Biden’s plan to end suburban single-family zoning. Afterward, Biden has all but agreed to end sanctions on Iran. Congressional Republicans put a hold on $75 million of the newly reinstated US aid to the Palestinians. Republicans argue that funding Palestinians violates anti-terror laws. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
