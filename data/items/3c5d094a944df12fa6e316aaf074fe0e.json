  "description": "<div>The gals explore various motivations and traumas that might trigger arsonist behaviors, techniques for evading capture (which do not include erotic journaling of your capers), and the one way you should NOT waterproof a circus tent. Criminal cases include John \"Pillow Pyro\" Orr, Julio Gonzalez, and Peter \"Bruce Lee\" Dinsdale. This week's topic is paired with a fiery Garnacha de Fuego, which is not as flammable as it sounds.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
