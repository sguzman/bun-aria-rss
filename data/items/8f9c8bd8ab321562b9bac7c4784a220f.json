  "description": "<p>Why All Meat Is Not Created Equal | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://insidetracker.com/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InsideTracker</a></p><br><p>There is a lot of controversy around whether meat is good or bad for our health but what if this is the wrong question to be asking? For example, grass-fed beef is extremely different from conventionally raised beef, and people buying grass-fed beef often have many other healthy habits that those buying Big Macs may not. Yet, nutrition research doesn’t take many of these variables into account. This is why when it comes to eating meat, like with all other foods, focusing on quality more than quantity is key to creating good health.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman talks with Chris Kresser about how the type of meat being eaten is an important focus missing from many big dietary studies and they break down the myths and stigmas around red meat consumption. Dr. Hyman also speaks with Fred Provenza about how the way we eat meat, along with what the animal eats, can make such a difference when it comes to our health.</p><br><p>Chris Kresser is the CEO of Kresser Institute for Functional & Evolutionary Medicine, the co-director of the California Center for Functional Medicine, the creator of ChrisKresser.com, and the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>The Paleo Cure</em>. He is known for his in-depth research uncovering myths and misconceptions in modern medicine and providing natural health solutions with proven results. Chris was named one of the 100 most influential people in health and fitness by Greatist.com, and his blog is one of the top-ranked natural health websites in the world. He recently launched Kresser Institute, an organization dedicated to reinventing healthcare and reversing chronic disease by training healthcare practitioners in functional and evolutionary medicine. Chris lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife and daughter.</p><br><p>Fred grew up in Salida, Colorado, working on a ranch and attending school in Wildlife Biology at Colorado State University. He is professor emeritus of Behavioral Ecology in the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University where he worked for 35 years, directing an award-winning research group that pioneered an understanding of how learning influences foraging behavior and how behavior links soil, plants, herbivores, and humans.
