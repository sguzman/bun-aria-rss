Williams welcome former basketball player and current cannabis entrepreneur Al Harrington to episode 13 of I AM ATHLETE Podcast. Al and the cast discuss everything from Basketball to the stigmas and benefits of cannabis. \n\nBefore the cameras start “recording” Chantel expresses how much she enjoyed Chad’s reaction to his wife’s pregnancy announcement in the new hit Netflix series “Selling Tampa”. She shares that Chad’s raw and organic reaction to the news is what society needs and she wishes that there were more avenues in mainstream media that would present athletes in similar light. \n\nBrandon starts the show off with business and ask Al to share his story on how his company Viola Brands was born after he retired from the NBA. AL shares a story of how his grandmother’s found relief with cannabis during her battle with glaucoma and diabetes led to him becoming a proponent for the legalization of cannabis. \n\nThe cast go on to share their personal stories of using Marijuana for the first time. D.J shares how as a kid he was embarrassed of his mother and father for their evolvement and usage of cannabis. He also shares that he has since then become a user and advocate for cannabis after seeing the benefits it has over alcohol. \n\nAl dives deeper into his work with Viola Brands. He shares how cannabis has traditionally been used to hurt the black and brown community for many years. He shares the powerful truths behind the hemp plants and how he plans to use it to build the black and brown community back up with the same plant that was used to break it apart. \n\nWrapping things up, the cast talk basketball. Brandon asks Al what’s the biggest difference between Reggie Miller and Steph Curry. Al admits that Steph is the better shooter but if Reggie played in this era he would have made another 1500 three point shots by now. Chantel prompts one of the most controversial questions in this modern era by asking AL who he thinks the all time G.O.A.T is between Michael Jordan and Lebron James. \n\n\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChadJohnson\n#ChantelTremitiere\n#AlHerrington\n#MoreThanAPodcast\n\nDRAFTKINGS\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), call/text TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).\n\n21+ (18+ NH/WY).
