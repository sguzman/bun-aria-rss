  "description": "<p>June 5, 1983. Chino Hills, California. The Ryen family consisted of Douglas, Peggy, Jessica and Joshua. They had invited Joshua's friend, Christopher Hughes, to stay the night. The next day after Chrs hadn't returned, his father visited the Ryen home to look for him. Soon after, he would make a terrible discovery. Sometime during the night the Ryens and his son had been attacked and all had been killed save for Joshua. An investigation turned up a suspect in Kevin Cooper. He had recently escaped from prison and had been hiding in a house just 125 yards away from the Ryen's home. He was arrested in Santa Barbara seven weeks after the murders. But many questions remain even after his conviction. Was evidence planted against him? Why couldn't Joshua Ryen reliably say who attacked him? Was there any truth in a story of three white men committing the crimes? There were multiple weapons used in the attacks. Join us as we discuss this controversial case and attempt to figure out who was responsible for the Chino Hills Massacre.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
