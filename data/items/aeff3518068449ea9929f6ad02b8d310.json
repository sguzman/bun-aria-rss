  "description": "<p>We show that there is a constant $C$ such that for every $\\varepsilon&gt;0$ any\n$2$-coloured $K_n$ with minimum degree at least $n/4+\\varepsilon n$ in both\ncolours contains a complete subgraph on $2t$ vertices where one colour class\nforms a $K_{t,t}$, provided that $n\\geq \\varepsilon^{-Ct}$. Also, we prove that\nif $K_n$ is $2$-coloured with minimum degree at least $\\varepsilon n$ in both\ncolours then it must contain one of two natural colourings of a complete graph.\nBoth results are tight up to the value of $C$ and they answer two recent\nquestions posed by Kam\\v{c}ev and M\\\"{u}yesser.\n</p>",
