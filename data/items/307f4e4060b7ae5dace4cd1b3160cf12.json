  "description": "<p>We investigate the critical behavior and the nature of the low-temperature\nphase of the $O(N)$ models treating the number of field components $N$ and the\ndimension $d$ as continuous variables with a focus on the $d\\leq 2$ and $N\\leq\n2$ quadrant of the $(d,N)$ plane. We precisely chart a region of the $(d,N)$\nplane where the low-temperature phase is characterized by an algebraic\ncorrelation function decay similar to that of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase but\nwith a temperature-independent anomalous dimension $\\eta$. We revisit the\nCardy-Hamber analysis leading to a prediction concerning the nonanalytic\nbehavior of the $O(N)$ models' critical exponents and emphasize the previously\nnot broadly appreciated consequences of this approach in $d&lt;2$. In particular,\nwe discuss how this framework leads to destabilization of the long-range order\nin favour of the quasi long-range order in systems with $d&lt;2$ and $N&lt;2$.\nSubsequently, within a scheme of the nonperturbative renormalization group we\nidentify the low-temperature fixed points controlling the quasi long-range\nordered phase and demonstrate a collision between the critical and the\nlow-temperature fixed points upon approaching the lower critical dimension. We\nevaluate the critical exponents $\\eta(d,N)$ and $\\nu^{-1}(d,N)$ and demonstrate\na very good agreement between the predictions of the Cardy-Hamber type analysis\nand the nonperturbative renormalization group in $d&lt;2$.\n</p>",
