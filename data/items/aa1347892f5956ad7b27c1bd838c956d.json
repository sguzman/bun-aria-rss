  "description": "<p>Globalisation…it’s a hot topic in economics but why do so many economists emphasise the importance of trade? Many would argue that this began with David Ricardo and his Theory of Comparative Advantage, leading to the interdependence between countries that we see today. Who was Ricardo and how did he develop his ideas? &nbsp;What would he have made of today's global economy? And what is his very tenuous connection to fish and chips? Listen to this episode to find out more about this famous economist and his impact on the world today, whilst being entertained and informed by Pete and Gav throughout.
