  "description": "<p>A chronic problem with the world of entrepreneurialism right now is the ubiquitous presence of \"hustlers\" who are showing the world their \"baller\" lifestyle. The problem is, they are just showing it. They aren't really living it; because they haven't done the hard work necessary to experience it. The reality is, people like the show and the style, but they've never developed the substance required for success. The MFCEO says: you can't fake it. You won't become an authentic success without taking the hard road and doing the hard work.</p>",
