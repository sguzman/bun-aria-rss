A healthy planet coincides with healthy animals; when we look at the way public health and our climate have changed with the industrialization of agriculture, animals are a key focus. We often hear the argument that in order to solve climate change we need to stop eating meat. What these people aren’t realizing is that animal agriculture <em>done right</em> is actually part of the solution. That is a big stipulation because the methods used to raise meat can make or break our climate crisis and our health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I’m thrilled to sit down today with Anya Fernald to discuss the ins and outs of regenerative farming and animal practices. Anya Fernald is the co-founder and CEO of Belcampo. Belcampo operates 27,000 acres of organic farmland in California and processes its own livestock for sale in its own butcher shops and restaurants. Anya has two decades of leadership and entrepreneurship experience in high-quality, organic and premium foods. Given her expertise on meat and leadership within the meat industry, Anya has been profiled in <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>, and has served as a regular judge on Iron Chef America on The Food Network since 2009. She has been recognized as one of <em>Inc. Magazine</em>’s 100 Female Founders, one of the 40 under 40 by <em>Food & Wine</em>, and was named a Nifty Fifty by <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by BiOptimizers, Thrive Market, and BLUBlox.</p><br><p>Right now you can try BiOptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough for 10% off, just go to <a href=\"http://bioptimizers.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bioptimizers.com/hyman</a> and use the code HYMAN10 at checkout.</p><br><p>Thrive is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
