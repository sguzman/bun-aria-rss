  "description": "<p>November 14th, 2011. Lapeer County, Michigan. A young woman and her boyfriend, along with a friend of his, had been staying over at her Aunt's place over several days. Andrea had been house sitting while her relatives were away. On November 14th, she texted KC, her boyfriend, to have him meet her at the house. According to him, he arrived but the house was dark and he didn't see Andrea. Upset, he spent most of the evening with a friend from work. Friends and family became concerned for Andrea after she had gone missing since the 14th. Two days later her car was located. Then, a visit to her aunt's home resulted in Andrea being found. She was found dead in the laundry room as a result of a gunshot. Who had executed her? Police zeroed in on KC, but as the evidence in the case was collected and analyzed it seemed to point to someone else. Join us as we discuss the crime, possible motives and suspects in a case where timelines and evidence seem to lead to different theories of the crime.</p><p>Sponsored by:</p><p>//ThirdLove.
