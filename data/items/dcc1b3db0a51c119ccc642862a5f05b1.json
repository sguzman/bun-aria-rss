  "description": "<p>On June 18, 1985, a man walked into the Bellevue Police Department in Washington to report his 36-year-old wife, Julianne Jaillet, missing. He couldn't recall exactly when he'd last seen her but thought it might have been at the end of May or the beginning of June. He told police that he and his wife of five months had gotten into an argument, and she said she was leaving him, packed her belongings, and walked out. When asked why he hadn't reported Julianne missing in over two weeks, he said he thought she'd come back, that she'd been known to leave for a few days in the past, but never for this long. Things took a strange twist when some of Julianne's belongings were found in a hotel several states away. More than 36 years later, what happened to Julianne remains a mystery.</p><p>If you have any information about Julianne's disappearance, please call the Bellevue Police Department at 425-452-6917.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Boll & Branch</a>- To experience an entirely new standard of comfort, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bollandbranch.com</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Get 15% off your first set of sheets with promo code&nbsp;MIA.</p><p><a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moink</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moinkbox.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;to get FREE filet mignon for a year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
