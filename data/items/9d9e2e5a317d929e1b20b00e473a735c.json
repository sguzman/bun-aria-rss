Maybe it's in a completely different part of the economy. \n\nWhatever the case...you want to try something different while still doing your day-job.\n\nIn this podcast we look at various side business that musicians have tried over the years. Now granted this show was done a number of years ago, and some of these business may no longer exist, but what it shows is how musicians have taken on more than just touring over the years.\n\nThese are musicians who moonlight. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
