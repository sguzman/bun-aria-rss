  "description": "In April of 2003, a psychologist was found dead in his car from a car crash. But shortly before his death, he had received threatening letters, and the day he died, he was seen driving erratically before crashing into a tree. Though police ruled his death a suicide, his autopsy revealed unsettling details indicating that he had potentially been tortured and held captive before he crashed his car.
