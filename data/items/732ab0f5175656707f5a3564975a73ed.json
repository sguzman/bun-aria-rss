  "title": "ZBT #193: The Military Is Sensitive. Please Don't Trigger Us ft. Jessica Dawley",
  "description": "<p><p>ROUND 1: Barstool's founder Dave Portnoy lovingly said that the military can be one of the most sensitive groups out there. Is that true? If we say yes, are you gonna fucking cry about it?</p><p>ROUND 2: Oh you thought we were done talking about the Furry community? Think again. They're back in the news & this time it's for a piece of gear they wear that the US military is adopting for their own use. </p><p>ROUND 3: We played our cards right & landed an interview with Air Force veteran & poker champion Jessica Dawley. Find out if she's ever rolled around in money, since that's an awkward question Kate definitely asked her. </p><p>ROUND 4: President Trump gave a press conference on the white house lawn where he talked about a range of,,, uhh,,, issues. One of which was PTSD medicine. Later that day, he also talked about erasing student debt for disabled veterans. </p><p>ROUND 5: The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire… with hot, hot sexual tension that is! Turns out an Ex-GSA Official Had Sex With White House Staffer on Govt. Agency Rooftop. For the last round, we are gonna make it extra sexy for ya. </p><p>ROUND 6: On Thursday in New York City and up through the Hudson Valley, a team of fighter jets buzzed the skies. Is that a waste of taxpayers' money or are freedom boners worth every cent??? </p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
