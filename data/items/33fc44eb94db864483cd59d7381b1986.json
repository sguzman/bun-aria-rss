  "description": "<p>Realizing Your Deepest Intention (2019-01-16) - The Buddha taught that this whole life - including our thoughts, feelings and actions - arise from the tip of intention. While our intentions are usually marbled with wanting and fear, when intention comes into the light of consciousness, it unfolds into its most pure essence. This talk explores ways that when we are stuck in reactivity, we can become aware of intention, and find our way to the aspiration that expresses our most awake and loving heart. </p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
