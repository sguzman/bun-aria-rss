  "description": "<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, Podcast Family! Each year, during the week of Christmas, we like to do something special for you, and today is no different. As you may know, John Maxwell spends the final week of each year looking back on his year, his journal, his notes, his calendar, and how he’s spent his time and energy. He calls this exercise his year in review. So, this week we’re bringing you a lesson in which John shares, step-by-step, his process for his year in review so that you can set aside time for yourself and apply this proven practice to your life.</p> <p>John has made some of his biggest life and business decisions during this week. So, we wanted to add value to you by giving you this powerful process. It’s changed John’s life, it’s changed the lives of our team members, and we believe it’ll change your life too.</p> <p>We also decided to do something a little different in this episode. Instead of having a post-episode discussion and application, we want to encourage you to take the time you have after John’s lesson to implement the things you’ll learn in this episode. We want you to start your own year in review, so that you can confidently step into the new year with the valuable insight that will help you make next year better than the last.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Year in Review Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Review and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3gJuhABMHrw\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-Self-Aware-Leader--Play-to-Your-Strengths-and-Unleash-Your-Team-_p_3016.html\"> <em>The Self-Aware Leader</em> by John C.
