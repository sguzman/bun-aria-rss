  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden gave an address from Independence Hall in Philadelphia where the American Revolution was launched. Biden and the Democrats keep alienating and lying to the American people and the people keep pretending to believe it. He labeled \"MAGA Republicans\" and election-deniers as a threat to our democracy. Biden called on all Americans to come together in the face of what he called extremism (soccer moms and conservatives). Then, Democrats are trying to change our entire political system. In Alaska, the California-born rank-choice voting was used to disenfranchise voters and defeat former Governor Sarah Palin who was running for Congress.  Later, Former South Carolina Governor and Ambassador Nikki Haley calls in to blast Biden for maligning Republicans while Democrats dehumanize minorities and divide Americans with his hateful MAGA-Fascism rhetoric. Haley also called New York State Attorney General Letitia James to the carpet for leaking the names of donors to her policy advocacy organization. This is the same office that is after former President Trump, the NRA and now Stand For America.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
