  "description": "<p>A massive day of Olympic action is behind us as we celebrate Australia getting back into the medals and celebrate a queen still being a queen as we recap day 7 of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics! How great is it to celebrate Scotty James winning another medal and how great are we feeling that we predicted it would be silver? How are we feeling about the departure of Shaun White? Is Ester Ledecka still the queen despite not being able to back up her double double? Why is skeleton the sport that Australia needs to really get behind thanks to how great Jaclyn Narracott is doing and do we need to excited or worried ahead of tomorrow? Which special guest do we have on tonight to keep things a little Canadian without a Canadian? Why are we so excited about Irish cross-country skiers all of a sudden? And are we pumped for some excitement tomorrow with the medal tally or are we not feeling the vibe? Snow and ski your way into some more entertainment and get behind another episode you won't want to miss!</p>",
