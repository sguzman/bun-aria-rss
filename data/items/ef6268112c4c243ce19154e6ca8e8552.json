When goes in to treat a child patient, the kid's mother notices OP's prosthetic ear and actually gasps. She's so horrified by the ear that she demands that OP remove it because it's scaring her kid! OP refuses, and then the father starts grilling OP because the father assumes that OP is mentally disabled and has no business working as a medical professional.
