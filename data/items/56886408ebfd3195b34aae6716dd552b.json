  "description": "<p>This week, we share 3 of the questions that we are most often asked, and discuss why they're really not helpful. Often, especially when we are starting out or when we are switching to a new medium, we ask questions as a kind of shortcut ... it feels easier to ask than to work it out for ourselves. But the truth is that the answers to these questions are unique for each of us. Only you can find the answer that works for you. That said, we do have some suggestions that we hope are helpful. This week we are also moving back to working on larger paintings, which feels really good, and we are both working hard on our membership groups. As an added bonus, Alice shares her lockdown TV recommendations!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Last chance to join Louise's Art Tribe at the founder's discount rate: <a href=\"https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p>Sally Hirst free courses on Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewJ2YXT8hN8Gb3g7LMkQKw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewJ2YXT8hN8Gb3g7LMkQKw</a></p>\n<p>Sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n",
