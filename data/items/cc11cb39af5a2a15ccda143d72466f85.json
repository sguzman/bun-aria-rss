  "description": "This week, WSJ broke news of internal Facebook Inc. emails that suggested the company lacked urgency to stop data leaks. With David out in Hong Kong at the Journal's Asia tech conference, Joanna and Christopher take you down Memory Lane with some of WSJ's reporters. After catching up on the news, they revisit a chat with Sam Schechner, who broke a story about how much information app makers share with Facebook-without telling you. Then they go back to a talk with Katie Bindley, who downloaded a pregnancy app then found herself targeted by maternity ads on Facebook and Instagram. Finally, they recap Facebook's most recent developer conference, in which the company promised users more privacy-but not privacy from Facebook.",
