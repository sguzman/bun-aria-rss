  "description": "<p>A listener emails in - he made it to an Ivy League school but feels like he doesn't deserve to be there. His peers have't been thru the horrific stuff he has and he feels like maybe nobody can relate. I get it, let's get deep on it. Also a woman who practices witchcraft asks if she should come out to the people in her community. Should she be out and proud or hide that shit?? Where do we draw the line on being out on stuff? Also, subversion. What function does it provide in society and when is it just to annoy people? Let's get our entire lives and get deep as F#ck. </p>\n",
