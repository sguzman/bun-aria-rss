  "description": "A Lesson In Letting Go \n\nThis message, “A Lesson In Letting Go,” by Pastor Steven Furtick, from Elevation Church in Charlotte, NC, is built on the same important perspectives as last week’s message “Looking Forward To Normal.” \n\nWhen all we’ve known is busy, rest feels like something to be resisted. When all we’ve known is bondage, blessings feel foreign. So Pastor Steven is teaching us how to say, “I’m not going back to normal, I’m looking forward to freedom,” as we all loosen our grip on the things we never had control over anyway. \n\nAs we dive into Exodus 14 and Romans 12 we find the most important lesson in letting go comes from the inside out. God doesn’t want us to conform (outside in) any longer to the pattern of this world, but instead to be transformed (inside out) by the renewing of our minds. \n\nEmbrace this “Lesson In Letting Go” so we can stop dwelling on what’s lost and watch Him bless what’s left. \n\nDon’t forget to share this message with a friend and be sure to subscribe for ongoing inspiration and encouragement.
