  "description": "<p>Eric Nam is a Korean-American pop singer from Atlanta. He’s currently lives in Seoul, South Korea, where he found fame as a K-pop star. He was named “2016 Man of the Year” by GQ Korea, and Forbes named him one of their “30 under 30 Asia.”</p>\n\n<p>But his success in Korea has been complicated a little by what he wanted to do with his career versus what he felt he was allowed to do. As his career as an artist has evolved, he’s gotten closer and closer to making the music he wants to make. In November 2019, Eric released <em>Before We Begin</em> — his first album entirely in English. In this episode, Eric Nam and producer Rabitt break down a song from that album called “Love Die Young.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/eric-nam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/eric-nam</a></p>",
