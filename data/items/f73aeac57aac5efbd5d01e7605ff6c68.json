  "title": "The Cost of Meritocracy With Michael Sandel",
  "description": "Does meritocracy create a better world for everyone, or does it create massive inequality? There's been a lot of debate in the last few years about meritocracy, and it's become even more pressing in light of the pandemic. If essential workers are \"essential\", are they really less meritorious than a banker or accountant? So, we decided to discuss both sides of this debate in our next two episodes. \n\nOn this episode, we'll be joined by Michael Sandel who teaches political philosophy at Harvard University and is author of the new book \"The Tyranny of Merit: What's Become of the Common Good\". He'll be making a nuanced case against meritocracy. Also, be sure to stick around for a new surprise after the episode.",
