  "description": "<p>Olympiodorus the Younger (ΟΛΥΜΠΙΟΔΩΡΟΣ Ο ΝΕΩΤΕΡΟΣ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire. Justinian's Decree of 529 AD closed Plato's Academy in Athens and other Pagan schools but Olympiodorus avoided persecution in part because the Alexandrian School was less involved in politics. At his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians. Painting: <em>La fábula de Leda</em> (<em>The Fable of Leda</em>) by Eugenio Cajés (1575-1634) and based off of a painting by Antonio da Correggio (1489-1534). Translated by George Burges. Audiobook read by Geoffrey Edwards.</p>",
