Don't just demand it, believe it.</p><p>It's a question I'm asked often by everyone from employees to entrepreneurs and private practice professionals. How do I raise my rates, earn more money, get paid what I'm worth?</p><p>Part of it is a marketing principal—\"price implies quality.\" Raise your rates, ask for more and people will start to see you as someone worthy of that amount. It's all about perception, they \"file\" you as a higher-caliber performer because the price or salary you're asking is that of someone who is worth it. It's quality \"by association.\"</p><p>BUT, that's only half the equation. The other half is about belief. And, if you miss this part, you can raise your fees, ask for more, demand a raise...and none of it will matter. It still won't work. Nobody will buy you're worth it until you do. That's what we're talking about in today's GLP Riff.</p><p>And, on in our Good Life Science Update, we're exploring the alarming relationship between noise, especially traffic and city noise, and heart disease. Turns out, city dwellers and traffic marauders may be at a higher risk of heart attack or stroke and many other diseases. We'll explore this phenomenon and some new research on what may be the underlying causes.
