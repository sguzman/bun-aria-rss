  "description": "<p>This week, we look at a man who had the potential to be a legendary figure in his sport, but he was prevented from doing so. First, he was prevented by the NCAA, NFL, and the federal court system, then he was prevented by his own inexplicable actions. From robbery, to a crazy night with an arsenal in his car, and a stand off with police. It's a roller coaster ride of rooting for a guy, only to have him break your heart!!<br>Challenge a major industry in court, carry all your guns when driving around near the home of a witness, set to testify against you, and when in doubt, always \"Go Goosin'\" with Maurice Clarett!!<br>Check us out, every Tuesday.
