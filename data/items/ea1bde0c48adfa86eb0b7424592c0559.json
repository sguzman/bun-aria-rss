  "description": "My guest this week is Deborah Frances-White: an award-winning stand-up comedian, author and quite possibly the defining feminist of our generation. You'll probably know her from her hit podcast, The Guilty Feminist, or from her book of the same name and if you don't then WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING, WHERE?<br /><br />Deborah joins me to talk about failure at improvisation, failure to be a biological mother and how to rebuild your life after leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses. Along the way, we discuss her adoption, the Syrian refugee who lives in her house and why learning to be joyful about miserable failure could actually be the key to long-term happiness. Deborah is such an impressive and clever woman and every time I hear her speak, I learn something unbelievably helpful and new. This occasion was no exception. My favourite bit is where we talk about dating as a data-gathering exercise. Enjoy!<br /><br /> <br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted by Elizabeth Day, produced by Chris Sharp and sponsored by 4th Estate Books<br /><br /> <br /><br />The book of the podcast, How To Fail: Everything I've Ever Learned From Things Going Wrong by Elizabeth Day is available to pre-order here.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Guilty Feminist by Deborah Frances-White is out now published by Virago.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br />Elizabeth Day @elizabday<br /><br />Deborah Frances-White @deborahFW<br /><br />The Guilty Feminist @GuiltFemPod<br /><br />Chris Sharp @chrissharpaudio<br /><br />4th Estate Books @4thEstateBooks<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> ",
