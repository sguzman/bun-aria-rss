  "description": "<p>Standard causal inference characterizes treatment effect through averages,\nbut the counterfactual distributions could be different in not only the central\ntendency but also spread and shape. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of\ntreatment effects, we focus on estimating quantile treatment effects (QTEs).\nExisting methods that invert a nonsmooth estimator of the cumulative\ndistribution functions forbid inference on probability density functions\n(PDFs), but PDFs can reveal more nuanced characteristics of the counterfactual\ndistributions. We adopt a semiparametric conditional distribution regression\nmodel that allows inference on any functionals of counterfactual distributions,\nincluding PDFs and multiple QTEs. To account for the observational nature of\nthe data and ensure an efficient model, we adjust for a double balancing score\nthat augments the propensity score with individual covariates. We provide a\nBayesian estimation framework that appropriately propagates modeling\nuncertainty. We show via simulations that the use of double balancing score for\nconfounding adjustment improves performance over adjusting for any single score\nalone, and the proposed semiparametric model estimates QTEs more accurately\nthan other semiparametric methods. We apply the proposed method to the North\nCarolina birth weight dataset to analyze the effect of maternal smoking on\ninfant's birth weight.\n</p>",
