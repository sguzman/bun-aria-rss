  "description": "<p>Wow. THIS guy! Joachim Kroll is one of the most disturbing serial killers we've covered so far. And if you've listened to the Albert Fish and Toybox Killer episodes, you know that is saying A LOT. From 1955 to 1976, this German rapist, murderer, and cannibal is thought to have killed at least 14 people and probably killed more than 30 people - almost all of them young women and girls. Annnnnd, we also dive briefly into other examples of modern cannibals and the details we share are beyond grisly. If you can't handle tales of cannibalism, you're for sure gonna want to sit this one out.  <strong><br /><br />We've donated $5,800 this month to the Alzheimer's Association.</strong> The Alzheimer’s Association leads the way toward ending Alzheimer’s and all other dementia. <br />To find out more, visit <strong><a href=\"https://www.alz.org/\">https://www.alz.org/</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDrEdo7IXsc\">https://youtu.be/sDrEdo7IXsc</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a> <br /></strong>Try out <strong>Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"> </a><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
