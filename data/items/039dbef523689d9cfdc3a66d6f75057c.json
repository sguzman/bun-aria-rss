  "description": "Glenn is joined by Rabbi Daniel Lapin who is an American Orthodox rabbi, author, public speaker, and heads up the \"American Alliance of Jews & Christians.\" They both discuss what exactly anti-semitism is, the response of the left to any Biblical teaching, and the sad fact that the world seems to be heading the complete opposite direction of the Bible. Also, they talk about the massive difference between how the left sees the end of the world as opposed to a religious viewpoint. Lastly, Glenn and Rabbi Daniel Lapin explore the current society and what civilization and time period we most resemble and how we as humans don't seem to learn from the mistakes of our past. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
