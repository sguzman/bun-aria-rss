    "media:description": "Ariana Grande ft. Ty Dolla $ign - safety net (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nFor a singer, being able to set a mood is like being able to cast a spell. Time and again Ariana Grande has proven she's one of those vocalists who can architect an aura, and this performance of \"safety net\" is a great example of the way she controls the emotional climate of a song. The lyrics describe the feeling of being lost in love - a little bit over your head in a new relationship. By inviting Ty Dolla $ign along for a very smooth exchange of lines, Ari takes on an arranger's duties. She knows exactly how she wants this one to sound. \"safety net\" is from 'Positions,' of course. Like our previous Official Live Performance of \"pov,\" it puts her voice right up front, exactly where it should be. Deftly designing the use of swoops and trills, she again shows us her mastery of modern pop. Stay tuned, more coming.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “safety net” by Ariana Grande.
