  "description": "On today's show, Pat looks ahead to the Black Friday sale that Pat McAfee Inc. will be holding among some other announcements. Also calling into the show is everyone's favorite Canadian, Gumpy. The guys chat with Gump about what he's been doing since they've been off the airwaves, how his job has been going, what it's been like with marijuana being legalized in Canada, and how some of his sports teams have been doing (4:03-25:45). The guys also chat about the World Series, react to some of Jon Gruden's recent comments regarding Amari Cooper, and look ahead to Thursday Night Football. To close the show, country superstar and hilarious human Wheeler Walker Jr. joins the show to chat about his upcoming album WWIII, he gives some more of his thoughts on Yodel Boy, plays a couple of cuts off his new album, talks about his feud with Garth Brooks, and discuss his marketing strategy for the new album (48:40-1:17:21). It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers. \n",
