    "media:description": "Errata: \n\nI said in this video that \"CPUs and GPUs are not seen as acceptable hardware choices for edge AI solutions\". This is not true, as CPUs are commonly used for small, sub-$100 items. And GPUs are frequently used in lieu of FPGAs due to their ease of programming.
