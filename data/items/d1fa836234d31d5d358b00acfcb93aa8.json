  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, the democrats are trying to steal the Governor and Senate races in Florida, the Governor race in Georgia and the Senate race in Arizona. Those states are cointinuing their ballott counting. Florida law requires counties to report early voting results within 30 minutes after polls close, but Broward and Palm Beach Counties in Florida are still counting and refusing to disclose the number of ballots remaining to be counted. The Republicans not only have to win elections, they have to win them with enough of a buffer that all the cheating that goes on doesn’t affect the outcome. Florida GOP Chairman Blaise Ingoglia calls in to explain what the Republicans are doing to protect the integrity of Florida's elections through this recount process. Later, a retired US Marine suffering from PTSD entered a college bar in California and murdered 12 people including a Sergeant from the Sheriff's Office. Sergeant Ron Helus entered the front door of the bar during the gunfire to stop the shooter; Sgt. Helus lost his life in this act of selfless heroism. Afterwards, the media questions the Constitutionality of President Trump's interim appointment of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General. Going on to say any interruption with the Mueller investigation would spark problems or conflict in the function of a government that the Constitution might be unable to resolve better known as a Constitutional Crisis. All of this, despite the fact that temporary appointments are completely legal when they're serving on an interim basis while searching for candidate or awaiting senate confirmation. Finally, congress has no legitimate oversight responsibility to receive President Trump’s personal finances/taxes with a private coorporation. Article 1 powers don’t include the securing of personal, private financial records and tax returns for the purpose of democratic objectives.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
