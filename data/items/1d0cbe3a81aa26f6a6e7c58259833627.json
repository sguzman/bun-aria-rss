  "description": "<p>Season 2 - Episode 8</p> <p>Team Deakins is so pleased to welcome the fabulous production designer Mark Tildesley (NO TIME TO DIE, PHANTOM THREAD, SUNSHINE) to the podcast for a delightful conversation. Mark unpacks the role of the production designer, and delves into how he works with hyper visual directors like Danny Boyle, and more contemplative, internal directors like Michael Winterbottom. He also sheds some light on how the role of the production designer differs on a small, personal movie compared to a mega blockbuster franchise like James Bond. This is a delightful conversation that drills down on the real world nuts and bolts of filmmaking. Don’t miss it!</p>",
