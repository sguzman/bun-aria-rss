  "description": "<p>Oprah calls that <em>persistent knowing</em> inside of us our <em>Spiritual GPS</em>. She says it’s our inner compass guiding us to move through our lives no matter what difficulties come our way. In this <em>SuperSoul Conversation </em>Oprah talks with renowned spiritual teachers Michael Beckwith, Caroline Myss, Cheryl Strayed, President Jimmy Carter, Dr. Robin Smith, Mastin Kipp, Elizabeth Gilbert, Marianne Williamson, Sue Monk Kidd about what we can do to tune into that inner guidance. Intuition may speak to us in subtle ways, through longing or restlessness.  Or it may sound louder, when we get a wake-up call: a beloved relationship ends, a job loss or money problems arise. One thing is certain, when we ignore our <em>Spiritual GPS</em>, we risk peril in the process. <em> </em>This episode is a compilation of some of her most profound conversations with guests from her Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday.</em> You can find these conversations  and more in Oprah’s New York Times best-selling book <em>The</em> <em>Wisdom of Sundays</em>.</p>\n",
