  "description": "<p>We took our show to Atlanta over the weekend, and what better way to celebrate the hottest town in reality TV than by taking a trip in the wayback machine and revisiting the first episode EVER of \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\"? This was back when Nene and Kim were friends (and had different faces), when Deshawn Snow had hope, and Lisa Wu Hartwell was, well, a thing. We had SO MUCH FUN recapping this episode, and to make things even better - we had four special cameos from Lea Black, Kate Chastain, Kelly Dodd, and Lisa Rinna to celebrate Ronnie's birthday! You cannot miss this episode, and honestly, you can't miss our live shows either.
