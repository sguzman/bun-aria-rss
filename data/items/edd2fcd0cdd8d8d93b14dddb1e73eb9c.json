  "title": "2021 NFL Draft Bold Predictions: Justin Fields #3 overall? No defensive players in Top 10? 2 or more RBs in the 1st round? (Football 4/28)",
  "description": "The Pick Six Superfriends gather, as they often do around big events, to make bold predictions for the 2021 NFL Draft. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech all have some wild, yet not absolutely improbably, predictions for how things will go down on Thursday night. We know that there should be a heavy run of offensive players to kick off the draft, but how long will that stretch continue? There's all sorts of speculation around #3 and while the obvious choice appears to be Mac Jones, Brinson takes it in another direction for the 49ers. The guys mix in draft props as they predict when players and positions will be off the board. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
