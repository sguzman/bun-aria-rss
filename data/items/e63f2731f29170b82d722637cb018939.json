I wanted to correct my comment at the end of this episode where I make claim to a winning streak.  That was not correct as we already lost that streak on New Years Eve to Vancouver.  Also, I am posting this after our game with Toronto tonight...as I furiously type this due to the nightmarish turnout of that game.
