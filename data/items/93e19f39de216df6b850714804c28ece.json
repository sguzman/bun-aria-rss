  "itunes:summary": "In early February 1974, I was facing the biggest decision of my life. I was convinced through reading the New Testament that Jesus really is the Son of God. But I did not want to be a Christian as I feared that I would lose my freedom. The last things that I associated with faith were love and freedom. I associated faith with losing my freedom. I thought that God would want me to stop doing all the things that were fun and that I enjoyed.\nIn fact, over the last nearly half a century, I have discovered that faith leads to true freedom and love. Love, faith and freedom are inextricably entwined.",
