  "description": "<p><strong>\"All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.\" That's a quote from old Billy Shakespeare, but it also succinctly summarizes the sociological philosophy of Erving Goffman. This week, Connor and Dan take a look at said philosophy and discuss whether social interaction is the equivalent of a little stage play we all perform for one another's benefit. Also discussed, the benefits of school uniforms, what the abbreviation of Erving is, and Connor's new nickname!</strong></p>",
