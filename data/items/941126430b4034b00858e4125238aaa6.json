  "description": "<p>Calling <strong>Ken Fulk</strong> an “interior designer” doesn’t do him justice—Fulk’s San Francisco firm does everything from weekly floral arrangements to branding to planning extravagant events, complete with costumes, fireworks and mariachi bands.  For the right client, he’ll even design a wedding—famously, he created a theatrical fairy-tale experience for early Facebook president Sean Parker. On this episode of the Business of Home podcast, Fulk speaks with host Dennis Scully about what silicon valley moguls want from interior design, why he’s been taking ownership stakes in his projects, and what lessons he’s learning from the era of social distancing. This episode is sponsored by Dedon and High Point Market.</p>\n",
