  "description": "<p>The thirteen <em>Epistles</em> (Greek: ΕΠΙΣΤΟΛΑΙ; Latin: EPISTOLAE) may or many not have been written by Plato. If genuine these letters provide a glimpse into the personal life of Plato including his financial concerns and political involvement with the tyrant Dionysius II. Coded language and hidden messages appear to have been used in the letters making parts difficult to understand. Translated by George Burges. Painting: <em>Portrait of the Sisters Zénaïde and Charlotte Bonaparte</em> by Jacques-Louis David (French, 1748 - 1825), 1821. Scanned by The J. Paul Getty Museum. </p>",
