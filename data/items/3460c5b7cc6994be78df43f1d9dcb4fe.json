  "description": "<p>Coburg, Victoria, Australia didn't always have that name. It was originally known as Pentridge and it was infamous for being home to the Pentridge Prison. This prison was one of the most notorious in Australia, housing some of the worst of the worst and was open for 146 years. Today, it is the setting for fashion shows, parties, conferences and even weddings. As is the case with many old jails, this one is restless behind the scenes...or should we say, behind the veil. Spirits roam the cell blocks. Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of Australia's Pentridge Prison! Moment in Oddity features sheep farts downing a plane and This Day in History features Thomas Edison inventing the phonograph.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-86-pentridge-prison.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-86-pentridge-prison.html</a></p> <p>Become an executive producer:  http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p> </p>",
