[October 24, 2019] – Over the last four years, more than 50,000 participants have developed and submitted over 114,000 artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to improve everything from detection of <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/e/media/press-release/nearly-10-000-global-problem-solvers-yield-winning-formulas-to-i.html\">lung cancer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151214005646/en/Annual-Data-Science-Bowl-Crowd-Sources-Solutions-Transform\">heart disease</a>, to monitoring <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/e/media/press-release/booz-allen-kaggle-announce-winner-of-the-data-science-bowl.html\">ocean health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/e/media/press-release/2018-data-science-bowl-results.html\">helping accelerate life-saving medical research</a> as part of the annual <a href=\"http://www.datatsciencebowl.com/\">Data Science Bowl</a>®.</p>\n<p>In partnership with PBS KIDS, this year’s competition will look at advancements in early childhood education. The results will lead to better designed games and improved learning outcomes, empowering children, parents, caregivers and educators across the globe with insights into how young children learn through media and which approaches work best to help them build on foundational learning skills. The 90-day Data Science Bowl competition will award winning participants with a share of $160,000 in cash prizes.</p>\n<p>Research shows much of the most critical brain development in children takes place <a href=\"http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf\">before they even reach kindergarten</a>. Child development experts indicate it is during these first five years that children develop linguistic, cognitive, social, emotional, and regulatory skills that predict their later functioning in many domains. Yet early education approaches around the world vary in quality, accessibility, technique and engagement, leading to disparities in children’s learning and development. Further, access to effective early learning resources is critical, as research demonstrates that high-quality educational media can help support young learners. To better understand these challenges and develop the most effective approaches to high-quality early educational media, <a href=\"http://www.boozallen.com/\">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> (NYSE: BAH) and <a href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/\">Kaggle</a> today launched the fifth annual <a href=\"http://www.datatsciencebowl.com/\">Data Science Bowl</a>®, the world’s largest data science competition focused on social good.</p>\n<p>“Early childhood education is a pivotal point in a child’s development that can provide them with a profound advantage and set the foundation for lifelong success,” said Dr. Josh Sullivan, senior vice president, Booz Allen Hamilton and leader of the firm’s analytics and AI business. “For the fifth annual Data Science Bowl, we’re excited to harness the collective power of people around the world to uncover how children learn and develop more beneficial and effective educational tools for children.”</p>\n<p><b>The 2019 Data Science Bowl At-A-Glance: </b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Why does this challenge matter?</b> The first five years of a child’s life are <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02568543.2016.1273285\">critical to their development</a> as it’s when they learn and cultivate linguistic, cognitive, social, emotional and regulatory skills that predict their later functioning in many domains. Access to high-quality, effective early learning resources is critical during the early childhood developmental period and supporting education at an early age is also key for other long-term <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6040/299\">success factors</a> such as increased qualifications, employment, and earnings.</li>\n<li><b>What will participants do?</b> Participants will be provided with anonymous gameplay data from the <a href=\"https://pbskids.org/apps/pbs-kids-measure-up.html\">PBS KIDS Measure Up!</a> app, which was developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready to Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. They will be tasked with creating algorithms that utilize information about how players use the app to determine what they know and are learning from the experience, in order to discover important relationships between their engagement with educational media and learning. The insights gleaned from these solutions will help PBS KIDS and other organizations create new solutions, content and products that help ensure each and every user has the best chance to learn important skills, helping improve childhood learning access and achievement.</li>\n<li><b>Privacy and data security.</b> PBS KIDS is committed to creating a safe and secure environment that family members of all ages can enjoy. The PBS KIDS Measure Up! app does not collect any personally identifying information, such as name or location. All of the data used in the competition is anonymous.
