Is it the best horror movie in ages or is that more hyperbole from the desperate fan base of a genre with the lowest bar for entry and yet the highest bar for quality? Your know-it-all internet uncles are here to make the definitive call. Then they dive into the lemarchand box of stop motion animation, Phil Tippett’s ‘Mad God’, one man’s passion project 30 years in the making with a history that seems like it was cribbed from a creepy pasta. Was it worth it? Does it make sense? Have your hosts stared into the void and saw the void stare back? You’ll find out soon enough! They’ll have our rundown of the new releases on physical media, your Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.Then Matt and Chris wrap it up with the bookie approved probability game, What Are The Odds? So Let’s get this further descent into despair and madness started with a clip from the Black Phone.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-11:06: <strong>Intro/The Black Phone</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">11:07-20:27: <strong>Physical Media Picks</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">20:28-30:12: <strong>Mad God</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">30:13-52:51: <strong>What Are The Odds?!?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">52:52-54:19: <strong>Wrap Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
