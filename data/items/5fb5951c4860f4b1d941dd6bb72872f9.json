  "description": "<p>If you go on social media and look up #manifestation, you would guess it’s about designer bags, expensive shoes, lavish cars, private jets and exclusive vacations. While those things can be great if you want them.. That is NOT what manifestation is actually about. And the reason why most manifestations don’t even work is because people don’t understand the core concept.</p> <p>In this episode, we get real. We talk about what is missing in the manifestation conversation, what manifestation is truly about, and bringing the spirituality back into manifestation so we can manifest what truly matters.</p> <p>In this episode, I sit with one of my besties + Manifestation through Meditation Author Cassandra Bodzak for another jam-packed episode on the truth about manifestation. Her episode 389: How To Manifest Anything (that is in alignment) is the #1 most downloaded episode on Highest Self Podcast history so I know you’re going to love it.</p> <p>You are a creatrix so far beyond the material possessions.
