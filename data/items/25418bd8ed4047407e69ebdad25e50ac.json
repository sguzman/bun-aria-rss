  "description": "Hairstylist Jimmy Paul takes us on a journey, starting in the small steel mill town outside of Pittsburgh where he dreamed big and landing in New York City, where he made his name as one of the fashion industry’s most in-demand talents. His tale is a true New York story: He talks about his time at the The Pyramid Club, with nightlife legends like Ethyl Eichelberger, Agosto Machado, and Lady Bunny; getting his start at Oribe; Marc Jacobs’ legendary 1992 grunge collection for Perry Ellis; his first <em>Vogue</em> cover; collaborating with photographers like Steven Meisel, David LaChapelle, and Joshua Jordan; and so much more. Also, Jimmy shares what it takes to weather the ups and downs, keep the creative spark alive, and stay focused on the work. -- For links and sponsors mentioned in this episode:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fatmascara.com/blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fatmascara.com/blog</a>; Our private Facebook Group:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/301355990240321/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Mascara Raising a Wand</a>; Instagram:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fatmascara/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@fatmascara</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessicamatlin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@jessicamatlin</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenn_edit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@jenn_edit</a>; Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@fatmascara.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">info@fatmascara.com</a>; To submit a \"Raise A Wand\" product recommendation &amp; be featured on a future episode:&nbsp;+1 646-481-8182.&nbsp; <p>Become a member at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/fatmascara\">https://plus.acast.com/s/fatmascara</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
