    "media:description": "This is a companion video to my other Steins;Gate video: Butterfly Effect.\n\nNOTE ON YOUTUBE ADVERTISING\nI wrestled for 2 whole weeks with the terrible copyright situation for this IP.\nBasically, the complete video (not just some music tracks) was plastered with copyright claims (an extremely spurious and unethical practice IMO) by the Japanese publisher (mages).\nIn the end, I decided the video was needed to go in tandem with the Butterfly Effect overview video, and that therefore with a heavy heart I have to accept YouTube's enforcement of adverts at their discretion.\nI just want it to be perfectly clear that *this is not my choice* - this seems to have been the choice of .. Steins;Gate ...\n\nSteins;Gate is rated M (Mature 17+) by the ESRB. My video is therefore NOT suitable for children as per the COPPA legislation.\n\n#SteinsGate #VisualNovel",
