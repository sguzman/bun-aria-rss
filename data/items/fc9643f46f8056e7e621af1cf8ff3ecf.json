  "description": "<p>In the early 2000s, Hpnotiq was one of the most popular liquor brands in the industry. Everyone wanted the mysterious blue bottle. The brand went from being unknown to moving a million cases a year at it’s peak, before the company was sold for $65 million. Another brand with a similar but even more impressive raise to prominence was Ciroc vodka. Ciroc was another unknown brand that went from moving 50,000 cases in 2007 to 2.6 milllion cases in 2014. The common denominator in both of these brands rise to dominance was their head of marketing and strategy, the legendary Nick Storm. To call Nick a marketing genius would be an understatement. He’s been a force in the music industry and nightlife scene for over 25 years. He has built relationships with some of the biggest names in the history of music and entertainment. He implemented the marketing plans for Ciroc and Hqnotiq that would change the face of the spirits industry forever. On episode 65, Nick outlines his journey in the spirits industry and gives behind the scenes backstories on both iconic rises to prominence. #marketingplan EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ Guest IG: @iamnickstorm Brand Resumes: .https://brandresumes.com/eyl/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
