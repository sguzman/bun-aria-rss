  "description": "It's Thanksgiving weekend in the USA.  It's a warm, friendly, family holiday provided that a.) your family does not discuss politics, b.) your unhinged uncle does not drink too much and c.) the indoor deep-fryer does not burn the whole house down.  Maybe you'll go to a class reunion.  Those are always...terrible.  Or, alternatively, maybe you'll do what you did on prom night...stay home alone.  Except this time you'll have Rosa Brooks, Emily Brandwin and Maggie Feldman-Piltch to join you and they'll be talking about what's right with the world and what they're thankful for.  They will, that is, just as soon as they get their own awful high school experiences off their chests.
