  "description": "<p>Let’s suspend judgment, just for a minute. What if you could take a few weeks, months, maybe even an entire year off work to do exactly what you wanted, whether traveling the world, considering your next career move or just taking a moment to step back and really check in with yourself? Would you go for it? Especially after the last few years we’ve had? Safe bet, most people would jump on that opportunity. But then comes the reality check. The doubt. The details. Sure, it’d be amazing, but I could never make it happen. Right?</p><br><p>But, what if you could? What if it was actually more doable than you ever imagined? What if there were ideas, tools, and strategies that would help you step away and reset your mind, body, and life? Ways that might not even require you to leave your job, and know you had something to come back to. Even if, by the end, you didn’t want to anymore? What if your personal, life-changing sabbatical was not only possible, but necessary for you to not only reclaim your sense of self and purpose and aliveness, but to create the space to see more clearly who and what matters, and how you want to step into your life from this moment forward.</p><br><p>My guest today, DJ DiDonna has been studying these real-life breaks, in all forms, showing why they matter and revealing incredible insights into not just how to do them in a way that truly gives you what you’re looking for, but also how to make them more possible than you ever imagined. DJ is the founder of The Sabbatical Project, a research and advocacy nonprofit that is on a mission to define, explore, and research sabbaticals and their impact on non-academics. On his own sabbatical, DJ walked 900 miles on pilgrimage in Shikoku, Japan and ran a poverty research lab at his alma mater Notre Dame.&nbsp;</p><br><p>And today, we dive deeper into some of the ideas and stories that appear in his upcoming book based on hundreds of interviews with sabbatical-takers from across the world. DJ and I uncover more about the history of sabbaticals and their roots in academia. And also, he breaks down the essential components of taking an effective extended pause from work and even offers some ideas that might make you seriously consider taking a sabbatical in the near future—even if retirement isn't even in sight yet.</p><br><p>You can find DJ at: <a href=\"https://thesabbaticalproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thesabbaticalproject.org/take-the-quiz/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Learn About Your Sabbatical Style</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddidonna/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000421909495\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chip Conley</a> about reimagining later-in-life contributions.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li><li><strong>The Loudest Girl in the World&nbsp;</strong>is a new podcast that tells the story of Lauren Ober’s journey to understand what the hell it means to be on the autism spectrum and how to live life as a newly diagnosed autistic person. <a href=\"https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/loudest-girl-in-the-world\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download and listen today wherever you get your podcasts.</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
