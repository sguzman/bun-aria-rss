Do people who engage in the oppression of others initiate these cycles of violence and oppression themselves? All the sinful practices that we could possibility engage in humanity wide, they all have us in their grip, making sure that we are dehumanized and dehumanize each other; it’s all part of this cosmic network that is <strong>wrath</strong>. It is self-consumptive. The whole thing is set aflame and will consume itself. Where is God in this? How do New Creation dynamics play into this? What does Paul say in Romans on all of this?<em><strong> </strong></em>Today, we continue our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: \"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast.
