The first of their published books came from Christina's fic \"The Office,\" and was published as <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30DYRED\"><em>Beautiful Bastard</em></a>. Sarah loves it a lot.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/wonder-woman-1984-delayed-christmas-1234766774/\">Wonder Woman 1984 has been postponed</a> because of COVID, and according to the director the film is best seen in a theater. It is not because <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/09/robert-pattinson-the-batman-coronavirus\">Robert Pattinson got COVID</a> (He's <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/robert-pattinsons-batman-resumes-after-his-covid-19-battle/\">back to business now</a>).

(Ps. Jen's favorite scene is not in that video, her search continues.)</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackplusJenn\">The Twilight fandom was vast</a>, as we discussed in this episode. And there are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZREllor/status/1312771775185530886?s=20\">important reasons why many folks are</a> drawn to fandom. Last summer, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCRzMREgE8N/?igshid=p6qaee1limpw\">Alexis Daria and Adriana Herrera talked about fanfiction and fandom on Instagram Live</a>, and it's a great watch.</p><p class=\"\">Christina and Lauren mentioned “canon” and “AU” and AO3 and livejournal and fandom bootcamp and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joannasmith008/fanfiction-428029544a12\">maybe you want a primer</a> on some fanfic terms.</p><p class=\"\">Maybe you also need a primer on a <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/13/s026-cinnamon-roll-romance-heroes-interstitial-with-andie-christopher\">cinnamon roll character</a>.</p><p class=\"\">These hugely popular romance writers came up through fanfic: Sally Thorne, Alice Clayton, Nina Bocci, Tara Sue Me, Amanda Weaver, Rebekah Weatherspoon, Helena Hunting, Daisy Prescott, EL James, and Ruth Clampett. Present-tense, stream of consciousness flow, and intense character work are some of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/10/how-fanfiction-improves-writing/599197/\">the hallmarks of fandom writing, and some of those stylistic choices</a> have influenced mainstream fiction in multiple genres, including romance.</p><p class=\"\">Did you miss the community experience of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iJj6XK\"><em>The Submissive</em></a>? Lucky for you, it's now available as a stand alone novel, and the next books in the series <em>The Dominant</em> and <em>The Training</em> also started as fic.</p><p class=\"\">Christina and Lauren and Nina Bocci worked on <a href=\"https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Fandom_Gives_Back\">the Fandom Gives Back fundraiser</a> to benefit <a href=\"https://www.alexslemonade.org/\">Alex’s Lemonade Stand</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Jen said she loves <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iA7ea7\"><em>Beautiful Player</em></a>, but honestly no one will be surprised that she got the title wrong and her real favorite is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Stranger-Book-2-ebook/dp/B00A0BHS8Q/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=beautiful%20stranger&qid=1602031159&s=digital-text&sr=1-1\"><em>Beautiful Stranger</em></a>.
