  "description": "It's hard for kids to share their parents. Siblings can feel like they're competing for the ultimate resource: your love and attention. While we can't get rid of those competitive feelings, we can help our kids learn to recognize and regulate them (and this of course is what leads to improved behavior!). In this week's episode, Dr. Becky offers several strategies to parents navigating sibling rivalry—from validating our kid's tricky feelings about siblinghood to encouraging cooperation to introducing mantras through play.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
