  "description": "<p>Today's episode is.... interesting. Honoring a tradition started with the 100th Drunk as F*#k episode, I altered my mind again for this 200th episode. Five minutes before recording, I ingested a hefty amount of magic mushrooms. And then I did my best to not ruin the research. I hope it's entertaining! The story of the West Mesa Bone Collector is a tragic one - not the best for a happy high. Eleven women's bodies (and one unborn child) were found in a plot of undeveloped desert just outside of Albuquerque in 2009. And authorities still don't know who did it, but they do think a serial killer is responsible.  And, there are some suspects that do look pretty damn guilty. We take a deep look into this crime, and get a little crazy celebrating 200 straight Mondays of Timesuck. Thanks for making this possible, Meatsacks.
