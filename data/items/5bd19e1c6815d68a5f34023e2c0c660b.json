  "content": "<p><a href=\"http://pamitc.org/iccv15/\">ICCV 2015</a>, the International Conference on\nComputer Vision, is one of the premier venues for computer vision research,\ntogether with the CVPR conference.\nThis ICCV is happening in Santiago, Chile, a beautiful city with amazing food.</p>\n<p>The computer vision community is growing, and this ICCV is the largest so far\n(1460 attendees, 525 papers).  Since a few years computer vision is broadly\nrelevant for the industry and there are no less than 22 companies sponsoring\nthe conference.\nThe acceptance rate this year was 30.92%, with the acceptance for oral\npresentations at 3.30%.\nAll papers of the conference are <a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/ICCV2015.py\">available as open-access PDF\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p>There was a lot of interesting work presented on the first day, but here is my\nsubjective selection of interesting work.</p>\n<h3>Aligning Books and Movies</h3>\n<p>By Yukun Zhu, Ryan Kiros, Richard Zemel, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Raquel\nUrtasun, Antonio Torralba, and Sanja Fidler.</p>\n<p>Movies and the books they are based on form a rich paired data source.\nIn this work the authors propose a recurrent neural network model to align\nthese two sources semantically.\nThe challenge is that movies and books are often substantially different, but\napparently modern recurrent neural networks have enough semantic discrimination\nability to enable such alignment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbweb/\">Project page</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Zhu_Aligning_Books_and_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\">paper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Convolutional Color Constancy</h3>\n<p>By Jonathan Barron.</p>\n<p>Color constancy deals with the correction of colors in digital images.  While\nthere have been a large number of works in this area, the issue remains\nchallenging and important.</p>\n<p>In this work the author convincingly demonstrates that common changes in colors\ncorrespond to simple translation of a color histogram in a transformed 2D\nhistogram space.  Then, the problem of correcting for these translations can be\nposed as simply recognizing the true center position of the observed color\nhistogram and undoing the translation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Barron_Convolutional_Color_Constancy_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Self-Calibration of Optical Lenses</h3>\n<p>By Michael Hirsch and Bernhard Schoelkopf.</p>\n<p>Both cheap and expensive camera lenses suffer from many optical effects,\nleading to deterioration in image quality.\nThis work proposes an automatic way to obtain non-parametric kernel estimates\nof the point spread functions characterising a lens.\nThe resulting model can then be used to deblur images.\nIn effect, this allows better image quality even when using cheap lenses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Hirsch_Self-Calibration_of_Optical_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\">Paper</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/blog/iccv-2015-day-2.html\">second day</a> is available now.</p>",
