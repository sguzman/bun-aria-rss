  "description": "<p>Round 1: Update the safety brief: A pilot crashed his plane a couple of times and people are freaking out about it. It was only 7 crashes in a week. Whats the big deal?\n\nRound 2: Our friends at Task and Purpose think they have the enlisted drinking culture nailed down… We’ll be the judge about that. Last I checked, 23 year old Kate doesn't work at Task and Purpose. \n\nRound 3: In a NOT shocking report that SHOULD be shocking, food insecurity is running wild in the military community. There’s a growing number of military families that are struggling to put food on the table. \n\nRound 4: Bad Ass of the Week returns with the story of a former Polish soldier, 94-year-old Wanda Traczyk-Stawska who stunned the crowd at a pro-EU rally when she thundered \"Be quiet, stupid boy! You lousy bastard\" at a member of a far-right group attempting to disrupt the gathering over a loudspeaker.\n\nRound 5: In other news with the Olds, we regret to inform you that they are back at it again …. And by that we mean getting elected.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
