It's strange because of the very short window of time in which little William goes missing. William was three years old when he was last seen. He was playing outside with his sister. According to reports William was only left unsupervised for about 15 minutes. Several strange vehicles were spotted near where William was playing. Was the little boy being watched? Did someone snatch him up and take him? Police are still working under the assumption that William is alive. This week we take a look at the details of William's disappearance.
