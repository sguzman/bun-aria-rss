Her husband, Julian Assange, is somewhat infamous not only for founding Wikileaks, but for publishing classified government documents that lead to his unlawful imprisonment. Today, Stella leads the charge for his freedom and for the freedom of information.\n\n—Links— \n\nGet up to $200 OFF + 2 FREE pillows with all mattress orders: https://helixsleep.com/JORDAN\n\nFor Stella Assange:\n\nTwitter: @STELLAMORIS1\n\nFor US/Canada: https://assangedefense.org/take-action/\n\nFor UK viewers: https://dontextraditeassange.com/take-action/\n\nThe Trial of Julian Assange: A Story of Persecution by Nils Melzer https://www.amazon.com/Trial-Julian-Assange-Story-Persecution/dp/1839766220/\n\n—Sponsors—\n\nHelix Sleep: Get up to $200 OFF + 2 FREE pillows with all mattress orders: https://helixsleep.com/JORDAN\n\n—Chapters—\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:04) Intro\n(7:30) 750 thousand pages of trouble\n(15:14) Incautious journalism\n(24:32) Sexual misconduct allegations\n(38:37) The Ecuadorian embassy\n(47:26) The US enters the fold, fault 7\n(58:28) Has the US prosecution achieved their goals?\n(1:04:05) Moving the goal post, 17 charges\n(1:12:45) Why the battle cannot be waged in a US court\n(1:22:13) The constitutionality of the espionage act\n(1:27:50) What this means going forward\n(1:37:41) To stand one's ground\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #julianassange #stellaassange #wikileaks #journalist #censorship #espionage",
