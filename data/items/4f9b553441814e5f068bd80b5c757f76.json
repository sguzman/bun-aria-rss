  "description": "On the one hand, America's vaccine roll out is making great progress. On the other, in the last week COVID cases are on the rise in 38 states. On the one hand, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are working remarkably well. On the other hand, Astra Zeneca and perhaps Johnson and Johnson not so much. (Or maybe the government is over-reacting to a very tiny number of problem cases with the J&J vaccine.) On the one hand we know more about the disease. On the other hand it keeps changing and about a third of us just don't want to know the science. Where does this lead? We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winner Laurie Garrett, former senior Obama health specialist Dr. Kavita Patel and Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School. Also: A special conversation about latest revelations about Trump and Russia and the Biden team's response.  Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.
