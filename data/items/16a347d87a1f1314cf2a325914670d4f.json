  "description": "<p>It's even taboo to talk about taboos. Even though we may not realize it, our social taboos are able to keep us imprisoned within our own minds.</p> <p>Don't you want to know what invisible forces are governing the way you think, feel, and function on a daily basis? Don't you want to know why you do what you do?</p> <p>Well, even if you did, it's very difficult to find out what they are because they are usually a \"blind spot\" in our consciousness.</p> <p>I'm not talking about science fiction, and Neo waking up from a dream within The Matrix. I'm talking about science fact, and how our perception of reality is largely governed by beliefs that we never got to choose ourselves. Could your faulty beliefs be causing you to struggle and fail repeatedly in your life?</p> <p>This is where a teacher like Daniel Vitalis come in...</p> <p>He can instantly redirect your focus to help you see the things in your life that are hiding in plain sight.</p> <p>I often say that our relationships are the #1 most influential factor on our health and happiness. Why this episode is so valuable is that we often carry a lot of guilt, shame, and fear surrounding our relationships and don't really know why.</p> <p>Most of us want to have happy, healthy relationships in our lives, but we tend to find many creative ways of screwing them up. We self-sabotage and don't know why. We stay in the wrong relationships and don't know why. We look for problems when they're not there, and we often feel that we are inadequate or that something is \"wrong\" with us.</p> <p>I'm sorry, but chances are, there is nothing wrong with you. You are a wildly amazing human being, with many gifts, talents, capacities, and complexities that make you uniquely you. The perfect you that you are.</p> <p>Today we're going to break open a can of whoop a$% on taboos so that we can be free of the guilt, shame, and fear that may be holding you back from health and happiness.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>Why being optimistic isn't necessarily natural for humans.</li> <li>What taboos actually are (and how they make us want things more).</li> <li>How taboos function in our psyche.</li> <li>What the the Intrinsic Taboo is (you need to know this!)</li> <li>How many \"wild human\" tribes are left in the world (and what advantages they have over us).</li> <li>How cavities in teeth are related to osteoporosis.</li> <li>What Dr. Weston A.
