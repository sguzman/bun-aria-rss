  "description": "<p>Finding claims that researchers have made considerable progress in artificial\nintelligence over the last several decades is easy. However, our everyday\ninteractions with cognitive systems (e.g., Siri, Alexa, DALL-E) quickly move\nfrom intriguing to frustrating. One cause of those frustrations rests in a\nmismatch between the expectations we have due to our inherent,\nfolk-psychological theories and the real limitations we experience with\nexisting computer programs. The software does not understand that people have\ngoals, beliefs about how to achieve those goals, and intentions to act\naccordingly. One way to align cognitive systems with our expectations is to\nimbue them with mental states that mirror those we use to predict and explain\nhuman behavior. This paper discusses these concerns and illustrates the\nchallenge of following this route by analyzing the mental state 'intention.'\nThat analysis is joined with high-level methodological suggestions that support\nprogress in this endeavor.\n</p>",
