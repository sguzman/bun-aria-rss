  "description": "<p>In this 94th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss adulthood. Beginning with an excerpt from the Adulthood chapter of our forthcoming book, we discuss postmodernism and physical reality. We then discuss error correction, and explain our concern about the Carvallo study out of Argentina. We discuss cargo cult science, and Heather’s conversation with a liberal Christian outside of a farmer’s market: on being good to one another and connecting, the police and protests and leadership and forgiveness. We share a short excerpt from Elie Wiesel’s book Night, discuss diminishing returns curves, and vitamin D and other low-hanging pandemic fruit. Finally, we enjoin you to smile at people, put your phone down, and define your fights for whom and what you love, rather than against whom and what you hate.<br/> <br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
