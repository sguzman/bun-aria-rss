  "title": "Value Investor's Edge Live #44: Textainer Group: Updates On Container Leasing Markets",
  "description": "The Textainer Group (TGH) management team joined Value Investor's Edge Live on January 10, 2022, to discuss the container box leasing markets and prospects for 2022. TGH spent most of the past 18-months prioritizing growth capex, but they have also been actively repurchasing shares, and they re-launched their dividend last quarter. As we shift into 2022, higher shareholder returns appear likely as growth capex will eventually slow down. TGH has signed most of their recent growth on 12-year to 14-year contracts, so once the forward growth slows, TGH will have enormous resources available to either pay large dividends or repurchase more shares.\nThis interview and discussion of the underlying LNG global markets is relevant for anyone with container shipping interests or investments, including firms such as Atlas Corp (ATCO), Costamare (CMRE), Danaos Corp (DAC), Euroseas (ESEA), Global Ship Lease (GSL), Matson (MATX), Navios Partners (NMM), Triton Intl (TRTN), and Zim Integrated Shipping (ZIM). \nTopics Covered\n\n(2:00) How are box leasing prospects shaping up for 2022?\n\n\n(4:45) Is capex slowing in 2022, or might volumes be similar to last year?\n\n\n(6:45) Current economics in growth projects? Still near record levels?\n\n\n(9:00) When will free cash flow shift towards higher shareholder returns?\n\n\n(11:00) Balance sheet update?
