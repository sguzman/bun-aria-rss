  "description": "In just a couple of years, Creedence Clearwater Revival generated one of the most amazing runs of hits in\nAmerican pop history: from “Proud Mary” to “Green River,” “Bad Moon Rising” to “Travelin’ Band.”\nReportedly, they even outsold the Beatles in America in 1969. But for all their success with those John\nFogerty–penned classics, CCR never held the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100. All of those hits were No. 2s: a\ndubious Billboard chart record they hold to this day, for most No. 2s without a No. 1. True, it was the late ’60s,\nand CCR had the bad luck to be competing with such chart titans as Paul Simon and Sly Stone…but\nsometimes they were held back by No. 1 songs that are barely remembered today. In this episode of Hit\nParade, we break down the sequence of events that relegated CCR—a future first-ballot Rock and Roll Hall of\nFame band—to the charts’ permanent runner-up slot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
