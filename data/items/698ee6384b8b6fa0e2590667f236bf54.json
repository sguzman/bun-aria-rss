  "description": "<p>Los Angeles Rams Chief Operating Officer Kevin Demoff joins Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams to discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including what the Super Bowl means not only to the team's bottom line now, but what it means in the context of a franchise building a $5 billion (and counting) stadium complex. Demoff also talks about the process of hiring a new coach, and the risks associated with naming a 30-year-old to the position. Also discussed is how teams and leagues will benefit from sports betting, the non-call in the NFC championship game against the New Orleans Saints, and the global view of Rams owner Stan Kroenke, whose company also owns the NBA's Denver Nuggets and Arsenal of the English Premier League. He also talks about the stadium and fan experience. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
