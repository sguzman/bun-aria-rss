    "media:description": "I don't know how to explain it other than incorrectly but kind of close to how I really feel, imagine you just felt more, you had an extra sense other than the 5 regular ones, and it was to feel something else, and because of it you have to be super tense so that you don't lose something? When I'm alone I have like zero problems with anything ever, and some people never do anything that bothers me, but some people are like dispensaries of misery for me, I have to focus on whatever I'm doing while also fighting with my own senses, maybe my thalamus isn't doing its job to filter unnecessary signals very well. The WORST part is, I can't just tell people to stop, like what do I say? Stop breathing like that? On bad days of this, my left ear typically, will gish more earwax than usual from me pounding that little skin flap that you can plug your ear with, it can hurt too. Really I'd rather just not do this, but it almost feels like I don't have a choice. Don't even get me started on \"exposure therapy\" like making me just completely shut down by overloading me is going to fix me somehow.\n\nlearn more",
