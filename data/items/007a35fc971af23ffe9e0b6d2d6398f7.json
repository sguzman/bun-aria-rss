  "description": "<p>The rules are changing. At a time when technology promises to allow the lame to walk and the blind to see, we're forced to ask: what makes us uniquely human? In this final episode of Season 1, we speak with the so-called \"sage of Silicon Valley,\" Yuval Noah Harari, about humanity's future. We try out technology that claims to deliver on a miracle, and we meet the source of several new innovations being created by people normally left out of the laboratory.  In this episode: Professor <a href=\"https://ynharari.com/\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>, <a href=\"http://robots.stanford.edu/\">Sebastian Thrun</a> of Google X and Kitty Hawk, <a href=\"https://www.futureofsex.org/\">Bryony Cole</a> of Future of Sex, musician <a href=\"https://www.noemusic.net/\">Noe Socha</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.neurobio.pitt.edu/faculty/schwartz.htm\">Dr. Andy Schwartz</a> of the University of Pittsburgh.  Special thanks to <a href=\"https://forward.com/\">The Forward</a>, and <a href=\"https://makeitallwork.com/\">Make It All Work</a>. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
