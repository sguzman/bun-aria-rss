  "description": "Part I of our interview with outspoken venture capitalist and entrepreneur Chamath Palihapitiya ruffled some feathers...consider that the pregame to today’s Part II.\nIn this episode, Chamath argues his thesis that “zombie companies” need to go six feet under for the rest of the economy to stay alive and well—especially in the middle of today’s pandemic and recession. He explains...\n\nWhy stock buybacks and monetary mismanagement deserve more than a slap on the wrist\n\nHow the government needs to reconsider the incentives it offers companies to create a more sustainable version of capitalism\n\nAnd while he’s at it, Chamath draws apt connections between luck and hard work. \nCome for the deep analysis of government intervention in companies deemed too big to fail, stay for Chamath’s assertion that the U.S. economy needs billionaires like the NBA needs LeBron James.\nListen now and let us know what you think. And if you missed Part I, go check that out, too.",
