  "description": "<p>This weeks review is episode 1340 John Nores and 1341 Steven Rinella.</p>\n <p>John was a fish and game warden that ended up tackling cartel marijuana grows on national lands and was first on Joe's radar from going on Steve's MeatEater podcast so these two go hand in hand. It's so messed up what is going on with these grows and very brave of these officers to tackle it with limited resources.</p>\n <p>Here is the wolf video we talk about. Please watch it and message us with comments..Â <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ysa5OBhXz-Q\">https://youtu.be/ysa5OBhXz-Q</a></p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
