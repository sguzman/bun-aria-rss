From small rodents like mice and rats to behemoths like elephants and whales, mammals are found in all kinds of shapes and sizes, occupying numerous environmental niches. This rich grouping of animals comprises a vast network of different lineages and in this video I want to explain the origins and the spread of mammals. As such this video will be broken up into two parts: in the first I will cover the evolution of mammals, and in the second Iâ€™ll be going over the major extant orders and explaining every living mammalian family.\n\nImage Credits:\nWillemSVDMerwe\nJulio Lacerda\n\nSources:\nHandbook of the Mammals of the World\nSteve Brusatte\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AnimalOrigins",
