  "description": "<p>On any given workday, the average person in our modern world devotes about 50% of their waking hours to work. That’s a lot of time investment. And, believe it or not, this time investment has huge implications on your health, happiness, and longevity.</p> <p>Today we’re talking about how our work influences our health. Plus, more importantly, we’re covering specific ways that you can adjust your work (or perception of your work) to enable you to get more joy, health, and success out of the thing you likely will spend half of your waking hours doing.</p> <p>Today’s world is very different from the one our family member’s lived in just a couple generations ago. We live at a time of instant access to virtually everything. We live at a time of greater connection to people all over the world. And we live of more opportunity than ever to do work that we are deeply connected to. That’s why I thought our guest Chris Ducker would be the best person to help share these insights with you. He’s experienced the whole gamut of work experiences… from corporate work to being an incredibly successful entrepreneur, to experiencing a nearly tragic level of burnout that could have cost him everything.</p> <p>Through all of this Chris found out that the work you do really comes down to YOU. And you are the secret ingredient to creating a thriving work life that makes you an abundant living and makes a major difference in the world, should you choose to embrace it. It’s time to banish burnout and create the life you love.
