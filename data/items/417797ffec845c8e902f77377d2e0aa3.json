  "description": "Settler Jamaica in the 1750s: A Social Portrait (University of Virginia Press, 2016) is the most recent work from distinguished historian Jack Greene. Using a treasure trove of records from the middle of the eighteenth century, Greene paints in incredible detail a societal picture of Britain’s wealthiest Caribbean colony. Greene finds much more social and economic diversity in Jamaica than traditional accounts suggest. He is also able to trace the specific contours of slavery, landed wealth, and plantation characteristics in each of the island’s regions. For scholars of the eighteenth-century Caribbean, the book is an invaluable study of a key moment in one of the principal locations of the West Indies.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
