  "description": "When our child is kicking or biting someone, our first thought is probably, \"How do I protect the other person?!\" But here's something to consider: We also need to protect our child from associating their bad behavior with being a bad kid. In this episode, Dr. Becky advises three parents on how to respond to aggressive behavior while keeping everyone safe. She walks through distancing \"the urge\" from \"the action,\" emotionally vaccinating kids for frustrating moments, and enforcing boundaries instead of punishments. In every situation, she gently reminds each caller that they're a good parent with a good kid. \n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
