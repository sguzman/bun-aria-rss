  "title": "72  - The Colonial Devastation of Africa",
  "description": "<p>Before this week I knew very little about Africa’s history. It’s a continent of many nations, nations whose boundaries and governments are near constantly in some state of transition. It’s a beautiful continent rich in wildlife, natural resources, and culture but suffering under perpetual war, famine, and chaos. There are currently 15 African countries experiencing either war or post war tension. Why? Well, turns out the trouble has a lot to do with good ol’ fashioned European imperialism. We know something about that here in America. It’s how our own nation was formed. So let’s learn more about the continent you, in all likelihood, know less about than other continents - Africa. Africa’s history is fascinating - and we explore much of it today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>You can now <strong>signup to become a Space Lizard!!!</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast\">https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast</a> .
