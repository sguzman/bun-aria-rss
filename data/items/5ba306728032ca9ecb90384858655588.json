  "title": "Deep Dive: How Do We Respond to a Child’s Pretend Weapon Play?",
  "description": "What do you do when your child pretends to have a gun? First, take a deep breath. There's nothing wrong with your child, and this doesn't mean they want to harm anyone. Young kids often go through a phase of pretending to have weapons as a way of exploring big ideas like good and bad, power, control, and more. In this Deep Dive episode, Dr. Becky talks with parents Nina and Tom, whose three-year-old recently pointed his finger at his parents and said \"Pish! Pish!\" She explains what's going on underneath pretend gun play, and models actionable strategies and scripts for responding in the moment. The three also discuss how to navigate delicate conversations around gun safety with kids, and why it's important to differentiate between pretend guns and real guns.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
