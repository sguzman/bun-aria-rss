  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Feeling defeated by last week’s overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court? As an antidote to the bad news, we share this origin story from Author, Psychotherapist, Kinkster, Sex Radical and Ethical Slut, Dossie Easton. This story was told at Dossie’s Story Toast in 2019, where we celebrated both her 75th birthday and the 50th Anniversary of *this*, Dossie’s life-changing trip to a new sexually empowered version of feminism. Gather your strength and be inspired by Dossie’s true tale as we prepare to challenge what’s next. #WorkToDo #TooIntelligent #TooOutspoken #TooStrong #TheRiddleOfTheUniverse</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Unstoppable’ (Sia)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Dossie Easton, a long time player on the San Francisco S/M scene, is co-author with Janet Hardy of The Ethical Slut, The Bottoming and Topping Books, and Radical Ecstasy:  SM Journeys to Transcendence.  </strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Dossie is a psychotherapist working with individuals, couples and more in her private practice in San Francisco, with a particular interest in how S/M journeys into Shadow can bring old wounds into the healing light of consciousness and and give them a shot of life force in the form of good hot sex. </strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>An active sex radical since 1961, Dossie was a member of the first Board of Directors of the Society of Janus in San Francisco in 1974, and active with SFSI from 1973 to 1985. Currently she makes her home in the mountains north of San Francisco, travels to teach at conferences all over the world, and wanders through the mountains around her home declaiming filthy poetry to the vultures.
