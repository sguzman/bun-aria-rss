  "description": "In today's podcast we hear how Meltdown and Spectre have put the fear of hardware flaws into enterprises everywhere. No family of systems can be safely assumed to be immune. Most are positively identified as vulnerable. Proofs-of-concept show that remote attacks exploiting chips' speculative execution features are feasible. India's Aadhaar national identification database is compromised. Justin Harvey from Accenture with his outlook on 2018. Guest is Dinah Davis from Code.likeagirl.io and Arctic Wolf Networks. We’re discussing trade shows and conferences, and the importance of having diverse panels. Cryptocurrency speculative mania continues.",
