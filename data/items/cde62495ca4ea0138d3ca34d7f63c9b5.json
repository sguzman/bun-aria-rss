  "description": "<p>Everyone has bone; a skeleton. And while this may not bring everyone together in the current political and social climate, it does group us all as targets for the milk industry. Today on Las Culturistas, Matt Rogers & Bowen Yang discuss 90's Milk culture, Calcium culture, and the \"Got Milk?\" phenomenon that saw every A-list actor of the time posing with a little milk stain on their lips, as if to say, \"I've just consumed milk and would like more.\" A revolutionary marketing campaign for the culture, our hosts grapple with how they consumed milk as a result of these ads, and discuss how they affected them and their milk-consuming habits, even today. Matt makes a shocking revelation about the contents of his college mini-fridge, and Bowen wonders if the \"Got Milk?\" phenomenon was successful in its endeavor to \"cure osteoporosis\" aka the coronavirus of its day. All this, and a detour into Nintendo culture that can only be described as \"completely off theme for the episode\". Got Milk? No. But we DO got this episode, bitch.
