  "description": "Missing 411. North America. One man's research shows that for more than a century, people have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances across North America. Now, author David Paulides brings some of these cases, previously recounted in his series of books, to living rooms in the form of his Missing 411 documentary. Made with the help of his son, Benjamin, they profile five separate, mysterious incidents involving children. When a person goes missing there is a search effort to locate them. But national parks and even forests can make such searches difficult. Adding to these difficulties are the questions that remain long after a person's remains are located. How did a child disappear when surrounded by family? How and why did they end up 12 miles away and a half a day later with no explanation of how they could have traversed such difficult, mountainous terrain on their own? We interview David about why he got involved in researching these disappearances as well as what can be done to understand why they are happening and possibly prevent them.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
