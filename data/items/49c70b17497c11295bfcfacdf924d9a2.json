    "media:description": "Every October, it's a tradition to watch the original John Carpenter's Halloween, but what about the horror movies the characters are watching in Halloween? It's a familiar trope, the movie within the movie, something to compliment what's actually happening in the film. It could be a tribute to the movies the director grew up, but could there be more of a reason why these movies are on the TV? Is there a reason why Carpenter chose The Thing (1951), Forbidden Planet, and Night of the Living Dead specifically, or, was it all at random? That's what I'm investigating today! \n\nFollow James:\nhttps://twitter.com/cinemassacre\n\nFor everything else Cinemassacre:\nhttps://cinemassacre.com/\n\n#Halloween #Halloween1978 #JohnCarpenter #JamesRolfe",
