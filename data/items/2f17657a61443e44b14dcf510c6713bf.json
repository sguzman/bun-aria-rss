  "description": "<p>Graduating Oberline, Alix Spiegel landed in Chicago and stumbled upon a help-wanted ad that would lead to an internship with soon-to-be-legendary radio producer, Ira Glass. A year later, Spiegel became one of the founding producers of This American Life, where she, Ira, and a small, devoted team would change the face of public radio, storytelling, journalism, and, eventually podcasting. She eventually left to work on NPR's Science Desk for a decade and build more of a life outside radio. Then, January 2015, Spiegel joined forces with journalist Lulu Miller to co-host Invisibilia, a series from NPR about the unseen forces that control human behavior — our ideas, beliefs, assumptions, and thoughts. Invisibilia interweaves personal stories with fascinating psychological and brain science, in a way that ultimately makes you see your own life differently. Her work on human behavior has also appeared in <em>The New Yorker magazine</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>You can find Alix&nbsp;Spiegel at: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Invisibilia</a> : https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
