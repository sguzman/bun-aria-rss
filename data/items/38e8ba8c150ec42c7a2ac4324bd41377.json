  "content:encoded": "<p>The title of the workshop is Bayesian Methods for the Social Sciences, so it makes sense to ask what&#8217;s so special about the social sciences.</p>\n<p>At first I was thinking of comparing the social sciences to the natural sciences, but I think that social sciences such as political science, economics, and sociology have a lot in common with biological sciences and medicine, along with in-between sciences such as psychology:  all of these are characterized by high variability, measurement challenges, and difficulty in matching scientific theories to mathematical or statistical models.</p>\n<p>So I decided that the more interesting comparison is to the <em>physical sciences</em>, where variability tends to be lower, or at least better behaved (for example, shot noise or Brownian motion).  In the social sciences, statistical models&#8212;Bayesian or otherwise&#8212;have a lot more subjectivity, a lot more researcher degrees of freedom.  In theory, Bayesian inference should work for any problem, but it has a different flavor when our models can be way off and there can be big gaps between actual measurements and the goals of measurements.</p>\n<p>So I think there will be lots to say on this topic.  I&#8217;m hoping the conf will be in French so that I&#8217;m forced to speak slowly.</p>\n",
