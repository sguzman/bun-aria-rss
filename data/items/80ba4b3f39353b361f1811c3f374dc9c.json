  "description": "What fueled Donald Trump’s election? In Troll Nation: How The Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set On Rat-F*cking Liberals, America, and Truth Itself (Hot Books, 2018), Salon senior political writer Amanda Marcotte argues it was not a principled conservatism but burning desire by right-wing trolls to annoy liberals. Marcotte observes how Trump successfully positioned himself as a warrior against political correctness, while she also challenges the notion that liberals use allegations of bigotry to shut down dialogue. She charges that the infamous Access Hollywood tape did not derail the Trump campaign because sexual harassment is a form of trolling. And she argues that the troll mindset continues to shape how the Trump White House governs. Troll Nation explores several facets of the ongoing culture war, including race, gender guns and the environment. And the book discusses why trolls are attracted to conspiracy theories. Marcotte gives a bracing assessment of why the 2016 election did not turn out as many expected.\n\n\n\nBill Scher  is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine.
