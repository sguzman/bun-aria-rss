  "description": "Tonight, my special guest is Dr. Jaap Van Etten who's here to discuss the book about the power of Crystal Skulls. Get his book.\nCrystal skulls invoke a sense of mystery. What was their role in ancient times? Are they important for us in current times? Can they assist us on our spiritual journey? How? Although much has been written about them, many questions still linger. This book addresses many of these lingering questions on practical, subtle-energy, and spiritual levels. \nThis long-awaited sequel to Crystal Skulls: Interacting with a Phenomenon weaves practical information on crystal skulls with meditations to provide a deeper understanding of the role of crystal skulls in expanding the consciousness of individuals and humankind as a whole. \nFilled with useful guidance for both beginners and those who have worked with crystal skulls for long periods of time, Crystal Skulls: Expand Your Consciousness addresses essential issues: what material crystal skulls should be made from, what size to choose, how to clean them, and what to do with them. The most important part of the book addresses awakening the potential of a crystal skull. Learn about the energies of these awakened crystal skulls and the effects they have on the spiritual development of individuals and the collective consciousness of humanity. \nThis book invites you on a journey of awakening the potential of your crystal skulls -- and consequently awakening yourself. Several meditations are given to support this journey along with descriptions of the known ancient and old crystal skulls, making this book a \"must have\" for anyone interested in crystal skulls and in the journey of spiritual development.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Twitter @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Pinterest pinterest.com/mysteriousradio\nLike us on Facebook Facebook.com/mysteriousradio\nVisit our website: https://www.mysteriousradio.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
