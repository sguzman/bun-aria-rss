  "description": "Histories of seventeenth-century Quakerism have far too often emphasized social and political factors as the agents of development and change. While the Quakers were not in a vacuum and persecution was a real challenge, Madeleine Pennington draws attention to a more fundamental agent of change in Quaker belief and practice: theological pressure. In Quakers, Christ, and The Enlightenment (Oxford UP, 2021), Pennington takes seriously Quaker's doctrinal and intellectual engagement with other Christian traditions in the turbulent revolutionary and restoration period of the seventeenth century. She explores the metaphysical implications of Christology in the broader landscape of Post-Reformation theological exchanges, and how early Quakers conformed and delineated their developing religious culture. Madeleine Pennington is head of research for Theos Think Tank and on Twitter (@mlmpennington).\nRyan David Shelton (@ryoldfashioned) is a social historian of British and American Protestantism and a PhD researcher at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
