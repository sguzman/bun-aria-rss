  "description": "<div> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Dear Gabby we pick people completely at random—we don’t have any information about where they are, who they are, what their questions might be. What's really interesting about this episode is that on this particular recording day, each of these women came on to speak on behalf of the same topic—unspoken shame. This was no accident. The Universe will always hook us up with what we need. The guests on this episode are brave souls who came forward to voice unspoken shame surrounding trauma, sexual abuse and mental illness. I hope this episode serves you greatly.
