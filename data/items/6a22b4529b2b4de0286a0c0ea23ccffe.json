Baseball playoffs are heating up and some of the Dodgers aren't even trying. A couple NBA over/unders that are guaranteed winners and a mini season preview. Hot Seat/Cool Throne. Bill Burr joins the show to talk about his upcoming show at MSG, why we care too much about sports, his favorite College venues across the country, why we've all been the guy he witnessed getting kicked out of bar Sunday for being angry at the Football game, and some conspiracy theories that only the wokest can understand. Hmmm for Coach K and Zion Williamson, Witch Hunt are the Astros cheating. Embrace Debate is Nick Bosa a Quitter and Guys on Chicks.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
