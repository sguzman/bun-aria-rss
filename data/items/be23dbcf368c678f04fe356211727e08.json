  "description": "The Holy Grail: The greatest legendary item of all time and the focal point of the Arthurian legends. This is its origin. Beginning as the humble cup of a crucified savior, the Grail will take on legendary status. We'll see how it moved from Jerusalem to a far-flung province on the edge of the world, and we'll meet the people tasked with protecting it, whose great, great, great, great grandchildren will become the heroes of the Arthurian legends. This is a Grail story unlike any you've ever heard. This is where it all begins. -- Sponsors: Wolverine: The Long Night - check out this fantastic podcast at http://wolverinepodcast.com Blue Apron!
