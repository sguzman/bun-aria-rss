  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO Radio Host Brian Mudd fills in for Mark. There are now 320% more immigrants in the U.S since Biden took office. This equates to more than the population of 15 states. Yet Vice President Kamala Harris, our Border Czar, says the border is secure and the media wants to call Gov. Ron DeSantis a kidnapper. Then, the uncontrolled border has become an industry with people being trafficked and smuggled into Mexico just to trek across the Rio Grande River into the U.S. The San Antonio Sheriff is very concerned about the 48 migrants that flew to Martha's Vineyard but said nothing about the 53 dead migrants that perished as they were smuggled across Biden's open border in the back of a hot truck in San Antonio. Later, President Biden has expanded Title IX protections for boys to have access to girls' bathrooms and locker rooms. These issues have to be addressed and corrected. Afterward, former White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro joins the show to discuss his new book, Taking Back Trump's America: Why We Lost the White House and How We'll Win It Back\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Taking-Back-Trumps-America-White/dp/1637586787\nLearn more about your ad choices.
