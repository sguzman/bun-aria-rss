  "content:encoded": "<h4>Not only did the use of “woke” increase by 50%, but politics and social issues were also at the forefront of conversation this year</h4><p>Sure, December is a time for loving (<a href=\"https://theblog.okcupid.com/what-it-means-if-your-date-is-obsessed-with-the-holidays-fe1f11ddac9\">or loathing</a>) the holidays — but it’s also a time for reflection, looking back on the year that’s passed and asking yourself “what the hell?” Because let’s be real: 2017 was insane — and many of the things that made it insane, from covfefe to North Korea, were hot topics on OkCupid.</p><p>When we reflect on the year gone by at OkCupid, we look to our users. What were they talking about in 2017? What became less important to them this year, and what became more so? To find out, we skimmed nearly 20 million user profiles to discover what they were writing about most in 2016 compared to 2017. And here’s the thing: despite a year riddled with bad news, 2017 produced some good news as well. Because we found that daters got woke in 2017. First of all, they got woke literally — though you (understandably) may be rolling your eyes that we’re actually using “woke” in a (somewhat?) scientific piece, use of <strong>woke</strong> in user profiles increased 50% this year. More importantly, however, they actually got woke: political terms, and words and phrases associated with social causes, saw an impressive increase in usage this year.</p><h4>Politics</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AeDtMk4UeUPOHi5fgWFWIg.png\" /><figcaption>At least on OkCupid, Democrat beat out Republican in 2017.</figcaption></figure><p>Politics were <a href=\"https://theblog.okcupid.com/https-theblog-okcupid-com-2016-review-on-flirting-1bddb9a24dc0\">a hot topic of conversation between matches last year</a>, but this year’s political mentions eclipsed those of 2016. Mentions of <strong>politics</strong> increased by over 26%, with usage of <strong>Republican</strong> increasing 28% and <strong>Democrat</strong> growing 38%.</p><p><strong>Trump</strong> may be happy to know that his name’s appearance increased by 20%. It might be because he had everyone worried — <strong>nuclear</strong> increased by 33% and <strong>North Korea</strong> mentions rocketed (too soon?) by 63%. But <strong>covfefe </strong>was the political term, if you can call it that, with the greatest increase in mentions at 90%. Yes, this means that a handful of special daters — psychics, perhaps — wrote “covfefe” in their profiles <em>before</em> the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/covfefe-trump-twitter.html\">infamous tweet</a>.</p><h4>Gender Equality</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2oA2sNq1s94hgfbkrHgEsg.png\" /><figcaption>Something to be proud of: women’s rights were a big focus this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/womens-march.html\">Women’s March</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/the-movement-of-metoo/542979/\">#MeToo</a>, the <a href=\"http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/\">Silence Breakers</a> — gender equality, or is often the case, inequality — has been a major topic of conversation this year, from international news to OkCupid profiles. After the Women’s March, we saw an increase in photos captioned “Women’s March,” and daters were increasingly more likely to state their views on gender issues in their profiles: from 2016 to 2017, <strong>feminist</strong> increased by 26%, <strong>nasty woman</strong> by 66%, and <strong>women’s rights</strong> by 73%. This is a trend we can definitely get behind, and we hope the conversation continues to grow — both online and off — in 2018.</p><h4>TV Shows</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SmwF3d7L4muDz0Y15RFJ_w.png\" /><figcaption>Is this trend an indicator that GoT will one day be irrelevant? Photos sourced from Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>OkCupid users got woke this year — but they’re human, so they also binged on Netflix, HBO and CW. <strong>Riverdale</strong> is a new show for 2017, so it’s no surprise that its usage skyrocketed (by 90%) now that the daters talking about it aren’t just those who live in the Bronx, love the Bronx, or have visited the Bronx. <strong>Stranger Things</strong> held onto some staying power with an increase of 54%, simultaneously knocking <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> down a notch — GoT still saw an increase in mentions, but by a meager 14%.</p><h4>Celebrities</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0KIIWJj4raldygi6EqkUqQ.png\" /><figcaption>Blake Shelton may be People’s Sexiest Man Alive, but at least OkCupid users were over the country crooner this year.

Take <strong>Clooney</strong>, for example: despite the fact that he hasn’t been crowned People’s Sexiest Man Alive since 2006, mentions of his name grew 18% whereas 2017’s Sexiest Man Alive, <strong>Blake Shelton,</strong> actually saw a decrease in mentions, dropping nearly 40%. Ouch. At least he can say he’s in good company: <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> mentions fell 10%, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> fell 19% and the <strong>Kardashian</strong> fam took a hit with 17% fewer mentions in 2017.</p><p>As far as the kings of comedy, <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> stole the late-night crown from <strong>Fallon</strong>, who reigned in 2016 — mentions of Fallon dropped by over 50% whereas Colbert increased by nearly 30%. <strong>Kimmel</strong> remains in third place, but he nonetheless saw a small boost.</p><h4>Dating</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KTAjYxY4PQ_AcalirXGT1Q.png\" /><figcaption>R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</figcaption></figure><p>And now to the part we really care about: dating*. Dating has seen some shifts this year, and we say mostly for the better. Get ready to cue the <em>awww</em>s, because we saw <strong>love</strong> increase in mentions by 13%, which is a lot when you consider how frequently it was used last year, too. <strong>Devotion</strong> also increased by 13%, <strong>passion</strong> by 22%, and <strong>meaningful relationship</strong> by 25%. It probably warms our hearts most, though, that <strong>respect</strong> increased by 19% — a step in the right direction.</p><h4>So what’s the takeaway?</h4><p>Our consensus: turns out, 2017 really wasn’t so bad! Some bad things may have happened (yes, we’re talking about Trump), but the world kept turning and daters kept dating. And we found that, this year more than ever, daters were connecting over things that really mattered to them — like women’s rights, respect, and even George Clooney. In fact, nearly 90 million of these connections have been made in 2017 so far, so we’d definitely say it was a good year — at least a good year for love.</p><p><em>*Just kidding, we do really care about dating, but more importantly how dating relates to the things you care about most.
