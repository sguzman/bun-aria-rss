  "description": "While the people of Hawaii were terrified by an errant alert indicating an incoming ballistic missile attack, the rest of the country remained frightened by what would happen even if there were not such an attack.  Judging from Donald Trump's plans for nuclear weapons and his temperament, of course, the risk of going without further such scares decreases daily.  On this episode of Deep State Radio, Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and David Sanger discuss why putting a couple books on your head won't improve your nuclear posture and, of course, shitholes.  Lots of discussion of shitholes.  Shitholes as far as the eye can see.
