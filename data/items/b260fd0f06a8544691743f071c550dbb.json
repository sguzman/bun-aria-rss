Last, editor of the Bulwark, talked with Mike about the then recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the potential political fallout. Last walks through some of the nightmare scenarios, and then he explains that although he remains optimistic with regards to the legitimacy of the SCOTUS, he is ultimately losing faith that some voters care not for a system of governance that is capable of functioning competently.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
