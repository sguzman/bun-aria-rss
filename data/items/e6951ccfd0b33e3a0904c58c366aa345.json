  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, is President Biden uniting the country by celebrating indigenous people's day or by claiming that unemployment went down since more Americans have opted out of the labor force and joined the welfare state? All while citizens are losing their jobs because of mandates? Biden and the Democrats are subsidizing big government, spending your tax dollars recklessly, weakening our economy, and lifting sanctions on Iranian missile producers and that was just today. Then, the battle of over critical race theory continues as more parents attend school board meetings to criticize Biden's push to silence their speech by saying it's 'violence.' Later, Marc Elias and his gang of Pennsylvania attorneys succeeded in usurping the federal Constitution in the 2020 election through filing lawsuits and friendly judges ruling favorably in their favor. This negates Pennsylvania's state Constitution because changes to election law can only come from the legislature or a change in the state's Constitution - not from the State's Supreme Court. The lawsuit to prevent this from happening again in the future has been brought again because the US Supreme Court refused to even hear the case back in 2020. This case isn't about former President Trump or reversing past elections, it has to do with protecting future elections from activist judges. Afterward, Biden's policies are hurting America because coal and natural gas are used to make electricity. With crude oil at the highest cost per barrel since 2014, the country is facing a serious problem of deindustrialization. Limiting our own access to natural resources preventing America from producing its way out of this problem that was engineered by Biden and the Democrats.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
