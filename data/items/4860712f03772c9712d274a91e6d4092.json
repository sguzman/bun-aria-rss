  "description": "<p>The Island Hotel and Restaurant that is located on Cedar Key in Florida was originally made to be a general store and it was built to last. The building material that was used was Tabby, which is a mixture of oyster shells, sand and limestone, and the structure has lasted 155 years. The building has survived severe weather, the Civil War, fire, passing through the hands of many owners, a stint as a brothel, foreclosure and death. It would seem that the spirits of many who have passed through the doors have survived as well. Island Hotel is not only one of the better known hotels in Florida, but it has a reputation of being haunted. The actual number of haunts seems to be thirteen ghosts.The Moment in Oddity features surviving lightning strikes and This Day in History features publication of the Book of Mormon.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures are here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-ep-36-island-hotel-and.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-ep-36-island-hotel-and.html</a></p>",
