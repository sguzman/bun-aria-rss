  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the election integrity legislation in Georgia is designed to make it harder to cheat and contrary to the lies in the media has nothing to do with racism. Don't allow the left to drag you into the hell that they've created. On January 6th, 2005 Democrats claimed that electronic voting machines had changed votes taking them from the Democrats and giving them to the Republicans. Thirty-one Members of Congress, including J6 Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, objected to the counting of the electoral votes in an attempt to change the outcome of a presidential election. In fact, Democrats have done it to the past three Republicans to win the presidency. Yet the media won't dare call them election deniers. Then, the media easily forgets the violence of Democrats rioting during the inauguration of Donald Trump or the violence following the Republican National Committee outside the White House. Democrats are never held accountable like the people that committed violence on January 6th. Later, President Biden was asked why he was releasing 15 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and lied like he always does. Afterward, Blake Masters joins the show to explain that Sen. Mark Kelly chose to leave the border open instead of acting in support of Arizonans. Masters says that Kelly is just a rubber stamp for Biden, Schumer, and Pelosi.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
