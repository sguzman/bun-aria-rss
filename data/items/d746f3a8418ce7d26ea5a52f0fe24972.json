Besides the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro phones, we wanted to showcase two of\n  the latest form factors: the Google Pixel Tablet<sup>1</sup> (Google's brand\n  new tablet, coming in 2023), and the latest device powered with Wear OS by\n  Google: the Google Pixel Watch! As consumers begin to<a\n    href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/google_pixel_watch?hl=en-US\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n  >\n    preorder the watch</a\n  >, it's an especially great time to prepare your app so it looks great on all\n  of the new watches that consumers will get their hands on over the holidays.\n  Discover the latest updates to Wear OS, how apps like yours are upgrading\n  their experiences, and how you can get started building a beautiful, efficient\n  Wear OS app.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Here’s What’s New in Wear OS</h3>\n<p>\n  The Google Pixel Watch is built on Wear OS and includes the latest updates to\n  the platform,&nbsp;Wear OS 3.5. This version of Wear OS is also available on\n  some of your other favorite Wear OS devices!&nbsp;The new Wear OS experience\n  is designed to feel fluid and easy to navigate, bringing users the information\n  they need with a tap, swipe, or voice command. With a refreshed UI and rich\n  notifications, your users can see even more at a glance.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n  <a\n    href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWj4C2qWdTfHtZS11SKHgE2rae404ImVR7gaXjZarO9aUYkvJR0LNbzR3r2OWajQIlu2W7_b7xz09lw_bqLVLwLBG_BcuZzg0s6nkJ8UIxzAz0ETcoAJVseLURltDI_rhhBSmcQ5Xu4FyeCR5mfZO1WQ-WZUNPCzBkxH96vAezjp3Szyb_8cqVIGip/s1600/image1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"\n    ><img\n      alt=\"\"\n      border=\"0\"\n      data-original-height=\"1999\"\n      data-original-width=\"1999\"\n      height=\"400\"\n      src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWj4C2qWdTfHtZS11SKHgE2rae404ImVR7gaXjZarO9aUYkvJR0LNbzR3r2OWajQIlu2W7_b7xz09lw_bqLVLwLBG_BcuZzg0s6nkJ8UIxzAz0ETcoAJVseLURltDI_rhhBSmcQ5Xu4FyeCR5mfZO1WQ-WZUNPCzBkxH96vAezjp3Szyb_8cqVIGip/w400-h400/image1.png\"\n      width=\"400\"\n  /></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  To take advantage of building on top of all of these new features, earlier\n  this year we released\n  <a\n    href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/compose\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    >Compose for Wear OS</a\n  >, our modern\n  <a\n    href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    >declarative</a\n  >\n  UI toolkit designed to help you get your app running with fewer development\n  hours - and fewer lines of code. It's built from the bottom up with Kotlin,\n  and it moved to\n  <a\n    href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/07/compose-for-wear-os-10-stable.html\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    >1.0</a\n  >\n  earlier this year, meaning the API is stable and ready for you to get\n  building. Here's what's in the 1.0 release:\n</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <li>\n    <strong>Material:</strong> The Compose Material catalog for Wear OS already\n    offers more components than are available with View-based layouts. The\n    components follow material styling and also implement material theming,\n    which allows you to customize the design for your brand.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Declarative:</strong> Compose for Wear OS leverages Modern Android\n    Development and works seamlessly with other Jetpack libraries. Compose-based\n    UIs in most cases result in less code and accelerate the development process\n    as a whole.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Interoperable:</strong> If you have an existing Wear OS app with a\n    large View-based codebase, it's possible to gradually adopt Compose for Wear\n    OS by using the Compose Interoperability APIs rather than having to rewrite\n    the whole codebase.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Handles different watch shapes:</strong> Compose for Wear OS extends\n    the foundation of Compose, adding a DSL for all curved elements to make it\n    easy to develop for all Wear OS device shapes: round, square, or rectangular\n    with minimal code.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Performance:</strong> Each Compose for Wear OS library ships with\n    its own baseline profiles that are automatically merged and distributed with\n    your app’s APK and are compiled ahead of time on device. In most cases, this\n    achieves app performance for production builds that is on-par with\n    View-based apps. However, it’s important to know how to configure, develop,\n    and test your app’s performance for the best results.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Another exciting update for Wear OS is the launch of the\n  <a\n    href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/08/wear-os-tiles-material-library-build-tiles-fast.html\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    >Tiles Material library</a\n  >\n  to help you build tiles more quickly. The Tiles Material Library includes\n  pre-built Material components and layouts that embrace the latest Material\n  Design for Wear OS. This easy to use library includes components for buttons,\n  progress arcs and more - saving you the time of building them from scratch.\n  Plus, with the pre-built layouts, you can kickstart your tiles development\n  knowing your layout follows\n  <a\n    href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/design/tiles\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    >Material design guidelines</a\n  >\n  on how your tiles should be formatted.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finally, in the recently released<a\n    href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/09/android-studio-dolphin.html\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n  >\n    Android Studio</a\n  >\n  Dolphin, we added a range of Wear OS features to help get your apps, tiles,\n  and watch faces ready for all of the Wear OS 3 devices.

For example, Google Home’s latest updates users can easily control\n  their smart home devices through the Wear OS app or by saying “Hey Google” to\n  their watch to do everything from adjusting the thermostat to getting\n  notifications from their Nest doorbell when a person or package at the\n  door<sup>2</sup>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Health and fitness apps have a lot of opportunity with the latest Wear OS\n  platform and hardware updates. Google Pixel Watch includes Fitbit’s amazing\n  health and fitness features, including accurate heart rate tracking&nbsp;with\n  on-device machine learning and deep optimization down to the processor\n  level.&nbsp;Users can get insights into key metrics like breathing rate, heart\n  rate variability, sleep quality and more right on their Google Pixel Watch.\n  With this improved data, there are more opportunities for health and fitness\n  apps to provide meaningful insights and experiences for their users.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The updates and improvements from Wear OS and the Google Pixel Watch make\n  building differentiated app experiences more tangible.
