  "description": "<p>A Charged harmonic oscillator in a magnetic field, Landau problems, and an\noscillator in a noncommutative space, share the same mathematical structure in\ntheir Hamiltonians. We have considered a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic\noscillator (AHO) with arbitrarily time-dependent parameters (effective mass and\nfrequencies), placed in an arbitrarily time-dependent magnetic field. A class\nof quadratic invariant operators (in the sense of Lewis and Riesenfeld) have\nbeen constructed. The invariant operators ($\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}$) have been\nreduced to a simplified representative form by a linear canonical\ntransformation (the group $Sp(4, \\mathbb{R})$). An orthonormal basis of the\nHilbert space consisting of the eigenvectors of $\\hat{\\mathcal{I}}$ is\nobtained. In order to obtain the solutions of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation corresponding to the system, both the geometric and\ndynamical phase-factors are constructed. Peres-Horodecki Separability Criterion\nfor the bipartite coherent states corresponding to our system has been\ndemonstrated.\n</p>",
