  "description": "<p>In early April, the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office announced that they had solved and closed the 2002 disappearances of 20-year-old Angela Mack and her son, Thomas “Mikey” Rettew. Our last episode explored the dramatic turn of events in Angela and Mikey’s mysterious disappearances since we originally aired their story in March. Today, we’re continuing our dive into this incredible, still developing story. \"The Dead Man\" explores who Clarence Krusen was, his criminal history, and many attempts to adopt children from struggling parents. </p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://thredup.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thredup.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://Grove.co/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Grove Collaborative</a> - For a limited time, when&nbsp;my listeners go to <a href=\"http://Grove.co/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Grove.co/VANISHED</a><strong> </strong>you will get to choose a FREE gift&nbsp;with your first order of $30 or more.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
