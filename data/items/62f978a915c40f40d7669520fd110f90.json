  "description": "<p>This week's chat was inspired by Michael Neill's book \"Creating the Impossible.\" The book, which is subtitled \"A 90 Day Program&nbsp;to Get Your Dreams Out of Your Head and into the World,\" argues that we can accomplish more than we ever imagined without the constant stress and pressure associated with high achievement and asks \"what if creating what you want to see in the world isn’t dependent on believing in yourself, or even believing that it’s possible?\" In other words, if we get out of our own way, and stop telling ourselves something isn't possible, new possibilities and opportunities start to reveal themselves. In this episode, we discuss the idea of the mind as a \"virtual reality generator\" and explore what happens when we change the way we are thinking. If we allowed for the possibility that our wildest dreams might be attainable, how would we act differently? And what might unfold as a result?</p>\n<p>We also celebrate reaching dizzy heights on the Apple podcast charts and share our excitement about letting loose and making some bold moves on works-in-progress.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Mentioned: Michael Neill Creating the Impossible: <a href=\"https://www.michaelneill.org/ctibook/\">https://www.michaelneill.org/ctibook/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
