  "description": "<p>Within recent years, the field of nano-mechanics has diversified in a variety\nof applications, ranging from quantum information processing to biological\nmolecules recognition. Among the diversity of devices produced these days, the\nsimplest (but versatile) element remains the doubly-clamped beam: it can store\nvery large tensile stresses (producing high resonance frequencies $f_0$ and\nquality factors $Q$), is interfaceable with electric setups (by means of\nconductive layers), and can be produced easily in clean rooms (with scalable\ndesigns including multiplexing). Besides, its mechanical properties are the\nsimplest to describe. Resonance frequencies and $Q$s are being modeled, with as\nspecific achievement the ultra-high quality resonances based on ``soft\nclamping'' and ``phonon shields''. Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication\nundercut of the clamping regions of basic nano-beams produces a ``natural soft\nclamping'', given for free. We present the analytic theory that enables to fit\nexperimental data, which can be used for $\\{ Q , f_0 \\}$ design.\n</p>",
