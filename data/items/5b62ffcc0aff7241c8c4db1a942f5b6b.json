Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani&#8217;s Reliance is known for disrupting businesses with cut-throat price offerings. Jio, its telecoms unit, has been credited with upending the world&#8217;s no. 2 mobile market with cheap 4G data plans and free voice services in 2016. Last year, it followed that up with its 4G JioPhone that costs $81.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/reutersbest/article/reuters-reveals-indias-reliance-seeks-repeat-of-phone-success-with-184-laptop/\">Reuters reveals India&#8217;s Reliance seeks repeat of phone success with $184 laptop</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/\">Reuters News Agency</a>.</p>\n"
