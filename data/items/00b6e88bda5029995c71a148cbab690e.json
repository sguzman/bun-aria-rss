  "description": "<p>THIS EPISODE BROUGHT TO YOU EXCLUSIVELY BY THE NATIVE SOUNDThe vocalist from The Swellers, Nick Diener, is my guest on the show this week and I couldn't be more happy to bring you this raw and honest conversation. We speak about what it's like to break a band up, the transitions that he is going through in his own life and jealousy between bands (which is something very few bands/people discuss publicly). Nick was extremely gracious in sharing his thoughts and we deliberately let all of the coverage of The Swellers break-up subside before this episode was released. Please donate to the show!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
