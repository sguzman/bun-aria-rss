  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, What you’re watching with the Brett Kavanaugh hearings is the breakdown of the constitutional order in the United States Senate, respecting the Supreme Court. One of the main reasons that you see the obliteration of the confirmation process is because Kavanaugh has declared that he’s a constitutionalist. The enemy of the progressive statists, the enemy of the Democrat leadership in Washington, the enemy of the Democrat Senate members on the Judiciary Committee is the Constitution. That’s why they always talk about precedent, not the text of the Constitution. This battle is bigger than Kavanaugh – he’s just the latest causality. Also, the evisceration of our Constitutional system has led us into factions. As we examine Federalist 10, liberty is based on individualism not collectivism; it’s a circle of inalienable rights that surrounds us at birth. What we're seeing play out is the unmooring of our constitution, in effect its post-constitutionalism. We have elements in our society, like our courts, that have become much stronger than the founders intended. Then, the media are not only participants but they are leading the charge in character-assassination, in fact, The New York Times ran a negative story on the President's finances. The issue on the table is whether or not we're going to stand up to this. We need to show the left that 2016 was not an aberration it was a pattern! Finally, Steve Doocy from FOX & Friends calls in to discuss his new book, The Happy Cookbook: A Celebration of the Food That Makes America Smile.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
