  "description": "<p>The history of Boggo Road Gaol is both interesting and troubling. This history goes all the way back to the late 1800s when Brisbane was finally moving from a penal colony to a free community. Many violent offenders came to their ends at the gaol. Punishment was dealt out in the black hole. Conditions became so poor that reforms were necessary. Today, the gaol is a museum offering tours and there are stories of ghosts on the grounds. Join us as we share the history and hauntings of the Boggo Road Gaol! The Moment in Oddity features Rapunzel Syndrome and This Month in History features Jesse Owens born. Our location was suggested by Danika Ehlers and Natalie.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/09/hgb-ep-353-boggo-road-gaol.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>American Gods by Strike Audio</p>",
