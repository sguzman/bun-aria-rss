    "media:description": "In this video we look at the entire timeline of Chris Griffin from Family Guy. Created by Seth MacFarlane and voiced by Seth Green, we look at Chris Griffin's history, his entire life story, his past and future. Taking a look at the Family Guy cutaways, as well as Family Guy full episodes, I've put Chris life in chronological order. From season 1 to the newest Family Guy season. I look at his relationships with Peter and Lois Griffin, and being a brother to Meg and Stewie Griffin.\n\nWe also look at the funny Family Guy moments from Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Brian and Stewie Griffin. As well as other Family Guy characters from Quahog Rhode Island like Quagmire and Joe Swanson.\n\n#FamilyGuy #timeline  #familyguyclips #petergriffin #stewiegriffin #loisgriffin",
