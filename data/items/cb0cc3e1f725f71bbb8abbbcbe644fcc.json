  "description": "<p><strong>As a closeted, bi, teen atheist, it's a bummer your mom makes you go to a church &mdash; three times a week &mdash; that has a problem with your very existence.</strong> On top of this, she insists you're being overly dramatic about the depression, anxiety, and insomnia you experience every day. How do you even consider coming out to a mother who can't seem to empathize with your most basic needs?
