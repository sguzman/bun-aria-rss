  "description": "<div>Michael Bracewellâ€™s new book <em>Souvenir</em> is a vivid and poetic evocation of London on the brink of the digital era - the neglected in-between times between 1979 and 1986. He joins Sam Leith to talk about fine art and post-punk, T S Eliot and William Burroughs - and the dangerous lure of nostalgia.</div>\n",
