  "description": "Author Marlon James is following up <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> with a new fantasy novel <em>Moon Witch, Spider King</em>. It tells the same story as <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> but this time it's from the perspective of the character Sogolon as she hunts for a missing child. James is inviting the reader to question his narratives by telling the story twice but from different points of view. He told NPR's Michel Martin that the novels are non-linear in the tradition of African folklore.",
