  "description": "Bonsoir, Guten Abend, Buenas tardes, Buona sera! This is Mark from the Radio Lingua Network and I'm here to bring you some of the latest news about our language-learning materials.\n\nSince our last news podcast there have been quite a number of developments here at Radio Lingua. So much is happening we've decided to streamline our news a little and in addition to our news podcast which is released every month, we're now producing an email newsletter. If you'd like to sign up to the newsletter, visit www.radiolingua.com/mailinglist and add your details. In addition to keeping up to date with developments you'll also receive exclusive discount codes for our store.\n\nAt the beginning of this month the whole team was down in London at the Language Show. We thoroughly enjoyed the three-day event and were delighted to meet many of our listeners who had come along especially to say 'hello'. Some of our listeners even volunteered to have their photos taken, so visit our website and click on our new Photo Gallery to see these. Our iPod competition was won by Hannah Bond from Staffordshire. Hannah wins an iPod nano preloaded with our entire library of podcasts. Congratulations to Hannah.\n\nThis week, Kara and I were in Cardiff to collect a European Award for Languages in recognition of the success of Coffee Break Spanish. The European Award for Languages is a Europe-wide initiative supported by the European Commission which recognises innovative, effective and replicable approaches to language learning. The event was held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, and the award was presented by Isabella Moore, CEO of CILT, the National Centre for Languages. You can watch the video podcast we filmed during the day over on our YouTube Channel, that's at www.youtube.com/radiolingua\n\nFinally in tonight's news podcast I'm bringing you news of a new development for Radio Lingua: we're launching a brand new podcast tomorrow - that's Monday 27 November - which will teach you basic Polish in short weekly programmes. And when I say 'short' I mean short! Here's Ania to tell you more about 'One Minute Polish'.\n\nAnd that's it for this edition of Radio Lingua News. We'll be back soon with details of our Holiday sale in the store. In the meantime, thanks for listening!",
