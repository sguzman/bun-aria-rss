  "description": "Amy Sedaris had no plan of action for her career other than going to Chicago to do sketch comedy and going to New York to do plays with her brother David. And as she tells Marc, she still has no plan except for doing things that she finds fun. Amy and Marc talk about how that lack of planning  led to her early Comedy Central sketch show Exit 57, a collaborative partnership with Paul Dinello and Stephen Colbert that birthed Strangers with Candy, and a public persona that made her an ideal Letterman guest and the perfect driver for a faux-homemaking show like At Home with Amy Sedaris. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://cc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comedy Central</a>, <a href=\"http://hulu.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hulu</a>, <a href=\"http://capterra.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capterra</a> and <a href=\"http://aspiration.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aspiration</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
