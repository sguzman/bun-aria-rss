  "description": "Hong Gildong has been called the Korean Robin Hood, but really oversimplifies the story. It is both an awesome adventure tale with dragons, magic, assassins, demons, bandits, and betrayal, and a complex human drama, where one young man must find and understand his place in the world. It's both action-packed, and heartbreaking. The titular character, Gildong, was born a second-class citizen, and he was determined to make a way for himself in a world that kept pushing him down, even if that meant living outside the law. This is his story. The creature this time is the saalah, and they are what happens when a mommy genie and a daddy human (or the other way around) love each other very much. Loot crate is fantastic.
