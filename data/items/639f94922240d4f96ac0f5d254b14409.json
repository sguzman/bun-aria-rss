  "itunes:summary": "Our god-daughter’s second child, Hazy, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2015. Medically, her only hope was a matching donor. A young German man, who has to remain anonymous, sacrificially gave his bone marrow. Wonderfully, his donation saved Hazy’s life. Can you imagine what it would be like for Hazy to meet her donor?\n(Read more of Hazy’s story here.)\nIn an even more remarkable way, you can meet your blood donor. Jesus came ‘to give his life as a ransom for many’ (Mark 10:45). At the last supper, when Jesus took the cup, he said: ‘This is my blood of the covenant’ (Matthew 26:28; Mark 14:24). The ‘precious blood of Christ’ (1 Peter 1:19) is stressed throughout the whole New Testament:\n\nIt makes forgiveness possible (Colossians 1:14)\nIt purifies you from every sin (1 John 1:7)\nThrough it, you draw near to God (Ephesians 2:13)\nIt brings peace and reconciliation (Colossians 1:20)\nIt gives life (John 6:53)\nIt enables you to overcome Satan (Revelation 12:11).\n\nIn today’s passages, we see different aspects of what all of this means.",
