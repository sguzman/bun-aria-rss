  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 9/3/22",
  "description": "This week on The Mark Levin Show, while the establishment claims that Republican candidates are running on the unconstitutional raid at Mar-a-Lago it simply isn't true. Despite much talk about it, candidates must run on their records and against President Biden's. Lamentably, there is no establishment media for the conservative movement so 'We The People' must fight like we're behind, in order to win seats in Congress this November. President Biden will give a speech to explain how democracy is under attack, not by China, Iran, or Russia, but by conservative Republicans. This is from the same Joe Biden who has supported racist segregationists, tried to destroy the first black Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and denied the first Black woman nominated to the high court, Janice Rogers Brown. Clearly, Biden knows who is writing the history books so he's doing whatever he wants, and he doesn't care if he turns Americans against each other.  The DOJ filing defended their Mar-A-Lago search and the unauthorized removal of former President Trump's passports stating that it was necessary to stop the threat to national security posed by the three classified documents they found in Trump's desk. 'Hiding' documents on one's desk is the best way to hide them and commit obstruction, right? The DOJ and the media are working together to create much ado about nothing. In a move that can only be classified as truly \"California,\" the state asks residents not to charge electric vehicles, days after announcing gas car ban.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
