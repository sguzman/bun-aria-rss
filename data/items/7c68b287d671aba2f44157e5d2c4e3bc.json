In the popular culture of nations around the world, trees have often been considered “beings”, as is argued in detail in Haskell (2017).\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:37 - Trees Can Talk\n3:24 - Debate\n4:43 - Conclusion & Credits\n\n\nWritten and created by me\nArt & photography by kvd102\nMusic & additional graphics by me.\n\nTranslations:\nLeeuwe van den Heuvel - Dutch\nWand_Platte - German\n\n#trees #language",
