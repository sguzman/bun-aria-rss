  "description": "<p>In this episode of The Literary Life, Cindy and Angelina interview their long time friend and fellow reader, Kelly Cumbee. Kelly is a wife and homeschooling mother of seven who has given herself a highly literary education. Together they discuss how Kelly started reading at a very young age and the kinds of books she loved as a child. Kelly talks about her love for Edmund Spenser and how she began reading Spenser with her children. Angelina asks about Kelly's background and how she makes connections throughout her conversations and her reading. Another topic of conversation is how Kelly made time for books throughout the different seasons of life and how she didn't really start reading \"hard books\" until later in life. They wrap up the conversation discussing what Kelly is currently reading and with more encouragement to read widely and make connections.</p> <h3><a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/summer-of-the-short-story-links/\">Summer of the Short Story</a>:</h3> <p>Ep 11: \"Araby\" by James Joyce</p> <p>Ep 12: “A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls” by G.

So when I thinke to end that I begonne, I must begin and never bring to end: For with one looke she spils that long I sponne, And with one word my whole years work doth rend. Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd, Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd.     Book List: <p>(affiliate links)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RNwuyb\">A White Bird Flying</a></em> by Bess Streeter Aldrich</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xqdP1W\">Jayber Crow</a></em> by Wendell Berry</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LuMqnB\">The Secular Scripture</a></em> by Northrop Frye</p> <p></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LAD3TH\">Little Bear</a></em> by Else Holmelund Minarik</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/302uq8g\">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> by Lewis Carroll</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/300OMib\">The Story of King Arthur and His Knights</a></em> by Howard Pyle</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FFS6aP\">Saint George and the Dragon</a></em> by Margaret Hodges</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LwQBzx\">The Faerie Queen</a></em> by Edmund Spenser</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FXAFTp\">Wind in the Willows</a></em> by Kenneth Graham</p> <p> </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XBR7Te\">The Space Trilogy</a></em> <em>(The Ransom Trilogy)</em> by C.
