Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics \n\nCan I believe you?\nCan I believe you?\nCan I\nEver know your mind?\nAm I handing you mine?\nDo we both confide?\n\nI see it, eat through every word I sow\nSee what you need to, do you doubt it's yours?\nNow I’m learning the ropes\nNever get this close\nI've been wounded before\nHasn't let me go\n\nIt never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face\nIf I don’t, well, nothing will change\nStaying under my weather all day\n\nCan I believe you when you say I'm good?\nI didn't need to when I wished you would\nNo, it isn't enough\nNever held that much\nNow another way up\nBeen a row too rough\n\nIt never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face\nIf I don't, well, nothing will change\nStaying under my weather all day\n\nLately, I'm wondering too\nWhat type of desire I can break\nWhen I'm one way with them, one with you\nWhat half is it of me rearranged?\n\nCan I believe you?\nCan I believe you?\nI want to need you\nI want to need you\nCan I believe you?\nCan I believe you?\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
