  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>So much of our adult lives are impacted by our work. For some, it can determine where we live, where our children go to school, and even what times we eat dinner. Additionally, the quality of our lives depends largely on who we work with, which is why our work experiences should be improving our lives and not dampening them.&nbsp;In this week&rsquo;s session, I speak with one of my former professors, Dr. Kecia M. Thomas, Dean, professor, and expert in the psychology of workplace diversity. Our conversation explores the complexities of color blindness in the workplace, overt and covert signs of workplace discrimination, and the critical research on diversity resistance in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ðŸŽ‰ This episode marks 5 years of the Therapy for Black Girls podcast!
