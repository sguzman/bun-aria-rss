Both have enormous followings on Twitter, but have significant differences of opinion regarding policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The congresswoman from New York, who also goes by AOC, blasted the idea of making blue check verification available only to premium subscribers, tweeting on Wednesday: <em>&ldquo;Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that &lsquo;free speech&rsquo; is actually a $8/mo subscription plan.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>The left-wing politician relied heavily on her Twitter following to defeat Democratic heavyweight Joe Crowley in a primary for the 2018 congressional election.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Musk, a self-described <em>&ldquo;free speech absolutist,&rdquo;</em> returned fire: <em>&ldquo;Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8.&rdquo;</em> He then posted a screenshot from AOC&rsquo;s merch shop, highlighting the $58 price tag of a sweatshirt.</p>\n\n            <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587911540770222081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n    \n\n<p>AOC pushed back, saying she was proud of the merch and the fact that her workers are unionized, unlike employees at Musk&rsquo;s companies. The Tesla CEO is famously opposed to labor unions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She also claimed that her Twitter notifications were <em>&ldquo;conveniently&rdquo;</em> not working, concluding that she must have <em>&ldquo;gotten under a certain billionaire&rsquo;s skin.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n            <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Also my twitter mentions/notifications conveniently arenâ€™t working tonight, so I was informed via text that I seem to have gotten under a certain billionaireâ€™s skin ðŸ˜‚<br><br>Just a reminder that money will never by your way out of insecurity, folks.</p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1587968426374561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n    \n\n<p>The &lsquo;billionaire&rsquo; had a similar interaction with American author Stephen King, also a vocal advocate of left-wing causes. King threatened to leave Twitter if verification becomes a premium service. <em>&ldquo;F**k that, they should pay me,&rdquo;</em> he tweeted on Monday. Musk responded by trying to negotiate a suitable subscription price.</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/565741-musk-king-twitter-check/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Musk haggles with King over blue checkmarks\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>Musk claimed that his $44 billion purchase of Twitter last month was ideologically motivated. He expressed concern with the platform&rsquo;s content moderation policies, saying it needs to become a neutral marketplace of ideas. Critics claim that Musk will turn the service into an unregulated cesspool of bigotry, hatred, and white supremacy.</p>",
