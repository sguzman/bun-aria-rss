Plus Luis tries to make some sales himself to these idiots and even makes one.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this doesn’t want to make you go to Skankfest November 4-7 (that’s right, they’re announcing more programming for the 4th) I don’t know what will. Maybe you suck and you don’t like great comedy. Or good comedy at least. The point is, Luis is homosexual.
