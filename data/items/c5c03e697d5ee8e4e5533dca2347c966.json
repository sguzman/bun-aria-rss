The first frame shows how many of the first 100 primes end in 1, 3, 7 and 9. They all occur roughly the same number of times, so the four squares are almost exactly the same shade of red. The next frame shows how frequently a prime ending in 1 is followed by a prime ending in 3 - and so on. A structured pattern emerges, with the final frame showing the distribution of final digits in strings of 8 consecutive primes (for the first 2 million primes).  [<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/maths-experts-stunned-as-they-crack-a-pattern-for-prime-numbers-a6933156.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent news]</a> [<a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002CSF....13.1295K\" target=\"_blank\">visualization from</a>] [<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/ZXTWgEqS\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>]</p>",
