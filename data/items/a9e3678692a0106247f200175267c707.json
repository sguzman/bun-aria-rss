  "description": "<p>In the Church’s infancy,  Joseph receives the Vision of Moses as he begins what he calls the “new translation” of the Bible. Join Dr. Kerry Muhlestein, Hank, and John as we learn what happens when Joseph, Emma, Oliver, or others ask questions. We discover how the early Saints learn about the ordinance of the sacrament (do the emblems matter?), the power of the Abrahamic Covenant and how the Lord has much more in store for the entire human family via covenants via Elijah. Learn about our place in the Kingdom of God, why President Nelson constantly mentions the Gathering of Israel, and what great things the Lord has in store for His people.<br/><br/>Shownotes: followhim.co<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast/<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast</p>",
