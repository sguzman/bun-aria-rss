  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, in a continued effort to impeach President Trump, the Democrats keep pushing their purely political motives in yesterday's letter signed by a fraction of former federal prosecutors. Interestingly, the actual sitting US Attorneys and Assistant US Attorney could have written a letter asking the Attorney General William Barr to actually indict the president, if they really wanted to, but they didn't. Then, Senator Cory Booker is flirting with the lawless notion of violating people's second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Other Presidential candidates and Democrats are passing bills to promote the national popular vote initiative and other measures to require that candidates disclose their taxes in order to be on the ballot. After, Speaker Pelosi is setting the stage to either say that Trump is goading the Democrats to impeach him or so that she can take the high road and pass on the notion of impeachment. The House of Representatives has, in effect, become the Joe Biden for President campaign committee. Lastly, the New York Times has obtained some of Trump's Tax documents and published a snarky write-up on their findings from his tax data from 1985 – 1994. The NY Times is using this stolen information, in which they will be applauded by the media and the Democrats.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
