  "description": "Hercules is as terrible as he is awesome. There are sea monsters, centaurs, people being thrown off of things, Hydra poison, and Hercules making ridiculous choices. Basically, it's everything you could want from a Hercules episode. Oh, and he dies, because apparently he can do that. The creature this time is the Mamagwasewug, and he just wants to borrow a smoke off you...or he'll burn your house down.   Batman picture: https://www.instagram.com/p/BHD5g9OjfXq/?taken-by=mythpodcast Our sponsor this week: www.lootcrate.com/legends (code: LEGENDS).  Support the show?
