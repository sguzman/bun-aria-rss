  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, lawlessness has now enshrined congress, the state bar associations, and Clarence and Ginni Thomas. We begin with a federal judge named David Carter who claims that it's quite likely that former President Trump committed federal offenses on January 6th, 2021, and attempted to obstruct the counting of the electoral vote. If true, this is not a crime. This judge has not received any information from a grand jury and should have never made this non-factual outrageous statement. All citizens, president and otherwise, have a right to challenge the counting of electoral votes. Americans need to stand up to tyranny on the court and everywhere else. Then, the media operates in a pack mentality like a gang as they exploit in favor of radical leftwing activism. Their attack remains on conservative activist Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Despite having any evidence of conflicts, the left is echoing calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from any cases related to the 2020 election or the Capitol riot. Later, once upon a time, the Hollywood awards shows were a class act, but what Will Smith did was trashy. Chris Rock remarkably held his own and responded like a gentleman.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
