  "description": "<p>Today’s episode is hosted by everyones favorite realist, Nick Maraldo and he is joined by the full crew. The boys catch up from the weekend, as Connor has run into some problems putting together his apartment. The boys jump right into the Pod FOD which is a folder compiled from all things around the internet. Today’s FOD gives us a taste of the new Lord of the Rings show series, an R.I.P. to many of the boys favorite cheap beers, a more than normal penis-like snake, and much more. Make sure to subscribe to youtube.come/thepodpmi to watch full episodes and don't forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD to @ThePodPMI on twitter and instagram. We appreciate you rocking with us and we'll see you Wednesday, Cheers.</p>\n",
