Today, one of those guests came to fruition and I am so glad to bring it to you. George Hirsch from Harm Wülf/Blacklisted spoke to me for about an hour on everything from conflict on tour to motivation and being vulnerable. I didn’t honestly expect George to be so forthcoming with his answers but he was an incredible guest and I can’t thank him enough for it. Consider being a Bone Marrow donor, like me.
