  "description": "In Latino Stats: American Hispanics by the Numbers (The New Press, 2015), Idelisse Malave and Esti Giordani have produced a concise and accessible one-stop resource of facts and figures that detail the multi-faceted demographics, characteristics, and experiences of the nation’s second largest ethno-racial group. Culling data from state and federal government sources, private sector surveys, non-profit reports, and reliable media outlets, Malave and Giordani depict the Latino experience in contemporary American life and make a compelling argument for the group’s central importance to the nation’s future. Covering topics ranging from immigration and the economy, to education, health, identity, pop culture, and criminal justice, Latino Stats challenges the stereotypes and simplistic assumptions that undergird so much of the popular discourse surrounding Latinos. Up-to-date and well organized, Latino Stats is a handy resource for academics, students, policy-makers, and the general public.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
