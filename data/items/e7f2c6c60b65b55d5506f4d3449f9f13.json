  "title": "Dixon's Q test for outlier identification",
  "description": "I recently faced the impossible task to identify outliers in a dataset with very, very small sample sizes and Dixon's Q test caught my attention. Honestly, I am not a big fan of this statistical test, but since Dixon's Q-test is still quite popular in certain scientific fields (e.g., chemistry) that it is important to understand its principles in order to draw your own conclusion of the presented research data that you might stumble upon in research articles or scientific talks.",
