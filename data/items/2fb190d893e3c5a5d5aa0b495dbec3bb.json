  "description": "<p>Senior editor of The Dispatch and constitutional attorney, David French, and Holy Post co-host, Skye Jethani, discuss why the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention should waive their attorney-client privilege in the ongoing abuse investigation. Then, French explains why the increase in self-identified evangelicals between 2016 and 2020 isn’t good news, and why he now puts “evangelicals” in three different buckets. Finally, they examine claims from some neo-fundamentalists that empathy is a sin. French says the problem in America isn’t too much empathy, but selective empathy.</p> <p>SBC Executive Committee review [1:17]<br /> <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/09/21/sbc-executive-committee-agrees-to-pay-for-abuse-review-stalls-on-waiving-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://religionnews.com/2021/09/21/sbc-executive-committee-agrees-to-pay-for-abuse-review-stalls-on-waiving-privilege/</a></p> <p>Defining “evangelical” [15:28]<br /> <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/did-donald-trump-make-the-church\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/did-donald-trump-make-the-church</a></p> <p>“The American Crisis of Selective Empathy” [33:26]<br /> <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-american-crisis-of-selective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-american-crisis-of-selective</a></p>",
