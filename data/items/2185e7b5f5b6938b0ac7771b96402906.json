  "title": "Ep 6: What is Consciousness & Does LSD Help us Better Understand it?",
  "description": "<p>What is consciousness and can we access parts of our minds that we normally can't with the use of psychedelics? This episode we discuss the 1960's Harvard Psychologists Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) and their use of LSD to explore the mind. What is thought in the first place? Can we even know how we know? If I drop too much acid will I go insane and be convinced I'm an orange? My guest has done LSD about 50 times and can provide us some insight into the psychedelic world. She prefers to remain nameless and thus gainfully employed.</p>\n",
