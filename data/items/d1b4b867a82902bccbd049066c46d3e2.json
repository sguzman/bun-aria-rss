  "description": "<p>This week we’re discussing art fairs. We both have a slightly different perspective on these events - one of our rare disagreements - so today we’re tackling it head on. Louise asks: “Are art fairs really a viable sales vehicle for most of us? Or are many artists paying high fees to rent space without earning a return on the investment?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We debate our differing viewpoints and discuss how you can determine whether an art fair might be the right place to show your work. This includes considerations such as whether you are ready for this step, what kind of fair would suit you best, is the event well-run and well-attended, and how do art fairs fit into your overall plans?</p>\n<p>We also announce an exciting end-of-year event scheduled for the week of November 18th. “Your Best Art Year Ever” will be an interactive live 5-day event during which we will share our approach to planning for success. There will be live chat, laughs, sound advice, a chance to ask questions, and even a few free downloads so that you can plan your own “best art year ever.” You can join the Facebook group now and start to get to know everyone, so that you’re ready for when we start on November 18th.
