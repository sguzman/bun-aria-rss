  "description": "Adam recaps the show he did at the improv with Jay Leno, Jay Mohr, Rob Schneider, Gabriel Iglesias and more. He explains how it was a perfect mashup of vastly different comedy styles and that the audience seemed to embrace it all. At the show, Sarah Silverman showed him a picture on her phone of her and Adam’s son crying when he was a baby. Adam and gang hear the results of a staff poll where they were asked at what point would they make the switch to being with a transwoman. Gina wonders if there is a new term for ‘Indian Burn’ and Adam remembers pantsing a kid and then burning his shorts. The gang plays a round of ‘The Rotten Tomatoes Game’ with a racing theme.\n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nGeico.com",
