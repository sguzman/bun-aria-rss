  "description": "We speak with two Marketplace authors, both of whom feel the tech sector has more than achieved full value, and that a correction may be in line for the market as a whole soon. First, Michael Kramer of Mott Capital Management, author of Reading the Markets, speaks to us about the need for patience in an increasingly expensive market (1:00 minute mark-28:00). Then, Victor Dergunov points out why he's not crazy with market valuations, but why gold and the mining sector shine brighter (28:15-56:30).",
