  "description": "<p>Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Such a good example of that with this week's episode. In 2018, I watched a fascinating docuseries on Netflix called Wild, Wild Country about a controversial guru building a utopian city in the Oregon desert. I thought about doing an episode about the Rajneeshees then, but I didn't want to be overly influenced by that one show. I'm glad I waited. More dirt on the cult has come to light in the years since, and we look into it today. Did Bhagwan Rajneesh really offer enlightenment to his followers? Did he really ever even care about enlightenment? Or was it all about getting rich and sex? Or was it about enlightenment AND getting rich AND sex? Bhagwan's messages often seem empowering and enlightened at quick glance, but looking deeper, there was always a lot of darkness inside the supposed utopia he was trying to build. Hope you like this one as much as I did. <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for May is the HALO Dental Network.
