  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: Fuck Springing ahead on the clock. Losing an hour of sleep is a real bitch but we have some folks who have it way worse to start this week.</p><p>Round 2: Freddie Oversteegen was a boss ass bitch who killed a bunch of Nazis during World War 2. She was a lethal seductress whose story deserves telling so that's just what we're gonna do.</p><p>Round 3: The US will no longer disclose civilian deaths in drone strikes outside of war zones and that seems bad, right? Yeah. That's bad.</p><p>Round 4: We posted a video of Marines doing Pugil sticks training and it's going viral. We are all glad that Instagram wasn't a part of our lives when we were junior troops because we'd look like some boot bitches.</p><p>Round 5: Former US Senator and war hero Bobby Dole is being promoted from Captain to Colonel which shits all over Chaps' meritorious promotion from sergeant to staff sergeant!</p><p>Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
