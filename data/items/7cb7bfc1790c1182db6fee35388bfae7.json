  "description": "<p>Most of us spend our lives trying to fit in; to get it right; to avoid causing offence. If we have unusual personality traits or experiences, we tend to keep them hidden from all but our closest friends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This episode was conceived after a personal conversation during which Alice shared a major event in her life. That event played a major role in the way her art has developed and yet she has not discussed it publicly until now. &nbsp;We explore how such experiences can shape our art and whether this is something we should share with others. Does it help us connect with art buyers more authentically? Or is it too much information? And what are the potential downsides of being open about our lives?<br>\n<br>\nOur discussion touches on the work of Brenee Brown, covers what to do if you don't like exposing yourself, and includes a brief discussion of whether galleries approve of artists being vulnerable online. We also catch up with Alice after her workshop in Yorkshire and hear how she kept herself occupied during over 12 hours of driving (spoiler alert: there was singing!).</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dare-Lead-Brave-Conversations-Hearts/dp/1785042149/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54349805185&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6urEqsb25AIVFODtCh1DAQ_6EAAYAiAAEgL6cvD_BwE&hvadid=267243041880&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1006832&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t2&hvqmt=e&hvrand=4403177776366686653&hvtargid=kwd-375282016542&hydadcr=18458_1772235&keywords=dare+to+lead&qid=1569777892&sr=8-1\">Brene Brown Dare to Lead</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0\">Brene Brown TED talk on shame</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B2-FIAknUWR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">Louise's sketchbook from Alice's workshop</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pallantbookshop.com/product/david-tress-2/\">David Tress book</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>See fuller show notes on our websites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
