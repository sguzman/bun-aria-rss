  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 5/7/21",
  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Joe Biden predicted one million jobs this quarter and he only delivered 266K, while the country makes a significant return to inflation. Biden has destroyed our education system with indoctrination, destroyed race relations, college sports, and American-made energy. Biden is as close to a dictator as America has ever had and the Democrats strive to have one-party rule. If Biden knew that the dark days were coming, why would he create an economic catastrophe with the Democrats' massive deficit spending. Then, Sean Hannity calls in to discuss the importance of Mark Levin's new book \"American Marxism.\" Hannity mentioned how destructive Biden's policies are to the causes of liberty, the free market, and the Constitution. Hannity added that Americans must use their passion to save their country. Regarding vaccines, Donald Trump moved heaven and earth to ensure the faster possible vaccine research and distribution without sacrificing quality. Yet, Biden just sits there and claims credit for Trump's vaccines while playing nice with his pals in communist China by trying to give them America's vaccine research by voiding patents. Afterward, Joe Biden is breathing life into the vile regime of Iran after Trump had weakened them. Biden's move to re-instate the old Obama-era Iran nuclear deal without seeking a treaty should have republicans seeking his impeachment. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
