  "description": "<p><br />You may know the hilarious comedian Rory Scovel from his many appearances on CONAN, or maybe you even saw him live on tour with Conan & Friends. If you’ve ever wondered what he’d sound like as the host of his very own Team Coco podcast, wonder no more! Rory has a brand new show called “Dads: The Podcast.” Each week he and co-host Ruthie Wyatt are joined by their hilarious celebrity friends to unpack the mysteries of fatherhood, parenting, and the weirdos who raised us. Conan can’t wait to play some of it for you—but not before revealing the special first guest (hint: himself). If you like what you hear, go listen to the whole thing and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dads-the-podcast/id1528068952\">subscribe</a>! </p>\n",
