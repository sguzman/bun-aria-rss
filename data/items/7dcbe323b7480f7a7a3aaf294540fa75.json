  "description": "<p>Well somehow we have managed to defy expectations and actually win an award for this show so why not come together and talk about it for an hour to really try and come to terms with it?! That's right, we can officially call ourselves an 'award winning Olympics podcast' and the OG gang is back together to talk about what it means for the show, just why we're still in shock about it and also properly commend our fellow nominees in our category. We also go over some of the more memorable moments we've enjoyed in our 6 year journey so far, reflect on some of our amazing guests and wonder just how 'Hollywood' this will make us moving forward. So if you're still in shock that we are apparently award winning, then this is the episode to help you digest it a little more! Enjoy!</p>",
