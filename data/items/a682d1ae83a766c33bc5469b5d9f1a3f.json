  "title": "291 - The Fires of New Creation",
  "description": "“The Fires of New Creation.” We’re moving forward with the conversation on the Biblical narration of the the whole story. The story. The one about God’s intent, the separation of Heaven and Earth and the hope of new creation. Today we talk about fire and water and how they’re used in the Bible. Where is Judgment in this text? How did Jesus talk about it? How did Paul? What role does Judgment play? Where did we get so much of our theology of Hell and damnation? Is the story about Heaven and Earth or Heaven and Hell? Is Hell used, by Jesus, to motivate people? How does all of this connect to the Sermon on the Mount?\n\nWe also spend a little time talking about an email we got from a listener who is wrestling with whether or not to leave his church because of a NO mask mandate (as a staff member, he has been told he will be punished if he wears a mask on Sunday morning, inside the Church). Mike has good advice and context. Tim gets riled up.\n\nThis is part two. We will follow it with a conversation on Hell and Sin. \n\nWe got graphs! https://www.instagram.com/p/CNi3hUVrrNS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
