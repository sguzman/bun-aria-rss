  "description": "In a programme first broadcast in 2018, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the jewels of medieval English poetry.  It was written c1400 by an unknown poet and then was left hidden in private collections until the C19th when it emerged.  It tells the story of a giant green knight who disrupts Christmas at Camelot, daring Gawain to cut off his head with an axe if he can do the same to Gawain the following year.  Much to the surprise of Arthur's court, who were kicking the green head around, the decapitated body reaches for his head and rides off, leaving Gawain to face his promise and his apparently inevitable death the following Christmas.\n\nThe illustration above is ©British Library Board Cotton MS Nero A.x, article 3, ff.94v95\n\nWith \n\nLaura Ashe\nProfessor of English Literature at Worcester College, University of Oxford\n\nAd Putter\nProfessor of Medieval English Literature at the University of Bristol\n\nAnd \n\nSimon Armitage\nPoet and Professor of Poetry at the Universities of Leeds and Oxford\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
