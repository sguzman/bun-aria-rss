  "description": "Welcome to Food People, a show from Bon Appétit made by, for, and about people who love food. Each week, BA’s editorial director Amanda Shapiro asks a serious or not-so-serious food question: What’s the best way to grill chicken? Can meal prep be less terrible? Are air fryers worth the hype? In search of answers or at least a spirited debate, she’ll bring in staffers, chefs, writers, and experts from across the culinary universe. Expect strong opinions, tons of recipe inspiration, and more food puns than we'd like to admit.\nListen and subscribe at http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople-trailer or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.bonappetit.com/foodpeople\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.bonappetit.com/ba-apple\n\n\nSpotify: https://link.chtbl.com/ba-spotify\n\n\nStitcher: http://listen.bonappetit.com/ba-stitcher\n\n\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
