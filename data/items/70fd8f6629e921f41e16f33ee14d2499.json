  "description": "<p>We investigate the problem of finding paths that enable a robot modeled as a\nDubins car (i.e., a constant-speed finite-turn-rate unicycle) to escape from a\ncircular region of space in minimum time. This minimum-time escape problem\narises in marine, aerial, and ground robotics in situations where a safety\nregion has been violated and must be exited before a potential negative\nconsequence occurs (e.g., a collision). Using the tools of nonlinear optimal\ncontrol theory, we show that a surprisingly simple closed-form feedback control\nlaw solves this minimum-time escape problem, and that the minimum-time paths\nhave an elegant geometric interpretation.\n</p>",
