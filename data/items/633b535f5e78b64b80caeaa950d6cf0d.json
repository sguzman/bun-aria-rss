  "title": "Robert P. Drozek, \"Psychoanalysis as an Ethical Process\" (Routledge, 2019)",
  "description": "The subject of ethics in psychoanalysis has long been relegated to the sidelines of clinical theory. In his new book Psychoanalysis as an Ethical Process with a forward by Peter Fonagy (Routledge, 2019), Robert P. Drozek utilizes both philosophical and analytic concepts to arrive at a new theory of an ethical relational psychoanalysis, one that emphasizes the dignity and the values of both patient and analyst. Although the discussion of ethics is often seen as dry, Psychoanalysis as an Ethical Process disproves that notion with compelling clinical examples and lively discussion of theoretical ideas. In this interview we focus on the areas of therapeutic action and technique and how Drozek’s incorporation of ethics can enhance our understanding of our work.\nThis book is will be of interest to psychotherapists, psychoanalysts as well as those with as students of philosophy.\nYou can reach Christopher Bandini at @cebandini.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
