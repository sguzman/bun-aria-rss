  "description": "I don't want to spoil anything for someone who doesn't know this story, but this three-parter has everything: sneering villains, valiant heroes, monster fights, love, loss, betrayal, and someone shoving dragon tongues down their pants despite that not remotely being the best way to transport dragon tongues. It's the long-requested original story of Tristan and Isolde. The creature is just a hungry snail...who also happens to be four stories tall and in possession of mouth tentacles.
