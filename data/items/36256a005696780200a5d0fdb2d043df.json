  "description": "This week, the gals go deep into some military protocol. Topics include a bratty Congolese politician, some brutal (and sanctioned) \"death squads,\" and whether Amanda's farts constitute a war crime. Gain clearance to open a bottle of Winc's One From the Quiver Malbec, brush up on international relations, and tune in for Command Responsibility Crimes.",
