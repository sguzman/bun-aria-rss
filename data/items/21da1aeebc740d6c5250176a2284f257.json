Let's start with the Round 1/2 turn (8:00) with Jonathan Taylor, Joe Mixon, Antonio Gibson, Najee Harris and Nick Chubb. We've got all the Mixon analysis you can handle! Plus our thoughts on CEH (22:40) before getting to the Round 3 RBs (28:33). How do we rank David Montgomery, J.K. Dobbins and D'Andre Swift? ... After that group it's a lot less exciting. Moving on to Round 4 (38:10), Chris Carson headlines the group but you could see Josh Jacobs, Myles Gaskin, Darrell Henderson and a few others come off the board here. How do we rank them? Jamey is a Gaskin believer! Is Kareem Hunt behind this tier? ... We look at Round 6 and beyond (54:30) from guys like Michael Carter and Damien Harris to Latavius Murray and A.J. Dillon and more! ...
