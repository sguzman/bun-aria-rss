  "description": "<p>The objective of this work is to train noise-robust speaker embeddings\nadapted for speaker diarisation. Speaker embeddings play a crucial role in the\nperformance of diarisation systems, but they often capture spurious information\nsuch as noise, adversely affecting performance. Our previous work has proposed\nan auto-encoder-based dimensionality reduction module to help remove the\nredundant information. However, they do not explicitly separate such\ninformation and have also been found to be sensitive to hyper-parameter values.\nTo this end, we propose two contributions to overcome these issues: (i) a novel\ndimensionality reduction framework that can disentangle spurious information\nfrom the speaker embeddings; (ii) the use of speech activity vector to prevent\nthe speaker code from representing the background noise. Through a range of\nexperiments conducted on four datasets, our approach consistently demonstrates\nthe state-of-the-art performance among models without system fusion.\n</p>",
