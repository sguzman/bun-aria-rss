  "description": "In 2002 we launched a page with a set of guidelines for site owners that gave an overview of\n      best practices when it came to building a site. We called this page \"Webmaster Guidelines\" and\n      it's been with us ever since. Since then we added a lot of information to these guidelines to\n      help site owners build the site that's right for their users who visit through Google Search.\n      Today we're launching a refreshed, simplified version of the Webmaster Guidelines, and we're\n      changing its name as well.",
