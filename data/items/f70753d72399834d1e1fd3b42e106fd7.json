  "description": "Vote for us for Best Sports Podcast and Best Male-Hosted Podcast! http://podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nWe've got a lot of good debates on today's show as we bring on Donkey Teeth from Razzball.com. We go through Heath's RB tiers which look quite different from average draft position. Donkey Teeth gives his initial thoughts on Heath's tiers (2:40) and then Adam tries rearranging Heath's first three tiers (5:45)! We've also got some Scott Fish Bowl updates (8:55) and news and notes ... Tier 1 is easy, but Tier 2 is where it gets interesting (13:10). Within this discussion we debate Aaron Jones, Najee Harris and especially David Montgomery. Then we move on to Tier 3 (26:40) which features Javonte Williams, Saquon Barkley, Ezekiel Elliott and more. Does Zeke belong in this tier? Should Williams actually be higher (29:40)? ... Tier 4 (32:00) gets into the RB2s who still have a lot of upside, but do we run out of non-injury upside by the time we get to Tier 5 (38:40)? Should A.J. Dillon and Kareem Hunt be in their own tier? Then we talk Tier 6 (45:05), Tier 7 (48:15) and Tier 8 (50:50) which features players like Devin Singletary, Tony Pollard and James Robinson plus pass catching RBs and handcuffs. Which players could leap into a new tier? ...
