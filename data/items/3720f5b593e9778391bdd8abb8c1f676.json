    "media:description": "**Major correction: I wrongly and repeatedly referred to T. Reesei as being a yeast, when it is actually another type of fungus. Yeast is also a type of fungus, so my comments about reaction conditions remain true, but it is incorrect to call T. Reesei a yeast. Or to say that the cellulase came from yeast. \n\n*Small correction: I also said that 20ml of 20% , when it was supposed to be 25ml.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor this video, I'm going to be doing exactly what the title says, and I'll be turning a roll of toilet paper into moonshine. This was something that I've been wanting to do for a while and I am really surprised how well it turned out!\n\nPaper references:\n• The Effect of Pretreatment Methods on Cellulose Structure: https://bit.ly/2CJbyl0\n\nNile talks about lab safety: https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZA\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n• NileRed Store: https://nilered.tv/store\n\n• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/nilered\n\n• NileRed Newsletter: https://nile.red/home#newsletter\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n• Discord: https://nilered.tv/discord\n• Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NileRed2\n• Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nile.red\n• Snapchat: https://nilered.tv/snapchat\n• TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nilered\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/NileRed2\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nMusic in credits (Walker by SORRYSINES): https://soundcloud.com/sorrysines/walker\n\n-------------------------------------------",
