  "description": "Robert Plant is in his own words “cold” and “prickly” while speaking about his new album with Alison Krauss, Raise The Roof. First thing upon joining the Zoom call from London, Plant jovially launches into the much misattributed quote “talking about music is like dancing about architecture.” But he is neither callous, nor coy. For Plant the music is ineffable, a joyous celebration of friendship, and a kindred love of song that he shares with Krauss and producer T-Bone Burnett. Their album follows up from their 2007 Grammy award winning album Raising Sand. Both albums are steeped in americana and roots music, favorites that the trio traded across the Atlantic over many years of friendship. There are few hints of Plant’s Led Zeppelin or Krauss’ Union Station. Instead their collaboration sounds timeless, haunting and melancholic. Their idiosyncratic sound emerged from an entirely organic process, a method that both parties are happy to share, but reticent to analyze. Switched On Pop’s co-host Charlie Harding spoke with Plant and Krauss about the making of Raise The Roof.\n﻿\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED - Spotify Playlist\n\nRobert Plant, Alison Krauss - Quattro (World Drifts In), The Price of Love, Go Your Own Way, Trouble With My Love, Can’t Let Go, It Don’t Bother Me, You Led Me To The Wrong, Last Kind Words Blues, High and Lonesome, Going Where The Lonely Go, Somebody Was Watching Over Me\n\nCalexico - Quattro (World Drifts In)\n\nThe Everly Brothers - The Price of Love\n\nAnne Briggs - Go Your Own Way\n\nBert Jansch - Go Your Own Way\n\nSandy Denny - Go Your Own Way\n\nLed Zeppelin - The Battle of Evermore\n\nBetty Harris - Trouble With My Love\n\nLucinda Williams - Can’t Let Go\n\nBert Jansch - It Don’t Bother Me\n\nOla Belle Reed - You Led Me To The Wrong\n\nGeeshie Wiley - Last Kind Words Blues \n\nMerle Haggard - Going Where The Lonely Go\n\nPops Staples - Somebody Was Watching \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
