  "description": "<p>I wanted to try something different with this episode: to team up with a brilliant friend and colleague to answer questions from PSYCHOACTIVE listeners. Dr. Julie Holland is a psychiatrist and psychopharmacologist who has written many outstanding books, including most recently Good Chemistry: The Science of Connection, from Soul to Psychedelics. Julie is a long-time believer in the potential of psychoactive experiences to open our worlds and heal our minds. And, as you'll hear in her answers, she also has first-hand experience with many drugs, both good and bad.</p><p>Julie and I had such a great time that we plan to do more Q&A episodes in the future. We'll give you a heads up on when to expect the next one, but feel free to send us your questions in the meantime! Our number is 1-833-779-2460 for voicemails.
