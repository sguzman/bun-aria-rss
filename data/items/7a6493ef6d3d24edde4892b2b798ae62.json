  "description": "<p>We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the dynamic phase\ntransition properties of the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model on the kagome\nlattice in the presence of square-wave oscillating magnetic field. Through\ndetailed finite-size scaling analysis, we study universality aspects of the\nnon-equilibrium phase transition. Obtained critical exponents indicate that the\ntwo-dimensional kagome-lattice kinetic Ising model belongs to the same\nuniversality class with the corresponding Ising model in equilibrium. Moreover,\ndynamic critical exponent of the local moves used in simulations is determined\nwith high precision. Our numerical results are compatible with the previous\nones on kinetic Ising models.\n</p>",
