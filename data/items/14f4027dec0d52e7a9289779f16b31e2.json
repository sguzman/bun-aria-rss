  "description": "<p>The Kirk Minihane Show is back together and ready to tackle some hot topics Minihane missed during his mental health leave. Most importantly, why did the Mincels screw up the bracket rankings? The sports media are very concerned that coronavirus will prevent them from accessing locker rooms (0:15:00). A highly rated staple of Boston sports radio walks out on his own show after a heated debate about coronavirus (0:24:20). USA Today is running a \"best podcast\" bracket of their own, and Barstool somehow is absent from the list (1:03:25). Barstool CEO Erika Nardini shares high praise for Minihane -- and an alarming fact about an old enemy (1:26:32). Steve's a Liar guy returns to celebrate Blind Mike's social awkwardness in song (1:50:13).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
