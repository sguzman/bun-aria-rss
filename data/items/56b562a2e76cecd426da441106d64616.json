  "title": "Could geothermal become a major zero-emissions player?",
  "description": "Drill down far enough anywhere in the world and you reach temperatures hot enough to generate firm, reliable zero-emission electricity. That’s the hope for new geothermal technologies that could scale the industry beyond well-known geothermal hot spots like Iceland.\nBut first the industry needs to overcome major challenges in financing and technology. It has also to deal with the public opinion around the oil and gas industry, which may be an essential partner in scaling geothermal because of its overlapping expertise in drilling and underground exploration.\nIn this episode, guest host Lara Pierpoint talks with Jamie Beard, executive director of Project Innerspace, a non-profit focused on expanding the use of geothermal energy globally. \nCurrent geothermal technology relies on naturally occurring underground hot spots, common in places like Iceland and the western U.S.. But an approach called enhanced geothermal systems or “hot, dry rock,” would make geothermal available around the world, potentially adding hundreds of gigawatts to current geothermal capacity.\nLara and Jamie discuss major questions facing the geothermal industry, like:\n\nHow and where to drill for consistent hot temperatures? \n\nHow long before a well is depleted of heat-carrying capacity? \n\nWhat sort of surveying and information do funders need to deal with exploration risks? \n\nHow can the industry take advantage of the co-benefits of geothermal drilling, such as lithium extraction, carbon sequestration and waste heat?\n\nWhat working fluids, like water or critical CO2, are appropriate for a given project?\n\nHow viable are geothermal-source heat pumps and how do they compare to air-source heat pumps?\n\nWhat are the potential environmental impacts of geothermal?\n\nWhat role should the oil and gas industry play in scaling this zero-emission technology?\n\n\nResources:\n\n\nCanary Media: Advanced geothermal heats up with $138M round for startup Fervo Energy\n\n\nDepartment of Energy: DOE Launches New Energy Earthshot to Slash the Cost of Geothermal Power\n\nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
