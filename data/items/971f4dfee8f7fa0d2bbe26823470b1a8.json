  "description": "<p>Pumped to bring you another amazing interview today as we speak with Australian dual Olympian from the sport of Discus, Matthew Denny! Matthew gives a great insight into just how he got into the sport, and how he very much could’ve been a star in another sport instead. He also takes us through the unique nature of him competing successfully in both the discus and hammer throw, as well as which other field discipline he very nearly could’ve succeeded in more too. Added to this we learn just how much love he got online during the Olympics, and why Chris Hemsworth will be asking for his autograph by the time of the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. It’s an exciting and fun chat that will be the highlight of your day, so tune in now!</p>",
