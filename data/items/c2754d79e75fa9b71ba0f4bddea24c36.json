  "description": "<p>THE SQUIDMOBILE HAS ARRIVED. Get in losers; we’re talking cephalopods. Yes, she drives a vehicle with squid all over it and encourages people to text her, and we have this encore episode to prove it. The world's most impassioned squid nerd, Sarah McAnulty, gets locked in a basement with Alie to talk about cephalopods, alien DNA, camouflage, invisibility cloaks, why cute things make us bonkers, terrible mating strategies, cute and clever ones and why she is so charmed by squid. Also addressed: Philly accents and the Kraken. And why I am putting out an encore episode from a parking garage.</p><p>The squid facts hotline can be reached at 1-833-SCI-TEXT aka 1-833-724-8398</p><p>Follow Dr. Sarah McAnulty on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahMackAttack\">Twitter</a> & <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarahmackattack/\">Instagram</a> @SarahMackAttack</p><p><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/SarahMackAttack\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah's Atlas Obscura classes, science trivia, book + more</a></p><p>A donation was made this week to <a href=\"https://www.skypeascientist.com/\">SkypeAScientist.com</a></p><p>Follow Skype A Scientist on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skypescientist\">Twitter</a> & <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/skypeascientist/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/ologies-extras\">Transcripts and bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://alieward.com/smologies\">Smologies (short, classroom-safe) episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\">Become a patron of Ologies</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, masks, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on<a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/alieward\"> Twitter</a> and<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward\"> Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://www.jarrettsleeper.com/\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of <a href=\"https://www.mindjammedia.com/\">MindJam Media</a></p><p>Transcripts by Emily White of <a href=\"https://www.thewordary.com/\">The Wordary</a></p><p>Website by <a href=\"https://www.kellyrdwyer.com/photo\">Kelly R.
