  "description": "Tomorrow, the Fed will announce its latest interest rate hike… and investors are on the edge of their seats as they wait to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. I bring in Daniel Creech to get his take on how hawkish (or dovish) the Fed will be.  Daniel shares some wild details from Powell’s recent speech from Jackson Hole… and explains why Fed members are happy to see the markets fall.  I recap why the Fed is out of its mind lately, as it ignores the most important data when it comes to inflation. But there’s still a chance it comes to its senses. I break down exactly what the Fed could say that would spark a 1,000-point rally tomorrow. Hedge fund manager and “SPAC King” Chamath Palihapitiya is in the news again after canceling two of his SPAC deals. Prepare for a rant on why SPACs aren’t a level playing field for regular investors… how these rich guys pump the share prices before dumping their positions… and how much money Chamath made on these kinds of deals.  Lastly, if you’re interested in fully-vetted private placement deals, check out a membership to , where you’ll have access to amazing opportunities from an insider network you can trust.  In this episode   Why the Fed is happy about this bear market [0:30] Why the markets could rally 1,000 points tomorrow [7:33]  The Fed should pay attention to FedEx’s warning [20:15]  The “SPAC King” is full of s*** [25:15]  Proof SPAC investing isn’t a level playing field [29:50] Investments that give individual investors access to Wall Street gains [38:30]  Enjoyed this episode?
