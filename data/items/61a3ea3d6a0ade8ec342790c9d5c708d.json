  "description": "On this episode of the OM3, JJ and Tommy welcome in yet another NBA Champion for a conversation - the Miami Heat's P.J Tucker. In this honest and hilarious interview, P.J. holds absolutely nothing back. (The wine might have had something to do with this). They discuss and breakdown several topics, including the long and winding road P.J. has taken to become an NBA Champ, his past history with JJ (41 points anyone?), the Bucks’ amazing run last year, and so much more. Then for the draft, the guys are joined by journalist and author Shea Serrano. Before they tackle the draft, they touch on Shea’s new book \"Hip-Hop and Other Things” and what went into making it, as well as his brand new show “Primo\". An outstanding episode from start to finish. FYI, the draft topic is “the top 5 movies where someone makes a terrible mistake”. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
