Tarski gives a technical, metaphysically neutral definition for truth within a particular, well-defined language. So how does that apply to real languages? He thought he was defining truth (a semantic concept) in terms of more primitive (physical?) concepts, but Field and Davidson think that actually, truth as a general concept is indefinable, even though it's still helpful for Tarski to have laid out the relations among various semantic concepts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Please support PEL</a>!</p>",
