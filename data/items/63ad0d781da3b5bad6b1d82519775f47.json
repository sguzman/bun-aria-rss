  "description": "In a remarkable 50 year career in government that has seen him as Secretary of Defense, Director of the CIA, White House Chief of Staff, Director of the Office of Management and Budget and in Congressional leadership, Leon Panetta has seen it all. But, he tells us in an exclusive Agenda 2021 interview, he has never seen anything like the situation we're in now. We discuss Trump's COVID leadership failure, his kowtowing to Putin, his ignoring the threat posed by Russian bounties on US troops, and his weakening of NATO. Then we turn to the vital national security priorities that a Biden Administration must address come January--and they go far beyond merely undoing the damage Trump has done. This is a masterclass in government and policy from one of the great master public servants of our time. Do not miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
