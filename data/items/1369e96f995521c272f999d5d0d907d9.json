  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of The Literary Life with Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins, and Thomas Banks continue their discussion of J. R. R. Tolkien’s short story “<a href= \"http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm\">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. If you missed the Back to School 2020 Conference when it was live, you can still purchase access to the recordings at <a href=\"http://cindyrollins.net\">CindyRollins.net</a>. Angelina opens the book chat highlighting Tolkien’s mirroring of Dante’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3acbRF3\">Divine Comedy</a></em> with Niggle’s journey, and our hosts move through a recap of the story. The questions we should be asking as we read are whether this story deals with the recovery of our vision and whether it ends with a eucatastrophe.</p> <p>Cindy brings out more of the autobiographical nature of this story for Tolkien. Angelina tosses around the idea that Parish and Niggle may be doubles and be a picture of Tolkien’s two selves. Thomas talks about what Niggle has to do in the “purgatory” section of the story. They also talk about the themes of art and the artist, sub-creation, and redemption. Come back next week to hear a discussion about why we ought to read myths.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>It is when a writer first begins to make enemies that he begins to matter.</p> <cite>Hilton Brown</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Kill that whence spring the crude fancies and wild day-dreams of the young, and you will never lead them beyond dull facts—dull because their relations to each other, and the one life that works in them all, must remain undiscovered.
