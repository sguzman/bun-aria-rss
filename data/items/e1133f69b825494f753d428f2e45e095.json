  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents OP has the mother-in-law from hell! OP has children, and her mother-in-law seems to think that just because she's a grandparent, she has the right to come and take the kids whenever she wants, even if OP disagrees. OP turns down her MIL's request to take the kids, so her MIL flips out and begins a day-long harassment campaign. She shows up unannounced, camps out in the parking lot outside of OP's house to spy on her, and harasses OP and her husband. She even threatened legal action! Imagine being so entitled that you think you're entitled to another person's children!</p>\n<p>Get 10% off your first month at Betterhelp.com/rslash</p>\n",
