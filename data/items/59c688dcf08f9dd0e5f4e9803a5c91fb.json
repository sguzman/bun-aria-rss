    "media:description": "We’re in a new era where Black people are now occupying every area of fashion and beyond where  Black models have become activists fighting for body inclusivity. Precious Lee tells the story of her journey plus we take a closer look at the Black Models using their platforms to spark social change within the fashion industry. Highlighted are the lingering effects of racism, the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement and the pandemic upon fashion. Also covered are the changes over time around awareness of body positivity, diversity and inclusion, influencer culture, and social media. We also look at the Black In Fashion Council and how it’s helped facilitate Black photographers, Black models, and more. Paloma Elsesser discusses her first Vogue cover and we hear from Iman, Anna Wintour, Poppy Ajudha, Joan Smalls, Zendaya, Aweng Chuol, and many more as they discuss the state of the industry and where it’s headed - as well as the impact of colorism.\n \nMusic Featured:\n“Wake Me Up”\nWritten by Frederik Helmut Wiedmann, Gemma Hyesu Wiedmann\nPerformed by Emily Jaye\nCourtesy of MicDrop\n \n“All Love”\nWritten by Randolph Newman, Myles Morales\nPerformed by Myles Williams & Titus\nCourtesy of MicDrop\n \n“Drastic Measure”\nWritten by Randolph Newman, Myles Morales\nPerformed by Myles Williams & Titus\nCourtesy of MicDrop\n \n“Black Joy.
