  "title": "Why the Mid-Engine Corvette Took 60 Years to Make",
  "description": "Just a couple years ago, the world finally got its first Mid-Engine Corvette. Today on Past Gas, the epic, decades-long story of how we finally reached that point. It’s a story that starts with hiding out from the Nazis in a French brothel, and only gets wilder from there. What were the incredible experimental cars that Chevy scrapped, how did last minute business blunders hold the project back, and who were the geniuses who finally made it possible? It’s a mid-engine LEGEND on today’s podcast.\n﻿More about Show:\n\n\n﻿Follow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey.  \n\n\n\nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes.  \n\n\n\nFollow Joe on IG and Twitter @joegweber.\n\n\nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or using this link: http://bit.ly/PastGas.\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
