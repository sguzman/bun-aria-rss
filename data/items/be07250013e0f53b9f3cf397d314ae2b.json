  "description": "In today's podcast we follow the continuing story of the Shadow Brokers and their claims of having got their hands on Equation Group attack code (as bizarre as their story is, a lot of informed observers think the code they've posted is the real deal). Many see the Shadow Brokers incident as an escalation of a cyber cold war between Russia and the United States. More banking Trojan activity in South America. DNSSEC is exploited in DDoS attacks, and Cerber is still number one in the ransomware-as-a-service market (where Shark is a dodgy upstart). Kensington's Rob Humphrey shares the results of their recently security survey, and Johns Hopkins University's Joe Carrigan weighs in on securing your devices in the real world.  And yes, more Pokémon stuff.",
