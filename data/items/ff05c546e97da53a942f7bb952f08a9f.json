  "description": "In this month's episode of The Readheads Book Club we are discussing our most recent book, Klara and The Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro. The girls have a lot of differing opinions about this book. They're answering some of the bigger questions the book poses and trying to decipher what it all meant. Plus they're answering your questions and casting a Hollywood version of the book. As always they're sharing and reviewing the other books we read this month. The next book is Margo's choice and she chose We Are the Brennans by Tracey Lange.
