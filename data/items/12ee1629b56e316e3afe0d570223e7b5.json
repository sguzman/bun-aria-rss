  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys reminisce about St. Patrick's Day and why it is truly one of the best holidays, and chat about Russell Wilson almost being a Bear and the Bears settling with Andy Dalton. Also joining the program is Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Safety for the Buffalo Bills, AJ's former teammate, Micah Hyde to chat about his progression in the league, the culture being built in Buffalo, his relationship with Jordan Poyer, and Josh Allen being a dude (1:00:49-1:16:31). Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, 13 year NFL veteran, Head Football Coach at Lipscomb Academy, and friend of the program, Trent Dilfer. Pat and Trent chat about the free agent market for a QB, his thoughts on both the Russell Wilson/Pete Carroll situation and DeShaun Watson in Houston, and the necessity of a Head Coach and Quarterback being alphas and testing each other (34:19-58:31).  Later, Pat and AJ shoot the breeze about the new league year beginning and what they anticipate to happen over the course of the next few days (1:16:33-1:35:07).
