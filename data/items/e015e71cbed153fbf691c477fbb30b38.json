  "description": "<p>I don't know about you, but I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars. So I always love the Fourth of May. And I may or may not have been at a few Comic Cons in my lifetime. And if you know anything about the cosplay community, they are some of the most dynamic and fun people you'll ever meet. But even more so are the 501st Legion. And if you don't know who they are, you really should look them up. The incredible charitable work that they do is one of the reasons that my next guest, who is a lifelong friend of mine, Justin Weiss, chose to join his local fiber first, which is the Empire City Garrison where he dresses up like a stormtrooper. In fact, you might hear a little bit of a muffled audio in the beginning because he is in full costume as a stormtrooper which kind of shows that yes, it's charitable work, but it might be a little bit beyond that too. </p>",
