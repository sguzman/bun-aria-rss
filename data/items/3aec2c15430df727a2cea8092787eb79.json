  "description": "<p>What happens when a man that's been around sits down with you and just...starts talking? You open up in ways you never thought you would. This episode had some sort of plan before we started, but Greg Fitzsimmons AKA Fitzdog dropped a dime on us and we ended up being more vulnerable than ever before. This episode is your mommy's without their jeans - your naked mommies. Fitz really is hilarious and a fantastic guest/interviewer. This is one of the most engaging and interesting conversations we've ever had in the \"Dome.\" Enjoy!</p>\n",
