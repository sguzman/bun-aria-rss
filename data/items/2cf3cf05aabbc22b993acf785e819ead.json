  "description": "<p>When someone asks you \"What's your sign?\" it's more than likely they're asking you to share your sun sign, which indicates where the sun was located when you were born. And for a lot of us, that's as much as we know about astrology. So today we're giving you a crash course in all your personalities with our friend Bailee Pili @baileepili. The realm of astrology can appear vast and daunting. Luckily, there's an entry point to be found for even the greenest beginner. So buckle up, call your mom to find out what time you were born, and then get close because we're about to explain why you are the way you are - and if everything you manifest today was written in the stars!</p>",
