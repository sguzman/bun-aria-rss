  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today’s show I bring back Jordan Trimble - President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources (SYH.V). Skyharbour stands today as one of the most overlooked Uranium explorers. It's located in the heart of what's now known as the #1 mining jurisdiction is the world - Canada's Saskatchewan. Since Jordan was last on the show in November, we've seen a massive shift in the sector. Today, Jordan catches listeners up to date. Aside from Uranium prices finally coming off their lows... Skyharbour Resources alone has jumped nearly 150% in just 3 months. From .28 to .69, the stock still rests under $1 but as Jordan explains, this won’t be the case much longer… Skyharbour just released news on their most recent drilling program. And the results are game-changing. But as investors, lets not forget - junior miners don’t generate any revenue… cash concerns are critical, and at times, over-drilling can be detrimental... even in favorable economic conditions. As the company plans to aggressively drill in the near future, I ask Jordan the questions all investors need to know. Then, stepping back from the technicals, we take a closer look at the Uranium market as a whole. We already know demand is ramping up… but what about the other catalyst? As Jordan explains, there are multiple underestimated market components. These are factors that will only continue to drive Uranium prices higher. The fundamentals are all lining up. As for Skyharbour, if you took my recommendation a few months ago... keep enjoying the ride. As I expect Uranium prices to double in the next 6 to 12 months... well positioned companies like Jordan's should reap all the benefits. Also, don’t miss this week’s Educational Segment [45:36]. As the market continues to reach new all-time highs, fears are rising. Is the market too expensive? Are we overvalued? Absolutely not. Ignore it. Too many metrics are telling the wrong story.",
