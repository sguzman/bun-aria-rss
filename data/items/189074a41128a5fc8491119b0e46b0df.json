  "description": "<div>Sam's guest in this week’s Book Club podcast is Kavita Puri, whose book <em>Partition Voices </em>excavates<em> </em>the often traumatic memories of the last generation to remember first-hand the mass migration and bloody violence of the partition of India. She tells Sam why the story has been so shrouded in silence – there isn’t a memorial to Partition, she says, anywhere on earth – and yet how it has shaped the UK’s population and politics ever since, and she says why she believes it’s vital that empire and the end of empire be taught in every British school.</div>\n",
