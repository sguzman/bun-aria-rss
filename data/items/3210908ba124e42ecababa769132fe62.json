  "description": "<p>Many farmers across the Midwest voted for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election but hoped he would never follow through on his threats to impose tariffs on China. They feared that they would suffer if China imposed its own tariffs as payback. Now, Beijing has done just that, proposing tariffs on 106 types of American goods — including soybeans, corn and pork — in retaliation for President Trump’s plans to penalize Chinese trade practices. Guest: Eldon Gould, a farmer in Illinois who voted for President Trump. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily. </p>\n",
