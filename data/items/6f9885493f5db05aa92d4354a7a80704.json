  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys are LIVE from Colts training camp as they welcome in the Cleveland Browns for a joint practice. Pat sits down with Colts GM and friend of the show, Chris Ballard, to discuss the Andrew Luck situation and when they think he might be back healthy, what he expects out of his Colts team this year after a successful 2018 season, what he would've asked for in return from the Bears if Pat had went and played there, his relationship with Coach Frank Reich, and how he thinks the team performed in the joint practice with the Browns (3:26-17:43). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, one of the most underrated receivers in the league, and Pat's former teammate, TY Hilton stops by. They chat about him being a veteran in the locker room and what that process has been like, his thoughts on the Colts' QB situation and how that affects his preparation, what the best thing he purchased in the offseason was, and if his kids are better athletes than he is (20:36-27:28). Lastly, first team All-Pro, last year's Defensive Rookie of the Year, and one of the best linebackers in football, Darius Leonard stops by. They discuss the improvements he made in the offseason to polish his game, his thoughts on training camp fights with other teams, what it's like being a new father, what he did to relax during the offseason, and what gives him the massive chip on his shoulder (35:22-42:38). Today's a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
