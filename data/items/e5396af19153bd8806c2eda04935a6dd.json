  "description": "This week the European elections have generated intense discussion: The turnout was the highest for twenty years. And for the first time in decades, the traditional Centre-Right and Centre-Left failed to win enough seats to form a majority. They are under pressure to forge fresh partnerships with smaller blocs, like the Far-Right, the Liberals or the Greens, who have been returned with a bigger share of the vote. Some argue that the new balance of power will better reflect the political realities of the EU member states. Others predict stalemate on big issues like migration, budget, and climate, as newly-emboldened smaller groups fight for their own agenda. Join Ritula Shah and guests as they discuss the road ahead for the European Parliament.",
