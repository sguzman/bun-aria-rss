  "title": "Malene Barnett and Leyden Lewis on why BADG's Obsidian project is no ordinary designer showhouse",
  "description": "<p>Artist and activist Malene Barnett and designer and artist Leyden Lewis are two of the twenty-two creators behind the Black Artists and Designers Guild’s new project, Obsidian, a virtual concept house designed to celebrate innovation from black creatives—and to craft a home around the past, present and future needs of black families. On this episode of the podcast they chat with host Dennis Scully about why the Obsidian House is more like an innovation-driven car show than a typical designer showhouse, the challenges of creating meaningful partnerships with sponsors, and why the design industry needs to get beyond diversity as a goal, and start focusing on equity. <i>This episode is sponsored by Chairish and Universal Furniture.  </i></p>\n",
