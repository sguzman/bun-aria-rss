  "description": "Eryn White, who is Reader in Welsh history at Aberystwyth University, Wales, has written an outstanding new book on the beginnings of Welsh evangelicalism. The Welsh Methodist Society: The Early Societies in South-West Wales 1737-1750 (University of Wales Press, 2020) focuses on the movement that became known as the Calvinistic Methodists, a community that emerged under the leadership of outstanding organisers, orators and hymnwriters, and that developed some unusual tensions, including the influence of a female prophet who guided the decisions of leading preacher Howel Harris. The Welsh Methodist Society: The early societies in south-west Wales 1737-1750 will be essential reading for anyone investigating the early years of evangelicalism in the trans-Atlantic world.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of An introduction to John Owen (Crossway, 2020).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
