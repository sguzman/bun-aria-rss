  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has always enjoyed the spotlight, but not in the literal sense. Tickets are nearly sold out for the Kirk Minihane Ice Fishing Expedition to Madawaska, ME, but not everyone in the Barstool world is happy with how this is playing out. Minihane is not looking forward to having the Rough N' Rowdy fighters in studio tomorrow, but hey: he's a team player. Blind Mike doubles down on his defense of Louis C.K. following a hit piece in the L.A. Times. Minihane and Robinson spar over the fundamental question of cinema: Is Nick Cage the greatest living actor of all time? A new hit parody song leads Minihane to question his reality.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
