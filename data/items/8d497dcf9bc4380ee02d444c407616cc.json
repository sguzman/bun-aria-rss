According to the U.S. Department of \nLabor, more than 4.5 million people voluntarily left their jobs in November 2021—the \nlargest figure in the past two decades. This period has been dubbed the Great Resignation. \nAt the same time, wages and salaries have accelerated considerably and by the end of \n2021, inflation had hit its highest level since 1982.",
