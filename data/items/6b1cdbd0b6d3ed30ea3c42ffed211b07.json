  "description": "<p>As we prepare to take our summer break, we discuss the value of rest and recuperation. While some work requires consistency and regularity, we think making art is different and we both find our work ebbs and flows. Sometimes we are inspired and motivated to paint and other times we take a break and do something else, whether that is a vacation or simply a change of focus. Our conversation also turns to the pressure some of us impose upon ourselves to always be producing, and the benefits of just letting go of the idea of 9-5, 365 days a year. We will be testing out our own theories over the next few weeks as we take a summer break. Hopefully we will come back full of vim and vigour and ready to tackle a new season of the Art Juice podcast. See you then!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>How to Paint a Dead Man <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Paint-Dead-Sarah-Hall/dp/0571224903\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Paint-Dead-Sarah-Hall/dp/0571224903</a></p>\n<p>The Yellow House <a href=\"https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/books/martin-gayford/yellow-house/9780141016733\">https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/books/martin-gayford/yellow-house/9780141016733</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
