  "description": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally admitted inflation isn’t transitory… and his change of tune shook the markets. Daniel and I give our take on Powell’s comments and the market selloff that followed.  The Fed’s new stance marks the beginning of the end for the easy money policies we’ve seen since the start of the pandemic. We highlight several sectors and companies that will thrive… as well as ones that will suffer… as the Fed implements new policies to fend off inflation.  Rising inflation—not to mention the new COVID variant, Omicron—will mean more volatility in the coming weeks and months. Daniel shares a handful of “boring” stocks that investors should consider as we prepare for a shaky market.  We still don’t have a lot of data around Omicron... Yet, governments and markets are already overreacting. And individual investors can use these overblown fears to their advantage.  Jim Cramer recently made some alarming comments about using the military to enforce vaccines. Prepare for a rant...
