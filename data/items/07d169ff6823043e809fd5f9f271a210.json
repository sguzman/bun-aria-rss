  "description": "<p>A few weeks ago 19 black families made national news, when word broke that they purchased over 100 acres of land in rural Georgia to build their own self-sufficient town operated and controlled by them. The idea was to create a thriving safe haven for black families. What the press lacked was details on what the group's plans were. We had the great pleasure of sitting down with three members of the group. They explained their motivation for creating their own city. They told us the plan for expansion to buy more land. They also explained the steps to become an incorporated city, they detailed the expenses involved, they outlined the architectural plans, and more. In episode 108 we get a firsthand master class in developing and operating a city that started from scratch. #freedomGeorgia #groupeconomics #usdaloan EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com EYL University 40% off Annual Tuition Code: EYL Guest IG: @FreedomGA2020 Novae credit services: Novae Money - For Better Credit, Debt Elimination, Better Budgeting & Financial Literacy - Novae Money</p><p><br></p><p>Check out <a href=\"http://novaemoney.com/freedom\">http://novaemoney.com/freedom</a> to assist in you journey toward financial wellness, independence, and freedom</p><p>--- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
