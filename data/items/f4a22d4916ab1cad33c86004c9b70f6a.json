  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about how StoneDrill maybe succeeding Shamoon—it's more evasive and at least as destructive. Malwarebytes advises sticking to Google Play to avoid a new Trojan. Russian hackers—apparently mobsters who've copped some of Cozy Bear's MO—are blackmailing US progressive political groups. The University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security's Ben Yelin explains Amazon Alexa's role in a murder case. Neill Feather from SiteLock describes a Wordpress vulnerability.  Congress considers a bill to allow companies to hack back. WikiLeaks' Vault Seven seems mostly unsurprising. Washington wiretapping allegations prompt recriminations.",
