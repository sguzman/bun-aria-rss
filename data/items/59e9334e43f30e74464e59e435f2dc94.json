  "title": "357 - Jake Johannsen (@JakeThis)",
  "description": "<p>Jake Johannsen is a comedy legend. He was on David Letterman's show 14,682 times (more or less). His standup is so good that I often steal his jokes. And he's one of my closest buds. Join us in Jake's kitchen for a co-released wide-ranging conversation featuring the sexual frustration of marijuana plants, #metoo from a middle-aged white man's perspective (everyone loves to hear that!), and my awkward innuendos about how hot Jake's wife is. </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by</span> <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Basin and Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; “Deja Vu All Over Again,” by <a href=\"https://johnfogerty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Fogerty</a>; “Smoke Alarm,” by</span> <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carsie Blanton</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
