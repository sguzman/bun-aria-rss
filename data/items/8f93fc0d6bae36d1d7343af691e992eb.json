  "description": "<p>We are individuals, but we're also members of society. Economics generally deals with individual action whereas politics deals with the behavior of society as a whole.

When we talk about freedom, what kind of freedom are we talking about? Is it the ability to decide which goods and services we purchase and from whom without restriction? Is it being able to choose who represents our interests in government and which laws they create? And which is more important? Or is either of them?
