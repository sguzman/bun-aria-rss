  "description": "Not all history is learned - or taught - in school. In today's first interview, Robert Jones Jr. tells NPR's Scott Simon that he wanted to be 'a witness to [those] testimonies that have not made it into the official record.' His novel, <em>The Prophets</em>, is about enslaved Black queer people in America. The second interview is about the seemingly mundane day-to-day that makes up a person's history in <em>Zorrie</em>. Author Laird Hunt told NPR's Scott Simon that just because someone's story seems unremarkable doesn't mean it isn't rich.",
