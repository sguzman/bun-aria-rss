  "description": "Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm \n\nToday on the Matt Walsh Show, there is a crisis in our culture of lonely, disaffected young men. But anyone who speaks up for them, like Jordan Peterson, is villainized. Why? We’ll talk about that today. Also, a House hearing on abortion descends once again into anti-science nonsense. Vice has a puff piece about sex offenders that does not go according to plan. Kamala Harris is relatable, at least to me, for the first time. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with one of the great injustices and outrages of all time. It has to do with someone named Hailey Bieber and the color of her lipstick.\n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nJoin the Jeremy’s Razors Contest For The Car at https://www.jeremysrazors.com/play.
