  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, a faculty member at NYU says that transsexual liberation in and of itself is ineffective, but that the overall movement is about a communist revolution to abolish society as it currently exists. This sub-American Marxist movement is a force to be reckoned with because they've taken control of the culture. They run the universities, the media, and they run the Democrat Party. These movements are not imaginary, they want to rule your life, and cannot be ignored. Then, this January 6th committee is so insidious that Adam Schiff went as far as to doctor the transcripts of text messages from Mark Meadows's phone to misrepresent the facts during a congressional hearing considering a criminal referral to hold a former White House Chief of Staff in contempt of Congress. Later, US Senate candidate, combat veteran, and former Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel calls in to discuss his campaign and his support for President Trump's conservative policies. Mandel says that traditional Judeo-Christian values are under attack and must be defended if America is going to have a fighting chance of succeeding in the future. Afterward, there is no reason for Congress to have Trump's taxes; he’s a private citizen. You don't see Congress subpoenaing other former presidents as part of their legislative agenda to write tax policy. If the Republicans win the House in 2022 they must step up and stop this warped practice.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
