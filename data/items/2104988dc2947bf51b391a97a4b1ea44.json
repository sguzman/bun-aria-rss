We thank each and every one of our listeners for their support and for listening. Here's to a great year and an even better year to come! In this special, we introduce everyone to our HGB Research Crew - they share a little about themselves and their paranormal experiences along with answers to some \"tough\" questions we asked them - and we end the special answering listener questions. Enjoy!</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Help us to expand in our second year and become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
