  "description": "On this, the three-year anniversary of Harambe's tragic end, it's time to once again power through the grief, tighten our boot-straps, and ponder the ways in which we shall keep this republic steaming ahead. Is it possible to thwart the Left's mainstreaming of socialism? Will the Dems ever cease pushing the lies of collusion, obstruction, and cover-up? Will Trump be able to fix the crisis on the border? Can Biden pull off a 2020 win?\n\nJoin this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, and special guest Texas senator Ted Cruz, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
