  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of June, you reveal your summer bucket list, which makes your children cheer with anticipation. By July, you can’t find your list and by August, you’re tempted to check out until a new season starts. It’s no surprise we need the gospel to shape every expectation we have as we think about our summer plans. In this episode, Emily and Laura look towards the next three months and offer challenges to help us keep the right perspective as we plan, hope, and dream for summertime. We’re living for something much bigger than our summer plans, and God’s grace will sustain us as we persevere in motherhood—and to September.  </span></p> <p><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-133-summer-expectations-setting-our-sights-on-grace-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-133-summer-expectations-setting-our-sights-on-grace\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/75993/Copy_of_Regular_format-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p>",
