  "description": "<p>I will be speaking to Chris who was with the Indian tribal police for many years. Indian tribal police are peace officers hired by those Native American tribes which have a constitutional government on reservations, as opposed to hereditary chiefs. I spoke to him yesterday and he is going to come on the show and talk about some of the calls he received while on duty regarding Sasquatch. Chris still investigates reports today and is going to share some of those encounter stories as well.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to the father of the son who had an encounter just a few weeks ago. His son is still upset over the encounter below and who can blame him. The report goes as follows: \"My 15 year old son and his friend had left the camp to head down to the lake. As they were standing by the lake they heard something come down off of the ridge-line, my son turned around and was about 30 feet away from what he describes as an ape. The boys came running into camp, both white as ghosts. My son and his friend demanded that we leave. They were both in shock and shaking. I was finally able to calm them down enough to have them explain what happen. The boys said as they turned around they saw this HUGE thing staring at them. My son said it was taller then the basketball player Lebron James. Its head was round like a watermelon, his nose was flat and wide. The jaw on the creature was really wide, It was built like a bodybuilder. The creature was massive and ape-like in appearance. The boys said this thing just stood there starring at them. What has me puzzled is we have seen bear, cougar and the normal wildlife but both boys said it was ape-like.They were both terrified and shaking. After seeing the boys reaction and how upset both boys still are I really think they saw something. My son says he doesn't want to ever go in the woods again and wishes he would have never seen it.\"</p>",
