  "description": "The Delta variant is behind the big increase in the number of new Covid 19 cases in the UK since April. We take a look at what impact vaccines have had on infections, hospitalisations and deaths.\n\nChris Packham told viewers on the BBC’s Springwatch that blue tits eat 35 billion caterpillars a year. We get him onto the programme to explain.\n\nHow much does Type 2 diabetes cost the NHS a year? While exploring a dubious claim we find out why its hard to work that out.\n\nIs it true that on in two people will get cancer? We’ve looked at this statistic before but listeners keep spotting it on TV.\n\nWe also ask: if the SarsCov2 RNA is 96% similar to the RNA of a virus found in bats - is that similar, or not?",
