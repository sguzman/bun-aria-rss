  "itunes:summary": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 16\n\nIf you want to understand the present moment, especially how similar Wokeness seems to Mao's Cultural Revolution, you have to understand the  Italian communist Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci wrote a series of essays and  books while imprisoned by the Italian fascists in the 1920s and 1930s  that are referred to as his Prison Notebooks. These are the birthplace  of Cultural Marxism, which James Lindsay argues has evolved into \"Identity Marxism\" since. Once you understand Gramsci, you can easily  understand what is going on with our society at present and understand  more clearly than ever why it must be resisted. \n\nThough he didn't coin the term, the idea fellow communist Rudi Dutschke would name \"the long march through the institutions\" in 1967 is  ultimately Gramsci's roadmap to getting communism to take hold in the West. Gramsci identifies that the \"cultural hegemony\" of Western  cultures prevented communism from having any chance of taking root, so  he recommended a strategy that seeks to tear apart and capture major  cultural institutions, including religion, family, education, media, and  law. Mao understood this clearly and used it to devastating effect. The  same thing is happening throughout the West today. Join James Lindsay  as he explains the thought and relevance of Antonio Gramsci in today's  Woke movement, which he aptly brands \"Leninism 4.0.\"\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nnewdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\npinterest.com/newdiscourses/\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nhttp://bit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2021 New Discourses.
