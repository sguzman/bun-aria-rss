Andrew again had the midnight runs and realized that he needs to slow down on cauliflower pizza. They talk about relationships, communication and autonomy. You Heard It Here First, No, we will not be in your 'metaverse', a sad cab ride, Ric Flair is not eating some lady out on a train and in Andrew's Sports Moment they discuss an NBA star's opinion on college. The Fanthrax bag has a note about a 'Not Andrew', a superstition and besties talking in their sleep. In the Final Thought they try out karaoke mic modes and discuss FBoy Island's Casey's charm.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
