Or in the case of Attack of the Friday Monsters, the way we lived way back when.\nWe also talk about the week's big news: Microsoft's indie marketplace strategy.\nBut the monsters are the thrust of the episode. I should probably mention there's another large monster that makes an appearance. It's possible you've met him before. He's from New York and has a long neck.
