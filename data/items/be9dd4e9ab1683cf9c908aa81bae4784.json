    "media:description": "In this video I talk about the RSA Encryption Algorithm, and about the history of cryptography.\n\nPeople have been coding and decoding information ever since we learnt how to write. The Romans were one of the first to implement it, making what they considered to be the unbreakable 'Caesar Cipher'.  The cipher was able to win the Romans many wars.\n\nMany other types of codes have existed since then. The German Enigma is one of the most infamous, spectacularly confusing the British until Alan Turing along with some Polish scientists finally cracked it. The American Navajo code is also one of the most famous codes because it wasn't really a code- just another language.\n\nSince the invention of the internet, however, we've created highly useful algorithms that work using prime numbers: The RSA, to name one. The RSA is the algorithm used to secure your bank account transactions on the internet. Watch the video to find out more!\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music",
