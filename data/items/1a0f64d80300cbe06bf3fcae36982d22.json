  "description": "<p>Anne Le Naour is the technical and managing director for <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Château Meyney</a> of St-Estèphe in the Médoc of Bordeaux. She also manages the other properties of CA Grands Crus. The company is owned by the top bank that supports wine in France, Crédit Agricole Group (sometimes referred to as \"la banque verte\" due to its historical connections with farming). Its current portfolio includes Chateaux <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meyney</a>, 5th growth Grand Puy Ducasse in Pauillac, and Santenay in Burgundy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en/introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/anne-le-naour-credit-victoria-hardina-ca-grands-crus-60afa512646a2446246137.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"203\" /></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Le Naour is a trained oenologist with global experience and since she began at <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meyney</a> in 2016, she has transformed the Château, restructuring vineyards, improving viticulture, and moving towards organics. She has introduced better winemaking – less extraction, less obvious oak, and more care in handling vine and wine. Her deep knowledge of wine and winemaking, plus her unwavering dedication to quality has meant that the wines of <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Meyney</a> are attracting more attention than ever.</p> <p> </p> <p>These are exquisite wines, underpriced for what they are (<a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Meyney</a> is right next to second growth, Montrose, incidentally, even though it was unfairly omitted from the 1855 classification) and Anne joins to tell us about her outstanding career, the underappreciated area of St-Estèphe on the Left Bank, and the beautiful wines of the historic Château Meyney. <a href= \"https://youtu.be/dVfs-yGcqS8\">Here's my quick tasting video for a review.</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the notes from our conversation:</p> <ul> <li>We open with a discussion of <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meyney</a> and its heritage first an ecclesiastical property, then as a woman-owned property (that was, at that time, conspicuously left out of the 1855 classification), to the more recent family ownership and then to Credit Agricolé, the current owner.<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/meyney.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /></a><br /> <em>Photo: <a href=\"http://www.meyney.fr/en\">Château Meyney</a></em></p> <ul> <li>Anne gives an overview of her outstanding career, where she worked at chateaux and domaine in Champagne (Mumm), Burgundy, Loire, Bordeaux (at Château Beychevelle) --some of the biggest names in French wine.
