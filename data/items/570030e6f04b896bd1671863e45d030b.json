  "description": "<p>For the first week of our Advent 2020 series, Amanda and Raechel spend time with songwriter, podcast host, and comedian, Dave Barnes. During the episode, they explain how <em>Advent </em>is Latin for “arrival,” and talk about the importance of waiting as we prepare for Christmas Day. Dave compares this year to playing an accordion and shares two of his Christmas songs (but not his funky new version of Go, Tell It on the Mountain—we have to wait for that too!). Together, the three laugh about everything from mowing lawns to Instagram characters, and they offer some comforting answers to the profoundly multilayered and hope-filled question of why Jesus came.<br/><br/>Show notes: <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/advent-2020-week-1-with-dave-barnes/'>shereadstruth.com/podcast/advent-2020-week-1-with-dave-barnes/</a></p>",
