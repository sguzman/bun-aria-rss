  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) got it right when they struck down President Biden's unconstitutional federal vaccine mandate enforced by OSHA, and got it totally wrong on the healthcare case where SCOTUS ruled that healthcare workers in facilities receiving federal funds may keep their mandates in place. Later, Senator Mike Lee joins the show to discuss the 84 million Americans who were victorious in today's Supreme Court decision. Lee added that the Democrats are happy to take whatever they want to gain power. If Democrats succeed in destroying the filibuster, they will change election laws to make sure Democrats win and they will pack the court too. Then, the Department of Justice has indicted the founder of the Oath Keepers and 10 others with seditious conspiracy. Even this charge does not meet the legal standard to define January 6th, 2020 as an insurrection. The founder of the Oath Keeper is on record saying, \"All I see Trump doing is complaining. I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into their own hands.” This information only helps illustrate that Trump was not involved in any planned attacks. Not a single person has been charged with an attempt to overthrow the government.  Afterward, Marxism labeled as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) continues to seep into our culture under the guise of preventing racism. Amazingly, bigotry now has an academic veneer. Universities are now attempting to hire tenured staff based on race because of this movement. Yet there will be no effort for diversity of thought, ideology, or political perspectives.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
