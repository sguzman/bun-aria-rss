  "description": "<p>The guys start off debating whether The Carter 3 is a classic or not … no literally, this is the first sentence, so prepare for a music deep dive. Mal insists Wayne has no classic albums, and Rory and Demaris, as always, disagree with him, and ask him to give an example of a classic album to him, and he insists most “classics” are overhyped. This leads into a conversation about The Weeknd’s Dawn FX release, where the guys try to decipher what kind of woman and situation inspired this album (11:44). They comment on Timbaland’s ‘Thriller’ comparison, and then segue into a conversation about Gunna’s new album, and if he’s a better artist than Lil Baby (36:42). Gunna has all the kids saying “P”… so of course we had to figure out what that meant, and got into some emotional rapper discussions, including a ‘Deuces (Remix)’ breakdown (43:22). Of course we had to battle it out and debate who would win the Jaheim Vs. Usher Verzuz, as well as debate who could actually beat Usher (1:06:27). We also get into some sad sh*t (RIP Bob Saget), some bullsh*t (Did you too have a fake G-Shock?) + more!</p><p>To donate to the families affected by the tragic fire in the Bronx: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.gofundme.com/f/relief-for-families-at-333-e-183rd-st__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!f4_O-6UYQzCmvAapiN-w0xcERkaBoFdd4zAK_6VpM0ZfdiJV7wdkEsRluxK6AXmmGhnTzxeSQY1enHxKQCKjocwm305v$\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/relief-for-families-at-333-e-183rd-st</a></p>\n",
