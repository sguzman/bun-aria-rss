  "description": "In this episode we offer commentary on the ongoing exposure of Andy Savage and the allegations against him made by a former youth group attender many years ago. Mainly, this episode takes a look at hypotheticals and how the church might respond appropriately when horrific acts like this occur in your church. As this is still a LIVE conversation, details are in the gray. However, many of these stories over the years have come out and made to be true, and that's worth discussing as we are shocked and horrified at his church's response over the matter.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nIntroduction Music provided by Aaron Sprinkle available at www.soundstripe.com\nOutro music provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
