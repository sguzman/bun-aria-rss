For vulva owners, squirting is a thing of mystery - but it doesn’t need to be. In this special Best Of episode, I’m giving you my tips and firsthand experience with squirting as well as highlights of my conversation with sex educator Deborah Sundahl, who teaches us exactly how to squirt -- and I mean, step by step.</p><br><p>For example: did you know, vulva owners, that you have a prostate? That’s the g-spot, despite headlines you see every few months questioning its very existence. Also: did you know that clitoral orgasms and g-spot orgasms are two different things? Finally, with time and practice, did you know that EVERY vulva owner can squirt? It’s not magic -- it’s anatomy! Plus, I take your questions on squirting, from how to start, best positions to do it, and how to communicate to your partner what you want them to do.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Deborah Sundahl: <a href=\"https://deborahsundahl.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://deborahsundahl.com/product/female-ejaculation-and-the-g-spot-book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Book</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/sex-toys/p/GVD482632/liberator/fascinator-throw?lref=Srch%7Csex%2Bblanket%7Ca%7C1%7Cc%7C0%7C-relevance%7Csearch_page%7C0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fascinator Throw Ejaculation blanket</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
