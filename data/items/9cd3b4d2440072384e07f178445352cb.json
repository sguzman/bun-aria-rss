  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick's death stare at CBS reporter Dana Jacobson after she asked him a question about receiver Antonio Brown, whom the team had waived before their game against the New York Jets. There's always tension between the rights holders, who pay billions to show the games, and the teams and the league. Also discussed is what's next for Antonio Brown, who may file a grievance against the Patriots for his release. Brown was scheduled to be paid $1 million in salary, and another $9 million signing bonus. Also talked about is WGN's final broadcast of the Chicago Cubs. The over-the-air network has shown games since 1948. The Cubs, along with Sinclair, are starting their own regional sports network, Marquee Sports Network. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
