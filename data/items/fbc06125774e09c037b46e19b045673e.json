She pulls chunks off\nthe stick and eats it plain, explaining\ncream spun around into butter! Growing up\nwe ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon\nand butter, butter and cheese on green noodles,\nbutter melting in small pools in the hearts\nof Yorkshire puddings, butter better\nthan gravy staining white rice yellow,\nbutter glazing corn in slipping squares,\nbutter the lava in white volcanoes\nof hominy grits, butter softening\nin a white bowl to be creamed with white\nsugar, butter disappearing into\nwhipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple,\nbutter melted and curdy to pour\nover pancakes, butter licked off the plate\nwith warm Alaga syrup. When I picture\nthe good old days I am grinning greasy\nwith my brother, having watched the tiger\nchase his tail and turn to butter. We are\nMumbo and Jumbo’s children despite\nhistorical revision, despite\nour parent’s efforts, glowing from the inside\nout, one hundred megawatts of butter.\n</pre>\n<p>\"Butter\" by Elizabeth Alexander, from <em><a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/crave-radiance\" class=\"default\">CRAVE RADIANCE</a></em> by Elizabeth Alexander, copyright © 2012 Elizabeth Alexander.
