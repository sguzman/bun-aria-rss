Why is Andrew Luck higher than Carson Wentz? Is Tyrod Taylor/Baker Mayfield and Joe Flacco/Lamar Jackson being tied a little wink-wink situation? How did EA compensate for Lamar's Vick-like speed in the game? Could Joey Bosa be the next 99 overall player? Are the Jaguars the best defense in the game? Could the Browns be FUN to play with in Madden this year??? Can you play with Jay Cutler?
