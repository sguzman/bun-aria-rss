  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady OP works as a stringer, which is a person who drives to the scene of accidents or crimes and records the incident so they can sell the footage to news stations. One night, he manages to show up to a murder scene really early, even before the police arrive. When the cops show up they just assume that he's part of evidence collection, so the cops actually open the door and invite him to walk into the murder scene to start filming. A little while later, the actual evidence collection guys show up, and all the cops turn to stare at OP. Uh-oh.</p>\n",
