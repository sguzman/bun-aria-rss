  "description": "<p>This chat has been a long time in the making as I first fell in love with Pallbearer back in 2012 when they dropped their STAGGERING debut LP, \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4vcqtRCeKGALWvOg910jJi?si=9DOt94HtSACtPZRwohGrgQ\">Sorrow and Extinction</a>\" and then followed all of their subsequent releases. I had to bring Joseph on the show because not only do I love the band, but think that more people need to pay attention to what they are doing. Joseph and I speak about his experience being raised in an alternative religion, the Little Rock scene and ambition amongst many other things.
