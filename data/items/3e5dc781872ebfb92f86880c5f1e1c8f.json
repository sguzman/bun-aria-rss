  "title": "Black bluegrass musician Arnold Shultz's forgotten legacy; Preparing for a hurricane",
  "description": "As Hurricane Ian bears down on Florida, residents in several counties are under an evacuation order. Hillsborough County Fire Chief Dennis Jones describes how local residents are preparing for the region's biggest hurricane in 101 years. Then, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor Jeremy Siegel explains why the Federal Reserve's policy of hiking interest rates could lead to a major recession. And, many credit Bill Monroe as the \"father\" of Bluegrass. But when you listen to his music, you hear echoes of the man who mentored Monroe — Arnold Shultz, the son of a formerly enslaved man in Ohio Country, Kentucky. Among those working to restore that legacy is Dr. Richard Brown, a dentist and acclaimed mandolin player.",
