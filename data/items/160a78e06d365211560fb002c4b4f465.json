  "description": "<p>In this week’s episode, John Maxwell continues his lesson on how to gain the influence of those you lead. He points out that as you climb to higher levels in your influence, you don’t leave behind the previous levels, but instead, you build off of them.</p> <p>John also talks about the importance of consistent growth as a leader. In his words, “When you stop growing, your people stop going.” Consistency gives your team a reason to trust you and depend on your guidance.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Jason Brooks pick up the discussion portion of this episode with an insightful conversation about how leaders can sense, seize, and implement the value they see in others and those they lead to harness and exercise those qualities within them.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Moral Authority Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
