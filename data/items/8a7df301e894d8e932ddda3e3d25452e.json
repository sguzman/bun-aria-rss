  "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how we came to be doing what we're doing? If so, the next two episodes are for you. This week, we're diving into Alice's story, in a conversation led by Louise. You'll learn all about Alice's journey from graphic design to a full-time career as an artist, and what exactly that entails. We travel through Alice's past, talk about the role depression played in making her an artist, and explore the idea of intentionality ... how much of what we do is clearly envisaged from the outset versus that which is arrived a gradually and in incremental steps. Finally, we discuss Connected Artist Club, the online membership group that Alice built from fledgling idea into thriving community.
