In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas of the first two chapters, revealing both how religious Freire is and how Marxist. Part 1, covering the first two chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/). \n\nIn this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James tackles the next two chapters of this book, chapters three and four, wherein it becomes abundantly clear that \"Culturally Relevant Teaching\" (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/02/critical-education-what-is-culturally-relevant-pedagogy/) is an Identity Marxist repackaging of Freirean education. His discussion highlights how messianic Freire is and pointing out that, in some sense, Freire's Critical Pedagogy stands in analogous relationship to the Gospel of John for the Marxist Theology (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/). Freire's idea is that literacy means political literacy as understood in the Marxist way: formal education is bourgeois and Critical Education is a revolutionary praxis that can transform the oppressive state of the world. Freire's point, though, is positively religious, in the Johnnine sense in that his goal is to teach the word so the conscious can learn to speak the world. Join James Lindsay to unpack even more of what it means that all of our children now go to Paulo Freire's Marxist Sunday Schools.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
