To start off, the guys discuss how the Ravens' pass rush showed up against the Texans (2:54). Next, the trio look at the Vikings' comeback win over the Broncos and their impressive second half performance (8:24). Then, the guys analyze how Cowboys' QB Dak Prescott is proving his worth after his dominant game vs. the Lions (11:31). Later, they go into detail on Raiders' head coach Jon Gruden's positive impact on QB Derek Carr, as Carr is playing great football this season (23:18). Bucky also points out Jimmy Garoppolo's clutch moment from Week 11, but goes on to discuss why he's still the weakest link on the 49ers (35:56). To wrap up the episode, the trio talk about the Rams making running back Todd Gurley the focal point of their offense once again (46:10).
