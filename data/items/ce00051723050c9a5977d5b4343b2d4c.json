  "description": "This week, the gals explore some crimes committed in the untamed wilderness of our greatest national treasures, joined by special guest and renowned investigator Jeff Rinek. Topics include a bloody legal loophole in Idaho, a pair of hikers who met a grisly end, and a possible alien (or cougar or eagle or human) abduction. Open up a beautiful bottle of National Parks Foundation Yosemite Red, check in at the nearest ranger station, and tune in for No Man's Land Murders.",
