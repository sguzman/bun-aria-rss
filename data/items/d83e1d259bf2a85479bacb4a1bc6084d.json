  "itunes:summary": "I belong to a squash club that is also a gym. Each year on 1 January they bring in extra gym equipment. The place is packed out. By about 7 January, they move out all the extra equipment, as most people have given up their New Year’s resolutions, and the club returns to normal!\n\nGet fit\nLose weight\nReduce drinking\nStop smoking\nGet out of debt\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making these common New Year’s resolutions. Of course, all of us make resolutions that we fail to keep.\nThe good news is that each year is an opportunity for a fresh start. But then so is each week. Every Sunday is the first day of the week – a new beginning. Actually, every day is an opportunity for a new beginning.\nThe first three words in the Bible are, ‘In the beginning…’ (Genesis 1:1). Each of the passages for today tells us something about new beginnings and new opportunities, and suggests some possible New Year’s resolutions.",
