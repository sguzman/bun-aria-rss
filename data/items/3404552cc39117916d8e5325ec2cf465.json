  "description": "<p>Tonight we speak to Mo who had a sighting while out hiking with his kids. The children were playing and Mo looked up to see a figure just outside of the treeline watching them. When the creature and Mo made eye contact the creature then backed up into the brush. Mo, terrified for their safety, quickly left the area with his kids. This day has haunted him since. Mo continues to look for the creature he saw that day. Since this event he has had another brief sighting and different events in the woods that have shaken him up.</p>",
