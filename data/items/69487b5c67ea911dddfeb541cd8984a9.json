  "description": "Listening to FBI Director Christopher Wray before the Congress this week and last, his answers were long and yet achieved a kind of studied vacuousness. There was no there there. No substantive. No sense of responsibility for clear intelligence failures. No sense that we were getting to the root causes of the event. No sense that those really responsible for it will be brought to justice. And for all the reasons there was no sense that we will be able to avoid other such events in the future. Former FBI agent Frank Figliuzzi believes we won't. Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and his co-host David Rothkopf speak to Figliuzzi and former US attorney Barb McQuade about the questions Wray and others need to be asked...and answer. Join us for a substantive and disturbing conversation.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
