And how do comic books fit into modern day mythology? Have you considered having a guest perform one of their key skills with you and then deconstruct it during the show? (e.g. red teaming with Tim Ferriss) Tom I'm thinking of leaving my secure job with a great pension. I want to go into teaching but I still want to be more secure in what I want to do. Any suggestions? Wish I had had this content when I was 20 instead of 70. Listen up when you are young enough to put these life and job skills to work for you. Any suggestions for us retired folks?
