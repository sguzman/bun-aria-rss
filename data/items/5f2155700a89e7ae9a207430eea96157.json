  "description": "<p>Show Notes:</p>\n<p>Welcome to our Q+R on the Son of Man! Thank you to everyone who sent in questions. Here are the questions we responded to:</p>\n<p>Matt from Australia: (0:55)<br />\nI've got a question about humans and animals. It seems like animals get a really bad rap. You've been talking about when humans don't pass the test or live as they're made to live, they're not truly the image of God, they act less than human or to be true, they act like animals. And I'm wondering what about animals is so bad or so wrong? Or are you trying to communicate about a different reality than an animal? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Petra from the Netherlands: (6:20)<br />\nIn the podcast (The Empty Throne), Tim refers to the Empty Throne in Daniel 7, but if I read Daniel 7 in different translations, vs 9 says \"thrones\" and vs 10 \"the court place.\" So I get the conclusion that thrones are set for the court. In Matthew 19:28, Jesus tells his disciples that they will sit on the 12 thrones and judge the 12 tribes of Israel. I don't assume that's specific because in Revelation it says 24. My question is, where do you get the conclusion that the empty throne refers to the Son of Man because I come to the conclusion that it refers to the court. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Rachel from Delaware: (12:35)<br />\nThis is a question I've always had: where is Daniel in Daniel 3?</p>\n<p>Stephanie from Virginia: (21:05)<br />\nMy question is, why is Daniel portrayed as a new human, a new Adam, when he is not THE new human, the Messiah to come?</p>\n<p>John from North Wales: (21:20)<br />\nI've found this series on the Son of Man really exciting. I have a question about Daniel. I was struck when you were taking us through those first chapters in the book of Daniel that Daniel himself actually seems to be a flawless human being. My working paradigm was that there are no heroes in the Old Testament except for God himself, but Daniel does actually seems to pass the test (or at least to not really fail the test at any particular point). So how do you interpret the figure of Daniel? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Sam from Ohio: (26:04)<br />\nIn Daniel 7:18, 22, 27, it speaks of the saints being given the dominion and kingdom to possess forever. Verse 27 ends by saying, \"All dominions shall serve and obey them.\" But the ESV footnote says it might end by saying, \"All dominions shall serve and obey him.\" Is it a possible interpretation to view the Son of Man as a figurative representation of all the saints of the Most High rather than a specific individual? Or what is the connection between the individual and the collective groups of saints? Thanks!</p>\n<p>Douglas from Rwanda: (40:15)<br />\nI was curious about the use of the word \"son of man\" in other Old Testament books such as Ezekiel. Ezekiel appears to be written before Daniel and they use the exact same word \"son of man.\" I wonder if you know if it has a different meaning, and if not, how is it related to Daniel's use of \"son of man?\" Thank you!</p>\n<p>Ivan from El Salvador: (43:20)<br />\nI love the conversation about the Son of God and how he's someone God gave that title. How, with that definition, do we read John 1:12 that whoever receives him will be called a son of God? How do we understand that, or does John have a different definition in mind?</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of our supporters!</p>\n<p>Find more resources at www.thebibleproject.com</p>\n<p>Show produced by:<br />\nDan Gummel, Jon Collins</p>\n<p>Theme music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents</p>\n",
