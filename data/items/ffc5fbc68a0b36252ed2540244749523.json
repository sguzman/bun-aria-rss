  "description": "<p>Tonight we will be welcoming former police officer Brian Gosselin to the show to discuss his encounter and his new book Abair Road, The True Story.</p> <p>In August 1976, Police Officer Brian Gosselin had a face-to-face encounter with a Bigfoot-type creature on Abair Road in Whitehall, NY. This event set off a firestorm of publicity and has become a landmark case that has withstood the test of time. Brian encountered this creature just 30 feet in front of him, in his spotlight, with his pistol pointed directly at it, but he did not shoot. In “Abair Road, The True Story,” Brian shares the events that took place that night along with a great deal of information that has never been shared before.</p> <p><strong>Check out the book:</strong> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Abair-Road-True-Story-Gosselin/dp/1983903019/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517158289&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Brian+Gosselin+bigfoot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Abair Road The True Story</strong></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Will also be welcoming Greg who shares an encounter from his childhood.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our final guest tonight is Christopher Noel. Christopher Noel is a Burlington, Vermont-based Sasquatch researcher. Noel brings to his study an academic tone, and rightly so. For two decades, this Yale philosophy graduate taught at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.</p> <p>Chris writes \"We need a radically new approach to Sasquatch research. For much too long, we have stereotyped our next of kin, certain that they must confine themselves only to the most remote wilderness, occasionally sneaking up to campsites just long enough to scare the hell out of us before withdrawing once again to the far corners of the forest. Incorrect.
