  "description": "<p>Want to create an online experiment?  Here's how to do it.  I'll show you can create an experiment using two tools: Wix.com and Google Forms.  Using these two tools, you'll be able to get creative and put together an experiment online that others can take.  You'll even be able to collect the data.  In this episode of The Psych Files I'll use as an example a very do-able recent study which shows that people tend to overestimage the height of a building when they are on the roof looking down to the ground than when they are on the ground looking up to the roof.  The explanation for this is that evolutionarily, those who overestimated distances looking down were probably more likely to survive - because they probably backed away from the edge and prevented themselves from falling and killing themselves. Both students and faculty might be interested to see how this study could be set up online.</p>",
