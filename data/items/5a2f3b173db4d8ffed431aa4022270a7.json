So you can focus on the trigger, [...] or you can focus, ‘oh what’s exploding inside of me and how long have I been carrying this?’ [1:37:01]   “You have to have the compassion to look at yourself not through the voice that tells you you’re worthless, but to say if I reacted that way it must be a good reason for it. Something in me, there’s something that happened to me that made me react that way at some point” [1:39:35]   “There’s all kinds of memory and the body carries memory even if it doesn’t carry recall” [1:41:45] FOLLOW GABOR: Website: <a href=\"https://drgabormate.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://drgabormate.com</a>/  Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com</a>/drgabormate  Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/drgabormate/?ref\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/drgabormate/?ref</a>=hl  Youtube:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRF06lSFA8zV9L8\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRF06lSFA8zV9L8</a>_x9jzIA ",
