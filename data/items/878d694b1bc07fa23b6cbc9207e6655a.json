  "description": "<p>This week we are once again moving away from our coverage of economic titans and sharing with you another of our topical \"specials\".&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So... &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Climate change…it’s a hot topic but what light if any can conventional economics shed on it? In this environmental special, your friendly neighbourhood economists Pete and Gav look at various different theories that try to address how economics can solve the existential problem of environmental destruction! So if you want to know what steady-state economics is or have wondered what the ‘tragedy of the commons’ means, then have a listen. And who knows, by the end, you might have more inclination to become vegan (or at least cut down on your meat consumption). vowed to use public transport more and be itching to find out what your carbon footprint is. As always with technical support from Nic and music from Jukedeck - create your own at Jukedeck.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
