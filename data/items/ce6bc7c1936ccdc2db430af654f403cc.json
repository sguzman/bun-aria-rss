  "description": "<p>In 1995, Angie Hicks lent her name to her new company, a service that crowdsourced reviews of local businesses. “It seemed like one of those inconsequential decisions you make when you’re 22,” says Hicks. It turned out to be anything but inconsequential, as her company, Angie’s List, would become a household name and a major player in the home services industry. In this episode of the Business of Home podcast, she talks with host Dennis Scully about the company’s humble beginnings in 1995, why the housing crisis was an opportunity in disguise, and how the interior design profession has changed over the years. This episode is sponsored by High Point Market.</p>\n",
