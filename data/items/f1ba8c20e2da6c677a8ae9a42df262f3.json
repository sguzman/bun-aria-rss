    "media:description": "By now, I’m sure you’ve heard about the new 4000 series of GPUs from Nvidia. As many of us expected, the 4000 series is not cheap by any means. In fact, it’s actually extremely expensive with the top end 4090 coming in at $1600. But, this raises the question, how much exactly does Nvidia even profit from their GPUs? Well, fortunately for us, Nvidia is a public company meaning that all of their revenue and profit figures and public information. Nvidia’s latest gross margins come in at over 60% and their net margins come in at 26% which is even higher than Apple's. It’s not just Nvidia that has these insane margins though. Virtually all semiconductor companies from AMD and Qualcomm to Intel and Applied Materials have these insane margins. These crazy margins extend to their suppliers as well which mainly include TSMC and ASML. This video explains how the semiconductor industry become so profitable and when semiconductor margins will finally cool down. \n\nDiscord Community: \nhttps://discord.gg/SJUNWNt\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Semiconductor Margins\n3:16 - Fundamental Risk\n6:30 - Unprecedented Demand\n9:57 - The End Is Near\n\nThumbnail Credit: \nhttps://bit.ly/3Erd3p1\n\nResources:\nhttps://pastebin.com/4igEM61A",
