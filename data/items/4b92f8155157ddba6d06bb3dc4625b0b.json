The same strong drive and collaboration that makes our Fellows successful in our program helps them become leaders in their fields. Our Fellows lead teams at industry pioneers like Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Capital One, CVS, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify, Stitch Fix, Tamr, Twitch, Twitter, The New York Times, Uber, Wayfair, and Yelp. Our Fellows also lead teams at hundreds of high-growth startups, and several alumni have gone on to start their own innovative startups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ftYNd4xudFg31zy6\" /><figcaption>Source: Data reported from Fellows that completed Insight 2017–2019, compared to corresponding market data reported on Glassdoor in May 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>The most rewarding part of our program, and the reason Insight exists, is the experience we provide for our Fellows.
