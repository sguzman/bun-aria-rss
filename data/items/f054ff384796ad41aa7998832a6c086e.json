  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak with William who had an encounter with Sasquatch in Washington State. He was out with his church group camping, and he and a friend woke up early one morning and saw a Sasquatch walking away from their camp. The encounter has stuck with him all of his life. He wrote a small paper on his encounter. William is a working professional and spoke to a friend of his who is also a professional who had an encounter but did not want to come forward. Listen as William describes what he saw that day in Washington State.</p> <p>My second guest is Dawn from Oklahoma. Dawn had a sighting of a creature on an abandoned home and describes some strange experiences on and around her property.</p>",
