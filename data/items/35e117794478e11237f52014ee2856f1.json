  "description": "<p>Today (September 18), Bishop Barron will be speaking to Facebook employees at their headquarters in Menlo Park, CA, on \"How to Have a Religious Argument.\" (The talk will be livestreamed on <a href=\"http://facebook.com/bishoprobertbarron\">Bishop Barron's Facebook page</a> from 6:00pm-7:00pm ET.)</p> <p>Every day, millions of people argue about religion on social media. The comboxes of religious and atheist sites are among the most visited and the most heated in the virtual space. But what Bishop Robert Barron finds interesting is how few people really know how to have a good religious argument. There is a lot of energy, lots of sharp words, and lots of strong feelings expressed. But rarely do we come across productive, rational argument about religion. Bishop Barron paves a way forward, showing how we all, believer and nonbeliever alike, can share better religious discussions.</p> <p><em><strong>SPECIAL: Pre-order the hardcover book today for just $19.95 (26% off) and free shipping.
