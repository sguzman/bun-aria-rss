  "description": "<p>Where do you stand on the income ladder? Do you think of yourself as rich, as poor, or as somewhere in between? Our perceptions of wealth — our own, and other people's — can affect us more profoundly than we realize. This week in our Money 2.0 series, we revisit two of our favorite conversations about wealth and inequality. Sociologist Brook Harrington takes us inside the lives of the über wealthy and the people who manage their fortunes. Then, psychologist Keith Payne shares surprising research about income inequality and how it shapes our minds. </p><p><i>If you like this show, be sure to listen to the other episodes in this series, including </i><a href=\"https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/money-2-0-rewrite-your-money-story/\"><i>our conversation</i></a><i> about the mental scripts that shape our choices around money.</i></p><p><i>Also, check out our new podcast, </i><a href=\"https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/\"><i>My Unsung Hero</i></a><i>!
