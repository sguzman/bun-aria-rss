  "description": "<div>The UK's vaccine programme was hailed by the government as a success story for Global Britain. It became an example of how Britain could speed up regulation, reduce bureaucracy and become a worldwide home for tech and innovation in life sciences. <br>\n<br>\nThe government recently published a Life Sciences Vision, but how much vision was there? This podcast will look at the importance of the industry, the hurdles that it faces and its contribution to the government's Global Britain agenda. <br>\n<br>\nFraser Nelson, the editor of <em>The Spectator </em>is joined by Anthony Browne, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire; Zoe Martin, a policy manager at Cancer Research and Samin Saeed who is the medical director & chief scientific officer for Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd. <br>\n<br>\n<em>This podcast is kindly sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd.</em>\n</div>\n",
