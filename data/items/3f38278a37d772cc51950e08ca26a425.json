  "title": "Ep. 267: What Sets a Room Apart with Lorraine Enwright",
  "description": "Today we welcome award-winning designer Lorraine Enwright. Lorraine was the lead designer of the 2021 Serenbe Showhouse, and she also recently won Bath of the Year from Atlanta Homes & Lifestyles. We chat with Lorraine about what sets a room apart to achieve a designer look. We discuss the main differences in using a designer vs. going at it alone, why focal points are so important, and why Lorraine says the last 5% is the most important part of the room design.\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nWhat are the main differences between those rooms done by a designer vs. a homeowner?\n\nWhat resources does a designer have at their disposal?\n\nWhere do you begin the discovery process for a client that doesn’t know what they want?\n\nHow can someone understand scale and spatial relationships?\n\nWhy an emotional and instinctual connection to a style is important to pay attention to.\n\nThe details and last layers in the space are what really complete a room.\n\nWhere do people often go wrong with their details without using a designer?\n\nWhy odd numbers and asymmetry work best in design.\n\nHow often should you rotate or repurpose pieces, if at all?\n\nAre there any times when you can ignore scale?\n\nEvery room has to have its focal point(s).\n\nIf you want to be bold or add drama, how do you know where to do it?\n\nHow to make an oversized room feel cozy.\n\nHow to work with the windows and lighting your space has.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nHi “T. Schwartz”,\nNormally I would suggest Roman shades, but with kids, you might want to think about roller shades. You can use really any fabric you like to customize, so they work really well and look great. You could also consider indoor shutters. If you’re wanting a uniform look from the outside of the house, both shutters or roller shades are a great choice. If you really want to do Roman shades, I would recommend having the backs of them look similar from the outside. I love woven shades for that reason. If you don’t want to worry about the chords from Roman shades you could always motorize them; especially if you’re using an installer.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\n\nIntuitive Dwellings by Enwright Designs\n\nIntuitive Dwellings on Instagram\n\nSerenbe Showhouse\n\nBath of the Year\n\nThe Schwartz House\n\n\nFind all of the show notes on our blog, howtodecorate.com/podcast",
