  "description": "We continue our review of historical blood weeks with a trip to Thanksgiving Week, 2010. Ralph Friedgen was still at Maryland. Mike Stoops was still at Arizona. Dabo and Clemson went 6-7! These were different times, but that does not mean there was an absence of ranking upheaval, even if it cost us one of our best shots at a non-power making the BCS Championship.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
