  "description": "<p>Mental illness has been stigmatized in society since the beginning of time. And although society as a whole is becoming more educated and compassionate about this issue, we still have a long way to go in terms of changing the paradigm around mental illness. Today’s guest is leading the charge on this issue.</p> <p>Dr. Daniel Amen is a psychiatrist, speaker, 10-time New York Times bestselling author, and one of my great teachers in life. Today he’s back on The Model Health Show to share the paradigm-shifting information from his new book, <em>The End of Mental Illness.</em> This information encompasses everything from improving the health of the brain to alter your emotions to physically shifting the way your body operates through brain health.</p> <p>Your brain dictates your behavior, the way you see the world around you, and your overall health. I hope Dr. Amen’s insights will inspire you to change the way you think about mental health and begin taking steps toward creating and sustaining a healthier brain.
