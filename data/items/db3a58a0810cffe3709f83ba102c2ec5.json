Did he think there was a way to find re-enchantment without abandoning these values? And what would he have had to say about social media and its power to distract? The hosts have an enchanting time with Margaret Cohen from Stanford University, author of \"Profane Illumination: Walter Benjamin and the Paris of Surrealist Revolution.\"",
