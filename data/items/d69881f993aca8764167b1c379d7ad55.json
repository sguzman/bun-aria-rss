  "description": "<p>Week one of the coronavirus pandemic is over, and the Kirk Minihane Show is still going strong. Sadly, Blind Mike's foray into the stock market hasn't been as profitable as the investments made by certain elected officials, leading Mike to wonder why insider trading is even illegal. Hmm (0:13:37). Kirk and Steve continue to disagree over the severity of the virus (0:22:57). The prank calls continue to pour in as more and more Minifans spread good, accurate information about surviving the plague. We open up the phone lines and get a surprise call from NYC (1:39:21).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
