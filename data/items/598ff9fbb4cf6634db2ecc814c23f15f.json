The announcement came on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump pulling the U.S. out of the deal that was also signed by France, Britain, Germany, Russia, and China. Andrew Mach speaks with Bloomberg News State Department reporter Nick Wadhams to discuss the implications of this announcement, especially in light of renewed U.S. pressure on Iran through sanctions on metals and an increased military presence in the region. \n----\nTicToc is a daily news podcast hosted by Andrew Mach (@andrewjmach), produced at Bloomberg Worldwide HQ in New York City.
