  "description": "Welcome to Episode #3 of 'Knowledge Bites', where I discuss some of the concepts, theories and models I come across when reading books for my One Minute Book Review channel. In this episode, I will be giving a brief introduction to 'Logotherapy' and its place in psychoanalysis and individual psychology. I have made a concerted effort to keep this episode simple as it can be over-complicated easily. I came across this concept when reading 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen R. Covey and thought due to its impact on me, would be a great addition to knowledge bites.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
