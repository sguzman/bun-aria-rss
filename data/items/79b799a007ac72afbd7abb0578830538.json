  "description": "<p>October 30, 2016. Washington, D.C. During the 2016 Presidential election campaign in the USA, a conspiracy began to be posted about on message boards, facebook, and twitter. It apparently began after WikiLeaks made John Podesta's personal emails public. Hillary Clinton's campaign manager didn't have anything obvious in those emails that spelled out a conspiracy in government involving a \"child sex ring\" but believers in the conspiracy pointed to what they say were coded messages. At the center of this was a Washington D.C. restaurant named Comet Ping Pong. It was rumored that children were being held there. The pizza place's social media accounts were scoured and more 'evidence' of secret activities were unearthed. One man, a father of two, decided to take matters into his own hands and drove to the restaurant armed with various weapons, including an AR-15 rifle. So, was there a conspiracy involving pedophiles in government? Or was there something else at work behind the conspiracy known as Pizzagate?</p><p>Sponsors on this episode:</p><p>ThirdLove: thirdlove.com/genwhy for 15% off your first purchase. _</p><p>Joybird: joybird.com/genwhy and use code GENWHY for 25% off your first order.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
