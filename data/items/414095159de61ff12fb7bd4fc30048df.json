The crypto currency $Eternal saw a massive dump after a steady rise in value.\n\nCryptomines is a Play to Earn game. The game consists of you minting NFTs of workers and ships inorder to build a fleet of which you use to mine planets for profit. The reward for a successful mission is limited or set in stone and you have a chance to fail the mission meaning that you don't make any money back. \n\nEverything you do requires investment using their now failed crypto currency $Eternal. \n\nPlay to Earn isn't the right word for this, Pay to Earn is.",
