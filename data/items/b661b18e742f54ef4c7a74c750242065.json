They are mentioned in the credits of the video :)\n\nThis is my video series about Linear Algebra. I hope that it will help everyone who wants to learn about it.\n\nThis is the start of my series about Linear Algebra. Here we talk about examples of  linear maps. We visualise these with houses in the 2-dimensional plane.\n\nI hope that this helps students, pupils and others. Have fun!\n\n#LinearAlgebra\n\n(This explanation fits to lectures for students in their first and second year of study: Mathematics for physicists, Mathematics for the natural science, Mathematics for engineers and so on)",
