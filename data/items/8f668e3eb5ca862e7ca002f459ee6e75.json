  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane admits he got a little angry last week and went too far in attacking... Gerry Callahan. Minihane accepts the apology of his producer after last week's throw down. Did El Pres make the right call in firing former Barstool Sports writer Francis Ellis? Minihane and Blind Mike disagree. Minihane also disagrees with the decision of his former employer to spike a column critical of Julian Edelman's new documentary. A New York Times story about gender reveal parties pisses Minihane off almost as much as the media orgy over a bunch of millionaires playing baseball in a different country.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
