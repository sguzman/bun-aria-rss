  "description": "<p><em><strong>Culture War Refugees</strong></em>. Today, Tim Gombis beams in from his porch to discuss a theological understanding of the culture wars and how we're supposed to posture ourselves in these times. How nuanced is the conversation? What is the history of these topics and where do we enter them? Why does the Church need to have enemies? How does that define us? If it isn't prudent or productive to engage in these \"wars,\" how do we respond? Where is Jesus in this conversation?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
