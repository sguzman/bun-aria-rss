  "description": "<div>Today, Darkness Radio explores The Amazing Afterlife of Animals with Animal Communicator/Author, Karen A. Anderson!<br>\n<br>\nFrom a young age, Karen has had the ability to tell what animals were thinking and feeling, but it was only when a friend, and business partner double crossed her and , that she decided to start mucking out horse stalls, that hints of her true calling started to flourish!  It wasn't until an otherworldly animal discussion, which Karen tells us about. that her universe truly opens up! <br>\n<br>\nKaren also tells us how to move through our grief, how our animals are doing on the other side, and why we shouldn't grieve as much as we do when they pass on. <br>\n<br>\nKaren has a free app that helps you deal with pet loss and gives you hope and healing, and you can get her two books, \"The Amazing Afterlife of Animals\" and \"Hear All Creatures\" by clicking this link:  <a href=\"https://www.karenanderson.net/\">https://www.karenanderson.net/</a><br>\n<br>\n#paranormal #supernatural #metaphysical #paranormalpodcasts #darknessradio #timdennis #petpsychic #animalcommunicator #psychic #medium #spirits #ghosts #afterlife #pets #dogs #cats #birds #fish #lizards #ferrets #gerbils #goldfish #rats #earthboundspirits #rainbowbridge #messagesfrombeyond #animalsintheafterlife </div>\n",
