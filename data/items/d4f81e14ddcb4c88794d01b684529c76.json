  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Russian troops are busy murdering torturing, raping, and molesting Ukrainian citizens. When Russians in Moscow speak out, they're sent to a modern-day gulag for years. Unless the Ukrainians get the military equipment they need their people will continue to be brutalized. Then, U.S Senators Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski have announced that they will vote for the most radical person ever nominated to the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. She rejects natural human rights derived from God, and therefore our founding, and promotes Critical Race Theory. She is an extreme radical that has coddled users of child pornography and other crimes against children. Later, Senator Marsha Blackburn calls in to discuss the danger of confirming Judge Jackson. Blackburn agreed with this program's warning that Jackson will be a voice on the court for the dissolution of this country, the erosion of the family, and the end of faith. Afterward, Elon Musk might be one of the few individuals that can right the ship at Twitter regarding censorship, free speech, and preventing propaganda. Now President Biden's SEC is going after Musk to force him to disclose his majority stake in Twitter. Finally, Kelly Tshibaka the candidate for Senate in Alaska calls in to discuss why she's challenging Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
