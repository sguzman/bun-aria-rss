  "description": "<p>Every year, we learn more about the role and function of the gut microbiome. Our microbiome plays a tremendous role in our overall health including regulating our immune system, body composition, and so much more. But even with our ever-expanding understanding of the microbiome, our modern-day habits and practices are failing to support our gut health. </p> <p>On this episode of The Model Health Show, our guest is Dr. Emeran Mayer. Dr. Mayer is a world-renowned gastroenterologist and neuroscientist, one of the world’s most foremost experts on the gut-brain connection, and the author of the new groundbreaking book, The Gut-Immune Connection. On today’s show, he’s sharing incredible insights from his work on gut microbes, human immune health, and how optimizing your microbiome can impact your state of health. </p> <p>You’re going to hear Dr. Mayer’s work on the link between the microbiome and common Western diseases and how our compromised microbiomes are making us more susceptible to viruses. This episode also contains conversations on food quality and policy, antibiotic use, and real-world tips you can implement to support the health of your microbiome.
