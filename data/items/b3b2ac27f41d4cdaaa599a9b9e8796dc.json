Tom Brady is winning playoff games and not in New England. TBxTB and the Bucs defeated the Washington Football team in a great Saturday night showdown against an electrifying Tyler Heinicke (41:25). The Rams defense shredded Russ and the rest of the Seattle Seahawks. (48:50) The Buffalo Bills won a playoff game! The Colts put up a great fight but couldn't pull it off in the last few seconds (59:13).<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
