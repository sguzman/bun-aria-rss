  "description": "<p>A Jesus who’s a projection of your own desires can’t contradict you, can’t change you, and can’t help you. If you’re going to have a Jesus who really helps you or changes you, it has to be a Jesus with his own reality. We find the real Jesus in the New Testament Gospels. In this passage, we see: 1) The richness of Jesus’s interior life with God; 2) The richness of Jesus’s external ministry to others; and 3) How we can grow in that same wealth of character and power.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on February 5, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 1:35-45.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
