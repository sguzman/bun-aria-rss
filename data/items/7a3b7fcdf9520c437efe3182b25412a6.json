That chat helped inspire Balchunas&rsquo;s new book, &ldquo;The Bogle Effect,&rdquo; about the Vanguard founder&rsquo;s influence on investing and the financial industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On this episode of the podcast,&nbsp;Balchunas and Weber&nbsp;are joined by reporter Annie Massa to go over some of the bigger points Balchunas makes in his book. They go over why Vanguard&rsquo;s ownership structure was the real innovation, and how the rise of passive investing is pushing active managers to get way more active. They also discuss the writing process and Balchunas&rsquo;s motivation for publishing his second book.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
