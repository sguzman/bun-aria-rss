Our guests included Michael Govan, director, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); Doryun Chong, deputy director and chief curator, M+ in Hong Kong; and Allan Schwartzman. The panel was introduced by Kevin Ching, CEO of Sotheby’s Asia and moderated by Charlotte Burns. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Joining us remotely was Budi Tek, the founder of the Yuz Museum and Foundation, Shanghai, who broke the news of an unprecedented collaboration between Yuz and LACMA. This opened a discussion about the increasing willingness of museum directors and private patrons to collaborate and share. Our panelists also spoke about where innovation is taking place geographically; about cultural norms and how they manifest differently region to region; and about new technologies, such as augmented reality, and how they might impact museums and exhibition making. These are, of course, just a few of the topics covered. Tune in for the rest. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Transcript: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-the-future-of-the-museum-2/\"> http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-the-future-of-the-museum-2/</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</span></p>",
