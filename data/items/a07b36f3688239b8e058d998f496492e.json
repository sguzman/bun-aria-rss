  "description": "<p>A fun chat to bring you today as we chat with one of Australia's favourite broadcasters and former sprinter Jason 'Richo' Richardson about his incredible career and his incredible love for all things to do with the Olympics! We find out from Richo just what three dreams he had as a child and how one of them came true in some pretty extraordinary circumstances. We also find out which Olympic gold medallist he was training partners with during the 1990s and how some of his connections helped him secure some big name interviews during the Sydney Olympics. Added to this we learn of his Tasmanian connections to keep Ben happy, which moment from the Tokyo Olympics was his stand out memory as well as sharing some great moments with the legendary Bruce McAvaney. It's one hell of a great chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
