Boasting around half a million subscribers, Abigail’s channel is notorious for its well-researched content and colourful presentation.

When we present philosophy in the public sphere, what are our goals? Should they the same as those in the philosophy seminar room - our desire being rigorous, detailed, delicate contemplation - or does public media demand something else? In short, do we need to change our ways to make philosophy accessible?</p> <p class=\"\">[Note: Abigail Thorn came out as a transgender woman in January 2021.
