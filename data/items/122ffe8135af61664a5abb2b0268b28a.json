  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the Republican Party has become a soft-socialist party. Our civil liberties must be balanced amidst this crisis and the iron fist of government must never outweigh our liberties. Congressman Tom Massie was chastised today for asking Congress to conduct a roll call vote so that constituents would know exactly how their members voted on America's largest spending bill ever. This would have taken one extra day, but this was a problem because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already sent all of the members home. The Constitution is to be respected and adhered to in order to preserve our liberties and Massie's request was correct and reasonable. Meanwhile, the federal government's coordinator for the Defense Production Act, Peter Navarro, has just ordered General Motors to produce ventilators as their negotiations went awry. Then, China is not a friend of the United States. China was so slow to declare human-to-human contact which is what started this pandemic to begin with. Later, Gov Andrew Cuomo continues to be lauded as a presidential leader despite him ignoring the ICU bed shortage in his state and taking no action on it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
