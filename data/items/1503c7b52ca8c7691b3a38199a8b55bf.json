  "itunes:summary": "Over the past year, speculation has surged beyond business media to emerge as a broad-spectrum cultural theme — think Gamestop, Robinhood, tokenized communities, the rise of NFT art. Reflecting on this phenomenon, NM speaks with the gonzo art world/ art market reporter behind @jerrygogosian, artist HILDE LYNN HELPHENSTEIN as well as MATTHEW CAPASSO, formerly of Christies and now director of Fairchain, a company working to secure artists’ rights to secondary sale residuals. On this ep, Hilde and Matthew pull back the veil on 2021’s art market mechanics, from the clout battles of WhatsApp collector circles to the newly NFT-centric OG auction houses. Along the way, we discuss the what and why of art valuation today; new models for gallery/artist relations, the new “now” vs “contemporary” split; and the vicissitudes of love, lust, taste, and power that propel life in this realm.\n\nFor more: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jerrygogosian\nhttps://www.larrysaltz.com\nhttps://www.fairchain.art",
