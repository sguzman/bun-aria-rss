  "description": "Subscribe at usefulidiots.substack.com for an ad-free listen and extended interview\n\nOn this week’s show, award-winning journalist David Sirota justly rips Democrats for not only selling out the American people but for enabling Right Wing authoritarianism:\n“Democrats get elected promising to help people, promising various programs to directly help people.\nAnd then you get into power and you shield your corporate donors who don't want that change. You choose your corporate donors and you betray your promises to voters. What you're saying to voters is that democracy doesn't matter.\nAnd if you do that, there's going to be a lot of voters who say, ‘Look, I just voted for you. I just used democracy to put you in power. You're saying we got to get Donald Trump out of here because he's not helping people. I have to support you only because of democracy. You're proving to me that democracy doesn't matter.’\"\nIf Dems keep wasting their time in power, they’re going to stop holding power and push people into the arms of people like Trump, which is what happened in 2016.\nListen to this interview with the exceptionally interesting, intelligent and prolific David Sirota, and then listen to Meltdown on Audible.\nPlus, Dems are cutting everything Dem voters want in their bill, and so much more vaccine debating. And don’t worry, there’s some poop stuff in here too.\nHeads up: this week, we have begun donating a large portion of our profits to the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press to help independent journalists in need. To help this, we’re starting ad reads this week. If you want to donate to indie media (and not have to hear ads), become a subscriber today to hear our chat with David about an important study about the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism. And NO we’re not comparing Trump to Hitler.\nIt’s all this, and more, on the Halloween episode of Useful Idiots. Check it out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
