  "description": "<p>Back in early 2019, 9-year-old Serenity Dennard had been living at the Black Hills Children's Home in Rockerville, South Dakota. She had been living at the home since July of 2018. Her adoptive parents had placed her there after her behavior became too difficult to manage along with their other children at home. Serenity was on track to complete a one-year residential program at the children’s home in July and return to her adoptive parents. However, on the morning of February 3, 2019, she ran away from the home while staff members were distracted. She was last spotted by an incoming visitor, standing at the cattle gate near the road. Severe winter weather came through later that day, and Serenity had on snow boots, but no coat. She has never been seen again.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Serenity Dennard, you are urged to call the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office at 605-394-6115.
