  "description": "We are thrilled to have the one and only Mike Erre on back on the show today!  After three months dedicated therapy, healing and re-orientation, Mike is back to share more of his story.  In this episode, Bonnie and Tim talk with Mike as he updates everyone on where he has been, what he has been doing and learning.  Mike highly recommends OnSite Workshops, a therapeutic retreat center in Nashville, TN and has found great growth and solace in both the Enneagram and Spiritual Direction.  Mike also gives an update on Justina and the family, and \nTim and Bonnie share some of their own learnings from the past few months.  \n\nIn addition, we also answer the burning question, “Is Mike back for good?”\n\nIf you are a newer listener and aren’t sure what we are discussing, you may want to visit Episode 224 “Together, In Process” which explains Mike’s reason for spending time away from the podcast.  \n\nWe are excited for the road ahead, and how the new growth of the team will help continue to serve you.
