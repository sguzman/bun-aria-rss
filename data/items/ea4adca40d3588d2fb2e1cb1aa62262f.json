  "description": "<p>There is a crisis in America as powerful forces seek to destroy and silence certain shows on the Kirk Minihane Network. We now have two Intern Justins. President Trump has been banned from Twitter, Twitter competitor Parlor has been banned by Amazon Web Services, and Big Tech is only just getting started. The Boston Globe's Shirley Leung is cheering on the censorship and politically motivated attacks. Bill Belichick is going to get the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump. Blind Mike is a content machine over on Patreon. Jared Carrabis has added \"KMS\" to his Twitter bio and wants Big Steve removed from the Trivia Team. New England's favorite comedian is back with a new hilarious IG video.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
