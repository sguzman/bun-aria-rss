  "description": "The NFL has dealt with plenty of scandal this century, but this offseason was pretty rough. <br/><br/>Accusations of racist hiring practices, star players charged with sexual assault, and owners behaving badly have all been embarrassments for the league. <br/><br/>None of that has affected the bottom line.  TV ratings are as high as ever and NFL programs dominate the Nielsen top ten. <br/><br/>Our host Juana Summers talks to Kevin Draper, sports reporter for the New York Times, about what, if anything, can slow down the NFL juggernaut. <br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community. <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">Email us at considerthis@npr.org</a>.
