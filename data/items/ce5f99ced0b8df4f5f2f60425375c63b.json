  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO Radio Host Brian Mudd fills in. How did eliminating the leader of the world's largest state sponsor of terror become a bad thing? Too many leftists are focused on avoiding war as opposed to defending America. Then, remember when Chuck Schumer was saying that we had to listen to the intelligence community? Well, President Trump listened and now democrats are criticizing him for that. Later, it seems like the left supports the human rights abuses occurring in Iraq. Afterward, free enterprise is blowing up in the Democrat's faces as is impeachment. Trump's popularity is better than Schumer's and likely to rise further after this big win for America.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
