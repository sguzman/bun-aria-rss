  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys are playing an away game as they are live from Atlanta in their hotel conference room to recap the day's events and look ahead to some of the other things planned for the remainder of Super Bowl week. They chat about all the guests who stopped by yesterday, who some of their favorites were, and some of the issues they ran into along the way. They also give their final thoughts on the weight loss competition which has now officially ended, coming down to the wire between Todd and Zito. They also discuss what happens to the Patriots if Bill Belichick decides to retire, and if Ernie Adams is the actual key to their success. This week, Nick chooses a couple of Atlanta based Friday Bangerz to help send you into the Super Bowl weekend. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @evanfoxy.</p>\n",
