  "description": "Adaptive reuse, or using a building for a new purpose, has become popular around the world, but discussion about adaptive reuse in Asia is relatively scarce. As a result, this architectural innovation in Asia, which includes redesigned institutional buildings, awards for cultural heritage conservation projects, and adapted reuse field studies, is overdue for consideration. Asian Revitalization’s review of adaptive reuse begins by comparing the global presence of adaptive reuse to its presence in Asia and evolves into a detailed examination of adaptive reuse’s relationship to urban development and sustainability, how adaptive reuse supports heritage buildings, and its connection to best practices in heritage conservation in Asia. The text grounds its analysis in essays, timelines, and case studies that focus on revitalization in Hong Kong, commercial development in Shanghai, and community building in Singapore in addition to analysis of government policy documents and extensive fieldwork. At a time when sustainable development is crucial, Asian Revitalization can provide classrooms and a professional readership with a valuable resource about Asia’s participation in this flourishing and creative architectural movement.\nBryan Toepfer, AIA, NCARB, CAPM is the Principal Architect for TOEPFER Architecture, PLLC, an Architecture firm specializing in Residential Architecture and Virtual Reality. He has authored two books, “Contractors CANNOT Build Your House,” and “Six Months Now, ARCHITECT for Life.” He is an Adjunct Professor at Alfred State College and the Director of Education for the AIA Rochester Board of Directors.
