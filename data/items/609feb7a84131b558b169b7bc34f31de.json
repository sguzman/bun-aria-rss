  "title": "145 - Josef Fritzl: Austria's Monster",
  "description": "<p>On April 19th, 2008, forty-two year-old Elisabeth Fritzl helped her seventy-three year-old father Josef carry their nineteen year-old unconscious daughter Kerstin - yes, THEIR daughter, you read that right - out of a small, windowless cellar that Kerstin had literally spent her entire life inside up until this point. That day, Elisabeth felt sunlight on her skin for the first time in twenty-four years. For over two decades, she had been imprisoned and continually raped by her own father. And she lived to tell about it. Her story and the tale of her monster-father is insane. Hard to believe it actually happened. But it did. And we suck it all today on Timesuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Come to my standup special taping at Crofoot in Detroit on Friday, October 18th</strong>. Two shows!
