  "description": "<p>In these short parables, we see sacrifices made in the context of such tremendous riches that the sacrifice is made with incredible joy. In other words, the characters sacrificed in the joy and knowledge of what was on the way.</p>\n<p>This story shows us several principles of the kingdom of God: 1) Give up your small ambitions; 2) Christianity is a change of dimension and of essence; 3) To make that change, Christianity requires you to sell everything; 4) What Jesus gives in response to unconditional surrender is unimaginable splendor. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 28, 1994. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1994). Scripture: Matthew 13:44-46.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
