  "description": "Chris Ruane has been a member of the British Parliament for more than 20 years. As a meditation and mindfulness practitioner, he wanted to share the benefits of these practices with his colleagues in government. In 2013, he set up free mindfulness classes in the UK Parliament. Since then, more than 150 British Members of Parliament and peers have received mindfulness training, along with 250 members of their staff. Jamie Bristow serves as Director of The Mindfulness Initiative, which was founded in 2013 to support British politicians in forming the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness (MAPPG), a cross party group dedicated to developing public policy on mindfulness in health, education, criminal justice and the workplace. Ruane and Bristow have joined forces to bring mindfulness techniques to legislators around the world, hoping it will lead to more thoughtful decision-making and constructive dialogues between opposing political parties.\nPlug Zone\nChris Ruane Bio: http://oxfordmindfulness.org/people/chris-ruane/\nChris Ruane Email Address: ruanec@parliament.uk\nChris Ruane Twitter: https://twitter.com/Chris_RuaneMP\nJamie Bristow Twitter: https://twitter.com/jamiebristow\nThe Mindfulness Initiative: https://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org/\nTen Percent Happier Meditation - Jeff Warren's Training the Mind: https://10percenthappier.app.link/Sx7HisBOiX\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
