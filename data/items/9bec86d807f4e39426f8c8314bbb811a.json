Jesse is books editor at <a href=\"https://reason.com/people/jesse-walker/\">Reason</a> and author of two books, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062135562/reasonmagazineA/\"><i>The United States of Paranoia</i></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rebels-Air-Alternative-History-America/dp/0814793827/\"><i>Rebels On the Air</i></a>.

We've dipped our toes in the water of alt-country and country rock. But this, friends, is a full-fledged belly flip into the world of COUNTRY. Welcome to Willie Nelson, Part One. The show may never be the same.</p><p>In Part One, we take Willie from his early songwriting days up through <i>Phases and Stages</i>. That’s right -- it’s 3+ hours and we don’t even get to <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>. That’s how much we have to say about Willie.</p><p>We discuss much more than the music in this one. For example, we ask why country music's greatest albums are not considered among popular music's greatest as well? Why do we cabin them off to one side? How should we consider the songwriter versus the performer? Why would someone like Willie, early on at least, successful at one but not the other. And the voice. The delivery. What makes Willie truly Willie?</p><p>From Liberty to RCA to Atlantic, all of Willie’s record labels are represented on the show. It's a straight-up crime that some of these records aren't routinely listed among the greatest American albums of all-time. However, that's the silo country music finds itself in, at times. We try to bust through that silo.</p><p>It’s an exciting mix of styles and eras with entertainment and information for newbies and hardcore fans. Relax in any way you see fit, grab a bit of yesterday’s wine, and be amazed at how time slips away when you listen to <i>Political Beats</i>. You can even stay in your underwear, if you like.</p>\n",
