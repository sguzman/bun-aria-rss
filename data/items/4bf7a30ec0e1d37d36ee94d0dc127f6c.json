  "description": "<p>Daylight Savings is coming up and there is a darkness on the horizon. Sas is looking for an NYC studio apartment with a pool table, chics are used for chicken nuggets, and there's nothing better than a highland cow. We are working on getting our own Super Bowl ad, Sas is generous with his money to the homeless community, and the Phillies might win the damn thing this year. Enjoy.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
