Join Dr. Preston Cline, who has been a consultant on all the SOF Assessment and Selection courses, with Senior Enlisted Leader CMSgt Greg Smith and Green Beret SGM Matt Parrish as they discuss whether we teach our people to navigate uncertainty properly, whether SOF is transactional or transformational, and whether SOF has a gatekeeping mentality.   <br /><br />Listen to Dr. Preston describe the dynamics of highly-functioning teams, argue why women have and should always be part of special operations, guard against placing cultural fitness above all else, and challenge the special operations community to build cognitive, social and family resilience throughout your career and not wait until the end of it.
