  "description": "<p>Worrier Pose: Finding Freedom from the Body of Fear (retreat talk) (2018-10-07) - While fear is a natural part of our make up, many of us suffering when the “on” button gets jammed. This talk looks at how our fears generate habitual patterns of physical tension, anxious thinking, emotions and behaviors; and how this constellation prevents us from inhabiting our full wisdom and love. We then explore two interrelated pathways of healing—unconditional presence, and resourcing, or cultivating access to safety and belonging (from the IMCW 2018 Fall Retreat). </p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation:<br /> \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\"<br /> when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
