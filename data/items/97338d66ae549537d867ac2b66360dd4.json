  "description": "<p>Mercury’s in retrograde, guys…don’t say we didn’t warn you. We learn why Em doesn’t wear pink dresses and why Christine doesn’t wear white. It’s pinafore-ific!<br />First off, Em tells us about the the Jefferson Hotel in Jefferson, TX, feat. suicidal brides, sleep paralysis, giggling children, shadow people, unwanted cuddling, AND MORE. This place is a hot-spot for creepiness.<br />Christine isn’t actually a murderer but Peter Thomas Anthony Manuel SURE IS! There’s a reason he’s called the Beast of Birkenshaw (not to be confused with the Beast of Birkenstock).
