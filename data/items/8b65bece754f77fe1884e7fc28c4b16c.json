  "description": "<p>A common task in empirical economics is to estimate \\emph{interaction\neffects} that measure how the effect of one variable $X$ on another variable\n$Y$ depends on a third variable $H$. This paper considers the estimation of\ninteraction effects in linear panel models with a fixed number of time periods.\nThere are at least two ways to estimate interaction effects in this setting,\nboth common in applied work. Our theoretical results show that these two\napproaches are distinct, and only coincide under strong conditions on\nunobserved effect heterogeneity. Our empirical results show that the difference\nbetween the two approaches is large, leading to conflicting conclusions about\nthe sign of the interaction effect. Taken together, our findings may guide the\nchoice between the two approaches in empirical work.\n</p>",
