  "description": "Gold hasn’t been a particularly exciting asset class recently… but that’s quickly changing. Gold prices are approaching their six-month highs… near $1,900 per ounce. And Ed Karr—former chairman of U.S. Gold Corp. and fan-favorite guest—predicts the price will hit $3,000 next year. Today, he’s back on the show to discuss current market conditions—including two factors that will lead to a rally in gold prices. [1:30] Listen as Ed shares some positive news—and a huge catalyst—for his company, U.S. Gold, and what investors should expect over the coming months… including a major under-the-radar boost from the infrastructure bill. [10:00] Ed’s built an incredible team at U.S. Gold… and he recently turned over the reins to CEO George Bee. He recounts George’s successes… and explains why he’s excited to see a man he describes as “the Tom Brady of mining” in the driver’s seat. [20:45] One thing I love about Ed is he isn’t your typical goldbug… Today, he shares why he’s bullish on crypto… and what he expects as this innovative asset class matures over the next several years.
