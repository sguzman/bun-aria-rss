Known for its cheap price, light weight and very simple design, this clear-bodied ballpen comes in three different ink colors -- blue, black and red -- that can easily be distinguished from the color of its cap. It is the brand used by most students because it produces a thick line when used for writing and can be consumed even to the last drop of ink. Today, the brand name Panda has been included among the terms used by Filipinos to refer to the product it is associated with -- the ballpen. http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Panda_757-RP&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nExpensive drawing tools is not necessary for you to be a great manga artist...&#13;\n&#13;\nThe pen I'm using is worth 11 cents in US dollar...&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nMORE OF MY ARTWORKS HERE!...&#13;\nhttp://zeckos.deviantart.com",
