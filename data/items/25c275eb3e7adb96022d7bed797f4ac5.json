  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin, Democrats want unity in tyranny. Speech that hates America is tolerated by the media and Democrat party and speech that loves America isn't. Calls for peaceful and patriotic speech are considered hate speech but speech that denigrates America or Republicans is acceptable to the Democrat Party and the left within the media. Violence and destruction on the streets is applauded when it's convenient. Democrats used a phony pretext to go after President Trump and others in his orbit. Then, Joe Biden has destroyed many careers and is not a statesman of unity. This program implores you to ignore the inauguration. Unity? When did Obama, Pelosi, or Schumer ever stand up for unity and promote peace? Now they will hold a trial to condemn the former President and Mitch McConnell is happy to assist. Later, America is going to miss President Trump. His farewell speech wasn't played by much of the media but this program will always bring you the truth. Trump remarked, \"We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation.\" Afterward, the media is attacking Trump's 1776 Commission because of its focus on educational initiatives that support the founding of our nation and patriotism.  Finally, Allum Bokhari joins the show to discuss his book, #DELETED: Big Tech's Battle to Erase the Trump Movement and Steal the Election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
