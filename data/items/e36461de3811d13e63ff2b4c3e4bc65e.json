  "description": "<p>During childhood,&nbsp;<strong>Jim Kwik</strong>&nbsp;experienced a&nbsp;<strong>traumatic brain injury</strong>. As a result, he lacked focus in school, wasn’t able to read properly, and at one point, a teacher told him that he had a “<strong>broken brain</strong>”. So how did a kid with a “broken brain” become the&nbsp;<strong>leading mental coach for athletes, CEOs, and movie stars</strong>? Simple: Jim looked into&nbsp;<strong><em>how&nbsp;</em>to learn instead&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;to learn. Soon enough, Jim was reading faster, memorizing with higher accuracy, and doing well in school.</p><p>His friends asked him for some tips so they could improve their grades as well. With some success in his inner circle, he decided to make a flyer for&nbsp;<strong>speed reading and memory improvement classes</strong>. He put up the flyer at his college hoping one or two people would show up to his impromptu class. Over 100 students showed up, of which<strong>&nbsp;71 signed up for a full course with Jim</strong>. After that, Jim knew it was his&nbsp;<strong>life mission to help those who wanted to learn, memorize, and live better</strong>.</p><p>So&nbsp;<strong>why is it so hard for some people to memorize things</strong>?
