  "description": "In The Power of Artistic Thinking: Think Like an Artist and Innovate (Common Ground, 2019; 2021 paperback), Marisol D’Andrea, PhD explores the potential of artistic thinking and shares practical guidance to help us all harness the power of artistic thinking. Through in-depth interviews and conversations with artists, scholars, and thought leaders, she has arrived at core commonalities in artistic thinking: passion and obsession; imagination and belief; observation and connection; visualization and pondering; learning and exploration; and practice and repetition. In this book, she examines these elements and translates them into practical exercises.\nD’Andrea writes, “Through the arts, I learned—and I hope you will learn, too—how to prioritize your thinking (i.e., follow your passions), how to think (e.g., imagine), when to think (e.g., explore), and to discover who you are (e.g., self-transform) … It was artistic thinking that empowered me and spurred me on to write this book.”\nMarisol D'Andrea, PhD is a visual artist, illustrator, author, and multidisciplinary researcher. She holds a doctoral degree in Leadership, Higher and Adult Education from the University of Toronto and currently resides in Canada.\n﻿Susan Grelock Yusem, PhD, is independent researcher trained in depth psychology, with an emphasis on community, liberation, and eco-psychologies. Her work centers around interconnection and encompasses regenerative food systems, the arts and conservation.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
