  "description": "<p><em><strong>Insulted - Part Three: Friend of Sinners</strong></em>. This episode we are venturing back into understanding Jesus through the insults that were hurled at him. Today, it's the claim that he was a '<strong>glutton, a drunkard and a friend of sinners</strong>.' As Jesus subverted what was expected of Him, He also provoked conversations about who was welcome and why. What was the cultural context of this? What did sinner mean? Who was calling Jesus this and what was the reason for it? What is the history that leads up to Jesus and what dis His actions say to the community? How was He a glutton and a drunkard and what did that mean both in action and cultural context?!?</p>\n<p>First, Tim shares a new piece of '<strong>Timbits</strong>!' This is good the church is doing in the world, a counter to <strong>Tim's Troubled Times</strong>. A listener emails in and shares about her church in Canada and what it's doing to reach out to the community around them and lament the pain the church has caused there.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
