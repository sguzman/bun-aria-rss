  "description": "Horus's uncle Set murdered his father, and because his mother was shrewd, he gained the throne and the murderer was exiled to the South. There was just one problem: Set wasn't going to go quietly. He vowed on the day he left to kill Horus, feast on his flesh, and reclaim the throne for himself. The boy Pharoah, Horus, watched Set and his followers go, and knew he had to be ready. The war was coming. The creature this time is the vegetable man, and, no worries, he's not going to make you eat your vegetables. As a (possible?) vegetable himself, he's way more interested in eating you. -- Sponsors: Spotify! Check out this (and so many other podcasts) on Spotify.
