  "title": "A brief history of Middle-Out Economics (with Michael Tomasky)",
  "description": "We’ve lived in the shadow of trickle-down economics for over 40 years. During that time, our leaders unquestioningly embraced economic policies that prioritize the wealthiest and most powerful, with the idea that their wealth will eventually \"trickle down\" to everyone else. Finally, a contrasting progressive economic understanding is beginning to take hold. Middle-out economics—the idea that prioritizing the working- and middle-class is better for everyone in the economy—is having a moment. But where did middle-out come from? Michael Tomasky’s new book chronicles the history of middle-out and the rise of progressive economics in the United States.\n\nMichael Tomasky is a journalist and author. He’s top editor of The New Republic, editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas, and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.\n\nTwitter: @mtomasky\n\nThe Middle Out https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671443/the-middle-out-by-michael-tomasky \n\nWebsite: http://pitchforkeconomics.com\nTwitter: @PitchforkEcon\nInstagram: @pitchforkeconomics\nNick’s twitter: @NickHanauer",
