  "description": "Molly and Jason cover Peter Thiel stepping down from FB’s board and look back at the board&#039;s evolution over time (2:07). Next, we cover Joe Lonsdale’s op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, where he argues AWS should be split off from Amazon (27:41). We debate if valuations would increase if separated. Then, Peloton Founder & CEO John Foley is stepping down as the firm lays off 2800 people (40:30). We debate if they angling for an acquisition or making a turnaround attempt. To wrap, we discuss our startup of the day, Island, which is a browser for enterprise with a big valuation for a pre-product company (50:11).",
