  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we are really excited to have our good friend Kyle Harrison joining us. Kyle is a professional lacrosse player that Colin and I both looked up to when we were young lacrosse players. As most of you probably know, Colin and I both grew up playing lacrosse - and as we grew our first company, The Lacrosse Network, we actually got to make videos with Kyle and through that process, we became close friends.\nSomething really interesting about our relationship is that Kyle was the catalyst to get us into vlogging. We cover a bunch of topics on this episode including how to manage your content as a professional athlete, How to build trust with someone you want to film (like we did with Kyle), balancing family life and brand building, Lebron vs MJ and Race issues in the sport of lacrosse.\nNow in this episode we definitely dive into some topics that are specific to lacrosse, but even if you’re not familiar with the sport I still think this conversation is valuable to anyone who is interested in content creation and brand building - Athletes have always fascinated us with their ability to build long-lasting brands and Kyle is someone who has been building his brand since before the age of social media.",
