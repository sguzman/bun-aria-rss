  "description": "You've likely heard them before. \"Don't get too dark.\" Or \"You look good, have you lost weight?\" And even, \"Be quiet -- that's not ladylike.\" These phrases might seem inconsequential, but embedded deep within are messages of anti-Blackness. And they're messages that the most impressionable of us especially internalize: our children. Today we'll unpack three problematic phrases -- and their implicit meanings -- with Farah Jones. They are a multiracial writer, editor, and educator. A former middle and high school teacher, they currently write for various publications and present workshops and trainings around the country focusing on racial and gender justice and community building. Words matter. It's time to get intentional about how we use them.\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands.
