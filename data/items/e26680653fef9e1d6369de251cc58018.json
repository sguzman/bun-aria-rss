As the official decorator of the Obama White House, he not only had a front row seat to history, but became a part of it—an experience Smith recounts in a new book coming out this Fall. In this episode of The <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, he chats with host Dennis Scully about how he landed the president as a client, the secret code he used to refer to the Obamas, and the unique challenges that come with designing America’s most famous house. <i>This episode is sponsored by High Point Market and Paintzen</i>. </p>\n",
