  "description": "<p>We’ve been told since we were little kids to “Be nice.”<br />But what if being nice isn’t really that good and it’s making you and those around you miserable?<br />That’s the provocative argument my guest today makes. His name is Dr. Aziz Gazipura. He's a psychologist and founder of the Social Confidence Center. In his latest book, Not Nice, he makes the case that being nice is holding a lot of men back in their lives.<br />We begin the show by talking about what people think “nice” means, but how it usually plays out in reality. Dr. Aziz then digs into the issues that pop up over and over again in the lives of people pleasers, like anxiety, depression, anger, and resentment. We then discuss what the opposite of nice is, and no, it’s not being a complete jerk. He then shares specific tactics the chronically nice can start using today to be more assertive, like saying no without feeling guilty, getting over feeling responsible for everyone’s feelings, and stating your preferences.<br />If you’re a chronic nice guy, this episode is for you.<br />Get the full show notes at aom.is/notnice.</p>\n",
