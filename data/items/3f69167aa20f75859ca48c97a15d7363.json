  "description": "<p>Missionary gets a bad rap. I’ve seen it called the “comfy sweater” of sex – and can we talk about the name? Not sexy. Almost…anti-sexy. But despite its label, I don’t think that’s why missionary is considered vanilla or boring. It’s simply the default position, the one a lot of us fall into automatically – making it easier for us to tune out, phone it in, and miss out on any potential eroticism.&nbsp;</p><br><p>So on today’s episode, we’re going to make missionary more exploratory, as I address some of your common complaints. Such as: how do we make it more exciting? I’ll tell you all the reasons I love missionary, and give you technique tips to make it more surprising and fun. Next, vulva owners: are you having a hard time reaching orgasm in missionary? Of course you are: it’s not the prime position for clitoral stimulation, so I’ll offer position hacks that make it more pleasurable. Finally, is it possible to be kinky during missionary? Oh yeah: from bondage to dirty talk, we can leverage all that eye contact to turn it into the hot experience you crave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Show Notes:&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/making-missionary-hot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Missionary Sex Position - New and Improved</a></p><p><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/the-bottom-line-on-anal-w-dr-evan-goldstein/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The “Bottom” Line On Anal w/ Dr Evan Goldstein&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGR0hJS0JHRktGTkZCRk5MS0ZM?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodvibes.com%2Fs%2Fsex-toys%2Fp%2FGV40055%2Fdame%2Fpillo-by-dame\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pillo by Dame</a></p><p><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/doggie-style-vs-cat-position/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Position Breakdown: Doggy Style Vs Cat Position</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGR0hJS0JHRktGTkZCRk5MS0ZM?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodvibes.com%2Fs%2Fsex-toys%2Fp%2FGV46126%2Fmagic-wand%2Fmagic-wand-mini%3Flref%3DSrch%7Cmagic%252Bwand%252Bmini%7Ca%7C1%7Cc%7C0%7C-relevance%7Csearch_page%7C0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Wand Mini</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
