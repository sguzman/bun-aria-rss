  "description": "<p>Paul McCulley is a former Managing Director at PIMCO and a legend of the industry, having helped coin phrases such as \"shadow banking\" and the \"Minsky moment.\" On this episode, we discuss the history of economic policy ideas, starting with the monetary and supply side revolutions roughly forty years ago, and how they've dominated thinking until today. But the break is coming. He says that we are \"unambiguously\" on the verge of a profound change to a more democratically managed economy (one more driven by fiscal policy), a change that will have significant changes for the real economy as well as markets and portfolio management.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
