Greig asks questions on 7 clips of the film. There is a companion pdf with this episode (see the link below) that lists the approximate time these clips appear in the movie with images of the first and last frames. We get into specific breakdowns of these shots as well as talking about the experience of working with the director, the lyric nature of the book and how that influenced the film as well as the incredible music track from composer Nick Cave. Greig had done his homework and had plenty of questions for us! He led us through a great discussion of this film. <a href= \"https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/teamdeakins/ClipList-JJ-sm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to download the companion pdf.</a></p> <p>RECOMMEND EPISODE VIEWING: The Assassination of Jesse James</p>",
