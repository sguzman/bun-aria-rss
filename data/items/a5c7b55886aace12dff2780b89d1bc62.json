  "description": "Markets are down sharply as today’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data came in hotter than expected—leaving investors worried the Fed will continue its aggressive interest rate hikes. Prepare for a rant on the government’s “creative” inflation calculations… and why the Fed should ignore the CPI figure altogether—but won’t.  I explain how world governments are contributing to 40-year-high inflation… what the Fed should do to finally tame it… and why markets could drop 20% from here if the Fed doesn’t get its act together. On the plus side, I expect the Fed’s actions to lead to some great deals on Black Friday. In this episode [Aim for 5 bullets max]:  Why inflation data came in hotter than expected [0:30] How the government fudges inflation data [3:00] Experts continue to be dead-wrong on inflation [10:58]  My advice to the Fed [16:05 Why the markets could fall 20% from here [29:25]  Enjoyed this episode?
