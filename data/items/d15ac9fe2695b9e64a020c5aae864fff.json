MEV is arguably the single most important unsolved problem in the crypto space.</p> <p>In the context of incentives and network security, MEV generally refers to the ability of miners & validators to take advantage of their position as securers of the network. Blocks are verified by single entities, and these block producers have tremendous power when they are the ones adding a particular block to the blockchain. We refer to this instance as ‘God-Mode,’ in which a node has the power to assemble & order transactions at will. The threat here is the potential gaps between what is best for the network and what is best for the node.</p> <p>As an internal and unbounded threat to blockchains, solving the problems that MEV presents is critical to maintaining proper consensus and ensuring decentralization and permissionless access. We take a deep dive into potential solutions, and the impact of EIP-1559 and Proof-of-Stake on MEV. Dive in to learn why despite the challenges ahead, Charlie says:</p> <p>“In the absence of certainty, I’m willing to take the optimistic perspective.”</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Phil on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/phildaian?s=20\">https://twitter.com/phildaian?s=20</a> <br />  Georgios on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gakonst?s=20\">https://twitter.com/gakonst?s=20</a> <br />  Charlie on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/_charlienoyes?s=20\">https://twitter.com/_charlienoyes?s=20</a> <br />  Exploring Ethereum’s Dark Forest with Dan Robinson<br /> <a href= \"https://youtu.be/MtpRDqrCfbc\">https://youtu.be/MtpRDqrCfbc</a> <br />  Investing in DeFi Paradigms with Charlie Noyes<br /> <a href= \"https://youtu.be/dQOhbb5HmLA\">https://youtu.be/dQOhbb5HmLA</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
