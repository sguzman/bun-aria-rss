  "description": "<p>It's been a while since we've spoken to someone from the great sport of cross-country skiing and today we finally break the drought by speaking with Australian Olympian Casey Wright ahead of her second Olympics in Beijing! We find out from Casey just how she got into the sport and what other sports we could've seen her represent Australia in through her various sports she grew up playing. We also find out the insane training that goes into the sport of cross-country skiing and just what the differences are between the different styles. Added to this we find out why we need to keep a closer eye on the Norwegians during the Olympics as well as the possibilities of Casey representing another country at a future Olympics. It's an informative chat that will get you closer into the mood for the Olympics so get to listening!</p>",
