  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many of us work on our physical health—whether that means going to the gym or for a run—without being aware of the brain health benefits we’re receiving. I’m excited to welcome back today’s guest, health expert Shawn Stevenson, to tell us how we can boost our brain potential through quick and simple physical exercises. He's the founder of the Model Health Show Podcast.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical training is a powerful way to boost your brainpower and creativity. Simple exercises like push-ups, squats, daily walk, and sprints can help you improve so many aspects of your overall wellbeing and brain function, from sleep to creativity and brain cell production. There’s a lot of confusion out there about strength training, but the truth is that after years of evolution our body needs and expects us to work hard and lift heavy things—and it doesn’t have to mean complicated hours of workouts at the gym.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, we’ll explain the benefits of strength training and how it is connected to a happier, healthier brain. We’ll walk you through some quick exercises you can incorporate into your day, and explain how your sleep, productivity, and creativity can be improved in a few minutes a day. We’ll also be doing a deep dive into the top four exercises you can start doing today to boost the health of your mind and brain.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of our age and ability, we can train to prevent our physical and mental muscles from atrophying. In the process, we can improve our mental strength, resilience, sleep, mood, and cardiovascular health, among countless other health benefits. If you’re looking for a simple and effective plan to improve your body and brain health, today’s podcast is for you. </span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p class=\"p1\">** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
