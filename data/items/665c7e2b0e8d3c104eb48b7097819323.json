  "description": "<p>Even though the federal government published a report that determined the average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is $233,000- that doesn’t mean you HAVE to spend that much! When calculating how much YOU will spend on a child, start by asking yourself: what are my current expenses? Because really the best indicator of how much you’ll spend on your kids is how much money you are already spending on yourself. The cost of children will be an extension of your values and what you’re already spending money on. Listen as we cover how much kids cost, ranging from specifics like the cost of car seats to a broader, principled approach towards entertainment and spending in general.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Heavy Hands DIPA by Spindletap Brewery which you can find on Untappd. Another huge thanks to Leo for donating this beer to the show!
