They are mentioned in the credits of the video :)\n\nThis is my video series about Linear Algebra. I hope that it will help everyone who wants to learn about it.\n\nThis is the start of my series about Linear Algebra. Here we explain the definition of the basis for a subspace.\n\nI hope that this helps students, pupils and others. Have fun!\n\n#LinearAlgebra\n\n(This explanation fits to lectures for students in their first and second year of study: Mathematics for physicists, Mathematics for the natural science, Mathematics for engineers and so on)",
