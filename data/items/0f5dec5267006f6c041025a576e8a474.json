  "title": "88 - Embarrassed By The Bible: Wives Submit To Your Husbands",
  "description": "This week we begin a new mini series, \"Embarrassed By the Bible\".  To clarify, no we are not embarrassed by the Bible.  What we can say however, is that there is a whole truck load of content written though that cause us some major confusion and deserves a much deeper dive into context.  \n\nWe've received so many questions regarding what the Bible actually says about wives submitting to their husbands. Given our modern day context where women are regarded as leaders and influences, not only professionally but in the home as well, we figured we better explain whats going on in the book of Ephesians.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
