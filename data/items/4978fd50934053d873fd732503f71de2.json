  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat reacts to the new proposed CBA which was reported by Adam Schefter a couple of nights ago. Pat tries to break down and make sense of all of the mathematics, and dives into what it means, why the players will take issue with certain parts, and what the owners are probably thinking as they try to navigate their way through the whole thing. Pat and the boys also discuss the proposed addition of one more playoff team in the AFC and NFC, and why players like Richard Sherman are very vocal about making their decisions regarding the CBA very carefully. Later, Tom Pelissero of the NFL Network and NFL.com joins the show to give a more in depth breakdown of what he is hearing from owners and players regarding these CBA negotiations, where he thinks the potential snags will be, and where some more of the discussions and challenges will lead over the course of the next few days as owners and the NFLPA representatives meet. Tom also gives Pat his take on Tom Brady and whether or not he will actually spurn New England for free agency (20:10-36:06). Pat also takes a couple of calls from around the nation and dives into the Titans current situation and whether or not they should give Derrick Henry a max contract and resign Ryan Tannehill or if they should let them go and try to tank for Trevor Lawrence, and looks ahead to Tyson Fury/Deontay Wilder II and gives his prediction for what will happen in the highly anticipated rematch.
