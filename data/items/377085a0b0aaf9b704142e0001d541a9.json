  "description": "<div>\n<strong>THIS IS THE CASE PATRICK’S BEEN WAITING TO COVER ALL YEAR!<br>\n</strong>On the afternoon of November 24, 1971 a man using the name Dan Cooper boarded a passenger flight at Portland international airport, and hijacked the plane. He demanded $200,000 in cash and 4 parachutes. And then, money in hand, he jumped out of the plane at 10,000 feet. No trace of Cooper was ever found—though some of the money eventually was. For nearly 50 years, people have been OBSESSED with this case. Did Cooper survive the fall? And who the hell was he—or she! And that is what this documentary attempts to find out.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.twasthenightplay.com/\"><strong>LOOKING FOR SOME HOLIDAY CHEER?
