  "title": "Ep 66 The Outs and Ins of Organ Transplantation",
  "description": "<p>From the first skin grafts to the future of 3D printed organs, the science of organ transplantation has always seemed like something out of a sci-fi novel. How on earth can an organ from one person be removed and successfully placed into another person? Who first attempted such a monumental feat, and how long did it take for trial and error to become trial and success? Our episode this week seeks to answer these questions and so many more as we tackle the massive topic of organ transplantation. We begin by examining the immunological nitty gritty of transplant science and follow that up with the long and storied history of transplants. We round things out with a look at the numbers, which show the unfortunate reality that demand far outpaces availability, a reality that may soon be improved with innovative approaches towards bioengineering. And we are so excited to be joined by two fantastic guests,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kidneydonorhelp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carol Offen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/sphs/directory/elizabeth-crais-phd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Elizabeth (Betsy) Crais</a>, who share their stories of what it’s like to donate or receive a kidney.&nbsp;</p><p>Carol, who is a NKF Kidney Advocacy Committee member, has a great&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kidneydonorhelp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>&nbsp;that includes many resources where you can learn more about kidney donation as well as keep an eye out for Carol and Betsy’s book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/3175/9781098369835\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Greatest Gift: The Insider’s Guide to Living Kidney Donation</a>.
