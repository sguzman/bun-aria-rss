  "description": "<p>Sharing a secret efficiently amongst a group of participants is not easy\nsince there is always an adversary / eavesdropper trying to retrieve the\nsecret. In secret sharing schemes, every participant is given a unique share.\nWhen the desired group of participants come together and provide their shares,\nthe secret is obtained. For other combinations of shares, a garbage value is\nreturned. A threshold secret sharing scheme was proposed by Shamir and Blakley\nindependently. In this (n,t) threshold secret sharing scheme, the secret can be\nobtained when at least t out of n participants contribute their shares. This\npaper proposes a novel algorithm to reveal the secret only to the subsets of\nparticipants belonging to the access structure. This scheme implements totally\ngeneralized ideal secret sharing. Unlike threshold secret sharing schemes, this\nscheme reveals the secret only to the authorized sets of participants, not any\narbitrary set of users with cardinality more than or equal to t. Since any\naccess structure can be realized with this scheme, this scheme can be exploited\nto implement various access priorities and access control mechanisms. A major\nadvantage of this scheme over the existing ones is that the shares being\ndistributed to the participants is totally independent of the secret being\nshared. Hence, no restrictions are imposed on the scheme and it finds a wider\nuse in real world applications.\n</p>",
