  "description": "<p>20 years ago, we pictured dinosaurs as green, scaly animals. But times have changed! Now, we know some dinosaurs had feathers. And who knows — maybe some even had stripes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode looks at how we figure out what color dinosaurs might’ve been. We talk to Jingmai O’Connor, who studies fossil reptiles, about finding color pigment in fossils. And paleoartist Emily Willoughby talks to a “museum” about how her dino-depictions have changed over the years. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Our co-host, Elyana, also brought us this important question: If dinosaurs evolved from birds and birds don’t fart, did dinosaurs fart? Wha-wha-what!?! Look no further than this episode for an extensive investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember to keep your ears open for the brand new Mystery Sound. And break out your kilns, because today’s Moment of Um answers this question: How do you make clay for pottery?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There’s so much dino-tastic information that we decided to make a second dinosaur episode. So if you haven’t had enough (and who has?), make sure to check out next week’s show about what dinosaurs might have sounded like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Mathnasium (<a href=\"http://mathnasium.com/\" class=\"default\">Mathnasium.com</a>)</p>\n<p>KiwiCo (<a href=\"http://kiwico.com/\" class=\"c-link\">kiwico.com</a> checkout code: BRAINSON)</p>\n",
