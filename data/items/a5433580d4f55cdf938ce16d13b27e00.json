  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. Flip-flopping Beto O'Rourke — who once supported guns when he ran against Sen. Ted Cruz and now says \"hell yes we're going to take your AR-15 and AK-47\"— has ended his presidential campaign. Candidates like Beto wouldn't exist if it wasn't for President Trump; they've taken these far-left socialist positions because of the success of Trump's bluntness. Beto was an experiment of how far left the Democrat Party can go before turning off their base. Then, despite Speaker Pelosi's rhetoric about not wanting to impeach Trump, many Democrats are on record saying they want to impeach him in order to beat him. Recent polling shows that 52% of Americans do not support impeachment. So impeachment is likely to backfire and help re-elect Trump by even stronger margins than 2016. Later, Joe Biden bashes Elizabeth Warren over her radical tax increases associated with her campaign proposals. Afterward, new jobs numbers are in and there are more Americans working now than ever before, in the case of African Americans.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
