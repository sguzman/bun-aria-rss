  "description": "<p>Riccardo Sobrino, of <a href=\"http://www.cascinadellerose.it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cascina delle Rose</a>, runs a small estate in Barbaresco that produces elegant, perfumed and complex wines and has been in his family for more than 70 years. This 5 ha/12 acre vineyard is a family operation – he and his brother inherited the property from their parents, who are still involved in major decisions of the winery.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cascinadellerose.it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Cascina delle Rose</a> was started by Riccardo’s mother, Giovanna Rizzolio, in 1992 on this ideal site – steep vineyards with calcareous soils on the Tre Stelle vineyard side and clay soils on the Rio Sordo side to yield two equally wonderful but very different Barbarescos. Since its inception, Giovanna insisted on biodiversity, organic viticulture, and making wines that represent the elegance and grace. Made to highlight terroir, these wines represent the elegance and grace that is inherent to the wines of this region.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cascinadellerose.it\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Giovanna-Italo-Davide-Riccardo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Courtesy <a href=\"http://www.cascinadellerose.it/\">Cascina delle Rose</a>, Riccardo is second from the right</span></p> <p>The estate is run by Davide, Riccardo’s older brother and Riccardo, who I welcome and who I have had an opportunity to visit and learn from in the vineyards and in the winery.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the show we cover:</p> <ul> <li>The history of Barbaresco and of Riccardo’s family in the area</li> <li>We discuss his AWESOME mother, Giovanna Rizzolio, who saved up money working at a job she hated in textiles to buy the winery from her family and create outstanding wines that she made working in concert with the land.
