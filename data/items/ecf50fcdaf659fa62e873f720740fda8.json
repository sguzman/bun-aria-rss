They were able to discuss the uneven recovery from the pandemic. In the latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF warns that even though the global economy is on firmer ground, recoveries are diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliance on tourism do less well.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Global prospects remain highly uncertain one year into the pandemic. The outlook depends not just on the outcome of the battle between the virus and vaccinesâ€”it also hinges on how effectively economic policies deployed under high uncertainty can limit lasting damage from this unprecedented crisis.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<em>Bruegel would like to thank the International Monetary Fund for co-hosting this recording.<br>\n</em><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<em>This podcast was recorded with a live audience on clubhouse.
