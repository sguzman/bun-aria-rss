  "title": "Treating The Aurora Mass Shooter",
  "description": "Ten years ago, a disturbed young man entered a Colorado movie theater, where he shot and killed twelve people, wounding 70 more. We speak with his psychiatrist Lynne Fenton about warning signs, treatment options and what more, if anything, could have been done. Fenton’s new book is AURORA: The Psychiatrist Who Treated the Movie Theater Killer Tells Her Story. Plus, tomorrow’s $1.02 Billion lottery will probably make the winner happy, which is the point, but it seems to be one many people rebut. And, in the Spiel, a Senate hearing on policing shows the challenges Democrats face on a very important issue to voters.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
