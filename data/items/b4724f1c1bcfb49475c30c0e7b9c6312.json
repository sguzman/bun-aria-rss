  "description": "<p>This week saw us both experiencing self-doubt brought on by limiting beliefs. This inspired us to create a list of the most common beliefs that we feel hold artists back. This is so important, because these beliefs are often unspoken and we might even experience them, not as beliefs but as facts of life. When this happens, we don't even realise there is anything we can do about them. By bringing them out into the light and questioning them, we can often gather the courage to move forward despite our fears or doubts. So, join us as we discuss these pesky beliefs and share our thoughts on how to manage them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mentioned:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://share.tellafrienda2l.com/a/a2lworkshop2021/artjuicepodcast\">free Art2Life workshop HERE</a>.
