  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak with several witnesses who had encounters with Sasquatch. One of the topics tonight is lights in the forest. What are people seeing? What is being described?

The first witness is Mike who talks about his fish coming up missing and then seeing a creature step out of the forest to look at him.</p>",
