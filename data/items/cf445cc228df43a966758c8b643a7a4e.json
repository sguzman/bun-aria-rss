  "description": "<p>Recently you stopped all contact with a childhood friend due to his toxic behavior. He went through a pretty bad breakup due to his behavior and you had enough. He thinks that by being a horrible dick to people, he's being really honest and helping them. Your other friends tell you that you should talk to him about why you cut him off, but you feel you've told him one too many times why he's a dick and what he could do to change. Do you owe him a conversation just because you were childhood friends? On this Feedback Friday, we'll try to help you decide whether to continue ghosting this ex-friend or actually take the time to tell him he's a horrible person.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
