  "description": "<p>Lunchbox is going to his cousin's wedding, but he has an issue. He's not sure if he's expected to give a speech since he is a \"celebrity.\" We debate if Lunchbox is truly a \"celebrity\" and try to help him with his issue. Plus, a company is offering a service that will burry you alive and then dig you back up as a weird life affirming experience. We go around the room to see if any of us would do it. Mailbag: a listener writes in needing advice about her first dance song. She is getting married soon and the song \"Second Guessing\" by Florida Georgia Line has been her and her fiancé's song since the beginning of their relationship, so she wants it to be their first dance. But her fiancé thinks since Florida Georgia Line isn't together anymore, it might be bad juju for them to dance to it. We share our thoughts!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
