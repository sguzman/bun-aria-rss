  "description": "Who but Stanley Tucci could charm us on social media with his Negroni-making skills, eat his way through Italy for a documentary series, and publish a food-heavy memoir all during a global pandemic? He’s had so much going on that we almost forgot that he’s also a Hollywood star. The man/myth/legend gave us his best tips for entertaining in our November issue, and this week on the podcast, he sits down with editor in chief Dawn Davis to chat about his favorite Thanksgiving dishes, the gifts he insists on giving, and the pasta faux-pas that you NEED to avoid. Of course, when it comes to putting on a proper feast, we can’t all be Stanley Tucci—but that doesn’t mean we can’t try.
