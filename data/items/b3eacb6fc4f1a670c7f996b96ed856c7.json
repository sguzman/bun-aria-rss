    "media:description": "The Wakanda Forever Clips look TERRIBLE. Disney Marvel's M-She-U Phase Bore ends with the Black Panther sequel, that has the supporting cast vs. a heavily retconned Namor who can't even pronounce his own name. After watching the aforementioned 4 clips, the ones Disney Marvel deliberately picked out to sell this movie, cringe is the only word to describe them. The winds of change are starting to blow. Unfortunately, the more things change, the more Disney stays the same. Too much bad content will lead to apathy, the franchise killer.\n#wakandaforever #disney #marvel \n\nBecome a Nerdrotic Channel Member\nwww.youtube.com/c/sutrowatchtower/join\n\nSubscribe to The Nerdrotic Network: @Nerdrotic @Nerdrotic Live @Nerdrotic Daily \n\nEdited by @1/4 Black Garrett \n\nNerdrotic Merch Store!\nhttps://mixedtees.com/nerdrotic\n\nFNT T-Shirt!\nhttps://mixedtees.com/nerdrotic/friday-night-tights\n\nSponsored by GEEK GRIND!\nNerdrotic Blend Coffee from Geek Grind\nUse Promo Code \"Nerdrotic\" for 20% off:\nhttps://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/...\n\nNerdrotic Coffee Cup from Geek Grind:\nhttps://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/...",
