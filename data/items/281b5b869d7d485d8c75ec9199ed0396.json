  "description": "<p>Jake Hanrahan talked to me about conflict reporting. He goes to war zones and tries to bring back word of what's actually going on in these areas. It's crazy. He brings back tons of footage. Look at <a href=\"http://www.popularfront.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">PopularFront.co</a> and you'll see what I'm talking about. He's not even welcome in a lot of these places. Once they put him in a Turkish prison! Really interesting stuff in this one.</p> <p>You gotta excuse the sound a little. I recorded in the wrong button on my audio recorder so I had to end up using the laptop mic and it's not as good as the regular Sennheiser mic. You'll get used to it but the first 2 minutes you're gonna get annoyed. I'm telling you, this one is worth the trouble. Jake Hanrahan has some crazy stories!</p> <p>Go support Jake in his quest to bring the truth about wars. Become patron. You can do $1, $5, 0r $10 and no matter what you're going to be helping a real independent guy do his thing. <a href= \"http://www.patreon.com/popularfront\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Patreon.com/PopularFront</a></p> <p><strong><em>The Music</em></strong></p> <p>Eric Bogle - The War Correspondent</p> <p>Death Grips - I've Seen Footage</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Falco - Kamikaze Cappa</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Original Caste - One Tin Soldier</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to our sponsors:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get DHM Detox at NoDaysWasted.co/Skeptic.
