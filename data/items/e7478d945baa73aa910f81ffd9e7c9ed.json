  "description": "In Episode 50 I sat down with good friend Will Dalton to chat about aspects of my life including what inspired me to transition to a plant based lifestyle and ultimately start Plant Proof.\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nFor those of you who have followed the Plant Proof journey over the past 12 months, and become part of what is a really incredible community that continues to inspire me daily, you will know that I don't actually like to share a whole lot about myself. I've never been one to want to over share on social media but given the growth of Plant Proof I appreciate that many of you will want to get to know me better, and rightly so!\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWhen Will and I sat down we literally started recording with zero format, plans or notes. Everything you hear is completely off the cuff... just how we normally would chat over a coffee after some soft sand lands and a swim at North Bondi. So here it is, a very raw and somewhat unique episode for this show (I much prefer leading the conversation than being asked questions) - I hope it gives you a bit more insight into how I think. Be sure to listen all the way to the end including my outro at the very end of the episode after Will and I finish talking where I offer some more insight into a few things to close out the conversation.\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nReviews are really important:\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIf you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners. And if you have any friends that you think will benefit from listening to this episode or any of the other Plant Proof episodes please share the link – together we can make this world a healthier place.\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWhere to listen to the Plant Proof podcast?\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nCurrently, the Plant Proof podcast can be listened to on iTunes, Google Podcasts (note: use the google podcast app not google play), Spotify, Stitcher, Soundcloud or on the Plantproof.com directly. If you listen on iTunes be sure to hit ‘subscribe’ or ‘follow’ on Spotifyso you are instantly notified when I release new episodes each week.\n ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nSimon Hill\nCreator of Plantproof.com - your FREE resource for plant based nutrition information\nLearn more about your ad choices.
