  "description": "Glenn shares the craziest and most terrifying story he’s ever told on air that makes rapper Lil Nas X’s \"Satan Shoes\" look tame: Apparently in California, cannibal gods are better for children to learn about than the Christian God. BlazeTV’s Steve Deace joins to discuss his new book, \"Faucian Bargain,\" about how dangerous Dr. Fauci has been for our country. With the vaccine readily available, the country should be opening back up. Glenn argues that banks and companies are weaponizing social justice and that ESG scores will affect the common person. The Derek Chauvin trial is under way, and the media have already made up their minds. Our criminal justice system is in trouble if emotions are more important than facts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
