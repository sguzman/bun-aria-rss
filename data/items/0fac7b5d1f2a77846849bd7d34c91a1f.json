Uncivil is a history podcast that goes back to the moment when the divisions in this country turned into a war. The show ransacks the official version of the Civil War—with untold stories about covert operations, corruption, resistance and mutiny. Uncivil is hosted by Jack Hitt and Chenjerai Kumanyika (who you may remember from our episode on Purple Stuff). Jack and Chenjerai take on what you think you know about the Civil War, and connect what happened then to the political battlefield we’re living on right now.\nListen to Uncivil on Apple Podcasts | Overcast | Stitcher | Pocketcasts\nThe Nod will be back next week with an all new episode!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
