  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the status of the Ball family's Big Baller Brand. In the wake of allegations that a BBB part owner and friend of the family stole money from the company, Lakers guard Lonzo Ball covered up his Big Baller Brand tattoo. ESPN reported that Lonzo Ball severed ties with one the brand's founders, Alan Foster, over concerns that he had misappropriated $1.5 million of the player's money. Also talked about is Mets owner Fred Wilpon's decision to increase his stake in the baseball team by buying a limited stake that had been offered. The New York Post said Wilpon agreed to pay about $180 million for 12 percent of the club that had been held by Comcast and Charter Communications. That figure values the team at about $1.5 billion. Also discussed is lawyer Michael Avenatti's claim that Nike broke the law by paying high-school basketball players. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
