  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a racial equity activist group is calling on white liberal families to pledge that they won’t send their kids to Ivy League schools. And in fact, given that white liberals agree that white privilege and systemic racism exists, the group actually has a point. Also we have our Five Headlines, including Tucker Carlson getting accosted by a deranged leftist while out with his family, the Olympics begins and nobody notices, and AOC offers a defense of Critical Race Theory that contradicts the usual defense of Critical Race Theory. And in our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel the Free Britney movement.\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
