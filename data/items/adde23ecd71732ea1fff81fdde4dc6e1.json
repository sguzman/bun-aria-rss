  "title": "Crushing it in 2020: A positive lockdown story [98]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we feature our third positive lockdown story - this time, our guest is American artist Rachel Davis, who transformed her attitude and her art business when Covid forced the closure of an important show and the cancellation of all her plans. Initially depressed and listless, Rachel was inspired into action after a friend held a successful online event. Despite her lack of technology experience, Rachel decided to launch her own virtual open studio and subsequently designed and managed a successful online fundraiser. She also had work selected for several prestigious shows and made a rather special sale. We both found Rachel's story super-inspiring and we hope you enjoy it too.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Rachel Davis <a href=\"//\">https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/</a></p>\n<p>This American Life Kid logic &nbsp;<a href=\"//\">https://www.thisamericanlife.org/605/kid-logic-2016</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
