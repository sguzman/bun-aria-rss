He was created in 2009 on Something Awful by a man named Eric Knudesen and has dominated the internet ever since. In 2014 two Wisconsin girls pledged their allegiance to Slenderman by stabbing their best friend 19 times and leaving her for dead in the middle of the woods. They thought they would be off to live in his mansion in the forest, but that wasn’t exactly the end of it all.<br>\n<br>\nThank you to our Patreon supporters for picking this week's episodes!!!
