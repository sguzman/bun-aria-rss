  "description": "<p>The house that is nicknamed Korner's Folly is also thought to be one of the strangest houses in America. This is a large mansion with 22 rooms that was built in a whimsical way leaving some people scratching their heads in a similar way as the Winchester Mystery House. Jule Korner was a creative genius who wanted this house to be a visual experience and the house was under renovation most of the time to make room for new design ideas. Today, it is not only a museum, but the mysterious house harbors spirits. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Korner's Folly! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jenny Lynne Raines and features Titus Carvilius Gemello's ring and This Month in History features Roanoke Colony deserted.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2021/08/hgb-ep-399-korners-folly.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Journey by Carriage by StockMusic</p>",
