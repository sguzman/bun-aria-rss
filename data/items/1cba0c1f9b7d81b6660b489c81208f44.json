  "description": "<p>We derive simple but nearly tight upper and lower bounds for the binomial\nlower tail probability (with straightforward generalization to the upper tail\nprobability) that apply to the whole parameter regime. These bounds are easy to\ncompute and are tight within a constant factor of $89/44$. Moreover, they are\nasymptotically tight in the regimes of large deviation and moderate deviation.\nBy virtue of a surprising connection with Ramanujan's equation, we also provide\nstrong evidences suggesting that the lower bound is tight within a factor of\n$1.26434$. It may even be regarded as the natural lower bound, given its\nsimplicity and appealing properties. Our bounds significantly outperform the\nfamiliar Chernoff bound and reverse Chernoff bounds known in the literature and\nmay find applications in various research areas.\n</p>",
