  "description": "What are the identity conflicts that define contemporary society? In Brexitland: Identity, Diversity and the Reshaping of British Politics (Cambridge UP, 2020) Maria Sobolewska and Robert Ford, professors of politics at the University of Manchester, explore the long term, structural changes in British society that underpinned the 2016 referendum on EU membership, the 2017 and 2019 general elections, as well as contemporary political debates and future questions such as voting on Scottish independence. At the heart of the book is the identification of new identity groups- both liberal and conservative- that have been shaped by changes in education and diversity, as well as by politicians’ and political parties’ behaviours. Offering historical analysis of immigration and public opinion, as well as a rich and detailed engagement with contemporary social attitudes, the book is essential reading both in the UK and in other nations seeing the rise of similar forms of social change and attitudinal conflicts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
