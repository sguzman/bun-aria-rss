  "description": "<p>BEWARE THE SLENDERMAN tells the story of the internet's elusive Boogeyman and two 12-year-old girls who would kill for him. Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier lured their best friend into the woods, stabbed her 19 times, then set out on an odyssey to meet the tall and faceless man known online as Slenderman. Shot over 18 months with heartbreaking access to the families of the would-be murderers, the film plunges deep down the rabbit hole of their crime, a Boogeyman. and our society's most impressionable consumers of media. The entrance to the internet can quickly lead us to its dark basement, within just a matter of clicks. How much do we hold children responsible for what they find there?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING TO JOIN THE PATREON FAM FOR ALLLLLLLLL THAT BONUS CONTENT?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">GO HERE!</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>COME SEE US LIVE IN NYC ON FEBRUARY 9TH!</strong> <a href=\"https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/997774\">Click here for tickets!</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking for our Advertisers / Promo Codes?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/get-our-promo-codes\">Go Here!</a> We now have a whole page of our site for you to check out and <a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/get-our-promo-codes\">GET.
