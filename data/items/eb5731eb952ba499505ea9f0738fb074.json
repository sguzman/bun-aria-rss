  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things off with a quick explanation as to why he was physically incapable of dropping a post-4th of July pod on Monday. Sorry, America, but not even the great J-Mac is immune to the aftereffects of a good holiday cocktail. Next, Producer Rob G joins the show to help discuss the bombshell story over the weekend centered around ESPN personalities Rachel Nichols and Maria Taylor. A private conversation between Nichols and an associate was secretly recorded and leaked to other media outlets. In the audio, Nichols basically suggested that the biggest reason Taylor was advancing within the company so quickly is because she's black. Big Yikes. It's hard to say exactly what's going to happen moving forward, but one thing is certain: There are no winners in this. Say what you want about Nichols and Taylor individually, but ESPN comes out as a big loser in this. As Jay-Z says, \"Nobody wins when The Family feuds\". Later, the guys bring you a full Phoenix Suns-Milwaukee NBA Finals preview. Both Jason and Rob G have the Suns winning the series. Devin Booker and Chris Paul should be able to feast against Milwaukee's defensive coverage, and with Giannis Antetokounmpo's availability in question it's hard to envision the Bucks mustering enough offense to keep up. Unless Khris Middleton is suddenly available to develop any level of consistency, 'Suns in 4 Guy' may be back on your television relatively soon.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
