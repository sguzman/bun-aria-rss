  "description": "For more than 30 years, John McLaughlin has been one of the most thoughtful and trusted minds in the U.S. Intelligence Community rising to be Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.  He sees no precedent for the period we are in, the threats we face both internally and externally nor the challenges these present for the intelligence community or the country.  From a new National Intelligence Strategy that directly challenges the president and his policies to the sweeping success Putin has had undercutting the West's alliances and our vulnerability to future such attacks, our conversation with him is bracing and essential listening.
