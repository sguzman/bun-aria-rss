    "media:description": "This is a spontaneous home video which wasn't originally meant for YouTube, but as little miss is learning her French numbers, I thought you might enjoy it. I've found this advent calendar particularly useful to reinforce her learning, as we've been counting the stockings every day, sometimes in French sometimes in English, to see which one we were allowed to open that day! We're actually slightly ahead as we're off to France before the 24th (Fingers crossed this actually goes to plan!), so I let her start the calendar at the end of November. Only mentioning as some of you may notice we counted to 21, yet it's not the 21st of December yet! üòÖ &#13;\n\nHave a lovely Christmas!\nJoyeux No√´l √† tous ! \n&#13;\n_____&#13;\n&#13;\n// I T A L K I   P R O M O&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è http://promos.italki.com/frencheezee&#13;\n(this is an affiliate link)&#13;\n&#13;\n_____&#13;\n&#13;\n// P A T R E O N&#13;\nSupport my work and get cool rewards!&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.patreon.com/frencheezi&#13;\n&#13;\n_____&#13;\n&#13;\n// W A T CH   N E X T&#13;\n&#13;\nFRENCH CHRISTMAS STORY 2020\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://youtu.be/7FytZ6x1QgE\n&#13;\nTOP 30 FRENCH PHRASES INTERMEDIATE EDITION&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sXE54qMlyY&#13;\n&#13;\nTOP 10 BASIC FRENCH WORDS&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixUsp-vvbMM&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n_____&#13;\n&#13;\n// F O L L O W   M E&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Facebook | http://www.facebook.com/pages/frencheezi&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Twitter | https://twitter.com/frencheezi&#13;\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Instagram | https://instagram.com/frencheezi&#13;\n&#13;\n_____&#13;\n&#13;\n// A B O U T   M E&#13;\n&#13;\nBonjour !
