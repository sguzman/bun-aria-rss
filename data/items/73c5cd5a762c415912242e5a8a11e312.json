  "description": "On Monday’s Gist, we’re counting Pulitzers and powering up. \nJeremy Heimans and Henry Timms sort power into two categories: old and new. Old power is like Congress: top-down, official. New power is like Facebook: decentralized, crowd-sourced. What is the best way to meld both kinds of influence to improve our lives? Heimans and Timms have the beginnings of an answer. They’re the authors of New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World – and How to Make It Work for You.\nIn the Spiel, James Comey does seem ego-driven. That’s not always a bad thing. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
