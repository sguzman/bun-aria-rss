  "description": "Many of you are listening to this show and you're starting to build your collection of bourbon. I was in your same shoes years ago and I would come home from the liquor store every week with a new bottle when I wasn't even 10% done with the bottle I bought the previous week. That same process goes on, you learn about limited editions, the hunt really begins, the credit card points really start rolling in, and before you know it you have a bunker of bourbon. I'm joined by Mark Rucker of The Bourbon Life to talk about bunkering and when can there ever be enough. We talk about the upper limits of purchasing, bottle prices, and folks who purchase just for the investment purpose. There's more topics that we dive into such as tactics used by marketing teams to always drive limited releases and how some brands are creating confusion to consumers. But the question remains, will we ever need to stop bunkering bourbon?\n\nShow Notes:\n\nAbove the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about whiskey gift giving.\n\nHow many bottles do you have in your collection?\n\nCan you expense your bourbon purchases as business expenses?\n\nAt what point do you say you have enough single barrel selections of a certain brand?\n\nIs it harder to open the last bottle from a barrel pick you were on?\n\nMarriages are supposed to be a 50/50 relationship. Does your better half buy you bottles?\n\nIs there something in us that says \"is there ever enough to stop\"?\n\nIs there an upper limit such as maxing out your bar?\n\nIs there a problem with people who just want to collect to eventually sell?\n\nDo the vast majority of distilleries need to slow down on limited releases?\n\nShould people be going crazy for Russell's Reserve 13 year?\n\nDoes creating more colors of Weller continually feed the animal?\n\nWhat brand does a good job of having a lot of labels but doesn't create confusion?\n\nIs this strategy seen as a disservice to the consumer?\n\n@thebourbonlife\n\nSupport this podcast on Patreon",
