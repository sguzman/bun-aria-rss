  "description": "<p>Lenses encode protocols for synchronising systems. We continue the work begun\nby Chollet et al. at the Applied Category Theory Adjoint School in 2020 to\nstudy the properties of the category of small categories and asymmetric delta\nlenses. The forgetful functor from the category of lenses to the category of\nfunctors is already known to reflect monos and epis and preserve epis; we show\nthat it preserves monos, and give a simpler proof that it preserves epis.\nTogether this gives a complete characterisation of the monic and epic lenses in\nterms of elementary properties of their get functors.\n</p>\n<p>Next, we initiate the study of coequalisers of lenses. We observe that not\nall parallel pairs of lenses have coequalisers, and that the forgetful functor\nfrom the category of lenses to the category of functors neither preserves nor\nreflects all coequalisers. However, some coequalisers are reflected; we study\nwhen this occurs, and then use what we learned to show that every epic lens is\nregular, and that discrete opfibrations have pushouts along monic lenses.\nCorollaries include that every monic lens is effective, every monic epic lens\nis an isomorphism, and the class of all epic lenses and the class of all monic\nlenses form an orthogonal factorisation system.\n</p>",
