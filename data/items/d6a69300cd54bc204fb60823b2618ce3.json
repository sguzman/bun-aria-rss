  "description": "In today's podcast, we discuss the SWIFT transfer issues now under investigation in a dozen more banks. SWIFT announces a five-point security strategy. Attacks on the private sector are seen as having national security implications. Other cyber threats to business--DDoS and ransomware--place availability of data and networks at risk. We take a look at investor interest in cyber stocks, and we talk with experts on artificial intelligence and encryption. And, as far as nation-state attacks are concerned, again, signs point to Pyongyang. (As they so often do.) Malek Ben Salem from Accenture Labs explains AI and Machine Learning, and Brent Waters, of the University of Texas at Austin, who's recently been honored with an early career award from the Association of Computing Machinery for his contributions to encryption.",
