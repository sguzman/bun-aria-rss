  "description": "To kick off the week, Sharon sits down to chat with comedian and fellow Midwesterner, Charlie Berens. Charlie talks about how he doubled down on his Midwestern character after realizing just how different he sounded to people when he traveled outside of the Midwest. He channels his dad and his grandfather in his comedy, turning on that gruff but unfailingly polite Wisconsinite personality. Sharon and Charlie compare their Midwestern upbringings, laughing together about what it really means to say, “<em>I’m fine</em>” in the Midwest, how catchin’ fish is like going grocery shopping on the lake, and the rivalry–and striking similarities–between Minnesota and Wisconsin.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
