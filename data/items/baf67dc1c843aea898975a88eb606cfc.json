  "description": "Nothing is more core to the life of the Deep State than marking documents classified.  After all, if just anyone could read them, who'd want to?  On the other hand, if documents are classified, they can't be shared which is a bit of a problem in the cyber era when our most important defenses may be in the private sector.  What's a secret-loving country to do?  The NY Times' David Sanger, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and IISS' Kori Schake discuss.  (And, yes, they also discuss Omarosa and Peter Strzok and all that other mishigas as well.
