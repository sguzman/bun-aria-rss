  "description": "<p>What does it take to win with your money and achieve your financial goals? During this episode, we make a case that the most important factor is grit. It’s not earning six figures, or knowing the exact right investment moves to make. Though both of those are important, they’re not nearly as vital as grit. As Angela Duckworth writes, “Grit is perseverance for very long-term goals”. We begin to succeed when we truly commit to the goals that we’re pursuing. Luckily the amount of grit we possess isn’t static and there are ways for us to cultivate more grit in our lives that will allow us to get ahead with our finances. Passion, practice, and other people are just a few of the really important ways that we can develop more grit and start winning with our money.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Pales in Comparison by Edmund’s Oast!
