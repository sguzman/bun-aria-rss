  "description": "<p>My HoneyDew this week is Jessa Reed. Jessa’s story is unlike anything I’ve ever heard. By the age of 16 she had already lived a life that most people will never experience - bong hits at age six, addiction, abuse, being a teenage mom, death threats and severe meth addiction. Did I mention she died? Oh yeah, SHE DIED! It’s one hell of an episode! <a href=\"https://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>",
