  "description": "Today we welcome back one of our most downloaded—and controversial—guests of all time... Kristin Tate, author of The Liberal Invasion of Red State America, is back on the podcast to discuss public policy, culture, and cryptos. [1:35] During the COVID lockdowns, as businesses shifted to remote work, we saw a huge migration of people out of big cities and into more suburban and rural parts of the country. But Kristin says the shift had been taking place long before COVID forced the push forward. She explains why big cities will never return to the major corporate and cultural hubs they once were. [2:38] For instance, New York City’s newly elected Mayor Eric Adams has a mission: convince former residents to return to the Big Apple. Kristin highlights why he’s unlikely to succeed. [6:00] You’ve undoubtedly heard of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial… It’s just another example of how everything is politicized today—drawing a hard line between conservatives and liberals. We discuss how moderates are getting sick of the narrative… [12:15] If you’re traveling for the holidays, Kristin lays out a few issues that could wreak havoc on your plans... [16:35] And as we face labor shortages—especially in certain blue-collar industries—she reveals the cultural issues behind the problem. [21:00] Next, Kristin gives her thoughts on who will win big during next November’s midterm elections… and how she expects politicians to double-down with their respective voter bases. [23:40] Turning to crypto, Kristin shares her own holdings… and why she’s bullish on the asset class in the short term, but bearish over the much longer term... [26:30] Finally, Kristin gives us a glimpse into her next book… and the role she’s playing in Texas’ upcoming political race. [32:10] Enjoyed this episode?
