  "description": "<p>So, what if being highly sensitive was actually a superpower, not something to be fixed?</p><br><p>If you've ever heard the term, “highly sensitive person,” or even been called highly sensitive and maybe even recoiled a bit when that happened, our conversation with today’s guest, Dr. Elaine Aron, just might change your world. An acclaimed researcher, she first identified high sensitivity as a distinct character trait more than 25 years ago, introducing the term “Highly Sensitive Person” to describe someone who is easily overwhelmed by strong sensory input, subtleties in environment and other people’s moods, processes things in different ways and at different speeds, and deeply feels pressure and overstimulation.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Since its publication in 1995, her preeminent book on the subject, The Highly Sensitive Person, has gone on to become an international bestseller translated into 30 languages. She is also the author of<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e56Tge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>The Highly Sensitive Parent</em></a>, and many others. She has established the Foundation for the Study of Highly Sensitive Persons and published many scientific articles on sensitivity in the leading journals in her field.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Turns out, today’s conversation was also personal, because in many ways, I’ve begun to realize that I actually identify as a highly sensitive person. But, I also discovered so much more about the way I move through the world, how this trait relates to introversion and extroversion - very surprising - and how you can be both highly sensitive, while also being high-sensation, which I’d never heard before. And, we also discover how Elaine’s lens on high sensitivity has evolved in meaningful ways since her groundbreaking early research on the topics.</p><br><p>You can find Elaine at: <a href=\"https://hsperson.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000386711762\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Susan David, PhD</a> about emotional agility.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li><li><strong>Townsizing: </strong>On HGTV’s Townsizing, renowned author and writer Anne Helen Petersen takes you to small towns across the U.S. and talks to the people who make them special. <a href=\"https://pod.link/1648173038\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Listen to Townsizing wherever you get your podcasts.</a></li><li><strong>Aspiration:&nbsp;</strong>Aspiration is a climate-friendly alternative to big banks.
