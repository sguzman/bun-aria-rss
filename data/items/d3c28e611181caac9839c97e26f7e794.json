  "description": "<div>19-year-old Arlis Perry took her Christian faith seriously. After fighting with her husband Bruce on the night of October 12 1974, she decided to clear her head by stopping in at the Stanford Memorial Church to pray. When she still hadn’t returned an hour later, Bruce checked the church but the doors we locked. He waited a few more hours before reporting Arlis missing. <br>\n<br>\n---</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Episode narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a><br>\nWritten by Elsha McGill</div>\n<div>Researched by Jessica Forsayeth</div>\n<div>Additional writing and editing by Milly Raso</div>\n<div>Creative Director: Milly Raso</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"https://casefilepodcast.com/case-137-arlis-perry/\">casefilepodcast.com/case-137-arlis-perry</a>\n</div>\n",
