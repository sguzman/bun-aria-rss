  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, President Biden and the Democrats are doing everything possible to take control of voting and block Republican efforts to strengthen voter integrity. Democrats have proposed legislation that would turn America into one dark blue state where they would never lose power because that is the only thing that matters to them. Biden gave a Castro-like speech today in Philadelphia pushing a false narrative about standing up to the greatest threat to our Democracy, calling for no voter ID and no signature verification. Democrats want to ram through their voting agenda with a 50-50 senate a four-seat majority in the House of Representatives. The chaos at the border is all part of the plan, as they push to remove citizenship as a requirement to vote. They want to destroy our voting system and neutralize our vote by putting the Democrat party first and the country last. Also, we can no longer allow the government to control our schools. Community committees, parents groups, and activists must take a stand against their local school boards and the corruption of public education. Students should be taught civics and history as written by real historians, not 1619 project propaganda. Later, a new report came out that shows the U.S. Navy is not prepared for fighting a war but are well trained in diversity. This is what is happening to our military while the Chinese are building a naval fleet second to none. Finally, Marco Rubio calls in to discuss the ongoing crisis in Cuba. 100 activists are missing, people are being brutalized and murdered, and now some have had their internet connection cut to stop the spread of their uprising against their fascist government, all in the name of Marxism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
