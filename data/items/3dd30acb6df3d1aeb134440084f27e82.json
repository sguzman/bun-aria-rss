  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Eugene Cho is a passionate pastor, author, and activist who has learned how to maintain his convictions without condemning those who do not share them. Sometimes that learning has come through failure, and other times it’s been discovered at a dinner table with those he disagrees with. Cho has compiled his lessons into a new book, “Thou Shalt Not Be a Jerk: A Christian’s Guide to Engaging Politics.” Also this week: Will the coronavirus force churches to think outside the box?
