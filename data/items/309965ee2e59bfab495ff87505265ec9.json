  "description": "Kristin Tate, columnist and author of The Liberal Invasion of Red State America, has a lot of concerns about what we could see under the Biden Administration. Policies such as forgiving student loan debt, she says, could set a terrible precedent going forward… and one potential event could lead to a one-party system. Listen as Kristen shares how she started reporting on government waste and mismanagement… and why she’s worried about government intervention. Plus, she explains why she’s a fan of bitcoin and ethereum. [30:29] Then, as bitcoin pulls back from all-time highs, Daniel and I discuss the bearish thesis making its rounds in the crypto community... break down the incredible results from Netflix and Goldman Sachs… and why Daniel’s bullish on the markets.
