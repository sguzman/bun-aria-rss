  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming two guests to the show. My first guest, Georgie from Oklahoma, describes having an encounter with his family while fishing. He describes a creature with large breasts throwing rocks at him and his family.</p> <p>Our second guest Denise from Texas writes \"Hey Wes, I’ve wrote before concerning the years we have shared the woods with some creature that no one believes is there. MANY strange things happened (whistling, knocks after I accidentally would bang a broom, large strange dead animals in the tree line) and I knew nothing about Bigfoot until I “scared him” twice and then witnessed him through a pair of binoculars. This allowed me to watch his expressions change and study his face, creepy as it was.</p> <p>I also wanted to tell you about another guy we knew here in town who was in law enforcement and shot one that was on his back patio one night.</p> <p>If you’re interested in talking, I’d be willing to share what we have gone through. Thanks for all you do, you seem very kind.”</p>",
