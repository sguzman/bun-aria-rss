  "description": "Happy Vergecast day! Look we’ve got a new logo!\n\nThis week, in honor of The Verge’s fifth anniversary and the redesign of the website, we start off the show by giving some behind-the-scenes details on the new things you see on the site and things we’ve changed.\n\nBut don’t worry, we still have that weekly news you all subscribe for. Nilay, Dieter, Paul, and Dan discuss using the Google Home speaker and how it works with the Google Assistant. Also, we have reviews of the 13-inch Macbook Pro (yeah the one without the Touch Bar), Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods,” and some great ad reads in between.\n\n01:49 - The Verge turns 5\n\n15:58 - Google Home\n\n27:49 - Google Assistant\n\n40:35 - Macbook Pro\n\n1:06:27 - Paul’s weekly segment “Cookie Pods”\n\nWe want to thank the listeners, new and old, for tuning in each and giving feedback on the show, we greatly appreciate it.\n\nA quote from Nilay on this week’s episode:\n\n“We launched The Verge basically on the back of this podcast. This podcast when Paul and I were doing it with Josh as the Engadget podcast was so popular that we could fucking leave and start a new podcast, our listeners came with us, and we were able to launch This Is My Next and then The Verge so it’s wild that we’ve done it for five years.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
