  "description": "<p>We sit down with legendary investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital and his son Andrew who, while less-well-known, is also an incredibly accomplished investor in a very different arena: early-stage VC. The purpose of the conversation was to discuss their joint work together on Howard’s all-time most popular memo, “Something of Value”, which made the then-shocking argument that Value and Growth investing are not diametric opposites but rather two sides of the same investing coin. We of course dive deep into that, and also cover plenty of fun Oaktree and investing history, as well as Andrew’s favorite topic: selling (or not selling, as the case may be). This is not one to miss!<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more Acquired, you can <a href= \"http://pod.link/acquiredlp\">follow our public LP Show feed here</a> in the podcast player of your choice (including Spotify!).<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/something-of-value.pdf\"> The Original “Something of Value” Memo</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo-podcast/the-rewind-something-of-value\"> Howard and Andrew on Oaktree’s “The Memo” podcast</a><br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thanks to Vanta for being our presenting sponsor for this special episode.
