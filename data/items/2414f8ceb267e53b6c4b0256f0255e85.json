  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best Of Mark Levin.  The media is thoroughly and grotesquely racist, antisemitic, and Marxist. Darryl Edward Brooks Jr has been charged with the slaughter of 5 and the injuries of 40 children and adults he allegedly ran over at a Christmas parade. Brooks is a career criminal with a listing on Arizona's sex offender registry and his motivation remains to be seen. Then, these problems are perpetuated by the rejection of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's idea of a color-blind society from the Marxists that promote critical race theory and MSNBC hosts smear and trash White people and this country's founding.  Later, self-defense predates the U.S Constitution and Kyle Rittenhouse was rightfully found not guilty. A non-violent protester was killed in the riot on January 6th and the left within the media called that an insurrection. Yet, Democrats will defend the violent rioters instead of the law-abiding citizen. The radicals on the left don't believe in a jury system as was proved by the prosecutors in this case who were willing to undermine the Constitution to get a scalp for their cause. Finally, MSNBC's Tiffany's Cross attacks truck drivers claiming that the white drivers cut off the black drivers. Cross's suggestion that truckers are racists does not sit well with truckers of all races and genders across America. Later, Buzzfeed maintains that because the FBI opened an investigation into the Steele dossier they felt it was worth reporting on it. Despite learning that the entire dossier was false almost none of the media have retracted their stories.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
