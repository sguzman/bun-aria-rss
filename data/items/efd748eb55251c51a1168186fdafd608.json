  "description": "<p>Emmy award winning Cinematographer Phil Abraham joins Michael and Steve for another exciting episode of Talking Sopranos. Phil worked on all six seasons of the Sopranos and shares some great stories from behind the camera. He talks about how James Gandolfini was once  leery about a director so he tanked the scene just to see if the director would notice. He also talks about directing his first episode, and what it was like being part of crazy Soprano's family. </p><p>Then Michael and Steve get into this week’s episode which is one of Edie Falco’s best. Carmela tries therapy on her own but is shaken by what Dr Krakower tells her. Did you know that Mike Nichols originally agreed to play the role of the doctor but bailed after the table read? Junior undergoes an operation for cancer and places his life in the hands of a man named Kennedy. Unfortunately doctors in real life aren’t what they’re like on TV….wait what? Michael and Steve dig into the whole Kennedy mystique and Michael tells us what he really thinks of Ronald Regan. It’s all this week on Talking Sopranos Ep #33 “Second Opinion” S3 Ep7.
