  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, this investigation of Donald Trump was falsely labeled as an investigation into January 6th. Today's hearing showed us that despite all the opinions, texts, emails, and meetings President Trump did nothing to stop the transition of power. Despite all the testimony that the Committee has received, they failed to connect Trump to any interference with the election or any calls to violence. There is not a shred of evidence that Trump violated any law. On the contrary, he pursued every legal avenue to do things the right way; he is free to make phone calls, lobby state legislatures, and address his constituents and supporters under the constitution. Should the Biden administration indict Trump it will be the gravest act of insurrection, of tyranny, that this nation has ever faced since the Civil War and I don’t think the country will ever recover. Then, Congressman Jim Jordan joins the show to explain how the January 6 committee has been caught in several lies. They lied about Bernie Kerik's travel, they lied about Rep. Barry Loudermilk's tour, and they falsified Rep. Jordan's texts that quoted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Republicans intend to examine this committee and the questions surrounding, the border, energy policy, and Hunter Biden's federal investigations should they earn a majority this November. Afterward, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing today and radical leftist law professor Khiara Bridges testified in utter absurdities. Despite the states coming together after the Constitutional Convention to add the Bill of Rights, the left still hates the Constitution and trashes it as a white supremacist document. Meanwhile, recording artist John Ondrasik of the band \"Five for Fighting\" calls in to discuss his latest recorded in Ukraine to support the war against Russia. Ondrasik says he wants the message to spread to prevent further aggression in Europe and against Taiwan. Finally, former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich joins the show to discuss his new book \"Defeating Big Government Socialism: Saving America's Future.\" Gingrich explains that the things Democrats believe in don't work and are destructive. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Defeating-Big-Government-Socialism-Americas/dp/1546003193/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=newt+gingrich+books&qid=1657647275&sprefix=NEWT+G%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-3\nLearn more about your ad choices.
