  "description": "<p>It’s time to go Parks-and-Rec on this episode and talk about treating yo self while still being a responsible adult and not breaking the bank. There’s nothing wrong with the occasional treat- we all want to be able to splurge every now and again. But we also need to make sure that we’re not going overboard to the detriment of our financial health. Companies are waging war against our credit cards and checking accounts with advertising agencies at their sides. Our attention has been hijacked by marketers and this often leads to us buying more stuff that we don’t actually need. Couple that with rising prices due to inflation and higher levels of consumer debt and we realize that it’s going to take a healthy combination of wisdom, discipline, and intentional spending. Listen as we tackle all of this and as we propose some rules that will help us to be effective, but not excessive when it comes to treating ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Cherry Livelihood Jackie O's!
