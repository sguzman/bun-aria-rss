  "description": "<p>Lenses are an important tool in applied category theory. While individual\nlenses have been widely used in applications, many of the mathematical\nproperties of the corresponding categories of lenses have remained unknown. In\nthis paper, we study the category of small categories and asymmetric delta\nlenses, and prove that it has several good exactness properties. These\nproperties include the existence of certain limits and colimits, as well as\nso-called imported limits, such as imported products and imported pullbacks,\nwhich have arisen previously in applications. The category is also shown to be\nextensive, and it has an image factorisation system.\n</p>",
