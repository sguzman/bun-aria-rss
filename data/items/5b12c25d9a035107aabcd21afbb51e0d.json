Kessler (writer/producer) to the podcast. Todd is a really interesting guy who wrote 4 episodes of the Sopranos and produced 20 more. He’s a Harvard grad who met David Chase when he was 24 and started writing for the show at 25. He had a great run on the Sopranos until David decided the show would be better off without him. It was a huge blow for Todd and he tells us what James Gandolfini told him the night he left the show. After the Sopranos, Todd went on to become the co-creator and show runner for the very successful series Damages. </p><p>     Then Michael and Steve breakdown this week’s episode. In this one AJ talks Carmela and Tony into letting him spend the night in NYC. He ends up with his face glued to the floor and his eyebrows shaved off.
