  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the eminent 19th-century scientist Michael Faraday. Born into a poor working-class family, he received little formal schooling but became interested in science while working as a bookbinder's apprentice. He is celebrated today for carrying out pioneering research into the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Faraday showed that if a wire was turned in the presence of a magnet or a magnet was turned in relation to a wire, an electric current was generated. This ground-breaking discovery led to the development of the electric generator and ultimately to modern power stations. During his life he became the most famous scientist in Britain and he played a key role in founding the Royal Institution's Christmas lectures which continue today.\n\nWith:\n\nGeoffrey Cantor\nProfessor Emeritus of the History of Science at the University of Leeds\n\nLaura Herz\nProfessor of Physics at the University of Oxford\n\nFrank James\nProfessor of the History of Science at the Royal Institution\n\nProducer: Victoria Brignell.",
