  "description": "<p>A tiny, uninhabitable, rocky island sits off the coast of Pointe du Raz, in western Brittany, France in Raz de Sein. This island is home to Tevennec Lighthouse. Lighthouses are meant to prevent deaths by guiding ships through dangerous waters. But Tevennec has been the scene of death many times and even before the lighthouse was built, local folklore tells of a history of death and haunting on the island. Legend says that Tevennec was home to Ankou, the Breton name for Death himself. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Tevennec Lighthouse! The Moment in Oddity features the burial of a shaman 12,000 years ago and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features the UFO crash in Roswell. Our location was suggested by listener Janet Sheppard and our Research Assistant was April Rogers-Krick.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/07/hgb-ep-135-tevennec-lighthouse.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/07/hgb-ep-135-tevennec-lighthouse.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
