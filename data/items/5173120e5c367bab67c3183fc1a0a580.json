Takes the text of a blog post<br>2. Summarizes it into a DALL-E prompt<br>3. Submits that to DALL-E<br>4. Now you have art for the blog!</p>&mdash; ·¥Ö·¥Ä…¥…™·¥á ü ·¥ç…™·¥áss ü·¥á Ä (@DanielMiessler) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler/status/1581803468003516416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</center></p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the idea I became obsessed with last night, and I was able to get a working proof of concept in less than 30 minutes! This stuff is just nuts.</p>\n\n<h2>How to build it</h2>\n\n<p class=\"note\"><a href=\"https://www.v7labs.com/blog/few-shot-learning-guide\">More on few-shotting</a>.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<p>Ok, as I said in the tweet, there are a few key steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Summarize the text</li>\n<li>Turn that into a prompt</li>\n<li>Create an image from the prompt</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My technique&#8212;and be gentle because it&#8217;s a very quick POC&#8212;is to combine the first two steps into a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api\">few-shot</a> learning template. For anyone who just WTF&#8217;d, <span class=\"tweet-able\">few-shotting is basically showing an AI the right answer a few times and then giving it a similar problem with no answer</span>.</p>\n\n<p>So I wanted the template to both 1) train the AI to write a prompt, and 2) feed it my text to build the prompt from. I did that by mixing those two in the Summary portion of the template.</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138311\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138311\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/miessler-prompt-summary1-650x312.png\" alt=\"miessler-prompt-summary1\" width=\"650\" height=\"312\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-138311\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the training shots, showing the mixture of prompt and content summarization</p></div>\n\n<p class=\"note\">You can tweak this language to make it match your blog.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a professional digital painting about‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>‚Ä¶was static in all the summaries I trained it with. And so was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation‚Ä¶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means when I ask this tool for the real (non-training) prompt&#8212;using my new text&#8212;I don&#8217;t have to add those things!</p>\n\n<h2>Training the prompter</h2>\n\n<p class=\"note\">Some guru will be able to show me a better way, no doubt.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s pretty much it. You just need the text to get summarized, which includes a label (I used Text), and then a summary that is your output on a separate line (I used Summary). <strong>Then, as your final step, send the thing you want to summarize (which is the completed prompt), and leave the answer blank!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the whole promt looks like, with all the &#8220;Text:&#8221; portions being taken from other blog posts of mine:</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138322\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138322\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/miessler-full-prompt-text.png\" alt=\"miessler-full-prompt-text\" width=\"650\" height=\"1074\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138322\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138322\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The full series of Text/Summary training scenarios</p></div>\n\n<h2>Remarkably solid prompt quality</h2>\n\n<p>Using this technique I was able to generate some pretty decent prompts, which surprised me. Here&#8217;s the opening of a blog post I did recently, and I wanted to see if this technique could create a decent prompt for it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It‚Äôs common to hear that it‚Äôs hard to get into cybersecurity, and that this is a problem. That seems to be true, but it‚Äôs informative to ask a simple follow-up: The current cybersecurity jobs gap sits at around 2.7 million people. A problem for who? I think what we‚Äôre facing is an instance of the Two-Worlds Problem that‚Äôs now everywhere in US society. It‚Äôs where the vast majority of people are feeling pain from an issue, but there‚Äôs an elite that lives in a reality where the problem doesn‚Äôt exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not the whole article, of course, but it&#8217;s already got some decent stuff to key off of. So how did this trainer do? Here&#8217;s the prompt it created:</p>\n\n<p class=\"command\">\na professional digital painting about cybersecurity, jobs gap, two-worlds problem, pain, elite, reality, gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation\n</p>\n\n<p>Seriously?!?! That&#8217;s stunning. So not only did it keep my DALL-E 2 prompt stuff in there, but <strong>it also added the summary nested in the middle</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>So it extracted these terms from the text: <strong>cybersecurity, jobs gap, two-worlds problem, pain, elite, reality</strong>, and then it seamlessly blended them into the specific art styling I&#8217;ve told it I want for my site.</p>\n\n<p class=\"note\">You can tell which is which by the icons.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m pretty excited at this point, but now for the big question. How do the images look based on this prompt? Here are some of the outputs of running this prompt on DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138324\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138324\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/prompt-outputs-miessler.png\" alt=\"prompt-outputs-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"646\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138324\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138324\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Output from three different AI-engines using the GPT-3-created Prompts</p></div>\n\n<p>Are you f-ing kidding me.

I&#8217;ve not even begun, because I can comb through all the different art styles that these engines can make, and I can add <strong>a particular style I like</strong> to the prompt training. Actually I have multiple ideas there:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hardcode the art style you want for your blog</li>\n<li>Hardcode a color scheme</li>\n<li>In your custom prompt creator tool, factor in the content for the art style!</li>\n<li>Add a custom art call to the tool, so you can ask for different art styles based on mood</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Creating a simple utility, <code>bac</code></h2>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit over-stimulated right now, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far to make this kind of slick and usable. I&#8217;ve created a simple utility called Blog Art Creator (<code>bac</code>), which sounds fancy but is nothing but a silly shell script.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I have the training scenarios in a single file, <code>training.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>I save my new content to another file, <code>content.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>I have the final prompt in another file, <code>prompt.txt</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The utility just concatanates text, so it combines the training data, your content, and the prompt, and sends all of that to GPT-3. I use <a href=\"https://github.com/CrazyPython/gpt3-cli\">this cli tool</a> within my script:</p>\n\n<p class=\"command\">\ngpt3 &#8211;engine text-davinci-001 &#8211;temperature 0.75 &#8211;freq-penalty 1 &#8211;pres-penalty 1\n</p>\n\n<p>Which leaves us with this for the, um, &#8220;code&#8221;.</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138345\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138345\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/dac-script-650x331.png\" alt=\"dac-script\" width=\"650\" height=\"331\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-138345\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A dirty, no-good hack</p></div>\n\n<p>So then I just run <code>bac</code>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"command\">\nbac\n</p>\n\n<p>Now, as you know, you can create some pretty lame looking stuff if you don&#8217;t do your prompts right. So let&#8217;s test this with a brand new prompt from a much earlier, random blog post.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People are hyped about the metaverse, and it‚Äôs honestly understandable. First, we‚Äôre going through some shit as a species right now. Social tension, the best part of Star Wars‚Äô last three movies were the previews, and there‚Äôs a global pandemic. Part of this metaverse hype is just being excited to be excited, and I get it.Metaverse lore has lots of fun stuff in it‚Äîfrom AR/VR to headsets to avatars to moving between worlds. But I think we can reduce the metaverse to one concept and two axes.The metaverse is about experiencing a better life than in meatspace.Most important to this is content.Second most important to this is interface.ContentContent is life. It‚Äôs the source of meaning. It‚Äôs what gives provides us with evolution‚Äôs nectar of happiness in the form of hormone releases when we struggle and achieve something.<br /><br /><cite><a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/gaming-is-metaverse-1-0/\">Gaming is Metaverse 1.0</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which produced this prompt:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>\n\n<p class=\"command\">\na professional digital painting about the metaverse, hype, understandable, exciting, better life, content, interface, gorgeous digital painting, warm colors, captivating, trending in artstation\n</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138327\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138327\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/bac-output-miessler-650x263.png\" alt=\"bac-output-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"263\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-138327\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138327\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Running the bac command and getting output</p></div>\n\n<p>And created these images from DALL-E in the <strong>first two runs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/autosummarization-test-1-650x159.png\" alt=\"autosummarization-test-1\" width=\"650\" height=\"159\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138332\" /></p>\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/autosummarization-test-2-650x158.png\" alt=\"autosummarization-test-2\" width=\"650\" height=\"158\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138333\" /></p>\n\n<p>In. Sane.</p>\n\n<p>I will absolutely be using this for my own stuff going forward.</p>\n\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ll work on in immediately is breaking apart the art styling from the content summarization and tagging. Basically I want to be able to change the art in a separate file and have that get added into all the training shot strings separately from the labeling as part of the <code>bac</code> utility. Same with the labeling.</p>\n\n<p>So actually:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Break apart the art styling so I can change it without editing <code>training.txt</code></li>\n<li>Create a parser for going to get content from my site, either randomly or by search term, and implement that as command switches to <code>bac</code></li>\n<li>Add the automatic art switching based on terms found in the content, e.g., create &#8220;dramatic&#8221; and &#8220;serious&#8221; art if the content summary contains &#8220;depression&#8221;, &#8220;war&#8221;, &#8220;future&#8221;, etc, with a more moody color scheme as well. Implement those as switches too.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>End of POC</h2>\n\n<p>Well I&#8217;m stoked. I can&#8217;t wait to work on this more tonight, and I really hope you enjoy messing with the ideas and finding tons of ways to improve it. And <a href=\"https://ctt.ac/7t3d7\">share it out</a> or <a href=\"mailto:daniel@danielmiessler.com\">hit me up</a> if you want to hack on upgrades/variations.</p>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"note\">\n<li>Next steps for me would also include automating the submission to the image generation services, but that&#8217;s a bit kludgy right now. I&#8217;ll add that to the automation once it&#8217;s available and/or easier to submit to and get results from.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>"
