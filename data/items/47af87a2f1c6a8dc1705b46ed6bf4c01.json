  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat heads to the Indianapolis Colts’ Complex for a couple of incredible interviews before this weekend’s game against the Chiefs. First, newly minted All-Pro offensive lineman, the 6th overall pick, and one of the most dominant players in football right now, Quenton Nelson joins the show for an exclusive interview. Next, 4X Pro Bowler, one of the best WR’s in the NFL, friend of the show, T.Y. Hilton, joins Pat to talk about the entire clown mask situation with Jonathan Joseph and how he thinks the team performed against the Texans. They also look ahead to the Chiefs game, and chat a little about his relationship with Frank Reich and Andrew Luck, and shoot some craps (12:04-25:59). The guys also cover everything around the NFL as they look ahead to this weekend’s playoff games, recap the National Championship game, and welcome in AQ Shipley to chat about Bruce Arians heading to Tampa Bay and some thoughts on his new Head Coach, Kliff Kingsbury (53:19-1:04:57). Pat and the guys also get into a couple deep science issues including the discovery of the plague in Wyoming, Todd has a theory for why the water levels are rising, and they dive back into the oceans vs. space argument. They also chat a little bit about Mason Ramsey, discuss what’s going on in the weight loss competition and how miserable everyone feels, and end the show by having another huge giveaway. It’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
