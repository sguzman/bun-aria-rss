Dreams could be a way of <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24833073-600-how-the-strangeness-of-our-dreams-reveals-their-true-purpose/'>freeing our brains from the limits of normal life</a>. Also on the pod, the team discusses the discovery of the source of a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2258758-weird-space-radio-signal-tracked-to-its-source-for-the-first-time/'>fast radio burst</a>, sent out by a neutron star in our galaxy.

Also on the agenda: the news that <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2258515-octopuses-taste-their-food-when-they-touch-it-with-their-arms/'>octopuses taste with their arms</a>, and an <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2258764-squid-like-creature-that-looked-like-a-giant-paperclip-lived-200-years/'>ancient squid shaped like a giant paperclip</a>. We also have a debrief of what it means now the US has officially withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement. All this, plus dreamy new music from Oneohtrix Point Never, and a song from space to mark the 20th anniversary of the continuous occupancy of the International Space Station.
