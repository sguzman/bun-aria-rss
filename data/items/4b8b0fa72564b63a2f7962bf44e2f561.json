  "description": "To start the show, I share some personal stories about the inflation I’ve witnessed. I break down why the Fed is forcing us into a recession… why we (likely) haven’t hit bottom yet… and what you should be paying attention in this deleveraging process. The current bear market is tough to stomach… but the lower the stock market goes, the more attractive stocks become. I share why I’m getting more aggressive with my buying… and one particular country I’m investing in (hint: it’s in Asia and has a booming energy sector). I also share my checklist to find the best sectors and stocks. And I’m crazy bullish about one particular class of stocks… In this episode:  Inflation is crushing small businesses [2:00] Is there more downside in this market? [5:00]  The truth about recessions [9:15]  Why I’m buying more aggressively [16:45] The one country where I’m looking to invest [20:00] My favorite sectors right now [26:45] I’m crazy bullish on one class of stocks [29:30]  Enjoyed this episode?
