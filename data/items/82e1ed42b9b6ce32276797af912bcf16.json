  "description": "It's been about time. I am happy to announce that \"Python Machine Learning\" was finally released today! Sure, I could just send an email around to all the people who were interested in this book. On the other hand, I could put down those 140 characters on Twitter (minus what it takes to insert a hyperlink) and be done with it. Even so, writing \"Python Machine Learning\" really was quite a journey for a few months, and I would like to sit down in my favorite coffeehouse once more to say a few words about this experience.",
