  "title": "Ep 143 |  How Social Media Could Cause America's COLLAPSE | Jonathan Haidt | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "If Winston Churchill were alive today, would he get canceled? Jonathan Haidt can tell you, but his answer is not exactly comforting. Haidt is a social psychologist and professor at NYU who has devoted his career to the study of morality. But while he’s always been an optimist, he’s noticed some concerning changes since the rise of social media. Now, he argues, social media is not just out of control, it could cause the collapse of America. It’s the subject of Haidt’s recent article for the Atlantic, “After Babel: Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid.” On this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Glenn and Haidt discuss whether America just experienced a second Tower of Babel, why social media has fueled our political divide and devastated Gen Z, and what we must do to reverse course: “We need a Geneva Convention for the culture wars.”\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nBuilt Bars are made with real chocolate, high in protein and low in calories and carbs, and taste exactly like a candy bar.
