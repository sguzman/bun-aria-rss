  "description": "Understanding the varieties of conversational styles can mean the difference between feeling you're understood and being insulted. \"High involvement\" speakers interrupt or talk along with someone else to signal their enthusiasm, while \"high considerateness\" speakers tend more toward thoughtful pauses and polite turn-taking. Adjusting your speaking style accordingly may improve not only your communication, but also your relationships. Plus, when you read a text message from someone, does it seem weird if they use ellipses? And: a delightful new documentary about the World Palindrome Championships will leave you with just one palindromic thought: Wow! Also, boo-boo and boo-hoo, prune and plum, grass widow and widows weeds, a rig and a half, barefoot tea, funny names for birds, and a puzzle for movie lovers.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
