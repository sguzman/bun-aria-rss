  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, President Trump sounds like a man fully in charge by firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, not deranged or someone who should be removed under the 25th Amendment like the media says. Tillerson was fired not because of confusion within the Trump administration, but because Tillerson was undermining Trump’s position on the Iran deal. Trump firing Tillerson shows he is prepared to take action and do what he has to in order to advance his principles and implement his policies. Also, Trump’s nomination of Gina Haspel as CIA director should be celebrated, but instead she will be criticized endlessly by leftists dressed up as journalists doing anything to prevent her confirmation. Haspel is an American patriot who did her job wonderfully, and if her nomination is blocked, Trump should recess appoint her to head the CIA. If Obama appointed the first woman to be CIA director, the media would be going bonkers and Haspel would be politically bulletproof; instead it’s the opposite because she’s Trump’s nominee. Later, the Barack Obama campaign hired Fusion GPS to investigate Mitt Romney during the 2012 election just as Hillary Clinton did to Trump in the 2016 election. Obama hid payments to Fusion GPS through the same law firm that Hillary used and reported the money paid as legal services. When it comes to collusion, all roads lead to Obama. Finally, Mark speaks with Andrew Pollack, father of one of the victims of the Parkland school shooting.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
