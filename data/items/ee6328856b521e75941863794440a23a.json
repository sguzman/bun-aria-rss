  "description": "<p>\"IT’S A SWEET DEFIANCE TO FOLLOW YOUR PURPOSE.”<br />\nMusic is something that’s always been in my life. I love it. I used to sing in school, and I’m fascinated with people who pushed through the toughest times of the art to make their dreams become a reality.<br />\nI had the pleasure of interviewing Andy Grammer on a past episode and there’s a lot he’s said that has stuck with me.<br />\nWhen the universe seems like it’s telling you to stop and give up, that’s when you have to push even harder and let it know your serious. That’s exactly what Andy Grammer did.<br />\nHis dedication brought him from busking on the streets of Santa Monica to being a multi-platinum artist.<br />\nI hope you’re as inspired by his story as I was, on Episode 573.</p>\n",
