    "media:description": "In this video, you will learn how to express love and gratitude in Spanish for the people and things in your life. You will also learn about Valentine's Day and how it differs around the world.\n\nSpanish CI (Comprehensible Input) is a teaching methodology of speaking only in the language that you are learning so that you get the necessary input and the exposure. This is the necessary step to be able to start speaking the language yourself! Throughout the video, you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish through repetition.\n\nIf you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, subscribe to my channel for more TPRS and Comprehensible Input videos to come by clicking on this link.
