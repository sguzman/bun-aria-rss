  "description": "<p><p>Danny DeVito (1:44:18) is a bucket-list interview for KFC Radio. The legend discusses getting his start on Taxi, where 45% of people with TVs at the time were watching that show, how many more seasons of Always Sunny he is willing to do, the special effects on the set of Matilda, and his latest role alongside Michael Keaton in Disney's Dumbo. Also, Chris Distefano (59:54) is on the show talking about co-parenting with a Puerto Rican girlfriend, how to get rid of chlamydia, how CBD oil can save the Catholic church, and why you should never trust a British accent. Also Shane Dawson might have had sex with a cat. Voicemails include: pretending to be gay, girlfriend shits in public, cut your hair or cook your food, and is a bagel a donut? </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
