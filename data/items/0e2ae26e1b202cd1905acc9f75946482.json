  "description": "<p><br></p><p>June 13, 1996. Idaho Falls, Idaho. When 18-year-old Angie Dodge failed to show up to work, two of her coworkers went to her apartment looking for her. There they found Angie lying dead on her bedroom floor. She had been raped and murdered. In January 1997, police had a confession from 20-year-old Christopher Tapps. However, the DNA at the scene didn’t match Chris or the other two men he said were present at Angie’s death. Then Chris recanted his confession, claiming it was coerced. Who else was involved? And was Chris involved at all if there was no evidence of him at the crime scene?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
