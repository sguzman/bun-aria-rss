  "description": "Dr. Death. June 24, 1998. Hyde, Greater Manchester, England. A woman in her early 80's unexpectedly dies and after her daughter discovers a new will had been signed shortly before, an investigation is launched. The last person to see Kathleen Grundy alive was her doctor. Dr. Harold Frederick Shipman was a well-respected doctor with thousands of loyal and trusting patients. Despite this, police discover something very unsettling; many of Dr. Shipman's patients had died while under his care. After an autopsy is performed on Ms. Grundy and other former patients have been exhumed and examined, a disturbing pattern emerged. Dr. Shipman had been injecting them with overdoses of morphine to kill them and then had altered their medical records to avoid suspicion. Throughout history there have been many serial killers, but few can rival this murderer's body count. Just how did he manage to get away with this for so long and what did the British government do about it?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
