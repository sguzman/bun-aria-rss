  "description": "<p>When the children sit around years from now and reflect back on their favorite episode of Las Culturistas, you will hear all sorts of \"expected\" responses: Rachel Bloom's \"Wedding\"! Pat Regan's \"Nicolette\"! Josh and Aaron's six hour long Drag Race episode! And sure, all the sheep will nod along. But there will be some, let us call them \"the cool kids,\" who will pick their heads up knowingly and crow, \"Joel Kim Booster's SECOND episode is the purest distillation of the Las Culturistas form!\" That's right y'all: it's a CULT CLASSIC. Why? Well - Bowen, right back from Australia, is so jet lagged that he can barely keep it together (and yes, at one point Bo does claim to have a list of \"divas\" he loves, lists one \"diva,\" and then groggily exclaims \"Divas. Divas. I love Divas.\") Matt tries to AGAIN relitigate a niche NYC show - which leads to Joel pointing out the magic of Las Culturistas: \"the thing that I love about this podcast is that it is so alienating to viewers.\" And what about Joel himself? Well before you check out his new album MODEL MINORITY (coming very very soon!), check him on this ep talking about Sex in Seattle, Young Sheldon, Mandy Moore, Carrie Coon, Demi Lovato, musical theater auditions, and so much more. </p><p>Did you buy your tickets to CULTCH WAR yet??
