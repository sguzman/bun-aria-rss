  "title": "South Africa's anti-foreigner violence",
  "description": "South Africa is one of the richest countries in Africa. Its businesses and investments have been a catalyst for growth on the continent and according to the World Bank, African immigrants have made a positive impact on South Africa’s economy. Yet foreign workers come under regular attack in South Africa. In the most recent spate of violence, hundreds of foreign owned businesses were damaged by protestors who said foreigners were taking their jobs. Several people died. The South African government condemned the attacks; but fell short of calling them xenophobic. Others on the continent aren't so sure. From Ethiopia to Zambia to Nigeria the reaction has been fierce. Artists have cancelled events, radio stations have boycotted South African music and hundreds of Nigerians were repatriated to Lagos. Julian Worricker and a panel of expert guests discuss the latest signs of anti-foreigner intolerance in South Africa. Why are immigrants being targeted in the Rainbow Nation and what impact will the negative reaction have on the country?",
