  "description": "<p><em><strong>Culture Warring</strong></em>. Today, Mike and Tim discuss the idea of ‘Culture Wars’ in light of the leaked Roe V Wade decision. What’s the goal of a culture war? What does it mean to “win?” Does undoing a law such as this help to save lives? Or is it about the message? What does it mean to actually be ‘Pro Life?’ Is there Biblical permission for culture warring? It seems like Nobody wins a culture war. Either you lay down your weapons and seek peace together as neighbors, or you destroy the culture. The New Testament vision of the church is of these small and vulnerable communities, that venture out into the world to serve and that open up their communities and households to others (especially the marginalized) for encounters of mutual blessing.</p>\n<p>At the end of the episode, Mike and Tim try something new in <strong>'Prayers of the People,'</strong> which is hopefully an active way of engaging in prayer and worship on behalf of brothers and sisters all over the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We realize the sensitivity of these topics and our intention is to walk in humility as we discuss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.skyejethani.com/\"><strong>Skye Jethani</strong></a>’s video on Abortion: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWD7ykNjCc\"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWD7ykNjCc</strong></a></p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
