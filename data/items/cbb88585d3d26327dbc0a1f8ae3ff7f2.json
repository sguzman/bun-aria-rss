  "description": "In today's podcast we hear warnings that electrical utilities should regard hacks of Ukraine's power grid as a wake-up call (the squirrel threat notwithstanding). Various nations work to shore up their defenses against Russian government hacking and influence operations. Russia protests its innocence, but there are some reliable reports of Fancy Bear sightings in Norway. Cyber criminals are back, except for those behind Locky ransomware, who seem to still be on holiday break. New approaches to ransomware and phishing. Dale Drew from Level 3 Communications tell us about the BGP Flowspec. And a loyalty program at the Golden Arches may be proving problematic.",
