  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat breaks down his weekend in Philadelphia for the WWE Watch Along as he is recovering from almost having his back broken in two by a kendo stick strike from WWE legend Matt Hardy. He and the boys also recap the Djokovic vs. Federer Wimbledon final and how tennis is easily forgettable as an incredibly entertaining sport. They also do a deep dive into some more conspiracy theory talk as Pat and the guys talk about people preparing to storm Area 51 and how they think they will fare, and the Bob Lazar documentary about aliens and UFO’s as well as the Joe Rogan interview that Lazar did, and how Pat is still all the way in on other lifeforms being out there. He also explains how he’s so in on the alien movement, that he no longer subscribes to Bigfoot being real and relives his story about going Bigfoot hunting. Pat also looks ahead a little bit as he prepares for a loaded schedule in the fall and what that may entail for him. To close out the show, we reair the Joey Chestnut interview after Kobayashi recently stated in the news that he’s personally seen Chestnut cheat. The interview covers their rivalry, and gives a look behind the curtain at America’s greatest eater (1:57:12-2:29:14). It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
