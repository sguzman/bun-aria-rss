  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>Whether you’re working as a full-time creative or balancing your entrepreneurial goals with your 9-5, the creator economy seemingly never stops. The consistent pressure to create and publish something new can tax our mental health, lead to exhaustion, and ultimately result in creator burnout. Joining us this week to chat about managing it all is the host of the For Colored Nerds podcast, Brittany Luse. Brittany and I explored how to identify burnout as a creator, setting boundaries online, and how therapy has assisted her mental health journey as a full-time creative. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Brittany</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://pod.link/957205646\">For Colored Nerds Podcast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bmluse/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bmluse?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
