  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show. America needs a heart to heart in our politics and in our media, the majority of Americans don't tolerate any anti-Semitism. But we have Representatives in Congress that are dripping with it. Speaker Nancy Pelosi refuses to censure or reprimand Rep.'s Ilhan Omar, Rashid Tlaib, Keith Ellison, Louis Farrakhan, and Rev. Al Sharpton whom all influence the Democratic Party. Over the weekend a neo-nazi killed a woman that shielded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein from getting shot; her husband a doctor performed CPR on her until he realized it was his own wife he was trying to save and fainted when he realized it. The Nazi killer posted on 8-chan that he supported conspiracy theories suggesting that president Trump was \"...just a dupe of the Jews.\" Then, the New York Times has a long history of self-loathing anti-Semitism. According to \"Unfreedom Of The Press\", the NY Times was complicit in minimizing the targeted atrocities against the Jews. In much the same way they lied to the American people about Stalin as he was wiping out the Ukrainian people. The media is still manipulating the truth, now they're wrongly blaming President Trump for these anti-Semitic atrocities. However, Trump has been the strongest ally and friend to Israel of any U.S. President.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
