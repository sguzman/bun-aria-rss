Glinton and Pesca discuss GM's recent proclamation to go electric by 2025. Glinton says that it's not that car makers aren't making profits off of going electric, it's that General Motors' commitment is a sign that the state of things are grave. He projects that automotive companies will be entering into partnerships in an effort to solve environmental problems, and that the new Biden administration in conjunction with the depart of transportation will lead efforts to push the U.S. out of the recession. Glinton is a well-known host in the public radio and podcast realm, and is a former NPR business reporter covering the auto industry and economics.\nIn the spiel, trying to predict the history books. \nEmail us at thegist@slate.com\nPodcast production by Margaret Kelley and Cheyna Roth.\nSlate Plus members get bonus segments and ad-free podcast feeds.
