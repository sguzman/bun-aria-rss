Proverbs 18:4 says, “A person’s words can be life-giving water.” Proverbs 15:4 says, “A gentle tongue brings healing.” When we think of healing, many times we think of praying for people for healing. While that is one way, Joel wants to help you see how your words have healing power and why it’s important to speak the blessing over your family and children. Learn how you can change the atmosphere in your home and help break the chains that are holding your loved ones back.When you’re kind, encouraging and free with your compliments, when you don’t just think something good but your take time to verbalize it in the lives of those around you, not only are you being a healer, but you help others become everything God has created them to be. As you help others rise higher, God is going to cause you to rise higher!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
