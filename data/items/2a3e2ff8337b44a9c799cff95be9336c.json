  "description": "<p>November 08, 2010. Markham, Ontario. A woman calls 9-1-1 to report that intruders have been in her home, that she heard \"shots like pop\" and that her dad has run screaming from the house. Apparently, Jennifer had been tied to a railing. In the end, Jennifer Pan's mother was dead and her father was in a coma at the hospital. Detectives worked to piece together what happened and early on had located footage of several men approaching, entering, and leaving the Pan residence. While the evidence seemed to indicate that a home invasion had occured just as Jennifer had stated, some things didn't add up. What did happen that night at the Pan house? The answers would be verified by an unlikely source.</p><p><br></p><p>Sponsors:</p><p>Ziprecruiter: Try Ziprecruiter for free at ziprecruiter.com/genwhy and find out why 4 of 5 employers find qualified candidates the first day. </p><p>SimpliSafe: Visit simplisafe.com/genwhy to get free shipping and a 60-day risk free trial when you purchase a new home security system.
