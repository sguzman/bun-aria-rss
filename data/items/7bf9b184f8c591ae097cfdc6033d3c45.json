To take advantage of that update, though, PS5 owners need to go through a few steps to find and manually download the PS5-specific files, as outlined in <a href=\"https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054874091-PlayStation-5-Enhanced-Patch\">a Bungie support page</a> and <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/upgrade-ps4-game-to-ps5-version/\">a PlayStation Support page</a>.</p>\n<p>Without that download, the PS5 simply plays the PS4 version of the game in the system's backward-compatibility mode. <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-destiny-2-ps5-xbox-series-a-huge-performance-boost\">Digital Foundry's write-up</a> goes into detail on the \"true 4K resolution\" and 60 to 120 fps gameplay offered by the upgraded PS5 version of the game.
