  "description": "<div>On Oct. 24, 2011, 12-year-old Garrett Phillips was murdered in his home in Potsdam, a small town in upstate New York. Police quickly zeroed in on a suspect in this unthinkable crime: Oral “Nick” Hillary, a black man in the mostly white community, who was a soccer coach at Clarkson University and the ex-boyfriend of Garrett’s mother, Tandy Cyrus. Hillary insists that he is innocent. There is no evidence of his guilt and he has an alibi. And so begins a 5-year battle for the truth. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 100 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more!
