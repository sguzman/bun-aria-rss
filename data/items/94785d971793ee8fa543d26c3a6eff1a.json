  "description": "<p>Gabrielle Zevin’s new novel, “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,” is set in the world of video game design, and follows two friends named Sadie and Sam as they collaborate on what becomes a very successful game.</p><p>“A friend of mine described the book as being what it’s like to co-parent something that’s not a child,” Zevin says on this week’s podcast. “Sam and Sadie, they are more intimate with each other than anyone else in their lives. Yet they aren’t spouses, and he’s not her child, and yet this is the most important relationship that both of them have. So I wanted to write about that: What if the most important person in your life was really your colleague and your friend?”</p><p>Morgan Talty visits the podcast to discuss his debut story collection, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/books/review/night-of-the-living-rez-morgan-talty.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Night of the Living Rez,”</a> which is set on the Penobscot Indian Nation reservation in Maine, where Talty was raised.</p><p>“I was very much aware that Indigenous fiction tries to perform for a white readership, or a largely white readership, and there are instances in books that I’ve admired by Native writers that I could see this. And I always wanted to shy away from it, because I didn’t want to keep feeding into that type of storytelling,” Talty says. “Throughout the book there’s less association with Indigeneity in the characters, so it’s the characters who are front and center, it’s their human nature that’s front and center, as opposed to maybe something cultural.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Elizabeth Harris talks about how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/books/tiktok-books-booktok.html\" target=\"_blank\">#BookTok has become a dominant driver of fiction sales</a>; and Dwight Garner and Alexandra Jacobs talk about what people are reading.
