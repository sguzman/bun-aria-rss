  "description": "Flytrex offers real world drone delivery service, today. Fully autonomous, regulatory approved and insured. Starting at 0.8c per mile. Walmart also began drone delivery with select grocery and household essential items from Walmart stores using Flytrex’s automated drones. The drones are controlled over the cloud using a smart and easy control dashboard. Using our wire release mechanism, orders are gently lowered from eighty feet. Flying at 32 mph without traffic or other impediments, they reach your backyard in a fraction of conventional food delivery time. Flytrex can carry up to 6.6 pounds (6-8 hamburgers) for a distance of 3.5 miles and back. We cruise at 32 miles per hour and fly at an altitude of 230 feet. <br /><br />Guest: Yariv Bash , CEO Flytrex<br />Flyrex website ➜ <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/Flytrexdrone​<br /><br />#Flytrex​ #Drones​ #Delivery​<br />~Flytrex CEO interview | 5min Food Delivery Drone~<br />⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺<br /><br />Get the latest restaurant and hospitality insider tips and education on saving your restaurant business in our FREE Virtual Event Platform 🎓 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableVirtual​<br /><br />Subscribe on YouTube ✅ <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/PBNYoutubeSubscribe​<br />Facebook 📱 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableFacebook​<br />Twitter 📱 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableTwitter​<br /><br />───────────────────────────<br />Want to start your own virtual event or education series?
