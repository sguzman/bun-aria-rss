  "description": "Mile high club? Sofia has entered the NO FLY CLUB\nSeriously. Sofia is back (we’re just as surprised as you are) but this time with more baggage to add to her already concerning past! Not only has she been denied global entry TWICE, she is now on the no fly list! The appeal is still pending, prayers are welcomed. Sofia tells an exhilarating story about a Karen that she encountered on her flight to NYC and how an emergency landing was almost needed. As if that wasn’t enough, once Sofia finally (barely) made it to NYC, she encounters an old “friend” who she airs out on this episode! Fun! Finally, Sofia is joined by the REAL Professor Sloot, Robert Greene, for a continuation of their conversation about the Art of Seduction. A lot has gone on this week, just try to keep up Sloots. Big things are coming ;) \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nEpisode promo codes:\nZola: http://Zola.com/SOFIA\nHello Fresh: http://hellofresh.com/14SOFIA\nOuai: http://theouai.com promo code SOFIA\nNoom: http://noom.com/SOFIA\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
