  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys touch on several different things including the news that Jason Witten decided to abruptly leave the Monday Night Football booth and go back to the Cowboys to play, so the guys do a deep dive into the likelihood and chance that Pat becomes the 3rd man in the booth for Monday Night Football, and discuss some of the other guys they wouldn’t mind seeing in the booth if Pat doesn’t get the opportunity. They also cover robots delivering FedEx packages, Bryce Harper signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies that doesn’t include an opt out clause, Jimmy Kimmel addressing Lady Gaga about her sexual tension/love/chemistry with Bradley Cooper, a new group of robbers in England who have been knocking off parking meters, whether or not Ray Liotta needs to quit the Chantix ahead of his role in the new Sopranos prequel, some of the other TV shows the guys are excited for to return, a Nesquik chocolate milk shortage that has been ravaging Indianapolis, a potential bill being passed in Utah that would allow drivers to run red lights after 10 seconds if no one else is around, and what sickness that keeps you home from work is the most desirable. As always, the guys throw together a couple of tunes for Friday Bangerz to help launch you into this weekend. It’s a fun one. Come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode includes @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas</p>\n",
