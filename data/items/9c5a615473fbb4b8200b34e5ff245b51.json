  "description": "You know you are going to find fun and whimsy when you learn a designer started her business on April fools day! Sue Marsh of Whistle Creek Pig Production is just that! As a fabric designer, author and creator of darling designs, she knows how to put a smile on your face when making her projects!\nWhistlepig Creek Productions\n------------------\nArtist and author Deborah Fisher’s book ‘Quilt Giving’ caught my eye. Quilters love to make for others and one of our greatest joys is giving a quilt. Debroah designed 19 quilts that let us make projects that are not super time consuming and are wonderful to look at. Many are a more modern flair and you can use your scraps, prints, and solids to create warm and cozy presents. She is also the founder of the Bright Hopes Collaborative Quilt Project and I’m excited to learn about why she created it.  \nFishmuseumandcircus.com\nBrighthopes.org\n----------------\nAnnette Plog is the Author of True Blue Quilts and loves reproducing antique quilts. She is part of a group of friends who call themselves the 19th Century Patchwork Divas group. I’m excited to talk reproduction quilts and the love and blue with Annette today!\nwww.petitequilts.com/\n---------------\nI love creative people who jump in and do something new and fresh with things that have been around awhile. Add to that mix enthusiasm, endless energy, and a huge smile and you have Mathew Boudreaux, better known as Mr. Domestic. Since I’ve known Mathew I think I look at things a little differently. He has always been creative and we are lucky he now is hooked on quilting. I’m going to find out a bit about fabric weaving and English Paper Piecing today.. see.. lots of ideas!\nwww.instagram.com/misterdomestic \n--------\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
