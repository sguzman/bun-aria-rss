  "description": "<p>After holding out for awhile, the news dictated that Spittin' Chiclets finally goes full Masshole for Episode 17. The boys open by discussing the Greatest Comeback in Super Bowl History and the Patriots unprecedented dominance. They also talk about a gambling first for the big game and how they did. Next, the guys talk about the Claude Julien firing, his impact in Boston, and what's next for the Bruins. After #AllRightHamilton questions, the fellas chat about the rest of the league and also go over how Barstool pretty much owned Houston during the week of the Super Bowl. No guest this week but still a fun episode.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
