  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leaked internal videos show that my children’s book, Johnny the Walrus, has traumatized and triggered Amazon’s employees. They are literally in tears over it. It is the greatest moment of my career. We’ll talk about it today. Also, conservative accounts on Twitter see huge spikes in followers right as it’s announced that Elon Musk is buying the company. What’s going on there? And more disturbing information about the “children’s book” from the American Academy of Pediatrics that pushes chemical castration on nine year olds. Plus, a NASCAR driver is sent to sensitivity training for posting a “racist” meme. But was the meme actually racist? And in our Daily Cancellation, more leaked videos. This time it’s administrators and leftist activists meeting to game plan protests against my speech tonight at Wisconsin Superior. But why are school administrators helping to plan protests?\n\nJoin Ben’s Third Thursday Book Club now to get his notes for The Once and Future King by T.H.
