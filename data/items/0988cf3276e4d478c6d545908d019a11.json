  "description": "Bradley Cantrell and Adam Mekies' new book Codify: Parametric and Computational Design in Landscape Architecture(Routledge, 2018) Bradley Cantrell and Adam Mekies, \"Codify: Parametric and Computational Design in Landscape Architecture\" (Routledge, 2018) Landscape architecture has a long history of innovation in the areas of computation and media, particularly in how the discipline represents, analyses, and constructs complex systems. This curated volume spans academic and professional projects to form a snapshot of digital practices that aim to show how computation is a tool that goes beyond methods of representation and media. The book is organized into four sections; syntax, perception, employ, and prospective. The essays are written by leading academics and professionals and the sections examine the role of computational tools in landscape architecture through case studies, historical accounts, theoretical arguments, and nascent propositions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
