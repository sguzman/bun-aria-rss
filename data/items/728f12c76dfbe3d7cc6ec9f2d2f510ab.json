  "description": "<p>Calling all cool teens! Stop snagging and necking and tune into our horniest episode ever! In episode 110 Em covers the Goatman(person?) of Maryland. It’s unclear whether he’s a genetic experiment gone wrong, a hairy old introvert, or simply an urban legend. What we do know, however, is that he’s 100% axe. But that’s not all! Em gives us a bonus story this week - the Pope Lick Monster! Or as we like to call him, the Pretty Little Monster. <br />\n<br /><br />\n<br />Meanwhile, Christine covers the story of Ira Einhorn, who considers himself Philadelphia’s very own planetary enzyme. However, we know him as a hypocritical, predatory murderer who did NOT invent Earth Day and also smells like a hoagie with onions. Moral of the story: contrary to popular belief, the world could use a little <em>less</em> hugging.
