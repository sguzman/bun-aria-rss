  "description": "<p>Hello Mommies, her name is Battarina but don't you dare call her that! Christina starts this ep with showing us what TikTok's algorithm thinks she likes. And these are some of the COOLEST group of people you have ever seen! There's also a new show on TLC called \"Too Fat to Transition\" that Tom and Christina absolutely LOVE. The Charo Fart has touched so many lives and there is new merch to commemorate it available in the merch store! Tom and Christina give Charo a call to see how she feels about this great moment being commemorated. The impact of Charo's fart has been felt around the word and we want her to see it! Also, Tom and Christina have upped their coffee station game and remind everyone which coffee is supreme, plus one elderly woman goes for an extreme helicopter ride.</p> <p>Next, Josh Potter joins to discuss his pending trip to the Big Apple to see Robert Paul Champagne. Plus we get to see some entries in the \"Make Josh Come\" contest. You wouldn't believe how genuinely great these submissions are. We're all really excited for him.</p> <p>Finally, we have a Theo update you might not like.</p>\n",
