  "description": "<p>As we move into these final weeks of August, we'll be airing two extraordinary \"Best Of\" episodes, featuring powerful conversations from the last year.</p><p>First up, Elizabeth Gilbert. Gilbert exploded into the public's consciousness in 2006 with the release of her mega-bestselling memoir,<em> Eat Pray Love.</em></p><p>Since then, she's published a series of books, given a TED talk on creative genius that's been viewed more than 10 million times, become&nbsp;a leading voice on the pursuit of a creative, connected and vital life.</p><p>GIlbert's latest book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594634718?tag=pgus-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Big Magic</em></a>, takes you deeper into what it means to live a creative life, offering a wonderful blend of wisdom, unabashed magical thinking, amazing stories and a whole lot of unexpected myth-busting and contrarian insights.</p><p>I had a chance to sit down with Liz and, as often happens with these Good Life conversations, we ended up going all sorts of places I'd never planned. We touched on the power of curiosity and the fallacy of passion, where creativity comes from, what stops us from doing the thing we're here to do, the importance of caring for your vessel, what happens when you think you've reached the end of your capacity and her powerful lens on what it means to life a good life.</p><p>This is deeply moving, revealing, insightful and sometimes pretty funny conversation. In fact, we begin with a hard-hitting reveal of a relationship that Gilbert had kept secret for more than four decades. And, along the way, this beautiful thought came tumbling forth:</p><p>\"When you come to the end of yourself is where all the interesting stuff starts.\" <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/eFB62\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Tweet this.</em></strong></a></p><p>If you've ever wondered how to step into a creative life, how to get that thing in your head and heart out into the world, this is an absolute \"do not miss\" conversation.</p><p>We first aired this conversation in September 2015.
