  "description": "<p>Many recent efforts center on assessing the ability of real-world evidence\n(RWE) generated from non-randomized, observational data to produce results\ncompatible with those from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One noticeable\nendeavor is the RCT DUPLICATE initiative (Franklin et al., 2020, 2021). To\nbetter reconcile findings from an observational study and an RCT, or two\nobservational studies based on different databases, it is desirable to\neliminate differences between study populations. We outline an efficient,\nnetwork-flow-based statistical matching algorithm that designs well-matched\npairs from observational data that resemble the covariate distributions of a\ntarget population, for instance, the target-RCT-eligible population in the RCT\nDUPLICATE initiative studies or a generic population of scientific interest. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the method by revisiting the inconsistency\nregarding a cardioprotective effect of the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in\nthe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial and corresponding\nobservational study. We found that the discrepancy between the trial and\nobservational study persisted in a design that adjusted for study populations'\ncardiovascular risk profile, but seemed to disappear in a study design that\nfurther adjusted for the HRT initiation age and previous\nestrogen-plus-progestin use. The proposed method is integrated into the R\npackage match2C.\n</p>",
