  "description": "<p><strong>A \"friend\" who once admitted to having a crush on you came over to continue a night of drinking and crash on the couch.</strong> You pushed him away when he tried to kiss you because the crush isn't mutual and you have a boyfriend. Then you woke up in the middle of the night to him spooning, touching, and trying to make out with you. You pushed him away again and went back to sleep. Is this a form of sexual assault, or did you cheat by allowing yourself to get drunk and winding up in this situation?
