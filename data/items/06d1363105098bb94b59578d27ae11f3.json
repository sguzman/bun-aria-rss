  "description": "In an obvious attempt to infuriate Puerto Rican statehood advocates, Donald Trump wants to buy Greenland. And if a few thousand Republicans would move up there (as they no doubt would to mine and drill the hell out of its every beautiful nook and cranny) then he would no doubt welcome it as a state. Come to think of it, if we can designate which Republicans move there, maybe everyone can get behind this idea. We discuss this surprising foreign policy gambit plus other slightly more serious ones--like China, Hong Kong and the collapse of the UK into teeny tiny pieces with Kori Schake of IISS and Ed Luce of the FT. Tune in.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
