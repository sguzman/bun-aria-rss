  "title": "Ian wreaks havoc on Sanibel Island and insurance crisis; SCOTUS hears wetlands case",
  "description": "Sanibel and Captiva Islands were hit with a barrage of tropical weather from Hurricane Ian. Maria Espinoza, the executive director of FISH, a nonprofit providing disaster assistance, joins us. Then, Florida's already-existing insurance crisis was worsened by the storm's damage. Florida State University associate professor Charles Nyce joins us to explain why state residents were paying some of the highest homeowners insurance rates in the country, even before the hurricane struck. And, the government's role in preserving the country's wetlands is at the center of a Supreme Court hearing on Monday. Dr. Bob Bond, who grew up going to Priest Lake — the site at the center of the case after a couple tried to fill in wetlands on their property to build a house — joins us.",
