OP's mom immediately starts criticizing her about what she wears around the house, and just starts hounding her every single day about completely meaningless things. She pushes OP to her breaking point, so OP snaps and kicks her mother out of her own home. Was OP justified, or should she have bit her tongue and continued to endure the harassment?
