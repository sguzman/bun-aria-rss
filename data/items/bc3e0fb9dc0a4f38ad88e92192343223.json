  "description": "We are talking about one of Sue’s favorite topics today: How to add charm to your home. Lighting often is something that everyone can improve even if you’ve been in your home for a while. Boob lights are a great way to fill your room with light, but aren’t the most charming piece of lighting. We love sconces and Sue suggests just taking the cover off the ugly lights as this can look better than what your house comes with. When placing furniture, don’t just push them up against the wall, but try to mix it up. Go grab yourself an architectural digest and study the space planning because this will really add charm to your space. A lot of your walls are made of drywall, and then you add a texture to it, but you don’t want to add a lot of texture. We’re big fans of wall paper, which can add a lot of charm to your spaces. If you’re in an older home and you don’t want to re-lay all the flooring, you can buy rad rugs, which can make a big difference and really pull the room together. <br /><br />Lighting 3:41<br />Kelvin levels 12:47<br />Space planning 14:09<br />Architectural accents 19:28<br />Walls 21:54<br />Hang art 30:22<br />Flooring 32:48<br />Layering 37:37<br /><br />“When we’re in these little spaces I think there’s a real safety to them, and that is going to be the definition of a charming space. Like really dial those in, you know? The window seats can be full of down feathers and can be a small pattern, and you can have jumbo wells, or it can be like a French mattress type of a construction. Even a French ticking is darling with mismatched pillows, and all of those things are going to give you that feeling of charm.” 16:16<br /> <br />@hallahall<br />zocdoc.com/dearalice<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
