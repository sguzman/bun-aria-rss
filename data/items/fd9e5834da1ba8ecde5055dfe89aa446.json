  "description": "<p>Friends, today we share a talk I recently gave to the service men and women at the United State Air Force Academy. After previously speaking at the <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBgmZdM0IKg\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">Naval Academy</a> about three sailors from the Bible, then at <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFsvWeam01o\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer noopener\">West Point</a> about three soldiers from the Old Testament, I wondered, what should I speak of to the Air Force Academy?</p> <p>What came to me was the angels, those famous fliers in the pages of the Bible. I told the Air Force men and women that they are flyers, too, and so they should consider the angelic realm, the realm of pure spirits, those who fly into the very presence of God, becoming radiant by contact with him. I encouraged them to join the angels in flight, trust their life to a higher power, and become a person of right praise.</p> <h2 id=\"h-links\"><strong>Links</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em><strong><a href=\"https://books.wordonfire.org/theholyhour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Holy Hour: Meditations for Eucharistic Adoration</a></strong> </em>edited by Matthew Becklo</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://books.wordonfire.org/withallhermind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>With All Her Mind: A Call to the Intellectual Life</em></a> </strong>edited by Rachel Bulman</li> </ul> <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" /> <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
