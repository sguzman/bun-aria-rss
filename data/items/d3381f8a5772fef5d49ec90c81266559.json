  "description": "<p>Friday 8/31 - Today on the show we had Mack Wilds stop by where he spoke about new movie 'Dinner For Two', Being heartbroken, single life and more. Also we had comedian Ms.Pat stop by where she spoke about her life story, selling crack, and even getting shot, but lets just say if you didn't know her before, you definitely will after! Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a Minnesota House candidate that used the N-word to describe himself in a campaign ad. Also we opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners thought about Eminem's album. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
