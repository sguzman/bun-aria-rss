  "description": "<p>Did Russian Scientists seal five prisoners in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation in the 1940s? Did these prisoners lose their minds, scream until they'd torn their vocal chords, start eating their own flesh, attack guards who tried to release them, and die soon after the gas was turned off? Or, is this just an urban legend? And if it is an urban legend, where and when did it start? And why do people believe it?
