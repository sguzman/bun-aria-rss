  "description": "<p>\"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They <i>weave</i> themselves into the <i>fabric </i>of everyday life until they're indistinguishable from it.\" That quote from computer scientist Mark Weiser is from a 1991 paper where he outlined the vision of ubiquitous computing; in it, he also referenced \"seamlessness\"... We just can't get away from textile metaphors: we catch airline \"shuttles\", we \"weave\" through traffic, we follow comment \"threads” -- the metaphors are as ubiquitous and abundant and threaded throughout our lives as the textiles (and computing) all around us.</p><p>In fact, argues author and columnist <a href=\"https://vpostrel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Postrel</a>, the story of textiles IS the story of technology and science (across all kinds of fields, from biology to chemistry); of commerce (as well as management, measurement, machines); but most of all, of <i>civilization</i> (vs. just culture) itself. That's what her <a href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/virginia-postrel/the-fabric-of-civilization/9781541617605/\" target=\"_blank\">new book</a>, <i>The Fabric of Civilization: How Textiles Made the World</i> is all about. But it's really a story and history of innovation, and of <i>human ingenuity</i>... which is also the theme of the a16z Podcast -- and of this special, inaugural book launch episode with the author in conversation with showrunner Sonal Chokshi.</p><p>The discussion both dives deep and lightly dips into a wide range of topics: fabrics, from the <strong>genetics</strong> of cotton to the <strong>supply chain</strong> of silk (including pre-Industrial Revolution <strong>factories</strong>, early payment and incentive alignment, \"maestre\" and notions of <strong>expertise</strong>); knowledge, from the storage and transmission of it to sharing tacit and explicit code (including <strong>manuals</strong>, <strong>notation</strong>, <strong>measures</strong>); and math as the science of patterns, origins of <strong>mathematics</strong> (including early education and getting paid for it). The touch on the NASA space program, <strong>knitting</strong> and AI, and the <strong>environmental impact</strong> of dyes. Throughout, they discuss the what and the why -- the warp and weft of this episode! -- of <strong>HOW innovation happens</strong>, from incremental improvements to sudden leaps, also taking a closer look at the <strong>demographics</strong> and images involved. And finally, they cover the evolution and meaning of <strong>kente cloth</strong> (as well as other patterns) in Ghana and beyond... Because the story of textiles -- and of technology -- is not just a story of one culture or time or place: it is a universally <i>human</i> story, woven from countless threads and wires.</p><h3>links & other articles mentioned in this episode:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/VirginiaPostrel1/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> & <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vpostrel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> from the author, featuring cited images among others</li><li><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-computer-for-the-21st-century/\" target=\"_blank\">The Computer for the 21st Century</a>, Mark Weiser, Scientific American, 1991</li><li><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17513470902896561?journalCode=tmaa20\" target=\"_blank\">Every topological surface can be knit: a proof</a>, Sarah-Marie Belcastro, Journal of Mathematics and the Arts, 2009</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-making-of-skyknit-an-ai-yarn/554894/\" target=\"_blank\">How an AI took over the an adult knitting community</a>, Alexis Madrigal, The Atlantic, 2018</li><li><a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/artists/maarten-van-heemskerck\" target=\"_blank\">Portrait of a Man, Portrait of a Woman</a>, Maarten van Heemskerck, Rijks Museum, 1529</li><li><a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2020/0825/We-re-storytellers-in-the-designs-In-Ghana-pandemic-inspires-new-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">In Ghana, pandemic inspires new fabrics</a>, Kent Mensah, Christian Science Monitor 2020</li><li><a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/10/14/welcome-to-the-new-world-civilization/\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome to the new world civilization</a>, Virginia Postrel, Reason, 2020</li></ul><p><i>images: composite of knitting by </i><a href=\"http://www.toroidalsnark.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>© sarah-marie belcastro</i></a><i> (courtesy Virginia Postrel) + magnetic core memory wires & beads, magnified 60x (photo from Virginia Postrel) -- combined by Sonal Chokshi for the a16z Podcast</i></p>\n",
