  "description": "Akamai was founded to give the brightest minds somewhere to grow ? and by surrounding ourselves with supportive individuals and an open culture, we can all bring our best, every day. It?s for this reason that our commitment to inclusion, diversity, and engagement is a key cornerstone of how we operate. Not as an objective or goal to be achieved, but as a journey of continuous learning and improvement that we can all benefit from, individually and collectively.",
