  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we discourage President Trump from working closely with radical libertarians Charles and David Koch's plan for amnesty. We must stem the flow of illegal immigration and strengthen border security, doing otherwise risks a potential loss of conservative supporters in his base. Republicans must stop running from the Democrats when they start pushing; waffling here could cost Trump his presidency. Mitch McConnell has exploded the debt and done nothing the entire time he's been in Congress to fix our illegal immigration problem. Government is not the answer. Conservatives must stop this! Using the National Emergencies Act, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and other laws is not a cause for alarm. No one balked at its use over the past 43 years; it’s not like Trump is declaring martial law or creating new laws—he's simply addressing a national emergency at the border. Also, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, blasts the idea of healthcare for all, as leftists Sen Kamala Harris and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have promoted, saying it’s a bad idea because it would destroy an entire industry and is obviously unaffordable. Perhaps Harris should visit Auschwitz to see what happens when unarmed citizens are attacked by the third Reich, instead of suggesting that Americans be disarmed. Finally, historian Victor Davis Hanson calls in to discuss the state of progressivism from the point of humanity in his new column \"The Progressive Race to the Bottom.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
