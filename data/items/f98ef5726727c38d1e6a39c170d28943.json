  "description": "The five-day workweek can feel as preordained as the number of minutes in an hour, but it hasn't always been the norm. Workers fought for a Monday-to-Friday schedule before it became standard in the U.S. in the 1930s. Since then, the nature of work has changed a lot, and now, workers are once again fighting for better conditions, says U.K.-based researcher Will Stronge.<br/><br/>In this episode, Stronge, who co-wrote the book <em>Overtime: Why We Need a Shorter Working Week</em>,<em> </em>discusses what has changed since the '30s and what a shorter workweek offers workers and organizations.",
