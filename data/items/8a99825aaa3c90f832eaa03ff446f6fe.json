  "description": "<p>Forty-nine years ago, the landmark <em>Roe v Wade</em> decision guaranteed women the right to a safe, legal abortion. This June, the Supreme Court is expected to gut that historic ruling, triggering restrictive abortion laws in at least 23 states. While the United States is on the precipice of stepping back this women&rsquo;s health right, the rest of the world has seen a trend of liberalizing abortion laws over the past 25 years. In this limited, narrative series from Next Question with Katie Couric, we explore the history &mdash; and future &mdash; of abortion in this country. In this 6-episode series, Katie takes listeners inside abortion clinics, front row at an abortion comedy show, and shares intimate, first-person experiences of people &mdash; from the illegal period to now &mdash; who have had abortions and the stories of those who have cared for them. There&rsquo;s never been a more urgent time to understand how we got here and how reproductive rights can apply to everyone.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
