    "media:description": "First \"Rapid-fire\" session.  I present you with 5 questions and ask you to make the conversions in 5 sec.  This is meant to be a bit of a challenge - it's doable if you're doing it in your head, it's harder if you're working on paper.\n\n\nAt the end of the 5 sec, I work through the answer step-by-step.  \n\n\nIf you're just starting out and feel like you need more time, then feel free to pause the video until you complete your answers.",
