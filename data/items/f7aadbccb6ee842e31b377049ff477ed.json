  "description": "My special guest tonight is Dr. Susana Stoica who's here to discuss energy healing and her life as a healer. Dr. Stoica has healed many people over the years including her mother as a young child. Get her book Healing with a Loving Heart: Discover the Power of Energy Healing on Amazon!\nHealing with a Loving Heart: Discover the Power of Energy Healing is filled with true stories of healing when all hope was lost. It addresses a wide range of diseases, shows why ALS does not have to be a terminal illness and gives insights into the autism spectrum, delayed brain trauma, the use of energy healing to help the body accept a newly transplanted organ, and how some illnesses respond well to alternative solutions when mainstream medicine has no effect. This encouraging book also discusses the process of healing, healer-doctor interactions, and how to stay healthy, as well as what you can do to help yourself if given a certain diagnosis. \n\nDavid Brownstein, MD, author of 16 books on alternative healing, has the following to say about this book: \"Susana has helped countless patients in my practice and many others. She has a gift that is special. Her book, Healing with a Loving Heart, is written with her heart. I find her description of what she feels [when doing her healing work] correlates with my conventional medical paradigm... This book is more than worth the read. It should be part of your library.”\nEnjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now from anywhere in the world.\n\n\nPre-order Kim's new book 'Say This, Not That: When Someone You Know Is Grieving on Amazon\nFollow Kim's Page on Facebook\n\n\nVisit her website\n\nCheck Out Mysterious Radio!
