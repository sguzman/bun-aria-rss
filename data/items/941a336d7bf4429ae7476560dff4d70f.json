  "description": "<p>We study a proper definition of R\\'enyi mutual information (RMI) in quantum\nfield theory as defined via the Petz R\\'enyi relative entropy. Unlike the\nstandard definition, the RMI we compute is a genuine measure of correlations\nbetween subsystems, as evidenced by its non-negativity and monotonicity under\nlocal operations. Furthermore, the RMI is UV finite and well-defined in the\ncontinuum limit. We develop a replica path integral approach for the RMI in\nquantum field theories and evaluate it explicitly in 1+1D conformal field\ntheory using twist fields. We prove that it bounds connected correlation\nfunctions and check our results against exact numerics in the massless free\nfermion theory.\n</p>",
