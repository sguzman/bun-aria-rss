  "description": "Our interviews today are both children's books and even though they are about wildly different topics, they both aim to make reading more accessible for kids. Nikole Hannah Jones, with the help of Renee Watson, has turned the <em>1619 Project</em> into a picture book called <em>Born On The Water</em>. They told NPR their goal was \"to say to young people - to young Black Americans, you belong here.\" Next, Adam Rubin has written a collection of short stories that are all different but have the same title: <em>The Ice Cream Machine</em>. Rubin told NPR's Rachel Martin that there are so many ways to tell a story.",
