  "description": "Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, CIO and president of Praetorian Capital, is a market legend. His extraordinary research has been featured on some of the most prominent investment sites and blogs. So when he shares what he calls “one of the best trades I’ve seen in my entire investing career… and there won’t be a better one in decades…” you want to listen. Plus, this is the most dangerous market I’ve seen in my 25-plus-year career. And right now, there are two negative trends that aren’t even close to factored into the market. [21:56] The coronavirus is a world-changing event… which begs the question, what will the New World Order look like a few years from now? Some sectors will thrive from the secular shifts we’ll see… while others will fall by the wayside. And you might be surprised at some of the dividend aristocrats and household names on my biggest losers list. [47:35] -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
