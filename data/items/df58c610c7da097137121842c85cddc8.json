  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s podcast is so inspiring and one that even challenges me! I’m interviewing Alexia from Hawthorn Farm who recently did a one-year challenge with her husband where they ate only foods they themselves had harvested, or friends and family had harvested and gifted them. They didn’t step foot in the grocery store, raised their own produce and meat, and you won’t believe what she had to say about her experience.
