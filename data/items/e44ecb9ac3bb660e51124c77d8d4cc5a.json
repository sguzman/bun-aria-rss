  "description": "On today's show, the guys chat about a Connecticut man covering himself in maple syrup and having sex on camera, two Utah roommates who had a bit of disagreement leading to a wild ultimatum, a 300 lb. woman stabbing her boyfriend with a table leg and then sitting on top of him and suffocating him to death, chat a little bit about PETA's recent obnoxious tweet, and Kellogg's factory workers in Memphis pissing in the cereal. Todd also wants to know who the guys would choose if they had to recast a Back To The Future reboot, the guys answer some listener questions including what they would want on their rider if they were to get famous enough to do a stadium show, and pick NFL quarterbacks for one another. As always, they close the show with a couple of new Friday Bangerz. It's a great time, come and join us.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, and @evanfoxy.\n",
