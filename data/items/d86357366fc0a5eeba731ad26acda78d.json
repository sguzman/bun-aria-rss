  "description": "<p>We bring you a special episode today that you weren't expecting as we apparently find a reason to allow Ben to talk more about himself and learn more about his unsuccessful bid to bring the 2020 Olympics to Hobart. Just how far did this bid get? Was he ever serious about? What was the endgame of the bid? Did he lead people on with it? Why did it stop? And does he believe that smaller cities such as Hobart could ever host the games? It's an episode that you probably will want to miss, but we think you shouldn't as it still is entertaining and informative! So tune in!</p>",
