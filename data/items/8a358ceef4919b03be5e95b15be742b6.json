  "description": "Hey All! This week we read the final book in Tiffany Reisz's Men at Work series, One Hot December! This one has a bad-ass welder heating things up with a man that’s part construction worker, part CEO (a creature we’ve never seen in the wild, but we are definitely into). We finally got a tiny bit of kink, and we play Fuck-Marry-Kill with the book's leading men and supporting ladies. Get. Stoked. This book also kicks off our holiday series of Christmas books! \n Self Love Recommendations: \n - Let your *parts* breathe, even in the winter. Melody is so committed to this, she's going to create some crotchless leggings for night time. TMI? Sorry not sorry.\n - If something has bothered you for a while, fix it, even if no one else cares. Erin decided to get a FACE TATTOO to do just that. She was already the absolute tits, and now there's no denying her bad-assery. \n *one more note: Melody opens up a tiny bit about her mental health in the winter. Seasonal Affective Disorder is tough, folks. Take care of yourselves, and if you take Vitamin D, don't forget to eat a fat with it! Mind. Blown.\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
