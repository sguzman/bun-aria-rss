In this podcast interview, Prof. Tillman discusses the historical origins of the clause, its original understanding during the early republic, and its possible application to the Trump presidency. In short, Prof. Tillman contends that the clause does not apply to elective offices; rather, it only applies to appointed offices in the federal government. Although conceding that there are good reasons to want such a clause to apply to the President, he contends that it is simply not a proper understanding of the clause to apply it to President Trump.\n\nHere’s some reading:\n\nProf. Tillman and Josh Blackman’s New York Times op-ed on Trump and the emoluments clause.\n\nProf. Tillman’s article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy on Trump and the emoluments clause\nLearn more about your ad choices.
