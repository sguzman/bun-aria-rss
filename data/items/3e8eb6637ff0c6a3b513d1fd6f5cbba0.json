  "description": "Once upon a time, people used radios in order to consume music, news, weather reports, and even sporting events. The lack of having a visual to watch was made up with the story being created in the listeners mind. This all changed though when the integration of TVs were popularized in homes - specifically when it comes to political commentary. Now, viewers could see televised speeches and elections broadcasted in their living rooms; some good, some bad, and some very bad. On today’s episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the first time the president went on TV. Along with this famous milestone, Maia as well shares the first of many milestones renowned artist Beyoncé created, starting with her nine-week run on the US singles chart with “Baby Boy”. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
