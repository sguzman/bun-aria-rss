  "title": "Way-too-early 2021 NFL Power Rankings + Bucs and Brady celebrate with Super Bowl Boat Parade (Football 2/11)",
  "description": "The Bucs continued their Super Bowl celebration with a boat parade through Tampa on Wednesday and let's just say that the team, and especially Tom Brady, enjoyed themselves. We got to see TB12 in rare form (4:55). Also in rare form - Will Brinson and Tyler Sullivan on this episode. Sully joined us to share his thoughts on his favorite team's former quarterback capturing another Lombardi Trophy (that he had no issue tossing across the water). There's reason to be confident, but the level of confidence the Bus are showing seems unique. That doesn't deter Tyler from ranking them #1 in his way-too-early 2021 NFL Power Rankings. Who follows the champs? Listen to find out. Here's a hint though: it's not the team they just beat in the Super Bowl. The guys cover Sully's Top 5 teams (14:00) and Bottom 5 (35:30) teams as we barely crack mid-February and are 7 months from real football again. But it's the NFL, so never too early to look ahead. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
