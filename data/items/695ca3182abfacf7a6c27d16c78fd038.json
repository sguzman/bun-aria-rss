  "description": "In this episode, Sharon sits down with psychologist and best-selling author, Dr. Edith Eger and her daughter–who is also a psychologist–Dr. Marianne Engle. When Dr. Eger was a young girl, she was a talented gymnast who trained for the Olympic games but was instead imprisoned at Auschwitz. As a survivor, she has written beautiful books full of light and healing. Dr. Eger advocates that we don’t ask “Why me?” but rather, “What now?”, which is a question that promotes action and an openness to change and possibility. Both Dr. Eger and Dr. Engle remind us that you can’t heal what you don’t feel; acknowledging our stories is a step toward freedom.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
