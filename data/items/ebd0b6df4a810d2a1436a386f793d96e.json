Yet when it comes to getting through those hardships without complaining or showing your anger and frustration on your face, many of us fail hard.<br /><br />Ryan Holiday is the modern day stoic, host and author of the Daily Stoic. His passion for sharing stoicism is apparent in any one of his bestselling books. The lessons on stoicism he simplifies and makes relatable are markers for living a quality life based in courage and truth.<br /><br />For this episode, consider the discomfort of being courageous when the stakes are high whether it’s moral or ethical. Stop stealing time from yourself and treat your time with as much value and care as you do your physical possessions. Find time to ask yourself the hard questions and consider what an ideal day in your life looks like.<br /><br />“There is no deed in this life so impossible that you cannot do it.
