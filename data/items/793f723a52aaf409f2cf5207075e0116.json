  "description": "<p>Fairness in automated decision-making systems has gained increasing attention\nas their applications expand to real-world high-stakes domains. To facilitate\nthe design of fair ML systems, it is essential to understand the potential\ntrade-offs between fairness and predictive power, and the construction of the\noptimal predictor under a given fairness constraint. In this paper, for general\nclassification problems under the group fairness criterion of demographic\nparity (DP), we precisely characterize the trade-off between DP and\nclassification accuracy, referred to as the minimum cost of fairness. Our\ninsight comes from the key observation that finding the optimal fair classifier\nis equivalent to solving a Wasserstein-barycenter problem under $\\ell_1$-norm\nrestricted to the vertices of the probability simplex. Inspired by our\ncharacterization, we provide a construction of an optimal fair classifier\nachieving this minimum cost via the composition of the Bayes regressor and\noptimal transports from its output distributions to the barycenter. Our\nconstruction naturally leads to an algorithm for post-processing any\npre-trained predictor to satisfy DP fairness, complemented with finite sample\nguarantees. Experiments on real-world datasets verify and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approaches.\n</p>",
