  "description": "Get your corn cobs ready! Hell has officially frozen over, which means Throwing Fits is dialing in a signature after dark flyover drone strike with our old pal and fan favorite Nick Grant. Nick is back on the pod against his better judgement to mix it up like only he can, getting extremely frustrated about topics such as like for example: gout chasing, midwest work attire, missing Kobe, his dream funeral, raising a new generation of jawnz enthusiasts, BLM, getting yatted, vintage movie tees and much more on this affectionately pugnacious episode of The Only Podcast That Matters™.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.\n",
