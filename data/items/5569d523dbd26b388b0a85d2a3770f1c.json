  "description": "Black Chyna is suing the Kardashian women, minus Kourtney and Kendall, for $100 million claiming they used their media power to get her show with Rob Kardashian canceled. Was it Kris’ alleged texts messages or Chyna’s restraining order on Rob that got E! to take away Chyna's second season? Comedian Jen Kirkman joins to go deep on the psychological makeup of Johnny Depp and his relationship with Amber. We cover his testimony and whether Jen’s mom may have had an eyewitness account. For years, Jen Kirkman has been written about in the press regarding her many disturbing encounters with comedian Louis CK. She finally shares her story from beginning to end of what happened. Then we discuss our predictions and hopes for Sex and The City’s reboot And Just Like That season 2. \n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
