  "description": "In this one-parter, Nolan, Joe, and James lay out the story of the Volkswagen emissions scandal so far. There were billions of dollars in fines and hundreds of thousands of cars were bought back from customers. From VW’s realization that their cars couldn’t pass US emissions standards and their decision to cheat, to the downfall of the whole charade and the legal consequences, the story is absolutely crazy. Since this is still an ongoing story, we might revisit it in the future as developments continue to unfold.\n\nFollow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey \nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes \nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels! \nLearn more about your ad choices.
