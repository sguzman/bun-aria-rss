  "description": "<p>Whether you’re single or in a relationship, we could all benefit from dating more deeply and effectively. In this episode, I offer tips on how to connect with someone on a values basis in order to create deeper connections. We often strive to be with people that don’t share our same values, but that’s just us trying to make something work that doesn’t naturally fit. So I offer practical tips to take any relationship to that next level. I encourage you to skip the small talk, listen, be vulnerable and find someone that increases your well-being. I share the 70/30 rule of online dating to help you be more transparent about what you’re looking for in your relationship. I also share my opinion on ghosting and how to react to it.</p>\n",
