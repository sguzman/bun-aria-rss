  "description": "<p>\"Part of the paradox at the heart of manufactured housing,\" explains Esther Sullivan, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver \"is that it's precisely the thing that makes it so affordable that also makes this a highly insecure form of housing.\"  Sullivan says that about a third of mobile homeowners live in parks where they rent a plot of land for their home. She calls this arrangement halfway homeownership, because it’s filled with  uncertainty. The property owners can raise rents, or fail to maintain communal infrastructure, or even sell the park and evict everyone living in it. Often there isn't a lot that residents can do, but now there is a new movement of cooperative ownership of mobile home parks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=24899&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Immobile Homes</a></p>\n",
