We’ll zoom way in on a diamond to understand the structure that makes crystals special, and hear about some unexpected crystals, too (hint: chocolate chip cookies contain a few different crystals!). Then, we take a look at how crystals form and get their cool colors. Plus, Marc and Sanden hunt down a hoax about Mesoamerican crystal skulls. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And! A mystery sound and a moment of um: why does sugar taste sweet?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
