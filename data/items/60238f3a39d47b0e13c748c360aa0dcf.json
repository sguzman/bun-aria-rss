  "description": "<p>The raffle for a chance to attend Kirk's upcoming live show at the Florence VFW has begun: eleven names have ascended into KMS history. A report from Blind Mike suggests he's doing well and may be ready to come back on the show (0:07:30). Former Boston Globe writer Chris Casper blames Kirk, without saying his name of course, for Mookie Betts' decision to leave the Red Sox (0:13:20). Kirk and Steve give their reviews of Sacha Baron Cohen's attempt to bring back that Borat magic (0:23:00). Kirk decides that you can no longer be called a \"doctor\" unless you write prescriptions and perform surgery; Dr. Martin Luther King is grandfathered in. Ryan Minihane makes the case for a 9 inch offering from Subway. Kirk reacts to Chelsea Handler's racist rant on Jimmy Fallon's late night show.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
