I was pleased as punch to tell Stephen that over our internet connection conversation (to be clear, I like Hoobastank). We get in deep with the feeling of being an outcast, the difference between \"shows\" and \"concerts\" and the business side of music. It's a wide ranging discussion and think you will find some value in here.
