  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. Carl Bernstein and CNN are now suggesting that the media should edit President Trump’s press conferences, rather than airing them live. What Bernstein really wants to say is that because the president is a propagandist and a liar, we in the media have to take the actual news of what he’s saying and edit it and decide what is our view of the news, with our liberal values. This gives you insight into how fools like this think. The problem with the people that populate the media is their ideology, their motivation, and their purpose. The press need to be examined and we need to study what the role of the press has historically been in our nation. They are ideologically driven and are incapable of restraining themselves to simply gather the facts and report the news. Then, Mark's Wikipedia page continues to smear him despite numerous requests for correction. These false attributions and mischaracterizations are proof that the left will use any media medium available to them for their political attacks. This is character assassination. Finally, Federal Judge Timothy Kelly, has ruled, from the bench, a 14 day temporary restraining order that the White House give back Jim Acosta's hard press pass until due process can be afforded to him. The Court did not discuss the validity of CNN's first amendment claims, however the court does not allow media in the courtroom and we the American people have no idea exactly what took place in that courtroom. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia would not release a public transcript of today’s ruling on Acosta’s press pass unless we paid for each page of the document, filled out an extensive application, and got the approval of the court’s office. Freedom of the press, except when it comes to the federal judiciary. Happy Thanksgiving!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
