  "title": "How Can I Get My Kid to Stop Doing an Annoying Behavior?",
  "description": "If your kid recently started to spit—or do something else that you just want them to stop doing—it’s easy to get into a power struggle. Annoying behaviors often become a way for kids to assert their individuality and express big feelings. In this episode, Dr. Becky talks to three parents dealing with spitting and what feels like defiance. She offers actionable strategies for responding to these undesirable behaviors in ways that are effective because they speak to the motivation under the behavior. You don’t want to miss this one; the strategies Dr Becky models are easily generalizable beyond spitting—from potty language to screaming to any “Just stop it!” behaviors.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
