Thanks to continuous glucose monitors, this is knowledge we’ll all be able to take advantage of in the near future. With insulin resistance playing a key role in the majority of the chronic diseases of our time, monitoring how our blood sugar responds to different foods is a huge step towards health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today's episode, I talk with Dr. Casey Means, Jessie Inchauspé, and Dhru Purohit about the best and the worst foods to eat for glucose management, as well as tips and tricks for combining food for optimal blood sugar balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Casey Means is a Stanford-trained physician, Chief Medical Officer and Cofounder of the metabolic health company Levels, an associate editor of the <em>International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention</em>, and a guest lecturer at Stanford University.
