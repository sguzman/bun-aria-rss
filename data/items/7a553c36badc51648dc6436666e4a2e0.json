  "title": "Warren Klein et al., \"Be Fruitful! The Etrog in Jewish Art, Culture, and History\" (Mineged, 2022)",
  "description": "The etrog is a curious fruit. The Bible commands its readers: “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day beautiful tree-fruit (peri etz hadar), palm fronds, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.” Native to the Far East and adapted to the culture of the eastern Mediterranean, the rituals of the etrog are among the very few that are dependent upon a particular environment for growth. In their wanderings across the globe, the etrog has remained part of Jews’ practices and of the annual rhythms of the Jewish harvest festival, Sukkot, the Feast of Booths. \nThis book is a lovely collection, both intellectually and visually, covering everything from the sale of etrog throughout its history to visual representations, medical remedies and much more. This interview is with Joshua Teplitsky, Jordan Katz, and Jonathan Surnow.\n﻿Matthew Miller is a graduate of Yeshivat Yesodei HaTorah. He studied Jewish Studies and Linguistics at McGill for his BA and completed an MA in Hebrew Linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. He works with Jewish organizations in media and content distribution, such as TheHabura.com and RabbiEfremGoldberg.org.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
