  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that, while the operators behind Operation Parliament pretend to be nothing but a bunch of skids, they're anything but. EITest gets taken down. Facebook this week faced questions about privacy and ideological bias. Most observers think these questions were largely ducked. Estonia's Annual Report on security is worth reading no matter where you live. And an accused swatter seems to have learned nothing from his experience. Dr. Charles Clancy from the Hume Center at VA Tech, discussing LTE network vulnerabilities. Guest is Dinah Davis from CodeLikeaGirl.io and Arctic Wolf Networks, discussing diversity at tech conferences.",
