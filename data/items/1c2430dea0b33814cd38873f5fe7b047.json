    "media:description": "Can we actually kill all the spotted lanternflies?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOver the summer, for the first time in what feels like a while, Americans united under a single cause: to murder an invasive bug.\n\nOkay, that‚Äôs a bit dramatic, but the situation itself was a bit dramatic. Social media was flooded with people in New York City, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey striking down spotted lanternflies in the most creative ways. Videos of the plant-sucking bugs that are native to parts of Asia showed them overtaking trees. Reports from Pennsylvania said they were capable of wiping out vineyards. Researchers warned they also threaten fruit trees and the hardwoods like black walnut. The public went on high alert. The messaging was clear: Stop this bug before it decimates the fruit and timber industries and costs the US tons of money.\n\nPeople struck them down all summer long, and now that it‚Äôs fall ‚Ä¶ well, they‚Äôre still here. And they‚Äôve spread.\n\nIs it futile? That depends. If you set out with your flyswatters and sticky traps thinking we could wipe out every lanternfly, then you were a bit misguided. But just because we can‚Äôt stop them entirely doesn‚Äôt mean we should quit. \n\nKristie Reddick, an entomologist and director of The Bug Chicks, put it best: ‚ÄúPeople cleaning trash out of creeks aren't going to be like, ‚ÄòOh, I picked up, like, three bags of trash and there's still more trash. I guess there's just trash now.‚Äô‚Äù Spotted lanternflies are the trash in this metaphor. \n\nCheck out the video above to find out more about spotted lanternflies and the part humans have played in spreading them around the US. \n\nRead more from Benji Jones on Vox.com:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/16/23353428/spotted-lanternfly-invasive-species\n\nFor more on where these bugs are:\nhttps://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/b0bae43d-c65f-4f88-bc9a-323f3189cd35/page/QUCkC\n\nFor more information on lanternflies and their life cycle:\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/spotted-lanternfly\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/have-you-seen-a-spotted-lanternfly\nhttps://nysipm.cornell.edu/environment/invasive-species-exotic-pests/spotted-lanternfly/\nhttps://nysipm.cornell.edu/environment/invasive-species-exotic-pests/spotted-lanternfly/spotted-lanternfly-resources/\nhttps://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/spotted-lanternfly/spotted-lanternfly\n\nFor more on the economic impact:\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/scientists-examine-potential-economic-impact-of-spotted-lanternfly-in-pennsylvania\n\nFor more on Kristie and Jessica, check out their website: https://thebugchicks.com/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
