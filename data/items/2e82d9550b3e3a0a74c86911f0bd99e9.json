  "title": "Raiders-Saints MNF Recap: Is Drew Brees washed up? Did Derek Carr play well? (Football 9/22)",
  "description": "Las Vegas actually has football and Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech are here to break down the debut of the Las Vegas Raiders at home. And what a debut it was! The Raiders topped the Saints 34-24 on Monday Night Football and although we want to credit the winners, the story of the night might be the steady decline of Drew Brees. Was this game an aberration or is he truly nearing the 'washed up' stage of his career? Or is he already firmly in it? Let's be honest, Jon Gruden deserves more recognition for his coaching performance on Monday than Derek Carr does for his quarterback performance and that's not just coming from Brinson! Join the Pick Six Superfriends as they recap the action plus break down the impact of several injuries and injury confirmations from around the league.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
