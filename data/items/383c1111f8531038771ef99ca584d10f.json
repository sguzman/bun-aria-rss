  "description": "Today we are joined by a very special guest, Cameron Esposito, to talk all things comedy and true crime! It’s the perfect mashup of worlds. Ash takes us through the Thelma Todd case from Thelma’s childhood in Massachusetts to when the young ✨Hollywood✨ starlet was discovered dead in her own car. Together we wonder what a car is exactly, why the Hollywood machine is so scary and whether we are prepared to be found paradoxically undressed.
