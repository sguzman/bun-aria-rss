This pregnant lady has a craving for garlic bread; however, she says that the smell of garlic makes her nauseous, so she wants garlic-free garlic bread. OP asks... \"Do you mean regular bread?\" The lady screams at OP and insists that she wants garlic bread, but without the garlic. But, lady, garlic bread is just regular bread with garlic butter! After much arguing, OP just decides to bring out normal bread with garlic butter on the side, and the woman happily gobbles up all of it. What?</p>\n",
