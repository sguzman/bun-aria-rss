  "description": "In Episode #210, Professor Stuart Phillips returns to expand on our conversation about using science to improve training outcomes.\n\nOne very common criticism of a plant-based diet is that it’s difficult to meet protein requirements due to both quantity and quality of plant-based protein sources. “Evidence” provided for this often centres around amino acid profiles, linking back to the DIAAS and PDCAAS protein scoring systems. Today, Professor Stuart Phillips offers clarity on this topic and much more useful information on what to consume, in what form, and when.\n\nIn this episode, we cover a whole suite of information that is highly relevant and applicable for those looking to improve their training outcomes. In addition to briefly revisiting the basics of protein consumption, we discuss distribution and timing, protein needs for older people, and protein quality scoring systems. We also dive into supplementation for those looking to improve performance and muscle protein synthesis, including caffeine, beta alanine, nitrates, creatine, omega-3s, and hormones.\n\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nProtein distribution (1:20)\n\nScoring systems for protein (11:13)\n\nSupplements for performance (28:08)\n\nSodium bicarbonate (43:40)\n\nNitrates (51:29)\n\nCreatine (56:10)\n\nOmega 3s (1:05:25)\n\nHormones & protein synthesis (1:10:30)\n\nAging & muscle gain (1:13:20)\n\nExciting new studies (1:24:12)\n\nOutro (1:27:19)\n\n\nTo listen to my previous conversation with Professor Philips, head to Episode #190. You can also learn more about him via the McMaster University profile, and connect with him on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\nIf you found this episode informative and a looking for ways to introduce more plant-based protein into your diet, you can download my free recipe eBook, Plant Perform.
