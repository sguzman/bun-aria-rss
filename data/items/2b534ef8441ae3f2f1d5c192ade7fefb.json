  "description": "In September 2009, a Yale graduate student working towards her doctorate was just days away from her wedding when she disappeared without a trace. But as investigators began looking into her disappearance, they discovered that she was never seen on surveillance footage leaving the building that day, and that her keycard wasn’t used after entering a basement lab the morning she was last seen. As they began questioning other students and searching the building top-to-bottom, they found some incredibly disturbing evidence.
