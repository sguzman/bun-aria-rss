  "description": "In this episode we’re talking about home theaters and entertaining spaces, or as people like to call them today, media rooms. There are some great brands out there for carpet that we love, one being Stark, which has really gorgeous authentic designs to its quality and is super fashionable, but they have some tailored options too if you’re a little bit more preppy. There’s a line or sister of Stark called Prestige and they are the exact same designs and they are maybe 40-50% more affordable. We like to use sconces to light up the walls and provide a little bit more atmosphere with a more dim effect. There are some really great sound bars out there now that have really simplified the sound system process, but make sure to get a professional when figuring out the acoustics of your theater or media room to ensure you have the most strategic setup. <br /><br />Lighting 3:22<br />Sound treatment 5:19<br />Carpet 6:32<br />Finish work and wall tone 9:49<br />More on lighting 13:37<br />Seating 15:46<br />Wall posters 17:44<br />Sound systems 22:30<br />Insulation and sound barriers 26:59<br />What we’re currently working on 28:04<br /><br />“I think whenever we start one of these spaces, like if it is an actual theater, I think people are usually looking at architecturally what is going to set this space apart? Whether that’s finish work and paneling, we usually see wall sconces and theatrics there, and you can get really funky, be it you want to be more formal, or you want it to have more of a young energy, I think that that’s when you skin the room. That’s what that does.” 3:31<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
