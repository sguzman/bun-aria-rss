  "description": "Since we covered Kristin's case, a month and a half-long preliminary hearing was held to determine whether the case against Paul and Ruben could proceed. The court heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including law enforcement officials, former friends and acquaintances of both Paul and Kristin, cadaver dog handlers, and soil experts. In September 2021, the judge in the case ruled that there is sufficient evidence to move the case forward to trial. Currently, the trial is set to occur on April 25, 2022.\n\nWith their daughter missing, her devastated parents relied on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation. To their dismay, the case was passed between departments and delayed long enough for key evidence to be lost. Despite sufficient evidence for officers to identify a suspect, they needed his cooperation to close the case. All the suspect was willing to do was plead the fifth. Decades would pass before they got any real answers.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
