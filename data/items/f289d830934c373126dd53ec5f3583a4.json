  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Russia is using vacuum bombs and thermobaric cluster bombs against Ukraine, which are prohibited by international law. There are more than 400 Russian mercenaries in Ukraine to assassinate President Zelensky. Many heads of state would flee under these circumstances, but Zelensky remains steadfast in Ukraine with his people. Is it fair for Zelensky to send assassination squads to take out Putin? Then, the New York Times' Walter Durante supported Stalin over the Ukrainians back in 1941. We are seeing similar from the nationalist and populists that erroneously identify as part of the conservative movement. Later, Joe Biden has nothing to say at the State of the Union address, so he'll take credit for things he didn't achieve like shutting down the virus while blaming others for inflation, skyrocketing energy costs, and Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Afterward, the Special Counsel of Wisconsin has found that Mark Zuckerberg's election donations violate state laws and are considered bribes. The Wisconsin report adds that the federal Constitution's equal protection clause was also violated as a result of illegal ballot drop boxes being instituted after offering something of value and putting the boxes inside nursing homes with non-citizens and incapacitated citizens.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
