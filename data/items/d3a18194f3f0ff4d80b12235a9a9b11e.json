  "description": "This is a very recent and ongoing case that has baffled almost everyone who has heard of it. Lori Vallow made headlines in the end of 2019, when her two children, 17 year old Tylee and 8 year old JJ disappeared, seemingly into thin air. With reports circulating that she told witnesses stories like her children were long dead or staying with relatives who confirmed they were not, things look like they are going from bad to worse. But where are Tylee and JJ? Who is Lori Vallow and why has death and destruction followed her for years? In Part 1, Ash takes us through Lori Vallow's life, as well as her first 4 marriage and a possible murder. <br>\n<br>\nThanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Daily Harvest<br>\n</strong>Go to <a href=\"http://DailyHarvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">DailyHarvest.com</a> and enter promo code MORBID to get twenty-five dollars off your first box! <br>\n<strong><br>\nHunt a Killer<br>\n</strong>Right now, just for our listeners you can go to <a href=\"http://HuntAKiller.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">HuntAKiller.com/MORBID</a> and use promo code MORBID at check out for 20% off your first box and to show support for our podcast. <br>\n<br>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
