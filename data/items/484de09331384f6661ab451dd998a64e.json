  "description": "<p>On October 1, 1976, Jimmy Don Robinson disappeared from Elmore City, Oklahoma, just a week after his 21st birthday. Jimmy was no longer living at the Robinson family home but stopped by around midnight. His mom had just gotten home after working a late shift and was cooking some dinner for herself. Jimmy briefly spoke to his family, and they noticed there was a man in the passenger seat of the car that Jimmy was driving. They didn't recognize the man, and Jimmy didn't mention who he was. He said he would drop the man off and be back in about 30 minutes. However, Jimmy never returned, and nearly 46 years later, Jimmy's family is still searching for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Jimmy Don Robinson, please contact the Garvin County Sheriff's Office at (405) 238-7591 or Garvin County Crimestoppers at 1-855-211-STOP.</p><p>You can follow Jimmy's case on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WhereIsJimmyDonRobinson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Where is Jimmy Don Robinson?</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whereisjimmydon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whereisjimmydonrobinson/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">instagram</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://goodrx.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GoodRX</a>- For simple, smart savings on your prescriptions, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://goodrx.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GoodRX.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
