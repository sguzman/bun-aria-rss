  "description": "In today’s episode, Sharon has a light-hearted conversation with her friend, Kendra Adachi, the genius behind The Lazy Genius books, podcast, and online collective. Kendra and Sharon first bonded over Kendra’s motto of “be genius about the things that matter and lazy about the things that don’t”, which can be applied to all areas of life–whether you’re in the kitchen or in the comments section of a political post. Kendra talks about the time she visited Sharon’s home with a film crew to help her reorganize parts of her kitchen using five steps: prioritize, essentialize, organize, personalize, and systemize. Copies of Kendra’s new book, The Lazy Genius Kitchen, are available on May 3rd (after surviving the harrowing adventure of&nbsp; being lost at sea!)<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
