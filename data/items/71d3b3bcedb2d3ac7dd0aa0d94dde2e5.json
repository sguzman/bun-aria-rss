  "description": "With Christopher on vacation (again), David and Joanna go through their best tips for surviving the coming July 4th travel craziness. They each bring their best gadget, app, and tip for getting where you're going a little more easily. Later, WSJ reporter Tripp Mickle joins to talk about the departure of legendary Apple designer Jony Ive-and what it means for Apple, and the Apple products you use, going forward. On this week's Today I Learned, the gang rediscovers Tumblr thanks to an online brawl between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun. Finally, David interviews Andrew Blum, author of \"The Weather Machine,\" about the global system for understanding and predicting the weather. And maybe, someday, hopefully, controlling the weather as well.",
