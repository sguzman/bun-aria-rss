  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think of when you hear the word \"warrior\"? Most people think of violence or skills in battle - but a real warrior embodies peace and positivity more than he does aggression and ego (and that's only the most basic definition of who and what a warrior is).</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brent Cash is a police officer and a martial arts master and teacher with over 40 years of experience, practice, and competition. In every part of his work and mentorship, Brent is dedicated to being the example of a modern-day warrior, through his principles, his habits, and his presence in his community.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of The Tactical Entrepreneur Podcast, Steve and Brent dive deep on what it means to be a warrior and how Brent grew into a warrior through his relationship with his father and his own discipline, how to cultivate the kind of self-awareness that allows you to intentionally and constantly improve yourself, your business, and your daily routine, how Brent raised up a champion or two of his own, and the signs to help you recognize a true warrior when you see one.
