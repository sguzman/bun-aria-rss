But once you enter the multi-cellular domain, suddenly life shows all sorts of shapes and structures. The <strong>possibilty space</strong> of multi-celled organisms is much richer.</p><p>Recall our principles of open-endedness:</p><ul><li><strong>Possibility Space:</strong> A world consists of a set of organisms. The space of possible organisms must be arbitrarily large.</li><li><strong>Peer Dependency:</strong> When new organisms appear, an environment must develop new niches.</li><li><strong>Search Algorithm:</strong> A procedure must find new organisms to fit new niches.</li></ul><p>In this post, let’s dive into how multi-cellularity can expand our possibility space towards increasingly complex genomes.</p><h2 id=\"multicell-world\">Multicell World</h2><hr><p>Last time, we worked with a simple Cellworld where cells could gain energy and reproduce. Starting with this is a base, let’s restructure the genome to support multi-cellularity, and also mix in the our bitwise chemical system.</p><p>In the Multicell world, an organism is made of a group of cells. Each cell performs a single chemical reaction, creating energy. When a cell has gathered enough energy, it will create a new cell in a neighboring space.</p><p>Similar to the Bitwise Chemicals project, there are eight chemicals. Every space in the grid has its own chemical counts, and a cell will only be able to perform a reaction if the required chemicals are there. Within an organism’s cells, chemical counts and energy are averaged out.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr class=\"gridhr\">\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card\">\n    <div class=\"kg-gallery-container\">\n        <div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n            <div class=\"kg-gallery-image\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%;\">\n                <video class=\"b-lazy b-loaded gridvideo\" type=\"video/mp4\" autoplay muted playsinline loop src=\"https://kvfrans.com/static/open/3/1.mp4\"></video>\n                <figcaption>\n                    Green cells represent the reaction (01+02).

Let’s allow for cells to specialize, and perform different roles.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"float-outside\">\n<div class=\"float-figure\">\n<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://kvfrans.com/static/open/3/cell2.png\">\n    <figcaption>An organism comprised of different specialized cells. Cells behave differently depending on their pheromone.</figcaption>\n</div>\n    In this setup, a genome is a decision tree. When a new cell is born, this tree will tell it what reaction to specialize in. Once a cell specializes, it will only perform that reaction.\n<br><br>\nCrucially, the genome decision tree takes as input a pheromone – four bits that are unique to each indicidual cell. When a cell makes a child, it can assign it a new pheromone, which can cause the child to specialize in a different reaction.\n    <br><br>\nPut together, the genome of a organism is like an algorithm that tells the organism how to grow and what its cells should specialize in.

These reactions usually synergize, with one providing the materials for the other. As the world advances, we also see cells that use their excess energy to power Killer cells and gain space.</p><p>One interesting note are the patterns of cells. With the way genomes work, there’s no real definition of a “pattern” – it all depends on the dynamics of the pheromones. Perhaps a cell with a pheromone of [0001] will produce a child of pheromone [0010], whose own child will loop back to [0001].</p><p>In real-life plants, we often see the Fibonacci series, or spiral patterns. These are patterns that naturally arise when cells grow by replication, since they are easy ways to gain repetition. In our gridworld, we often see checker-board style patterns, which are similarly easy to achieve.</p><p>Further work can involve:</p><ul><li>How can we increase the complexity of inter-species interactions beyong sharing chemicals and/or killing each other? What kinds of complexity lead to novel/interesing behavior?</li><li>Other than grid-based worlds, are there more interesting ways to represent physical organisms?
