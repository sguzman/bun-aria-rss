So many people don’t take that first step towards making the idea they have in their heads a reality because they’re afraid they won’t be perfect or successful. But as Beth tells us, embracing uncertainty and learning as you go is the only way to move towards growth and success. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, we’ll explain why imagination, creativity and white space are so important, and why creativity isn’t just something to be done in your free time. We’ll discuss why so many people don’t use their imagination to its full potential, how to cultivate imagination and the importance of vision and story in achieving your goals for a brighter future.</span></p>",
