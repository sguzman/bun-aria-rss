  "description": "In this episode we continue our discussion about exteriors and answer many of the questions our listeners have sent in. We have a question about whether you can paint your stucco, and that all depends on the climate in which you live, so if you live in a place like Utah where you get the extreme of all 4 seasons, it’s going to need to be repainted probably within the next 5-7 years. When talking about color, there are a lot of black and white homes out there, which we would say are somewhat overdone, so if you’re going for that look maybe use a more soft white and charcoal black to avoid being so blatant. Color can also be chosen by the environment or other homes that surround it. <br /><br />Can you paint stucco? 2:23<br />Siding, hardie board, and creating interest 3:15<br />Can you replace hardie board for a brick exterior? 7:46<br />Color - Are black and white homes too trendy? 10:59<br />How many colors to use on an all-stucco house 14:29<br />Exterior paint color that isn’t black or white 15:19<br />Landscaping, fencing 19:33<br />Decking 22:58<br />Lighting 24:54<br />Entry doors 26:18<br />Garage doors 31:23<br />Exterior remodels 34:32<br />Gutters 35:47<br /><br />“Anything done in good taste is gonna be long lasting. People always ask that, like ‘How do I make sure this isn’t gonna be trendy, or tiresome, or classic?’ If it’s done in good taste, like in your personal style, other people are gonna react to it and they’re gonna buy it.” 14:01<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
