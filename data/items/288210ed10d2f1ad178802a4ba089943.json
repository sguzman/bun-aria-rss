A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nI for one am glad the debate is behind us so that we can look at the things that really matter. Things like the UNHC \"suggesting\" that we pay reparations to the suppreseed minority in the US, yes that righs we need to pay for an outdated social construct that we spent nearly 600,000 lives removing from the US 150 years ago, so it seems that isn't enough; and if that isn't the topper of stuppidity maybe the US turning the keys of the Internet over to the UN takes the cake. Join me as we look into the matter and discuss the issues that make you step back and question your own sanity.\n\n Podcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
