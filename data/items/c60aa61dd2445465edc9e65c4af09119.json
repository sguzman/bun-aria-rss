    "media:description": "Full title: \"Sunlight Living [COLLAB] Stencil Horseback and the Smack Lobsters [Feat. Oracle]\"\n\n\nDiscovered by me\n\nThis instrumental was produced by Oracle (now known as Ghost64) on SoundCloud. Jack Stauber and Spencer Roeback made a song using the instrumental in this video, but the song has since been deleted, leaving only the instrumental available to listen to. The only thing that has been said about the song by Jack and Spencer was posted as a comment on the original instrumental by the catdash SoundCloud account, simply only saying that the song was a great track and a lot of fun to make. The cover art is not official, but is a remake of what it could have been based on the cover art for \"Vero Living\".\nJack Stauber and Spencer Roeback did not take part in producing this instrumental.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/64ghost/sunlight\n\n\n\"Sunlight Living\" is a deleted song that Jack Stauber helped make that has not been recovered yet.
