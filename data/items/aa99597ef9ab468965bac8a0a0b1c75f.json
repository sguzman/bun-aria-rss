  "title": "Mothers & Sons with Ocean Vuong (and Chase Melton)",
  "description": "Glennon’s son, Chase, joins Glennon for a special conversation with his hero, author Ocean Vuong, to discuss:\n\n1. Chase shares with Ocean the impact his work has had in his life–and Glennon thanks Ocean for helping mother her son.\n2. What Ocean learned from his mother about how to navigate being an Asian boy in America–and Glennon’s recognition that she did not prepare Chase for the same realities.\n3. Ocean’s new book, Time is a Mother, and why watching his own mother die gave Ocean a deep empathy and connection to every person.\n4. His relationship to maleness–and why Ocean is interested in “staying and complicating” masculinity.\n\nAbout Ocean:\nOcean Vuong, author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky with Exit Wounds, and the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is a recipient of the 2019 MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" and the winner of the Whiting Award and the T. S. Eliot Prize. In Time Is a Mother, Ocean's newest poetry collection available now, he reckons with his mother’s death, embodying the paradox of sitting within grief while being determined to survive beyond it. His writings have been featured in The Atlantic, Harper's Magazine, The Nation, The New Republic, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. Born in Saigon, Vietnam, he currently lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\nIG: ocean_vuong\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
