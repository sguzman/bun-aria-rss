  "description": "<div>Money is not generally discussed at the dinner table, and inheritance even less so. So, do parents do enough to pass down responsible personal finance habits to the next generation? And if not, how can those conversations be had? On this live recording of The Spectator’s Women With Balls podcast, deputy political editor Katy Balls will be joined by Charlotte Ransom and Dame Helena Morrissey to discuss breaking the taboo around money and offering practical tips on investing across the generations. <br>\n<br>\nSponsored by Netwealth.</div>\n",
