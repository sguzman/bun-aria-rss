  "title": "75 - Guns and God: David Koresh's Waco Siege",
  "description": "<p>Feb. 28th, 2018 will mark the 25th anniversary of the ATF raiding the Branch Davidian Compound in Waco Texas, setting off a 51 day armed standoff between federal agents and militant Christian fanatics. Over 80 people would die, most in the final day of the siege when a fire would burn the compound to the ground, killing nearly all of the men, women, and children still inside. Tanks versus citizens. Armed agents versus armed zealots. Religious freedom versus gun laws and the age of consent. And behind all of this madness? David Koresh. A self-proclaimed prophet, polygamist, and pedophile. We get real weird today as we go full-cult on Timesuck! </p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by by the socially conscious on-line fantastic mattress store LEESA!
