  "description": "Ever since he started shooting home movies with his family's bulky video camera, Jon M. Chu knew he wanted to be a filmmaker. But after directing several Hollywood blockbuster films like <em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</em> and <em>Now You See Me 2</em>, Jon felt uninspired by the stories he was bringing to the silver screen. In 2018, he directed <em>Crazy Rich Asians </em>— the first Hollywood film with a majority Asian cast in 25 years — and in 2021, Lin Manuel Miranda's <em>In the Heights</em>. We featured Jon M. Chu in TED Radio Hour's recent episode <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996599376/the-artists-voice\"><em>The Artist's Voice</em></a><em>.</em>",
