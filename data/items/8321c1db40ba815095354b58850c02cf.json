  "description": "<p>Many people want to talk about Jesus, but they want to relate to him on their own terms. The way to find the real Jesus is to encounter the Jesus of the gospels in the New Testament. In these verses describing the baptism of Jesus, we learn that 1) There is a dance; 2) The greatest need of your life is to get into that dance; and 3) Jesus is the one who can bring you in. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 15, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 1:9-13.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
