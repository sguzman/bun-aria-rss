  "description": "<p>America’s Highway Serial Killers /// Part 3 /// 592 </p><p>Part 3 of 4 </p><p><br /><a href=\"http://www.truecrimegarage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p><p>This week we pick up right where we left off with more bad guys and bad news from America’s Highways. Tammy Jo Zywicki was an amazing young woman who had just one year left at Grinnell college before going on to some big and wonderful things. When her car broke down in central Illinois that all changed. Most of us would have stopped to help the young woman or felt guilty as we continued on our journey hoping not to be later for our next stop. Unfortunately in this real life true crime story that was not to be. As her Pontiac sat on the side of Interstate 80 (I-80) Tammy had her head under the hood trying to fix the problem but then along came a spider. A predator saw an opportunity and pounced. Police have come up with some suspects over the years and we are ready to serve them up to you as we close out this four part series. If you have any information regarding the still unsolved murder of Tammy Jo Zywicki please call or email your local FBI office. If you have any information regarding the still unsolved murder of Kristin Schmidt please call the Oregon State Police - dial *OSP or *677 if you are calling from a mobile phone, or dial: 503-378-3720 </p><p><br />Beer of the Week Breakaway Session IPA (Nashville Soccer Club) by the amazing folks over at Fat Bottom Brewing Co.
