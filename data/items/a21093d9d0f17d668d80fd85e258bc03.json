  "description": "Episode 31 of the Plant Proof podcast I sat down with vegan mother Loni Jane. Loni Jane is perhaps one of the most well known online vegan influencers having started sharing her journey pretty much as soon as Instagram was launched. In the last 9 years Loni has become symbolic of someone who was in very poor health that adopted a plant based lifestyle and was able to turn their life around both mentally and physically to create a life of love, prospertity, growth and wellness … a life that is in her control and on her terms as opposed to her previous life where she battled with excessive drinking, low self awareness, poor nutrition and essentially a depleted physical body. Loni and I have been wanting to sit down and record this podcast for a while now and finally we were able to do it in her amazing home in Queensland Australia….we spoke for almost 2 hours but really could of spoken for many more. I hope you enjoy this episode…I think it really sums up Loni well and opitimizes why she has built such a loyal community on line… raw, candid and authentic Loni!\n\nSpecifically in this episode we cover:\n\n\nLoni's childhood years\n\nHer battle with deteriorating health and what factors contributed to this\n\nHow and why she transitioned to a plant based lifestyle\n\nThe difficulties associated with moving away from her previous habits\n\nHer partners support during her pursuit to better her physical and mental self\n\nHow she has raised her children so far\n\nTips during pregnancy from her personal experience including how she worked with her Doctor's\n\nSome high level information on supplements for women, children and during pregnancy from her personal experience\n\nSpecific foods her children eat\n\nand much much more (nearly 2 hours of chatting)\n\n\nAs always you can find the Plant Proof podcast on pretty much all podcast apps including Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, Soundcloud, Overcast and also directly on the plantproof.com website for everyone to enjoy absolutely free of charge!\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode please share it with any friends or family members who may benefit from listening to Loni's story and if you use iTunes and have 1-2 min spare time please leave a review on the show.
