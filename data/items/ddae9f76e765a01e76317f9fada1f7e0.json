  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Rich Zeoli of WPHT fills in. President Trump is having his best week ever. He is at 50% approval rating and today's job's report says there are 225,000 new jobs. Trump's week gets better when we look at former VP Joe Biden's 4th place loss in Iowa when he was widely considered the front-runner. This puts the Democrats in pretty bad shape as they go into the 2020 election cycle. Then, Mitt Romney is praised by the same media that called him a murderer for his betrayal during the impeachment. Later, Trump has beat all of the odds so far; crooked cops in the FBI, attacks on his family and the emoluments fallacy, the Russia Hoax, and the impeachment sham. Afterward, will Mike Bloomberg revert to his fascist tendencies if he wins the Democrat nomination? Will he eliminate our liberty and force us to learn to code? What about abortion? Finally, the White House announces that both Lt Col. Vindman and Amb. Sondland have been re-assigned.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
