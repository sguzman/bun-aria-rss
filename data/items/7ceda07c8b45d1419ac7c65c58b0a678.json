  "description": "<p>We say often on the podcast that there is a leadership deficit in our country and in the world. That means there is a huge need for leaders to step up and make change. But so many leaders talk themselves out of leading because they feel they don’t have enough influence or opportunities.</p> <p>In this episode, John encourages everyone that you can lead right now by starting wherever you are, using what you have, and doing what you can. He talks about influence and opportunities, and how to gain more of each.</p> <p>Join Mark Cole and Traci Morrow in the application portion of the episode as they share their own stories of stepping into leadership and discuss the great things that happen when you lean into the leadership needs around you.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Lead Now Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Now and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-360-Degree-Leader-Hardcover_p_2781.html\"> <em>The 360° Leader</em> by John C.
