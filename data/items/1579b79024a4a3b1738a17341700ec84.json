  "description": "In this edition Prof Steve Keen explains to Phil Dobbie how tax levels are really more to do with the government controlling the level of inflation in the economy and less to do with raising revenue to pay for their own expenses. Yet, few people see it that way. Once you do, it makes sense to see tax as an instrument that manages the strength of the economy, in unison with interest rates. Look at it like that and you see that tax should be low when economic growth is slow, not higher to cover the subsequent shortfall in government revenue.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
