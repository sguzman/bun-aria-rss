Today, Switched On speaks with Kari Helgason, head of research and innovation at Carbfix, the company that will take Rio's CO2 and inject it underground where it will turn to rock within two years. In our conversation, which takes place on location in Iceland at the site of Carbfix's first CO2 injection project, he tells us how the technology works, and how Carbfix's solution could scale to make a meaningful dent in global emissions.</p><p>BNEF users can hear this interview and more, on BNEF<GO> on the Bloomberg Terminal, <a href=\"https://cms.megaphone.fm/organizations/0bbaaaa6-027b-11e7-b684-3717adf9e9b8/podcasts/17d0d27e-92a8-11e9-9d5e-43538e740cb6/episodes/15acdd24-677f-11ea-9cd2-ffae81e64385/www.bnef.com\">bnef.com</a> or <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/mobile/\">BNEF Mobile</a>.</p><p>Switched on this week is hosted by Mark Taylor.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
