  "description": "In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) The Power of Play\n(00:02:23) Tool: Reading on Smart Phones, Sighing & Learning\n(00:09:14) Sponsors\n(00:13:57) Homeostatic Regulation of Play\n(00:23:53) Childhood Play & Mindsets\n(00:29:21) Contingency Testing\n(00:32:17) The (Power of) Playful Mindset\n(00:36:13) Body Postures\n(00:44:03) Rule Testing & Breaking\n(00:48:24) Role Play\n(00:50:39) Neurobiology of Low-stakes Play\n(00:54:22) Expanding Capabilities through Tinkering\n(01:00:03) Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity\n(01:04:44) Adulthood Play\n(01:10:14) Fire Together, Wire Together\n(01:18:03) Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery\n(01:23:25) Competition & Dynamic Movement\n(01:27:36) Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty\n(01:32:52) Personal Play Identity\n(01:37:24) Play Transforms Your Future Self\n(01:40:55) Recommendations for Play\n(01:44:25) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify/Apple Reviews, YouTube, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
