Internet streaming services have grown exponentially to serve <a href=\"https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/16445859/global-iptv-numbers-to-triple-in-5-years\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">millions of people</a> around the world. To access the streaming channels, broadcasts, and more TV content, you need a platform, and Kodi might be the right choice for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi is a hosting program that allows you to download add-ons or builds and access all the content you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need is a strong internet connection and a compatible device. Kodi can be accessed on different devices and is supported by many platforms, such as iOS devices, Windows, Android, and many more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After downloading and installing Kodi, you still need to include add-ons because Kodi does not produce any content by itself. Installing add-ons can be a lot of work, but luckily, things are easier with Kodi builds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsing through different Kodi builds to find the right one can be a daunting task; for this reason, this article provides a list of the best Kodi builds in the market. The builds are compatible with FireStick, Android phones, Windows, MacBooks, and other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is Kodi?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi is basically an open-source content streaming software, and has been around <a href=\"https://ting.com/blog/a-short-history-of-kodi/#:~:text=Kodi%20was%20first%20released%20in,and%20the%20abbreviated%20name%20stuck.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for nearly two decades</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before being named Kodi, it had two other names: Xbox Media Player and Xbox Media Centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This software allows you to access your content from local storage or over the internet using IP addresses. IPs, short for Internet Protocols, are a set of numbers that provide information about your location and the device you’re using to access the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Kodi, you&#8217;ll be able to access an online library of movie streaming channels, shows, sports events, and even more content. Kodi can also be customized with other software, such as addons or Kodi builds to help you access your favorite content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most platforms support Kodi, and you can download it online on Google Play, Windows Store, etc. The software does not require much expertise to install and set up, as you will find out later in this article. Kodi also updates its software frequently, meaning some of the builds mentioned here can only work on specific Kodi versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodi Installation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Kodi on Amazon Firestick, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube, Android Platforms, Windows, and Xbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodi For Amazon Devices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi is not on the Amazon App store, but you can still load it by following specific steps. Using the downloader app on the Amazon App Store, set up the Firestick for installation by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Enabling ADB Debugging</li><li>Permitting app installation from unknown sources.</li><li>Turning off device usage data.</li><li>Turning off collect app data.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodi On Android Platforms</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Android devices, you can download Kodi from the Google Play Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodi On Windows And Xbox</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Windows and Xbox devices, head over to the Windows Store, type <strong>&#8216;Kodi&#8217;</strong> into the search bar, and then install the software from the search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kodi On Mac And Other iOS Devices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://kodi.tv/download/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Download page</a> of Kodi&#8217;s website, you will notice a download link for different types of devices. Select MacOs from the provided options, and then click on the provided download button.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Next After Installation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi is designed to help you play your own content. To access the online media content, you will need to install add-ons and builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Kodi Builds?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi builds change the entire appearance of the Kodi platform in different ways. Builds are also equipped with useful addons to get you started with Kodi right after installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing a Kodi build, it comes with add-on settings, interfaces, an electric program guide, and many other exciting features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Kodi build, you do not need to download addons or worry about complex setups; it is basically a pre-packed version of Kodi.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Are Kodi Add-ons?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Add-ons are programs created by developers to help you access available content with a few clicks. Addons usually work almost the same as extensions do on your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/best-kodi-addons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Best Kodi Addons</strong> </a></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How Not To F*ck Up Your Kodi Experience:</strong> Streaming movies and TV shows on any of the 3rd party Kodi-addons may be illegal in your country due to copyright issues. \n\nConsider using a VPN if you truly care about protecting your online privacy.\n\n<strong>Here are the key benefits of hiding your IP (using VPN):</strong>\n\n1) Encrypts your internet traffic.\n2) You can access Geo-restricted content.\n3) You can avoid ISP throttling.\n4) You can avoid unwanted surveillance by government agencies and ISPs.\n5) You can protect yourself from hackers.\n\nConnect VPN on all of your streaming devices (iOS, Windows, Android, Amazon Fire TV, etc.) and enjoy worry-free & high-speed movie experience 24/7.\n\n<strong>The Most Popular VPN Providers Among Kodi Users Are:</strong>\n\n1) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/cyberghostvpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get CyberGhost</strong></a> - 45-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n2) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/expressvpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get ExpressVPN</strong></a> - 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n3) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/privatevpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get</strong> <strong>PrivateVPN</strong></a> - 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Builds For Kodi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know more about Kodi, the installation process for various devices, and the role addons play in this software, it&#8217;s time to check out some of the best Kodi builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Limits Magic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No Limits Magic is one of the most popular Kodi builds available today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing about this Kodi build is it doesn’t need any computing skills to operate. The build also doesn’t limit how much content you stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The No Limits Magic Build works with both Kodi 18.1 and 17.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you run No Limit Magic, it can give you access to a lot of content, but some might be unavailable due to legal issues. To access the geo-restricted content on the No Limit Magic build, you will need a good VPN, such as CyberGhost VPN. A VPN lets you stream anonymously, avoiding the legal trouble associated with streaming copyrighted content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No Limits Magic has frequent updates with new features for the best streaming experience. Some popular addons on this build include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Pulse Fitness</li><li>Sport’s Devil</li><li>The Magic Dragon</li><li>Cloud TV</li><li>And more.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Addons allow you to access a vast selection of online media content, from movies, live TV to music, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The build comes in different packages; you can choose between the Regular (271-276 MB) or the Firestick Lite version (171-176 MB).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regular version features an adult section while the FireStick Lite doesn&#8217;t. However, both versions are highly customizable for the best viewing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Titanium</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Titanium build is compatible with Kodi 18 and 17.6 Krypton versions. It offers live sports, movies, YouTube streaming, television shows, and even more content from the US and UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comprehensive online library of the Titanium Build is due to add-ons such as DeathStar and Gaia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeathStar addon is relatively new to Kodi and comes with a wide collection of video content. Given that DeathStar comes with preloaded addons, it is easy to confuse it with a Kodi build. In reality, it is actually an addon created by 11 developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Misfit Mods Lite</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Misfits Mods Lite is only compatible with Kodi 18 Leia. With this build, you&#8217;ll have access to a variety of movies, TV shows, kids zone, etc. Popular addons on this platform include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Death Star</li><li>Sports Devil</li><li>Magic Dragon</li><li>Exodus Redux</li><li>Yoda</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the features of Misfit Mods include a simple design, availability of top-rated addons, movies, and other media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that this easy-to-install build is also compatible with Real Debrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Slamious</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For your streaming needs, the Slamious Kodi build has over 40 popular add-ons that come with lots of exciting features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that this build has plenty of features, it may take a while before you get used to its user interface, but once you do, you&#8217;ll enjoy every bit of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One good thing about this build is that it is regularly updated, keeping it free from bugs while adding even more content for the best streaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in the Slaminous Repository, Slamious Kodi build works with both Kodi 18 and 17.6 versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The build is also compatible with most devices and operating systems, and has a user-friendly interface to allow easy navigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, this build is also safe and easy to install.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Xanax</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Xanax Kodi build shares the same developer as the Durex build, which explains the striking resemblance between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Durex build is no longer functional, but Xanax performs just as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xanax build has a clean interface and features popular add-ons like Yoda, Exodus Redox, Magic Dragon, Maverick Dragon, and many others. With all the options available, you&#8217;ll enjoy using this Kodi build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The software also doesn’t take up too much space, so you don’t have to worry about your device lagging. Once you enable installation from unknown sources on Kodi, installation is safe and easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the installation of Xanax, you will be prompted to choose between Leia and Krypton builds. Click on Leia if your Kodi version is 18 and above or the Krypton one if your Kodi version is below 18.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After closing and relaunching Kodi during the installation process of the Xanax build, you might still not be able to access some content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bypass these restrictions, consider installing a reliable VPN like CyberGhostVPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Xontech</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Created by Team Falcon, this build works with Kodi 18 Lea only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not only attractive but also easy to navigate. It comes with lots of streaming addons, which are regularly updated for an optimum performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xontech Kodi build has a futuristic design, something that makes it standout from the rest. It also groups its content in multiple categories, such as 3D-4K, A-Team, Movies, Shows, Music, Kids, Live TV, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular addons on Xontech include Yoda, DeathStar, Exodus Redux, The Magic Dragon, Sports Devil, Hootloop V2, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before installing the Kodi build, make sure to reset Kodi to default settings on your device. To access your default settings and addons on Kodi, choose the Regular Install button instead of Fresh Install, located towards the end of the installation procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The build works well on devices with commendable computational power; Xontech is built to stream content at a higher speed and better clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Maze</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For more flexibility and improved usability, the Maze Kodi is a great option. The build rarely experiences performance issues, even when installed on a device with low specifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Maze is compatible with various devices, such as Android TV Box, Kodi, Windows, Firestick, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Maze build originates from the Maze Wizard and has plenty of great add-ons to choose from, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Exodus Redux.</li><li>YouTube.</li><li>Sports Devil.</li><li>The Magic Dragon.</li><li>DeathStar.</li><li>The Loop.</li><li>And more.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the Maze include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Well-organized content, making it easy to navigate and use.</li><li>Small-sized installation package (124 MB).</li><li>Customizable add-ons for a better streaming experience.</li><li>A clean interface and layout.</li><li>Compatibility with many streaming devices.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Moments after installing the Maze, give it a few minutes to configure and update various add-ons and settings. Remember that most content hosted by third party streaming apps have copyright issues, but you can hide your online identity by using CyberGhostVPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Silvo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Build works with Kodi 18.1, 18.9 Leia, and 17.6 Krypton. Silvo has everything you need from a typical build despite being relatively lightweight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular add-ons on Silvo include Yoda, Maverick TV, cCloud TV, Sports Devil, and many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The add-ons allow you to watch movies, TV shows, documentaries, kid’s content, etc., from the US and UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the developers of Silvo reduced the size of the build from 540MB to 250MB, enabling users with low-storage devices to join the fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Silvo Kodi build, created by the Multi Build Wizard Team, features 35 themes or skins. You can utilize the customizable features to adjust the build to suit your taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Silvo to work, it needs encryption, which means you&#8217;ll need a reliable VPN like CyberGhostVPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you need to know about this build is that the adult section is easily accessible from the main menu. Therefore, you need to proceed with caution, especially where minors are involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Diggz Xenon Build</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known as the Diggz Xenon Plus, this build works only on Kodi 18.1 and is highly recommended for users who want to install Kodi on Android TV boxes and Firestick devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user interface on Diggz Xenon Build has nice visuals and animations. The layout is also exciting and anticipatory, given that Xenon is mainly associated with superhero movies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some key features of Xenon Kodi build include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Streams without lagging</li><li>Plenty of games available</li><li>Incorporates popular addons such as Seren, Exodus, Yoda, etc.</li><li>Availability of content for all ages</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one thing you need to know about this build is that it is quite large; it takes up to 600MB storage space. But this is quite understandable considering its many useful feature and vast repository of movies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reaper</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The build is a fan-favorite among Reddit Kodi users. Reaper constantly updates its repository and cuts off unnecessary or inactive add-ons to maintain efficiency. The developer team also carries out routine maintenance to get rid of bugs and any other issues that would affect the quality of stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaper&#8217;s interface is almost the same as Kodi’s; they both utilize the Estuary interface. Some notable a add-ons on Reaper include Seren, 13Clowns, Gaia, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reaper build also houses other essential services like OpenInfo, Trakt, Premiumizer, and Real Debrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If simplicity is what you are looking for in a Kodi build, you&#8217;ll love the Reaper. And, of course, for a better and safer streaming experience, you&#8217;ll need a top-rated VPN, such as CyberGhostVPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DaButcher</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For minimalists, DaButcher is one of the best bets. Due to its simplicity, users get to enjoy the seamless streaming performance. Like other builds, you also get popular add-ons, new skins for customization, the ability to add personalized widgets, among other exciting features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DaButcher has a well-organized and easy-to-navigate content section. The menu comes with different categories, such as movies, TV shows, Live TV, Kids Zone, Comedy, Documentaries, Fitness, etc. In terms of the installation package size, it’s small, making it compatible with most low spec devices. The installation process of the build is easy and takes only 10-15 minutes of your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>BK Nox</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The BK Nox build has a futuristic interface, just like the Titanium build, attracting many users to the platform. The build also has decent performance levels despite carrying a large package size of 300 MB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what makes the BK Nox Kodi build unique? It has a dedicated section for sports that includes sub-categories, such as live sports, baseball, and many others in the sports world.

However, streaming content using the Grindhouse build is not legal, and you might need a trustworthy VPN that doesn’t keep your logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CyberGhost VPN is a great example of such a VPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Equinox</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinox is among the top Kodi builds due to its clean and elegant layout. The build is quite large (400 MB), requiring a lot of installation space, therefore not suitable for low storage devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinox comes with various add-ons such as Genre TV, Genie TV, Sports, Yoda, Sports Devil, Merin Project, Genesis Reborn, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some impressive features of the Equinox build include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A large number of add-ons to choose from.</li><li>Access to the Genie TV premium service.</li><li>Beautiful, easy-to-use interface.</li><li>Regular updates.</li><li>Availability of adult section.</li><li>Extensive library of movies, TV shows, music, and Live TV.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinox derives from the Genie TV repository, which was launched in 2018.

Plutonium’s user interface is vibrant, has outstanding animations, and comes with popular add-ons like Magic Dragon, DeathStar, Yoda, Sports Devil, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is ideal for Amazon FireStick 4k.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it is also compatible with many other devices, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fire TVs</li><li>Fire TV Cubes</li><li>Android TV boxes</li><li>NVIDIA SHIELDS</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is about 160MB, which is pretty lightweight when compared to other builds we have reviewed so far. One thing you need to know is when you install Plutonium Kodi build for the first time, it may appear slow. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem; the build updates addons and other features in the background, which explains the (temporary)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reduced processing speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other great features by Plutonium include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Massive inventory of tools and addons at your disposal.</li><li>Multiple skins and design layouts that you can easily download and install.</li><li>Clean, organized, and easy-to-navigate layout, allowing easy personalization.</li><li>Compatible with most streaming services such as Roku, Chromecast, Smart TV, AppleTV, etc.</li><li>Works on almost all operating systems such as iOS, Windows, Android, Amazon, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>CellarDoor TV</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CellarDoor TV is one of the best Kodi builds in the market; it houses multiple builds compatible with the Krypton version of Kodi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the builds on the platform come with add-ons containing multiple media resources.

Here are some of the most common, and their answers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Do I Need A VPN To Use Kodi Builds?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Kodi builds contain pirated content that could land you in legal trouble. Also, government, ISPs, and other third parties such as hackers can easily track your activities online when using Kodi. To keep yourself protected always, you’ll need a VPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A VPN masks your IP address, making it difficult for third parties to identify you on the internet. When that happens, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone to tell what you are doing on the internet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Is A Good VPN for Kodi Builds?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless VPN in the market, but it is always advisable to choose the one that best suits your purpose. For example, when it comes to live streaming movies and TV shows on platforms such as Kodi, CyberGhostVPN is one of the best VPNs out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This VPN has a strict no-logs policy, dedicated streaming server, Wi-Fi protection, 45-day money back guarantee, and more than 7100 servers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Is The Difference Between A Kodi Build, Repository and Addon?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Kodi build is basically a collection of popular pre installed add ons. It also contains numerous Kodi skins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a Kodi repository, also known as a Repo, is a container where Kodi addons are stored.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, a Kodi addon is a collection of packages that have certain features and functionalities that are not included with Kodi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further understand what a Kodi addon is, think of your computer’s internet browser. If you are using Chrome, for example, you can install extensions from Google, to improve the functionality of your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browser extensions serve different purposes, such as taking full-page screenshots, blocking ads, translating pages, changing the appearance of the browser, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Should I Enable Unknown Sources Before Installing Any Build For Kodi?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything that is not offered in the official Kodi repository is considered to be a third-party. Meaning, it has not been verified by the Kodi team of developers, and may have certain issues, such as copyright infringement. By allowing installation from unknown sources, it is a way of acknowledging that you understand the risks that come with this decision and that you, not Kodi, will be fully liable of any consequence that may arise from the installation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Should I Reset Kodi To Factory Settings Before Installing Any Build?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Resetting Kodi before installing any build has three main advantages. It frees up memory and space and avoids any compatibility issues that may arise during the installation process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know a thing or two about the best Kodi builds, you should not have a problem choosing the right one for you. While at it, please remember that having a great VPN like CyberGhostVPN will improve your viewing experience while at the same time keeping you anonymous online.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What&#8217;s The Best Working Kodi Build For Movies, TV Shows and Sports?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve listed some great examples in this article. To recap, Khaos, Dominus, Innovation, CellarDoor TV, and Plutonium are a great place to start if you are looking for high-quality movies, TV shows, sports, and so much more!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com/best-kodi-builds/\">Best Kodi Builds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com\">ProoFFreader</a>.</p>\n"
