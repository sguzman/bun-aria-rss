  "description": "<em>All That She Carried</em> is the history of a single bag. Historian and author Tiya Miles used what few historical records she could find to tell the stories of three generations of Black women with ties to that sack dating back to 1850. Miles' journey started because of a simple message embroidered on the bag by one of its owners, Ruth Middleton. She told <em>Here & Now</em>'s Scott Tong that people have emotional reactions to seeing the sack, because it means the families survived to pass it down to future generations.",
