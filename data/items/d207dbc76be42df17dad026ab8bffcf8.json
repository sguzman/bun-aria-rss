  "description": "Sermon On The Mount: Introduction. This week, we are beginning a series going through the Sermon On The Mount. In a time where we are continually divided, even within the church, we take a look at a different affiliation, one that supersedes nation and location and informs how we exist within others: the Kingdom of God. In many ways, this is a series that will challenge much of what we hold tight within our identity (for Mike & Tim especially!), and we’re very excited to embark on with all of you.  \n\nWe have always viewed VOX as a community, despite it existing mostly within the digital realm. We encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on Facebook and Instagram. \n\nThe book Mike references is: https://www.amazon.com/Scandalous-Witness-Political-Manifesto-Christians/dp/0802877354/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lee+camp+scandalous+witness&qid=1595170355&sr=8-1\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
