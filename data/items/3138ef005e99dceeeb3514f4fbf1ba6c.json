  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving! We will be back next week with brand new episodes, but on a day when so many of us are thinking about love and relationships I wanted to share an episode that has changed the way I think about those topics in a profound way. \n\nAlison Gopnik is a professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of California Berkeley. She’s published more than 100 journal articles and half a dozen books, including most recently The Gardener and the Carpenter: What the New Science of Child Development Tells Us About the Relationship Between Parents and Children. She runs a cognitive development and learning lab where she studies how young children come to understand the world around them, and she’s built on that research to do work in AI, to understand how adults form bonds with both children and each other, and to examine what creativity is and how we can nurture it in ourselves and — more importantly — each other.\n\nBut this conversation isn’t just about kids -- it's about what it means to be human. What makes us feel love for each other. How we can best care for each other. How our minds really work in the formative, earliest days, and what we lose as we get older. The role community is meant to play in our lives.\n\nThis episode has done more than just change the way I think. It’s changed how I live my life. I hope it can do the same for you.\nBook recommendations:\nA Treatise of Human Natureby David Hume\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll\nThe works of Jean Piaget\n\n\nCredits:\nProducer/Audio engineer - Jeff Geld\nResearcher - Roge Karma\n\nPlease consider making a contribution to Vox to support this show: bit.ly/givepodcasts Your support will help us keep having ambitious conversations about big ideas.\n\nNew to the show?
