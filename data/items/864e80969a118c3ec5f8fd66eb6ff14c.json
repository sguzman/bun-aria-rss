  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys recap their Christmas breaks as Pat chats about his food preparations and getting his Shelby restored, Todd gives a scathing review of Holmes and Watson, and Digs breaks down his Christmas from hell. Pat also talks about calling the Packers and Lions game at Lambeau on Sunday and tries to learn a little more about the guys he’ll be calling the game with. They also look at this weekend’s NFL slate and decide which games are important in terms of playoff implications including Pat sending potential bulletin board material to the Titans before their tilt with the Colts on Sunday night, the guys debate about Tom Brady’s injury and whether or not the Patriots will be able to continue to run all over everybody. To close out the show, Pat asks people to send in phrases they’d like him to use on Sunday, with the best recommendation winning a $100 gift card to the store at <a href=\"http://patmcafeeshow.com/\">patmcafeeshow.com</a>. We hope everyone had a very Merry Christmas. It’s good to be back. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
