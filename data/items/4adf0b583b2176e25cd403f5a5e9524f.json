  "title": "Cutting edge: Impact of execution behaviour on valuation of optional financial contracts",
  "description": "Expected payoff maximisation is a commonly assumed strategy in valuation. S Hossein Hosseini, Qiaoyan Bian, Jay Chen and John Jiang suggest that execution strategies may vary due to complex option structures and their resulting uncertainties. Using a swing option as an example, they illustrate that expected payoff maximisation might lead to higher risk and conclude that the impact of execution strategies should be studied further",
