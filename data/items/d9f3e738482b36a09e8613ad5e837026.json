Kate Andrews is joined by a panel of three guests to discuss this and more: <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Duncan Baker, Conservative MP for North Norfolk.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Giles Gibbons, founder and CEO, Good Business.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Beth Hart, Vice President Supply Chain and Brand Trust at McDonald’s.</div>\n<div>\n<br>\nThis podcast is sponsored by McDonald’s.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
