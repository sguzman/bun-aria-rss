    "media:description": "While we learned in the last video how to describe spaces with vectors, it can be helpful to be able to describe spaces with just a few vectors.  In this video, we explore how to do this.  This leads us to consider the important ideas of linear combinations and spans.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
