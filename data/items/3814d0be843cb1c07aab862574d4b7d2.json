    "media:description": "Everyone has different tastes and preferences, however, one thing that the entire world seems to universally agree upon, is that Nickelback is the worst band of all time. But why? What's the actual reason for it? How did they manage to become more hated than Creed, Insane Clown Posse, and Limp Bizkit all put together? Are they bland and completely unoriginal? Does it have something to do with the frontman Chad Kroeger's behaviour?\n\nThis video will explore -  How Nickelback Became The Most Hated Band Ever.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§\n\nAlso, the idea for this video was partially inspired by \"Grunge\" who posted a video on a similar topic in February 2018 titled \"How Nickelback Became The Most Hated Band In History\" You can watch their version here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsj9uRojIfw&t=309s",
