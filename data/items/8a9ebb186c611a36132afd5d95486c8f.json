  "description": "The UK chose to respond to a global pandemic by reducing the amount of money given in foreign aid. Yet COVID-19 is attacking every country in the world. So is climate change. And there will be other viruses to come. For example, Ebola is reported to be out of control in West Africa right now. It is not as infectious as COVID-19, but its fatality rate is way higher (maybe as much as 50 percent). So, how does the west protect the developing world, and itself, through mass vaccinations. Can it fund the vaccines with money it creates. Could we adopt an approach where the pound, the dollar and the Euro fund local production facilities in developing nations, just as the Chinese Yuan is funding belt and road initiatives in many countries. Never before has there been a need for such global cooperation, but how do we fund it?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
