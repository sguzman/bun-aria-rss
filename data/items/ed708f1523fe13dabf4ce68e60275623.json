  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe List came over to argue with me about music. For real Joe is top 3 or 4 comics into music. He’s got great taste and he loves going to live shows even more than I do. And I really really love going to live shows. He does it sober all the time which is crazy to me, but that goes to show you how much he likes music. Legit though, all we really disagree on is whether Pearl Jam and Nirvana are great or just really good. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intro is a manic recounting of the last two concerts I went to. If you’re listening to this on Spotify or Apple Podcasts, put your phone on speaker and don’t look at it again till the music is done. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow Joe:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/joelistcomedy/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/JoeListComedy\">Twitter</a></span></p> <p><a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tuesdays-with-stories/id705474769\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesdays With Stories</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/tuesdays\">Tuesdays With Stories on Patreon</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more Ari: </span></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/ShaffirYT\">YouTube</a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/arishaffir\">Patreon</a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/arimerch\">Merch</a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/arishaffir/\">Instagram</a> </span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.arishaffir.com/\">Website</a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"http://www.arishaffir.com/tour/\">Upcoming Shows</a> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">01/21 | Phoenix</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">02/11 | Tampa </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">02/17 | Denver </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">02/27 | Vancouver</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">03/06 | Salt Lake City </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Music:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearl Jam - Last Kiss</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nirvana - Lake of Fire</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Mellencamp - Pink Houses</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billy Idol - White Wedding</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LCD Soundsystem - Dance Yourself Clean</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to our sponsors!
