  "description": "<p>Gold brought people to Ararat, but what it would be known for is its asylums. The Aradale Asylum would be home for the mentally ill for over a century and would feature conditions and treatments similar to other asylums around the world, most of which were not good. This misunderstanding and mistreatment of the mentally ill lends itself to the negative energy that sometimes feeds paranormal activity. The fact that the criminally insane were kept in J Ward only heightens that energy. Join me as I explore the history and hauntings of the Aradale Asylum! The Moment in Oddity features Moonshiners using cow shoes to hide footprints and This Month in History features the first photo of an American President.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/02/ep-292-aradale-asylum-in-australia.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/02/ep-292-aradale-asylum-in-australia.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Eulogies by Mort music is Long Time Gone by 5 Alarm Music on Drones & Beyond album.</p> <p>Lurking Shadow by 5Alarm Music on Danger & Drama - Disc 2 album<br /> Australia Didgerie Doo by 5Alarm Music on Ethnic Impressions album.</p>",
