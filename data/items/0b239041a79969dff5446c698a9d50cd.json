  "description": "<p>We're a day earlier than usual with this week's first episode, but I like to get interviews out quickly because of the possibility they'll be overtaken by events.</p><p>As promised, I'm joined by John Carl Baker, a senior program officer at the Ploughshares Fund who works on North Korea, to discuss last week's failed US-DPRK summit in Hanoi. John walks us through the history of US-North Korea diplomacy back to the Clinton administration, offers his thoughts on the positives and negatives of the Trump approach toward North Korea, and suggests a better way forward that centers inter-Korean engagement and lets Koreans take the lead for a change. Enjoy!</p><p>John's recent <em>Defense One</em> piece with Ploughshares President Joe Cirincione, on Democrats' response to Trump's North Korea diplomacy, is <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/02/trump-kim-summit-diplomacy-democrats-should-drop-politics-and-support-it/155102/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
