Why so many of us feel like machines instead of humans – and the power of imagination as a spiritual practice to reconnect with our humanity and divinity.\n3. Why grind culture – a collaboration of capitalism and white supremacy – wants to keep us exhausted, and how we can resist a culture of overwhelming busy-ness.  \n4. Why everything changes when we embrace ease as our birthright. \n5. Creative ways to reimagine rest within our hectic daily lives. \n\nAbout Tricia\nTricia Hersey is a Chicago native who has called Georgia home for the last 12 years.
