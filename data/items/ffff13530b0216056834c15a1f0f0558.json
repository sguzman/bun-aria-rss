On this week's episode of _The Vergecast_, Nilay, Natt, Casey, and Paul discuss how we're financially beholden to Big Car, and what to do about it now that Elon Musk has called us out on our bias.\n\nWe also got a chance to discuss Nilay's insane theory about Apple's dongle suppression campaign, Mark Zuckerberg's wacky trip to the EU, and spoke with unearned confidence about Dieter's hands-on with the Red Hydrogen One. Paul's weekly report on robots that do backflips is, of course, also something that happened.\n\n01:50 - Elon Musk\n\n27:54 - Red Hydrogen One hands-on\n\n32:34 - RIP Essential?\n\n36:37 - BlackBerry KEY2\n\n41:19 - Dongle suppression EXPOSED\n\n47:15 - Paul’s weekly segment “Robot backflip weekly update”\n\n51:08 - GDPR is happening\n\n55:54 - Mark Zuckerberg in the EU\n\n1:03:51 - Casey shamelessly plugs Converge\n\n1:06:35 - What’s happening in the rest of tech\nLearn more about your ad choices.
