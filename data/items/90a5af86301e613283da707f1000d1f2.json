Cape Cod was both of our highs of the week - Grace came for a week and Becca came for the weekend. So nice to get a little sunshine and relaxation!</p> <p>Join us on August 22nd for our next Book Club to discuss <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M6hRWg\">Circe</a> by Madeline Miller. And we will be putting out a call on Instagram for questions for our next advice episode!</p> <p><strong>Can't get enough Bad On Paper?</strong></p> <p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/yapod\">FB group</a> for amazing book recs & more</p> <p>Follow us on Instagram <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/badonpaperpodcast\">@badonpaperpodcast</a></p>",
