  "description": "Erin McCarthy, who teaches digital humanities at Newcastle University, Australia, has just published a fabulous new book about the ways in which the printing of poetry impacted upon the reading and imagination of poetry in early modern England. Doubtful Readers: Print, Poetry and the Reading Public in Early Modern England (Oxford UP, 2020) offers readings of work by Shakespeare, Lanyer, Donne and many other poets to show that early printings of their work organised their texts in order to make specific points about both poetry and poets. Why do most anthologies of work by Donne begin with “The Flea”? Tune in to find out more about how poetry was transformed in and sometimes by the move to print.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of Survival and Resistance in evangelical America: Christian Reconstruction in the Pacific Northwest (Oxford UP, 2021).\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
