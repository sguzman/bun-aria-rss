  "title": "292 - Jeffrey Epstein Suicide Conspiracies: Part 1 of 2",
  "description": "<p>We know that Jeffrey Epstein was born on January 20th, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York City. We also know he died on August 10th, 2019 (or late the evening of the 9th) in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. But what do we know about the sixty-six years in-between? We don't know as much as Epstein as we do many of our previous biographical subjects - he was a pretty mysterious guy - but we do know quite a bit. We know he managed the multi-billion dollar fortune of Lex Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands - a retail conglomerate that owns Bath and Body Works, Abercrombie & Fitch, Victoria's Secret, and more. We know he flew around Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and many other celebrities and politicians on a plane dubbed the Lolita Express, and they hung out with many people of note at his private island in the US Virgin Islands, an island dubbed \"pedophile island.\" He sexually assaulted women and girls there, at his massive Manhattan private residence, at his giant New Mexico ranch compound, in his Palm Beach Florida mansion, and elsewhere. In this first of a two-part episode, we examine his life as best we can, so we can best understand the conspiracies that sprung up in the wake of his very suspicious death. Who else was assaulting women and girls along with Epstein? How connected to the US government was this guy? We look into these questions and so much more today. </p><p><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  This month our donation will be going to Lifting Hands International whose mission statement is “We provide aid to refugees both at home and abroad.
