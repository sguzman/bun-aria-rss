  "description": "“Someday, some-time, when I am a man, I want to be worth a hundred thousand dollars!”\nThis is the story of two of the United States’ most wealthy industrialists.\nJohn D. Rockefeller is the son of a con artist; he teaches young John never to trust and leaves the boy wondering if food will or won’t be on the table. John will rise from his world of uncertainty to dominate the emerging oil scene.\nThe son of a Scottish weaver, Andrew Carnegie comes from absolutely nothing. But Pennsylvania Railroad exec Tom Scott sees promise in the lad. Tom’s mentoring will help Andy emerge as the king of the steel industry.\nBoth men overcome the impossible. But are they inspiring Titans of industry? Or monopolistic robber barons? The beneficiaries of their philanthropy see the former, while workers might see the latter—particularly those at a steel mill in Homestead, Pennsylvania.\n___\n\n4 Ways to dive deeper into History That Doesn’t Suck\n\nJoin our growing facebook community\n\n\nGet our weekly newsletter, The Revolution\n\nBecome part of the HTDS Patreon family\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Greg’s monthly newsletter, Connected History\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
