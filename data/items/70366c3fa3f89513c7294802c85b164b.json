  "description": "<p>Another day of Tokyo 2020 is done and another episode of your favourite Olympics podcast is here to go over everything that happened! How amazed are we that Norway apparently are as fast off snow as they are on it? How amazing was sport climbing to finally watch? How frustrated are both Canada and Australia for double fourth places in the cycling? Is Canada still celebrating over the soccer from yesterday? Is Australia still celebrating over the hockey today? How wild are we feeling about Harry and the boxing? And just how many chairs will be thrown during our always heated athlete of the day segment? Climb yourself up as fast as a Norwegian to listen to another epic day of Olympic recap action!</p>",
