With all this vocal fry talk, we start talking about the family that made it popular, the Kardashians, and how insane of transformation Kylie Jenner has had over the years. That leads us to discussing the Travis Scott fiasco as Astro World. Tom then talks about going to sporting events with his dad, Top Dog, who has a real problem with parking/traffic anxiety. We open on a grandpa who gives an update on his brown situation, and we get another sneak peak at the primo googling skills Nadav has to offer as well as an update on airport codes! The mommies discuss how miserable Thanksgiving can be and give tips on the little things you can to make it slightly more bearable. We see the newest British rendition of our favorite garage worker and wonder what kind of revenge you can participate in legally. Eye for an eye? We then unveil a new FedSmoker video (to us) where he seems to be falling head over heels for lady he met at the district attorney's office of a town he's passing through. How would you react if FedSmoker started making a pass at you? We talk about Top Dog saying words wrong for almost no reason, like concierge, Joe Pesci, and Washington. We watch some cool clips of the guy with the pet liger and an old lady who claims to not have a stinky meow. Christina makes the claim that if Tom was single he'd be a \"weird alone guy.\" The Apple store has one of the absolute worst in-store experiences of any company in the world, we see a cool guy withstanding quite a bit of horsepower, and we wrap with Christina's TikTok curations! Happy Thanksgiving and make sure you give thanks to those you're thankful for and try not to eat too much but also make sure you eat enough. Okay have a great week!</p>\n",
