  "description": "<p>Saying “Yes” - Meeting Your Edge and Softening (2018-07-25) - Our habitual ways of avoiding unpleasant experience keep us from intimacy with our inner life and with each other. This talk helps us recognize these often unconscious patterns that keep us identified with a separate, threatened self, and offers guidance in saying “yes” to the life we encounter. As we release resistance, we discover the creativity, wisdom and love that express our unbound, true, nature.</p> <p>Listen to accompanying meditation: <a title= \"Meditation: Saying \"Yes\" to Life\" href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/meditation-saying-yes-life-2/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saying \"Yes\" to Life</a></p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
