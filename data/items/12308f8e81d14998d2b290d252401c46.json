  "description": "<p>Chef Nikki Steward is one of the most famous and talented of chefs who cook and bake with cannabis. She describes her brand &ldquo;The High End Affair&rdquo; as a traveling &ldquo;infused culinary experience\" and has curated large dinner parties for Snoop Dog, Dave Chapelle, DJ Khaled and many other celebrities. I&rsquo;m an eager consumer but an inexperienced chef so I peppered her with questions: Is there something different about cooking for people who are high on cannabis and how does she standardize dosing? What about cooking for people who use cannabis as a medicine? Have old school techniques of cooking with cannabis become obsolete with high potency extracts and does she use all parts of the cannabis plant? How does she keep from getting too high when she&rsquo;s tasting as she cooks? And how does she deal with the challenge of people &ldquo;overdosing&rdquo; at a dinner?</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
