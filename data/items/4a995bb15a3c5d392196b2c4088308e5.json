  "description": "<div>With the winter approaching, and the threat of lockdowns looming, I decided to <span class=\"il\">leave</span> the country to do some exploring. Ari Shaffir loves to travel. And what a better time than now. It's scary to do, but once I made the decision it became a lot easier. This episode of My 2020 Year In Review podcast breaks down why I decided to hit the road, how I chose where I would go, and what things are like where I went. My first week was scary, just like every time I travel. But then I settled in and figured out all the best places to get food poisoning, how to properly wrap up pooped-on toilet paper for the garbage since you're not allowed to flush it here, and the process of finding weed. This runs all the way through December 31 and the most unique New Year's celebration I've ever taken part in.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Please sign up for <em><a href= \"patreon.com/arishaffir\">my patreon</a>!</em> Bonus content all the time. Plus access to exclusive merch. And early access to some of the podcasts.

At $3 meals you won't believe how much food they give you for $3. A soup, main course with side and tiny salad, sensible sized desert, and a big fresh fruit juice. It's nuts. You expect it to be like $15-$20 but then when you ask for la cuenta and they hit you with that $6 para dos people you're like, \"whaaaaaaaat?\" And they're available all over the country. Pretty much any time you get a lunch by the side of the road, that's what you're getting. I love it here. </div> <div> </div> <div>And our other sponsor, Terrible Internet. With terrible internet, it becomes nearly impossible to plan podcasts. Terrible internet is available all over this country. You don't even have to seek it out. It'll find you. And remember, when your AirBnB host says the internet is \"really good.\" they mean it's really good in relation to the rest of the country, which means it's terrible. And if you get terrible internet, make sure to use promo code: \"bang on the desk in anger till your hand breaks every time you lose the signal in the middle of a damn 6th and Jump podcast\" for nothing off your order.
