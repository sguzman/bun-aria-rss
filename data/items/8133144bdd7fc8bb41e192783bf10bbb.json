  "title": "PMS 2.0 283 - Week 8 NFL Preview, Johnny Hekker, Hue Jackson, Bubba Watson, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Thursday Night Football game, and look ahead to the week 8 slate and wonder which games will potentially be swayed by the weather as Tropical Storm Zeta moves through the United States. Joining the show is the reigning NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, 4x Pro Bowler, 6x All-Pro, friend of the program and The Brand, LA Rams P Johnny Hekker. Pat and Johnny chat about his unreal game against the Bears, the banana ball he's been kicking, if he's currently trying any other type of ball, how long he thinks he'll player, and much more (20:58-36:25). Next, former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders and the Cleveland Browns, Hue Jackson joins Pat and AJ Hawk to discuss what it's like being in the AFC North ahead of this weekend's tilt between the Ravens and Steelers, his thoughts on Baker Mayfield not being able to beat the good team's, how the tequila business is going, and more (41:13-1:08:05). Later, 2x Masters Champion and 14x PGA Winner, Bubba Watson joins the show. Pat and Bubba chat about what it's like winning the Masters, teaching himself how to swing a golf club, his battles with anxiety and what he did to get out of that funk, if he still has the hover golf cart, and if golf was always his first choice (1:11:15-1:34:43). Plus Pat and AJ give their picks on the Sunday slate.\n",
