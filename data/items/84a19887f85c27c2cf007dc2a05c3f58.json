We’ve been led to believe that getting older goes hand-in-hand with persistent aches and pains, hearing loss, and cognitive decline.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Aging is a biological process, but it doesn’t have to be so dire. In fact, what if you could become stronger, healthier, and more vibrant with each passing year? For over 20 years, Dave Asprey, the father of biohacking, has been on a mission to test and redefine widely held beliefs about human biology. His personal goal is to live to age 180, and he believes that you too can make smarter, science-backed choices to live a longer, healthier life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>In his new book, <em>Super Human</em>, Dave outlines the Seven Pillars of Aging and the four major killers in our modern world. His work consists of the most cutting edge, game-changing, and scientifically proven insights that you can use to age backward, support your biology, and increase your lifespan.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Today you’re going to learn about your ability to ensure a long and healthy life through making simple, logical decisions.
