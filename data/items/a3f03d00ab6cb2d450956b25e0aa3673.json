  "description": "<p>Dr. Sweat reminds us why we should reconsider if we teach that Lucifer wanted to save everyone. Hank, John, and Dr. Sweat continue to teach how the Lord's Atonement and His confidence in us can sustain us in the Last Days (which are now!). This episode reminds us we don't need to fear the Last Days due to the protection of His Spirit, our covenants, and God's grace. This is an episode that will help every teacher, parent, and member remember why they love their membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and why they love the Savior.</p>",
