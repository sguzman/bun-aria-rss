  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the other Roadhawks come to you live from a hotel in Baltimore on their trek to Met Life Stadium for Wrestlemania. They discuss the road trip so far, discussing the content Pat has made for the WWE and their time in Hershey, PA for a WWE live event, to Washington D.C. where they got an exclusive tour of the capitol from sitting US Representative from Ohio's 16th congressional district and Pat's former Colts teammate, Anthony Gonzalez, to winding up at a mansion outside of Washington D.C. for dinner. They also cover Foxy's rough week so far, the NCAA tournament and whether or not Coach K blew his utilization of Zion down the stretch against Michigan St. and Pat's budding fan hood for Purdue basketball. Pat and the Roadhawks also discuss how they're out on April Fools Day and the many pranks he was involved in while at training camp, they send their thoughts and prayers out to Nipsey Hussle and his family after his tragic passing, and look ahead at the rest of the trip that still includes stops in Philadelphia, New York City, and New Jersey. Also included is a road interview with WWE superstar and Pat's former Colts teammate, Baron Corbin, who joined the Roadhawks on their trip from Hershey to Washington D.C. (1:20:24-1:38:12). It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
