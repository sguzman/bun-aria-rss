  "description": "<p>We have six rounds today to help carry you into an awesome weekend.\n\n-Visit GetRoman.com/Zero for a huge discount on Roman Swipes-\n\nROUND 1: A Court Ruled Against a Soldier Who Says He Was Forced to Retire Due to Religious Beliefs, but we must ask… Is being an asshole really a religion?\n\nROUND 2: A pair of explosions, the second much bigger than the first, struck the city of Beirut early Tuesday evening, killing at least 100 people, wounding more than 4,000 and causing widespread damage. We’ll go over the who, what, when, where & why. \n\nROUND 3: U up? “Well they can’t see you - get down! Booty calls on hold, for the love of God!” That’s the message to troops in Japan right now as COVID puts a damper on sweet, sweet lovin’ out there. \n\nROUND 4: Cue the eyerolls from Kate - because someone has finally made edible crayons specifically for Marines to eat. \n\nRound 5: Novelist Brad Thor joins the show to talk about his weird brain, war games, and how he keeps the ideas fresh and realistic. \n\nROUND 6: A sailor terribly harassed for years after being labelled a Blue Falcon has finally been exonerated after the Navy corrected a story. Long overdue!!!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
