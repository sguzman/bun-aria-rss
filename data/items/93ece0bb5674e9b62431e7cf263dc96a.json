  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, WMAL radio host Larry O’Connor fills in for Mark. The Democrats, media, and their partners in pop culture have made a shift in their view of the pandemic.

The leftist elites were happy to impose draconian rules on you while they enjoyed private maskless dinners. Now that their own people are rejecting the restrictions of the Democrat Medical Complex, their partners in the Democrat Media Complex are spreading their new softened message.

Tactics like encouraging children to turn in their parents if they violate covid protocols or chastise them for having white privilege.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
