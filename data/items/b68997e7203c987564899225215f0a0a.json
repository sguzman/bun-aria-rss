  "description": "<p>Hold on to your bonnets, Holy Posters. Phil is joined by Kaitlyn Schiess and, while Skye’s away, guest host Mike Erre to talk about the scandals and misogyny plaguing evangelicalism. Phil wonders—are these bugs or features? And is it possible to love evangelicals but hate evangelicalism? Kaitlyn and Mike also explain what keeps them committed to Jesus and his church amid so much mess. Then, Skye talks to Baylor University history professor Beth Allison Barr about her new book, “The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth.” Barr explains why Paul’s writings about women are widely misread, how women have led throughout church history, and how the Reformation created the domesticated vision of womanhood still idealized by the church today. All of that, plus science can’t explain a sea worm’s perplexing number of posteriors.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/marine-worm-sprouts-hundreds-butts-180977715/\"> https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/marine-worm-sprouts-hundreds-butts-180977715/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://twitter.com/albertmohler/status/1391499883153080324\">https://twitter.com/albertmohler/status/1391499883153080324</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://twitter.com/ostrachan/status/1391831083826696193\">https://twitter.com/ostrachan/status/1391831083826696193</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/love-the-evangelical-hate-the-evangelicalism/id1523542249?i=1000521265414\"> https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/love-the-evangelical-hate-the-evangelicalism/id1523542249?i=1000521265414</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Making-Biblical-Womanhood-Subjugation-Became/dp/1587434709/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Beth+Allison+barr&qid=1621441692&sr=8-2\"> https://www.amazon.com/Making-Biblical-Womanhood-Subjugation-Became/dp/1587434709/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Beth+Allison+barr&qid=1621441692&sr=8-2</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/51444763\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/51444763</a></p>",
