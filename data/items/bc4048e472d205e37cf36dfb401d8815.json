She details her childhood in the entertainment industry, growing up around abuse and addiction, and how focusing on the mind-body connection serves as a grounding tool from those stressors. Alyson opens up about her experiences with using disordered eating as a coping mechanism, being disowned by her faith community for her sexuality, and her alexithymia diagnosis. She considers the therapeutic benefits she receives from dance, physical symptoms of being disconnected from one’s body, and the importance of implementing full body awareness into therapy.
