  "description": "<p><!-- wp:html --><!-- /wp:html --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>In a recent talk, Bishop Barron presented on the importance of not dumbing down the faith as we engage in religious education. Young people enjoy asking about and discussing the big questions, from God’s existence, to how to be a good and moral person, to the problem of suffering. A disconnect takes place when we meet these intellectual questions with watered-down catechesis. Instead, we must remember the central teachings of Christianity. We must present the fullness of truth, the reality of the Incarnation, and the good news of grace.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> <em>Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
