  "description": "<p>To truly understand Italian wine, you have to understand its integral ties to Italian culture. In Italy, food and wine tell the story of a region’s cultural identity, history, and the character of its people. With my recent seminars on Sicilia (<a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6FXGlju1DczRaZleFC3XNA\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on YouTube if you missed them</a>), and an impending trip to Piedmont with a group of Wine for Normal People listeners, the interplay of Italian wine, food, and culture has been top of mind. It was in this context that I invited the famed New York restaurateur, and Italian cultural advocate, <a href= \"http://www.ilgattopardonyc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Gianfranco Sorrentino</a>, on the show.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ilgattopardonyc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/2020-09-13_Gruppo_Headshots_Gianfrancopsd-292x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"247\" /></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Gianfranco is originally from Naples in southern Italy and after many years of managing restaurants all over Europe and Asia, he settled in New York.
