  "description": "Brandon Lawson. August 9, 2013. Bronte, Texas. A 26 year-old man leaves his house late at night after an argument with his common-law wife. He had planned to drive to his dad's house to stay elsewhere for the night and cool off. His truck would run out of gas and he would make a number of calls. He called his wife but her phone was charging in her car. He called his brother who drove out to help him. He also called 911. When his brother and a sheriff's deputy arrived, the truck was empty and Brandon was nowhere to be found. Hauntingly, the 911 call seems to indicate that his life was in danger. Was he running from someone? Or did something else happen to Brandon Lawson? http://www.missingbrandonlawson.com/p/case-questions.html\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
