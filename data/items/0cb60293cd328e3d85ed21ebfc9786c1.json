  "description": "<p>EPISODE 37 - LAURA METCALFE - DI Producer/Finishing Producer</p> <p>Team Deakins looks into the final step of making a movie or the DI, with DI Producer/ Finishing Producer, Laura Metcalfe (1917, WONDER WOMAN, TOMB RAIDER). While previously called the “DI Producer” since when it started it was all about the DI (“Digital Intermediate”), because the process has become so complex, you’ll hear the role referred to as “Finishing Producer”. We speak with Laura Metcalfe of Company 3 in London who worked with us on “1917”. We talk about when this role actually starts on a movie (much earlier than you might think!) and talk at length about setting up workflows that continue until the film finishes. We also go into detail with Laura about the very bespoke workflow on “1917” and the challenges it presented. We also walk through some of the deliverables of a film (the different formats that are made), how the dailies timing differs from the DI timing and the steps to setting up a DI. And, of course, much more! A very detailed look at post!</p>",
