  "description": "<p>We sit down with the CEO founders of two of the most capital efficient success stories of all time — Zoom and Veeva Systems — to understand how they grew to billions of dollars in revenue (and tens of billions in market cap) on very, very little capital invested. With the fundraising environment changing rapidly, we couldn’t think of a better topic to discuss or better sources of wisdom for founders, operators and investors all to learn from. Very special thanks to Jake Saper and our friends at Emergence Capital for inviting us and putting this conversation together at their 2022 CEO Summit!<br /> <br /></p> <p>This episode has video! You can watch it on Spotify (right in the main podcast interface) or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AcquiredFM\">on YouTube</a>.<br /> <br /></p> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@peter.gassner\">Peter’s great Medium blog</a><br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thanks to the Solana Foundation for being our presenting sponsor for this special episode.
