  "description": "<p>USModernist Radio goes to Palm Springs each February for the incredibly popular Modernism Week.  It’s a fascinating array of sunshine, architecture, lectures, parties, tours, exhibits, and you can even order martinis for breakfast. Yes, you can do that anywhere but you'll feel glamorous in Palm Springs. USModernist Radio's <strong>George Smart</strong> was there with keynote speakers and other special guests who make Modernism Week a blast.</p> <p><strong>Cory Buckner</strong> is an architect, artist, and author from LA.  She is one of the world's experts on <strong>A. Quincy Jones</strong> Modernist houses loved by celebrities such as <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> and <strong>Ellen Degeneres</strong>.  Los Angeles Magazine named Cory as one of Six Women who Changed The Face of LA Architecture and her architecture firm specializes in Modernist design. She was the force behind preserving Crestwood Hills in LA, a neighborhood full of Modernist houses that by now would likely have been extinct if not for her efforts. </p> <p>Producer <strong>Leo Zahn</strong> premiered \"Sinatra in Palm Springs – The Place He Called Home\" at Modernism Week, exploring <strong>Frank Sinatra’s</strong> primary home for almost 50 years. From his houses to where he ate to where he entertained, the film features interviews with <strong>Barbara Sinatra, Mel Haber, Tom Dreesen, Nelda Linsk, Bruce Fessier, Trini Lopez, Michael Fletcher</strong>, and others who knew and lived and played with Frank Sinatra.  After completing USC Film School, Zahn studied architecture and design in Europe. Over the course of his 30 year career in advertising he directed and photographed more than 600 commercials.</p>",
