  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino of NRATV fills in for Mark. Republicans finally got a big win with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The swampy GOP finally stepped up and did what we elected them to do despite a united effort by Democrats, the media, and activists throwing everything they had at Kavanaugh. The left blew a golden opportunity to convert Kavanaugh over time by doing the most despicable thing possible and calling him a gang rapist. Also, Devin Nunes dropped a bombshell Spygate update over the weekend, revealing that the FBI under the direction of James Comey made no effort to handle it by the book. Comey and other FBI officials broke their own rules for verifying information and allowed Democrats to shuttle fake info right into the FBI without going through proper channels.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
