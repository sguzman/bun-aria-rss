  "description": "In 1960, three Chicago women set off on a week-day getaway to a nearby lodge. After spending their first afternoon enjoying some lunch, they left for a stroll through the snowy park nearby- and they never returned. When a blizzard hit the following night and none of the staff realized the women were missing, the investigation started late- and potential evidence was lost from the new blankets of snow in the area. But one piece of evidence left at the scene would help put the pieces together. These are the murders of Lillian Oetting, Frances Murphy, and Mildred Linquist. Also known, as the Starved Rock Murders.\n\nPATREON BONUS EPISODES: patreon.com/goingwestpodcast\n\nCASE SOURCES:\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-08-25-9103030676-story.html\n\nhttps://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/chester-weger-convicted-of-1960-starved-rock-murders-granted-parole/article_5b103509-9505-56f2-a593-e791373e0ba9.html\n\nhttps://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/11/21/20974071/man-who-confessed-starved-rock-killings-paroled-after-nearly-six-decades-in-prison\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-chester-weger-starved-rock-killer-parole-20200221-njirg2g4pngcncp4wt7r76pi3e-story.html\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-viz-chester-weger-starved-rock-murders-htmlstory.html\n\nhttps://www.americanhauntingsink.com/the-starved-rock-murders\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40910100/lillian-isabelle-oetting\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80164560/frances-murphy\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40910035/mildred-monika_emma-lindquist Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
