  "description": "<div>My guest in this week's Book Club podcast is Lindsey Fitzharris – whose new book is <em>The Facemaker: One Surgeon's Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I</em>. At its centre is the compelling figure of Harold Gillies – ace golfer, practical joker, and pioneer of the whole field of plastic surgery. Lindsey tells me about the extraordinary advances he made and the will and skill that drove them; and the poignant story of how victims of facial disfigurement were the invisible casualties of the conflict.  </div>\n",
