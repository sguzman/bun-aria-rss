  "description": "<p>We’ve seen that when Jonah was called to preach in the great city of Nineveh, he refused and fled from God. God sent a storm to reclaim him, and he was thrown over the side of the boat into the ocean. There, he was swallowed by a great fish. Then in the belly of the deep, Jonah prays a prayer of faith, and he grasps the grace of God.</p>\n<p>We’re going to look, not so much at the subject or topic of the prayer, but the phenomenon of the prayer itself. How did Jonah, who was in this condition of utter despair, of cowering fear, and of rebellion… How did he come from that position to a posture of triumphant faith by the end of the prayer?</p>\n<p>The answer is that faith rose up, and it brought with it Jonah’s heart. We’ll see his faith that he exercised was done in three stages. First, he calls, then he remembers, and finally he commits.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 19, 1990. Series: Jonah. Scripture: Jonah 2:1-10.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
