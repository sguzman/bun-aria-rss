  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I have found the next school board that I will be visiting, but I’m not going alone this time. I’ll tell you all about that today. Also, the recall of Governor Newsom in California fails miserably. What can we as conservatives learn from that, if anything? Plus, I have a few thoughts on the tragic death of Norm Macdonald. And what about the story of General Milley going directly to the Chinese government to circumvent Trump? Isn’t that treason? Finally, in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with this question: is it white supremacy to tell kids in school to be quiet and behave? One teacher thinks so. We’ll talk about that today and much more on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
