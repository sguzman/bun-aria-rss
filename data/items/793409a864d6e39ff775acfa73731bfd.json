  "title": "Charles Eisenstein: A More Beautiful World Is Possible",
  "description": "<p>What will come to define the human race for future generations? Philosopher, teacher and writer Charles Eisenstein provides insight into what could await us in the future, and discusses how cynicism, self-delusion and separation help to create our troubled world. In his book <em>The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible, </em>Charles explains why he believes the one way to resolve conflict is when opponents make an effort to understand one another on a human level, become less judgmental and then begin to find common ground. Charles says, \"It's basically anything that says that, ‘Yeah, we're connected. Your well-being will bring my well-being. More for you is more for me. We're not really separate.’\" Charles also talks about the themes of civilization, human cultural evolution and being aware of one's own existence.</p>\n",
