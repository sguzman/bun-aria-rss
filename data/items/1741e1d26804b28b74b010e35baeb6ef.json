  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, The Democrats and the media want a one-party country. They don’t care about the children on the border. If they cared about the children they would’ve addressed this when Barack Obama was separating children from parents. Have you ever heard of a major political party that does not believe in securing the nation’s borders because it wants to continue to empower the party? The solution for this issue is, secure the southern border, put them on a bus and send them back home. But the media is stoking the fire, making the most outrageous statements. The media claims that they are advancing freedom of the press to promote an ideology and when the president attacks them by name, they claim he's attacking free speech. We don't need lectures from the lawless open-borders crowd on what kind of democracy we've become. Later, Dan Stein President of the Federation for American Immigration Reform calls the show to break down the facts behind the media's distortion of what's really going on at the border. Then, Rep Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee calls in to discuss today's senate hearings on the Inspector General’s report into Hillary's Clinton's email scandal. He says there’s no question that there is classified info in Comey memo and hat more evidence must exist at the DOJ. Nunes speculated that there was an abuse of power by the FBI and potentially a conspiracy and that a special counsel or a US Attorney from another District should investigate this now. Adding that it’s frustrating that Robert Mueller didn't start his collusion probe with the felony leak of a conversation between incoming National Security Advisor Gen. and the Russian Ambassador. Very few people knew about this call, so this would've caused the FBI to investigate themselves.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
