  "description": "This week, the gals open the casket and investigate some eerie slayings. Topics include the identity politics of real-life vampires, a French bloodsucker hiding in plain sight, and a human trafficker who was really bad at covering his tracks. Drip some Vampire Vineyards Dracula Merlot onto your lips, tuck into that rare steak, and tune in for Vampire Serial Killers.",
