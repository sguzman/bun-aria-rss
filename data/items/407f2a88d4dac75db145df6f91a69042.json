This, she explains, stems from US demoralization efforts:\n“During the Iraq War, we were able to build a movement that got hundreds of thousands of people out into the street. The problem is, that did not change Bush’s decision to invade Iraq, and so many people were demoralized. It made people question putting their energies in front of this war machine.”\nBut Benjamin urges us not to give up hope.\n“We have to recognize that it is our absolute responsibility right now. And I do feel as I travel around the country that there are many people recognizing the need to go in front of the offices of their representatives and protest, to educate their friends and families, I think we are in the midst of building up again.”\nAnd, importantly, we need to “keep the pressure up on the Biden administration.”\nTo educate yourself, your friends, and family, Medea Benjamin’s book and short video are great learning tools. And follow Code Pink to support their activism and their coalition Peace in Ukraine.\nPlus, this week we announced two new features:\n\nThursday Throwdowns: Our new mini-episodes premiering each Thursday to get your exclusive dose of midweek media madness. This week, we watched the Tapper/Biden interview.\n\nThe Absurd Arena: The Useful Idiots discussion board for people who think you can talk back to a podcast.
