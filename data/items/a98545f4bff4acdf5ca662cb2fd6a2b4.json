  "description": "<p>Mammals: you’re one. Your dog is one. So are giant rats. What do we have in common? Nipples. The incredible Southern Illinois University professor, researcher, science communicator and mammalogist Dr. Danielle N. Lee joins to chat about everything from nature’s parenting styles to hairy bellies, milk glands, nip counts, how a meteor paved the way for our existence, her favorite mammals and the mysteries of the platypus. An episode years in the making, Alie barely keeps her cool as Dr. Lee gives insight and perspective on what it means to be a human and a mammal. Also, we chat about Black Mammalogists week Sept. 13-19 and the important pivots that changed her career path. </p>\n<p>Follow Dr. Danielle N.
