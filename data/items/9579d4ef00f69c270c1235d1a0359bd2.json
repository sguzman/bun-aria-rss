  "description": "<p>\"IT’S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT THE EXCHANGE OF ENERGY ON STAGE.”<br />\nSo many times we give up on our dreams because of deadlines we put on ourselves. There have been plenty of moments when I felt like things were taking too long or like I was getting too old. It’s those moments we need to look within and understand why we are doing it. Find our real purpose.<br />\nDo you want to be an author to hit the New York Times bestseller list or because you want to have people read your work? Is it because you want your message out there or so that you can make your profile bio look great? My feeling is that your purpose should always be to serve. Serving other people brings fulfillment to yourself. Reaping the material rewards is just a bonus.<br />\nRemember, you’re never too old. It’s never too late for your dreams to come true. Our guest today, Rachel Platten, didn’t reach her mega-success in music until she was 32 - when most people would have given up on their dreams. Rachel is an incredibly hard working person. She kept pushing and pursuing her dreams for over ten years before anyone noticed. She was doing small intimate gigs and performing for people in hospitals.<br />\nWhen her hit song Fight Song came out it wasn’t an instant success. She was devastated and lost in her definition of success.<br />\nShe was certain it would sell millions of records and hit the charts. After reaching an all-time emotional low, feeling her only chance passed her by, she began to reflect on herself.<br />\nThe reason she got into making music was because she loved it for herself and she loved the connection it gave her with people. She came to the conclusion that playing hospitals and small venues was enough for her to feel happy. After that revelation, it was only a few weeks later that her song became a hit. She let go of her ego and trusted in the process. Doesn't sound like coincidence to me.<br />\nDiscover all of Rachel's incredible story and much more, on Episode 572.<br />\nShow notes:<br />\nWhat’s the thing you’re most grateful for and inspired by this year? (7:05)<br />\nDid you always feel like you were looking for outside approval? (8:44)<br />\nHow did you stay dedicated to your dream for years before anything happened?
