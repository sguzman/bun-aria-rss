  "description": "<p>Discovering the Power of Prayer (2018-08-15) - We all know the pain of separation and have a longing for connection. When we silently listen to and contact the depth of that longing, we are at the root of transformational prayer. This talk looks at what prayer is, who/what we are praying to, the shadow side of prayer, and ways of cultivating our prayers so that they become authentic vehicles for spiritual awakening.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
