  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino fills in for Mark. It was not incidental or accidental that General Flynn was spied on when speaking with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. The question becomes why was the incoming National Security Advisor unmasked? It seems that Flynn was not unmasked on the date of said call because he wasn't 'masked' to begin with. No one requested to unmask a call on December 29th yet they were already eavesdropping on Flynn before the famous January 5th meeting. The FBI was ordered to listen in on these phone calls by President Barack Obama's Presidential daily briefing staff. The Democrats know that this spying occurred. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe plainly states in his book that the Presidential daily briefing group was involved. At the same time that Obama expelled Russian diplomats from Washington as a setup for the Ambassador to call Flynn as he vacationed in the Dominican Republic. Afterward, the case becomes crystal clear once the timeline is established and the ineptitude of the very same FBI leaders and lawyers is exposed. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
