  "description": "<p>Photographer of everything cool, Larry Chen,  and co-owner of 1552 Wheels, Matt Crooke, are here to talk about a charity project that we are stoked about! Partnering with TST, they went up to Malibu in the early morning to take photos of Matt's Countach in the charred landscape. The goal: Capture amazing photos, make amazing poster, sell poster, give all proceeds benefit the resident relief effort of Malibu. And it turned out even better than we imagined. We all had a poster of a Countach on our bedroom wall, and now you can too, with the knowledge that the money is going to help people whose houses were destroyed by the horrible fire the area suffered in 2018. </p><p> </p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman <br />IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman @larry_chen_foto @mattcrooke</p><p><br />WATCH AUTO FOCUS: https://www.hoonigan.com/blogs/shows/auto-focus</p><p>LARRY’s BEST PHOTO (PRINTS FOR SALE): https://www.larrychenphoto.com/</p><p>1552: https://fifteen52.com/</p><p>NEW SHIRTS!<br />https://www.blipshift.com/tst</p><p>This show is also a video: https://youtu.be/kzykthdGKpI</p>\n",
