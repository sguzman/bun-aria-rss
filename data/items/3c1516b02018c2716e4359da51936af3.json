  "description": "With boatloads of trouble at home and a Congress unlikely to actually do anything between now and the election, Donald Trump needs to come up with some way to distract from the Mueller investigation and his deepening legal woes.  Live Tweeting Fox & Friends is obviously not doing the trick nor is The Rudy Show.  So why not blow up the Iran deal, open an embassy in Jerusalem and negotiate a nuclear deal with a guy who blew up his uncle with an anti-aircraft gun as an alternative?  What could go wrong--after all Javanka can handle Israel and John Bolton and Mike Pompeo can do the rest?  Our panel of David Sanger, Daniel Benjamin and Rosa Brooks discuss...and then head for the silos to wait it out until Trump decides to go back to beauty contests or something safer.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
