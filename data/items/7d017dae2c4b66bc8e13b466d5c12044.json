  "description": "<p>Lex is an MIT AI scientist and a really interesting person. This is his second time on Joe and he's really getting good on the podcast. Hopefully He'll become a regular and I like what he has to offer to the conversation. He's very well thought out and has some funny shit to say too. Loved it!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
