  "description": "<p>Are there other yous living in other, parallel dimensions? Are there an infinite number of other yous? Where the Hell are they? Today we talk about multiverse theory and it is a fascinating brain-buster. We glance over the history of cosmology and look at some of the minds whose intelligent, relentless questioning and study advanced our understanding of the stars and our place in them time and time again, often at great personal cost. How much further could our understanding of the cosmos go? Will we ever be able to meet.... ourselves? I hope you enjoy the best my limited mind could do with this unlimited subject. Hail Nimrod! </p>\n<p><strong>New standup special and album,</strong> <strong>Get Outta Here; Devil! out on Amazon, AppleTV, cable-on-demand, Spotify, iTunes, Pandora, and more. </strong></p>\n<p>We've <strong>donated $5,400</strong> this month to <strong>Penfed</strong>!
