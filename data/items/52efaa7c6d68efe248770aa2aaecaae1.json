Also, the parents of the Oxford High School shooter are being charged with manslaughter. Is that the right move or does it set a dangerous precedent for the future? Or could both be true? Plus, Kamala Harris’s henpecked staffers go to increasingly awkward yet hilarious lengths to prove that they’re happy to work for her. And the New York Times says that hotels in New York should be turned into homeless encampments. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out. Finally in our daily cancellation, Rashida Tlaib makes a pitch for student loan forgiveness but I’ll explain why she is herself personally a perfect example of why there should not be student loan forgiveness. \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
