This programme is a game-changer for the carefully selected communities across the Asia Pacific.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among thousands and thousands of applicants, we selected 20 communities from six different countries to join this year&#8217;s Asia Pacific cohort. The most diverse communities joining this year&#8217;s programme engage through content sharing on hobbies and leisure, support, education, parenting, sustainability and climate, health and well-being, and economic impact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the four-month programme, selected participants will receive training from experts and coaches through a customised curriculum to help them organise and strengthen their community while connecting with community leaders from around the globe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants will also gain access to Meta tools and services to support them in their efforts to activate their members. Each participant will receive a grant of up to US$40,000 through grant management partner GlobalGiving to fund work that advances their community goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last few years, the community leaders on Meta are looking for support and guidance in how to grow their communities’ impact stronger than ever. To support the communities, Meta took this holistic approach that enables the community leaders to learn and use the tools and educational resources they need for a better digital experience and make a greater impact in the world.</span></p>\n<h1>Let’s meet the communities of the 2022 APAC Cohort</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year among the selected, 20 communities from six different countries in the Asia Pacific region is joining this game-changing accelerator programme.
