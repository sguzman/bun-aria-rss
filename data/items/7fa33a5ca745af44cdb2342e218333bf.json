  "description": "<p>Here on the podcast we often talk about <em>how</em> to do smart things with your money, but we also try not to neglect the <em>why</em> behind our actions as well as our <em>attitudes</em> that have a massive impact on our overall approach to personal finance. Today on the show we’re talking with Ken Honda about his book “Happy Money” which is all about the mindset and attitude that we bring to our money which directly impacts our happiness. After a very successful business career, becoming an author was essentially a second career that Ken discovered and developed after retiring before he was 30. Ken’s writings bridge the topics of finance and self-help, focusing on creating and generating personal wealth and happiness through deeper self-honesty. Happiness and handling your money well takes more than just understanding the nuts and bolts, so listen as we talk about the art of gaining peace with your money!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Black Widow by Original Sin Cider- thanks to the folks there at Original Sin for sending this one our way!
