  "description": "<p>On today’s episode we’re joined by a fellow personal finance podcaster: Rich Jones, host of Paychecks and Balances. Rich has also worked in human resources and recruiting for the better part of a decade, and so we’re particularly excited to talk with him about negotiating raises.

So if you’re interested in negotiating a fatter paycheck, then this episode is for you!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Boss of the Plains by Fieldwork Brewing Company- a big thanks to Tim for donating this one to the show!
