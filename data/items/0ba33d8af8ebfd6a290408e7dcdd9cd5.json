  "description": "In today's podcast we offer a quick survey of the vast and spreading Ransomware landscape. (And talk about some other bits of cybercrime as well, but if Willie Sutton were alive today, and had an Internet connection, he'd be into ransomware.) Brexit's implications remain under study and speculation, but many see a shift in the tech startup scene in the general direction of Berlin. Most observers have now concluded that the DNC hack was a Russian job (and not the work of a lone hacktivist). Joe Carrigan from the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute reminds us why we shouldn't reuse passwords.",
