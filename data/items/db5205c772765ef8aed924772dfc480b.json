  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is America’s first Fascist! Her Alinsky tactics are literally destroying the long-held tradition of the president speaking before a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of The Union for the first time in history.  She's lying about her concerns over security, and the Democrats and the press have no problem with it! Pelosi's behavior is that of a radical authoritarian fascist.  She's more than willing to allow people to come into this country as they please, and she's defying the will of the people who voted nationally for President of the United States from getting the State of the Union Address as they always have. For all their talk about Vladimir Putin they are acting a lot like him in the Democrat party.  Pelosi has no problem asking for Trump's tax returns and is okay with investigations on his children and his business.  So perhaps the Pelosi's taxes, finances, and businesses as well as their children should be subject to the same scrutiny they wish for Trump, since she's second in the line for succession for the presidency.  Then, Michael Cohen says he will not testify, claims that he is afraid of threats from Trump. It's a joke, Cohen was likely advised by a real lawyer, not Lanny Davis, to keep his mouth shut and not confuse his previously told lies in a new testimony. Finally, Isaiah Berlin was brilliant in his essay and lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" which makes a powerful case for freedom from government and interference by other people versus the possession of the power and resources to fulfil one's own potential. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
