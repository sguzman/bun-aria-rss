  "description": "Today we’re talking about how to create an elevated space, whether your taste is dressy or casual. Either way, you can always create something great, as long as it’s the very best version of yourself. If you’re a dressy person, you’re likely going to be into shiny things, such as shiny velvets, silk drapes, original paintings, or shiny marble. The casual client is typically someone with the casual T-shirt, their style is a little more spontaneous, and they’re not hyper formal. Jess identifies herself as a high end casual, while Sue identifies as just a casual. The more formal homes will typically have more whites and blacks, like the checkered floors, but a casual home may have more wooden flooring and earthy colors throughout. <br /><br />Dressy space 5:34<br />The casual person 9:10<br />Dressy and casual colors 14:06<br />Casual finishes 17:28<br />Sheers 21:49<br />Cory’s music room 24:41<br />Rugs 29:44<br /><br />“Whether you want to spend the money on a rocky mountain hardware door set for your door, or don’t, go there for your inspiration. Always look at successful things, and then try and do something that’s like unto it if you can’t afford to do the great stuff. So that’s kind of where we live on this podcast, is to give you our very best advice, and then you take it and do with it what you will, but you always want to look successful and by successful we mean you always want it to feel like a professional helped you, whether it be casual or dressy.” 16:32<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
