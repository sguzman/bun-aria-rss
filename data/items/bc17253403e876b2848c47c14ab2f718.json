  "description": "<p>Let H be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field. We\ndefine a surjective map from the set CS(H) of unipotent character sheaves on H\n(up to isomorphism) to the set of strata of H. To do this we use the\ngeneralized Springer correspondence. We also give a new parametrization of\nCS(H) in terms of data coming from bad characteristic.\n</p>",
