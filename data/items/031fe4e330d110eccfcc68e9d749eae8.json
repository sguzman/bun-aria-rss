  "description": "We’ve been seeing some wild volatility in the markets over the last week… and the Fed’s change of tune on inflation is at least partially responsible. Daniel and I share why inflation is the worst enemy of the markets… why the Fed must raise rates to fight it… and whether we think they’ll actually do it. [0:30] It’s not just stocks experiencing volatility—bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also dropped a quick 20% in just a few days. I explain why you shouldn’t worry about what crypto critics have to say… why you need to look further down the road when it comes to digital assets... and why you should scale into crypto positions. [8:28] Silvergate Capital (SI)—a bank focused on the crypto industry—raised additional capital this week. This stock is up over 1,200% for  members… but it’s still an incredible buy at current levels. [16:10] Former President Trump’s new special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is stirring the pot on social media. Daniel and I break down the drama… and whether there’s a legitimate investment thesis behind the headlines. [21:05] Finally, the U.S. announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China. We discuss why this isn’t as big of a deal as it’s being made out to be… and the best way to get exposure to China. [25:38] Enjoyed this episode?
