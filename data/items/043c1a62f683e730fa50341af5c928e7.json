  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, I am in desperate need of advice. I was engaged to be married, but my fianc&eacute; and I recently split up after my ex-wife caused a whole lot of problems in our relationship. When my ex heard I was engaged, she called me. I told her that I was extremely happy and excited to get remarried. My ex said that she was happy for me and wished me well, which was a big lie. A few days after we talked, my ex created a new Facebook page, named it &ldquo;The Thompsons&rdquo; and posted a bunch of old pics from our wedding and family vacations..........</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
