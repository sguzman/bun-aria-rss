  "description": "Tuesday night was a big one for Democrats. In a southwestern Pennsylvania district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016, voters appear to have elected Democrat Conor Lamb to fill a vacant House seat — a huge upset for President Trump and the Republican party. The race has still not been officially called, but barring a recount, Lamb has a small but insurmountable lead over Republican Rick Saccone. This episode: host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, political editor Domenico Montanaro, and congressional correspondent Scott Detrow in Pennsylvania. Email the show at nprpolitics@npr.org.
