She tells us how she got into interior design, starting in high school when she needed to fill her schedule with some extra classes. That’s when she realized her passion for design and she began pursuing this career. We talk about discovering your own style and how fashion and design can often work really well together, and then you don’t need to worry so much about having nice things when you have kids. <br /><br />A day in the life of Rachel Parcell 3:09<br />How she got into interior design 5:45<br />Why Alice Lane? 8:58<br />Do fashion and design go hand in hand? 13:46<br />Finding your own personal style 17:32<br />Her favorite part of the design process 19:48<br />Living her lifestyle with children and a dog 24:53<br />Rachel’s favorite room 28:32<br />The nursery 30:04<br />The mud hall and dog bath 32:03<br />Something that people would be surprised to know about Rachel 35:00<br />What projects she’s working on next 36:14<br />Defining luxury 38:50<br /><br />“We bought it when we could see up the canyon, and then as homes started being built, we lost the view. And so, we decided, ‘Let’s go. Let’s move closer to the mountains. Let’s get an unobstructed view.’ It’ll be hard to replace this property, so who knows, maybe if we don’t ever find another property with a great view, this will be forever.” 23:24<br /> <br />@rachparcell<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
