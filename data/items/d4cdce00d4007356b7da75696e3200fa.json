  "description": "In one last noir twist, Joan marries for a fourth and final time to a man with a secret life. The last chapter of our story takes us from the Greenwich Village cross-dressing scene of the 1960s, to the set of Dario Argento’s giallo classic, Suspiria (Joan’s last film), to post-reunification Berlin, where Bennett’s legacy as a key face of film noir is solidified. What are the lasting reverberations of the violent act Walter Wanger committed in 1951 -- on Joan Bennett’s family, on film culture, politics and society? What, if anything, would be different today?\nListen and subscribe at http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\n\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
