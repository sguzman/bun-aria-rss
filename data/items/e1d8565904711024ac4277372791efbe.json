    "media:description": "In this video, we incorporate into type theory a central feature of logic: implications. Along the way, we encounter the work of the ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastus, the modern work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov, and end up doing computer programming.

It serves as a common language for reasoning about computation (functional programming), about mathematical structure (synthetic homotopy theory and higher category theory), and about constructive logic. This Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory video lecture series is intended to explain what HoTT is, show how to work in HoTT (including how formalization in Agda works), and give intuition for why HoTT is the way it is. I don’t assume any particular background familiarity, but the more you know about mathematics, computer science, and logic, the more you’ll be able to get out of these videos. Enjoy!",
