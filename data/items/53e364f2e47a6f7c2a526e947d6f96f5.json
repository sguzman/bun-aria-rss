  "description": "<p>Are jail time and new laws the only answers to men's violence against women, children, and other men?  Or is there something every man can do to end these tragedies?  In an earlier episode of The Psych Files in which I discussed Blaming the Victim, I talked about why there's a tendency to blame victims and to overlook the Optimism Bias that we all share (particularly younger folks).  But podcast listener and psychotherapist Jackie Henry felt that I didn't go far enough in that episode, and she was right.  We - especially men - need to think carefully about the way we talk about women in our everyday lives. Was that joke really funny?  Or was it one of the small ingredients that eventually adds up to - or contributes to - the ongoing violence and lack of empathy that those with power express toward those without it.  We take up this important issue in this episode of The Psych files.</p>",
