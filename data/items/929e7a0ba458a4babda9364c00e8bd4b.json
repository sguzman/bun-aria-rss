After a disappointing performance in the pool at the home Olympics of 2012, and then allegations of bullying in the Paralympic programme, followed by the swimmers best medal return at the Rio Olympics for 100 years - it's been a tumultuous few years. Jack took over in May 2017 and we asked him what the first thing he changed was. He tells us how disappointing it is that drugs in sport - particularly his first love of athletics where he won World, European and Commonwealth medals in the 5,000m in the mid 80's - is still dominating headlines but how he backed his 'team' for standing up to alleged drug cheats in swimming.
