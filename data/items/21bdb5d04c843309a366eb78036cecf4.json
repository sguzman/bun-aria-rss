  "description": "My special guest tonight is author Ben Westhoff who's here to discuss the deadliest opioid ever created causing instant death in adults, children and even infants. Get his book Fentanyl, Inc.: How Rogue Chemists Are Creating the Deadliest Wave of the Opioid Epidemic on Amazon.\nA remarkable four-year investigation into the dangerous world of synthetic drugs―from black market drug factories in China to users and dealers on the streets of the U.S. to harm reduction activists in Europe―which reveals for the first time the next wave of the opioid epidemicA deeply human story, Fentanyl, Inc. is the first deep-dive investigation of a hazardous and illicit industry that has created a worldwide epidemic, ravaging communities and overwhelming and confounding government agencies that are challenged to combat it. “A whole new crop of chemicals is radically changing the recreational drug landscape,” writes Ben Westhoff. “These are known as Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and they include replacements for known drugs like heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana. They are synthetic, made in a laboratory, and are much more potent than traditional drugs”―and all-too-often tragically lethal.\nDrugs like fentanyl, K2, and Spice―and those with arcane acronyms like 25i-NBOMe― were all originally conceived in legitimate laboratories for proper scientific and medicinal purposes. Their formulas were then hijacked and manufactured by rogue chemists, largely in China, who change their molecular structures to stay ahead of the law, making the drugs’ effects impossible to predict. Westhoff has infiltrated this shadowy world. He tracks down the little-known scientists who invented these drugs and inadvertently killed thousands, as well as a mysterious drug baron who turned the law upside down in his home country of New Zealand. Westhoff visits the shady factories in China from which these drugs emanate, providing startling and original reporting on how China’s vast chemical industry operates, and how the Chinese government subsidizes it. Poignantly, he chronicles the lives of addicted users and dealers, families of victims, law enforcement officers, and underground drug awareness organizers in the U.S. and Europe. Together they represent the shocking and riveting full anatomy of a calamity we are just beginning to understand. From its depths, as Westhoff relates, are emerging new strategies that may provide essential long-term solutions to the drug crisis that has affected so many.\n\n\nBECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!\n\nAPPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS\n\nANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS\n\nPLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO MYSTERIOUS RADIO PLUS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO PARANORMAL FEARS!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO SEVEN!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO OVER 150 HOURS OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO BONUS EPISODES FOR MEMBERS ONLY!\n\nRequest To Join Our Private Community \n\nVisit our home on the web: https://www.mysteriousradio.com\n\nFollow us on Instagram @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on TikTok mysteriousradioTikTok\nFollow us on Twitter @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Pinterest pinterest.com/mysteriousradio\nLike us on Facebook Facebook.com/mysteriousradio\n\nWant All Paranormal Episodes?
