  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane goes live from the studio to download on the George Floyd killing, the peaceful protests, the violent riots, and the corrupt media and politicians. Barstool personalities invite us to help looters pay bail and share antiracist reading lists. Mike Francesa thinks he's finally sniffed out a prank caller. The new Jeffrey Epstein documentary on Netflix is a great watch, but there's a few glaring omissions (0:49:24). The protests come to Boston as the boys are taping (1:07:00). Kirk and Steve decide they're moving the show to Maine, but will Mike come along for the ride?</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
