  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show by going straight to the phones and talking to a caller from Utah who is confounded by the constant messaging about masks. As the conversation progresses the topic shifts slightly to include both outdoor dining and vaccine mandates for children. They also speak to a caller from Florida who recently got covid and wants to share his experience of obtaining the monoclonal antibodies. After an impassioned rant about defiance specifically when it comes to California, Drew shares a conversation he had with a Governor who was concerned that a mask mandate he was being encouraged to enact was not his place as a Governor. As the show wraps up, they speak with a caller whose wife was recently diagnosed with cancer and is looking for advice. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nBlindsGalore.com let them know we sent you\nTryFirstLeaf.com/ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM",
