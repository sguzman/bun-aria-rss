  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving to all of our listeners! To complement your celebrations, Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech gather (via Zoom) to recap the Turkey Day NFL action. First, the guys tackle Washington's convincing victory over the Cowboys and the embarrassing coaching effort from Mike McCarthy (7:05). Of course, we have to provide our weekly \"who will win the NFC East\" update. Then, it's a breakdown of the Texans dominant performance against the Lions (31:05), focusing on what Houston is building and the potentially bleak future for Matt Patricia. Finally, we didn't get to discuss a 3rd game tonight, but did have to react to Ravens-Steelers news. Lamar Jackson (among others) has tested positive for COVID-19 putting Sunday's matchup in further jeopardy (43:00). The Pick Six Superfriends go over possible scenarios with that game before ending this episode.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
