  "description": "<p>36-year-old Isaac Seidel disappeared from Blain, Pennsylvania, on September 12, 2021. By the time Isaac's loved ones realized that anything was wrong, Isaac had already missed a few days of work. When they went to his home, where Isaac lived alone, an eerie scene was left behind. Isaac's bicycle, backpack, and phone were missing, but everything else seemed to be there except Isaac. He had left chicken thawing in the sink. It appeared that he had decided to go for a bike ride and planned to be back later to cook chicken for dinner. Isaac's family thought that perhaps Isaac had been in a tragic accident, so they began scouring the roadways near Isaac's house, looking in ditches and ravines. But there was no trace of Isaac anywhere. Nearly nine months later, they are still searching for answers.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Isaac Seidel, please contact the Pennsylvania State Police at (717) 567-3110. Missing along with Isaac is his dark green Cannondale bicycle.</p><p>You can follow Isaac's case on social media at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Find-Isaac-Seidel-105674638806459\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find Isaac Seidel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://theouai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OUAI</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theouai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theouai.com&nbsp;</a>and use code VANISHED to get 15% off your entire order.</p><p><a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moink</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moinkbox.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;to get FREE filet mignon for a year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED to get $15 off your first order and free shipping.</p><p><a href=\"http://zocdoc.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zocdoc</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://zocdoc.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zocdoc.com/<strong>VANISHED</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and download the Zocdoc app to sign-up for FREE and book a top-rated doctor.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
