  "description": "As protests have swept Hong Kong in the last few weeks, we begin an occasional series on the British Empire with a double episode on a previous wave of demonstrations, riots, strikes and bombings in the city, then a British colony. We speak with three people who were there about what happened, and learn new revelations about one of Hong Kong’s most notorious unsolved murders – of radio commentator Lam Bun.\nWe interview to Zhou Yi (Chau Yick/周奕), Leung Po Lung (梁寶龍) and Chui Yat Keung (徐日強) who were in Hong Kong at the time, as well as Lala, an activist and historian who interpreted for us and spoke about her research.\nThis podcast is brought to you by our patreon supporters.
