They started out in Woonsocket, South Dakota, and drove about 25 miles east to the tiny town of Fedora. After that, Eugene and his friend were spotted at a bar in Forestburg, which was along their route home. The last confirmed sighting of Eugene was at the bar. The truck they were in was seen on camera driving away from the bar at 7:38 PM. Other bar patrons said that you could tell they had been drinking, but Eugene didn’t appear to be visibly intoxicated, and he had mentioned that he wanted to go home, he had work in the morning. But according to Eugene’s friend, he made a detour to stop at a mutual friend’s farm. He went inside while Eugene stayed in the car. When the friend came out about 20 minutes later, Eugene was gone.
