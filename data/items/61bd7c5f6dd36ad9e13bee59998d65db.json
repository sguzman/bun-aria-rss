  "description": "Kenia Monge was 19 years old when she went missing after a night out with her friends in Colorado. While her father Tony was trying to call her friends and find out what had happened that night, a text came through to Kenia’s phone from a number she didn’t have saved. It was from a man named Travis who claimed to have attempted to give her a ride home the previous night. Tony agreed to go meet the man and talk, but when he shook Travis’s hand, he knew he was shaking the hand of the man who killed his daughter. The rest of the events throughout the case are shocking and will have you holding on to your butt til’ the very end. <br>\n<br>\nAs always thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid12\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid12</a> and use code morbid12<br>\n<br>\nAthena Club: Sign up today and you’ll get 20% off your first order!
