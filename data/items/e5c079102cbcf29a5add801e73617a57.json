  "description": "Gretchen McCulloch is a self-described “internet linguist,” host of the podcast Lingthusiasm, and author of the recent book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language. In it, she demonstrates that the way we've come to speak on the internet -- from emojis to exclamation points -- is not random or arbitrary, but part of a broader attempt to make our written communication more vibrant, meaningful, and, genuinely human. Far from ‘ruining’ the written English language, internet-speak, McCulloch argues, is revolutionizing language in unprecedented, and ultimately positive, ways.\nWe discuss why I feel bad if I don't use enough exclamation points (or use too many), why postcards are the pre-internet predecessors to Instagram, how emojis act as written equivalents of our body language, why sarcasm is like a “linguistic trust fall,” the meaning of “Ok boomer” and much more.\nBook recommendations: \nIt’s Complicated:The Social Lives of Networked Teens by danah boyd \nYou Look Like a Thing and I Love You by Janelle Shane\nThis Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\nIf you enjoyed this episode, you may also like: \ndanah boyd on why fake news is so easy to believe\nYou will love this conversation with Jaron Lanier, but I can’t describe it\n\nMy book is available for pre-order!
