  "description": "<p>In the latest edition of the Good Morning Football Podcast, hosts Kay Adams, Peter Schrager, James Palmer, and Super Bowl Champion Michael Robinson discuss night one of the NFL Scouting Combine and debate which QB stood out the most. Malik Willis put on quite a show and there was a lot of talk surrounding Kenny Pickett and his hand size. We turn to current NFL QB's to ask which young arm has the most potential looking forward and what they need to reach that potential. Back to the Combine, we examine the performances of the WR's and how the Draft could be affected with the depth of the position. The crew wraps up their Report Cards with the NFC West and what areas they can give an 'A' to each team. Peter will continue his reporting at the Combine through the weekend and describes how different and helpful it is talking to coaches and team execs when they're not behind a podium or in game mode during the season.</p><p>The Good Morning Football Podcast is part of the NFL Podcast Network.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
