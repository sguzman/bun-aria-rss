  "description": "Everywhere you go these days, you hear about deep learning&rsquo;s impressive advancements. New deep learning libraries, tools, and products get announced on a regular basis, making the average data scientist feel like they&rsquo;re missing out if they don&rsquo;t hop on the deep learning bandwagon. However, as Kamil Bartocha put it in his post The Inconvenient Truth About Data Science, 95% of tasks do not require deep learning. This is obviously a made up number, but it&rsquo;s probably an accurate representation of the everyday reality of many data scientists."
