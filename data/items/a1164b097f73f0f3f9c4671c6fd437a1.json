  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part Eight: What is Grace? </strong></em>Today, we talk about different understandings and interpretations of ‘grace,’ and how they’re to be understood biblically. Grace as God’s favor; as a gift or benefaction; as generosity. The American Understanding of Grace as free from prior conditions; without regard to worth or deserving. What is the OT understanding and how does it differ? What does Paul say? How does Santa fit into all of this? We’re continuing our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: \"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</p>\n<p>Mike and Tim also spend some time reading listener e, ails regarding the abortion conversation.</p>\n<p>And stay tuned for <strong>Voxology Radio</strong> this week. Mike and Tim take up new roles as DJ’s to soundtrack your day.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
