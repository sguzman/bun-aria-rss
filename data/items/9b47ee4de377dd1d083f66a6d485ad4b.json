  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles and Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony reunite after a brief hiatus to discuss one of the smaller engagements of the American Civil War that ended up having deeper repercussions for how the Union high command conducted themselves during military campaigns, specifically the heavily politicized Union Army of the Potomac. Fought on October 21, 1861, the Battle of Ball's Bluff occurred along the banks of the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia when a Union reconnaissance under Brig. Gen. Charles P. Stone triggered a larger engagement with a brigade of Confederate soldiers under Nathan \"Shank\" Evans. The small battle ended in disaster for the Union and led to the formation of the Committee for the Conduct of War. The guys evaluate the fight and the consequences it had on the overall war, while making an abundance of \"ball\" jokes throughout that'll just drive ya nuts. Enjoy!</p>",
