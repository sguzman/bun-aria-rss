  "description": "<p>17-year-old Andrea Cotten disappeared from Corsicana, Texas, in late January of 2004. In 2021, a local resident reached out to us about Andrea- the only missing person in Corsicana. So we started doing research and looking for people who knew her, and would talk to us. We learned that Andrea’s story was far bigger, more scandalous, and stranger than we could have imagined, all with Andrea, not yet an adult but not seemingly considered a child, at its center. There were stories that Andrea was last seen leaving in a truck with two men and other stories pointing to her own family.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about Andrea’s disappearance, please call the Texas Department of Public Safety Highway Patrol division in Corsicana at ​​(903) 872-5633. You can also contact the Texas Department of Public Safety Missing Persons Clearinghouse at 1-(800) 346-3243.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED to get $15 off your first order and free shipping.</p><p><a href=\"http://ritual.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ritual</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ritual.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ritual.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first 3 months.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
