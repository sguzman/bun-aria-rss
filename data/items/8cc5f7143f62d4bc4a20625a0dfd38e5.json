  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, it's a mistake to say we should never have gone into Afghanistan. They were harboring Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists that attacked the United States in 2001. Critics say that we should engage in nation-building but that's exactly what the US did after World War II, it was called the Marshall Plan. What Biden did in Afghanistan is atrocious. The Afghan airbase commander said he showed up and the Americans were gone because they'd left in the middle of the night. Now the Taliban, ISIS-K, Al-Qaeda are running wild in Afghanistan. The moment the U.S abandoned the Bagram airbase and relinquished their air support, every one of those 13 soldiers became a sitting duck. Then, Victor Davis Hanson calls in to explain how contrary agendas at play in Afghanistan are playing out. Hanson predicts that there will be many more 'Bowe Bergdahl\" situations because the Army has shifted its focus from military science to the social science of wokeness. Later, when a society begins to hate itself, hate its founding, and what their country once stood for it rots away at the core of a nation. Forget climate change, the biggest problem facing us is 'ideological change.' Afterward, the media and the Biden Administration continually fail to recognize that the Taliban and the Afghan government had to meet conditions in order to earn withdrawal. The conditions set forth by the Trump agreement, for a government of peace were never upheld by the other parties. Therefore, there was no need for a precipitous, reckless withdrawal that killed hundreds, injured more, and gave away billions in military assets. In breaking news, the murder of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Sirhan Sirhan, has earned a shot at parole after two sons of Robert F. Kennedy advocated for Sirhan, ultimately the Governor of California will make the decision. Sirhan maintains that he has no recollection of the RFK assassination, and the Soros-backed prosecutor has declined to participate in the parole hearing.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
