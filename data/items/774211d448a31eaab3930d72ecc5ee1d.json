  "description": "In this episode we consider what it really means to be \"left-behind\" during the rapture, tie that idea back into politics, explain \"Now and Not Yet\" with a terrible bocce ball anology, and affirm our own banter.\n\nWith much prayer and pursuit we are exploring what it looks like to develop a local community from this podcast.  If you are interested in what that means and would like to join our email list to be updated, please go to www.voxoc.com and enter your email at the top of the page or the footer to subscribe.  We look forward to more announcements in the future as to how this develops.  Thank you for all of the support along the way.  We're privileged to invite you to join us in this is incredible journey as we pursue Jesus together.  We look forward to your comments below.\n\nWe have created an opportunity for you to support the podcast through the means of donation.
