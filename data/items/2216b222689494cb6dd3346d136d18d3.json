  "description": "<p>Today's episode features a special guest co-host! Seventeen year old Welsh/Australian Freya joins us to help share the history and hauntings, including her own experience! Port Arthur is part of a World Heritage site Tfeaturing former Australian jail sites and it is an open air museum. Australia has a harsh history since it was established as a place for Britain to send her convicts. Many of the prisoners from Ireland's Kilmainham Gaol were sent to Australia. Port Arthur's prison became the stop for Britain's worst convicts. Such a harsh place would be a good breeding ground for things that go bump in the night just from its penal history alone. But this area has an even more tragic story. It was the site of a massacre in 1996. No wonder Port Arthur is considered to be one of the most haunted locations in all the world. Moment in Oddity features the blue people of Kentucky and This Day in History features the first run of the Pony Express.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-40-port-aurthur-australia.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/04/hgb-podcast-ep-40-port-aurthur-australia.html</a></p>",
