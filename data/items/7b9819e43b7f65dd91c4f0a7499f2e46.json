Next, they break down the mismanagement of the Arizona Cardinals—from coaching decisions, on-field performance, to the front office—and how the team as presently constructed cannot be run back (12:00). They then examine Tampa Bay’s offensive philosophy (19:21), tip their caps to the OG coaches of the league (27:35), and raise concerns regarding the Browns defense (35:04). They end the pod by discussing the Jets’ potential QB decision in the offseason (44:32), and the weekly extra point by Ben (51:07).\n\nHosts: Sheil Kapadia and Ben Solak\nProduction Supervision: Arjuna Ramgopal and Conor Nevins\nProducer: Eduardo Ocampo\nLearn more about your ad choices.
