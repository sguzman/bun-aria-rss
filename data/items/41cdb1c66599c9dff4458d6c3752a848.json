  "description": "<p>Dani Shapiro is a New York Times bestselling author and gifted examiner of life, especially her own. Her latest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WOiVT6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Inheritance</a>, (https://amzn.to/2WOiVT6) drops you into a surprise revelation about who her dad was or, more accurately, wasn’t and the familial earthquake this discovery led to. When the book published, Dani learned something else. She wasn't the only one with big family secrets. That realization became the inciting incident Dani's podcast called <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/family-secrets/id1441824608\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Family Secrets</a> (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/family-secrets/id1441824608).
