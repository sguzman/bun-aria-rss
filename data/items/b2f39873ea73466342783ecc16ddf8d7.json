  "description": "<p>My Edinburgh roommates Joe Derosa, Alex Kealy, Ahir Shah, Alex Smith, and I all got together to talk to about the world's largest comedy festival, The Edinburgh Fringe. And since it's the Fringe, we decided to get drunk while we did it. So here goes. It's a crazy festival and these guys will help me explain it. The British ones have been here many times. I've been here once before. And Derosa was 4 days into his first time. </p>",
