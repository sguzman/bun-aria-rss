  "description": "<p><p>Back in San Antonio, Kate chatted with Chaps' wife about her backstory, her life as a military spouse, and being Chaps' better half. Kate asks her everything from Chaps' TBI to Chaps' social presence to a lightning round of Chaps' favorite things. Afterwards, Kate talks about a story that includes some Naval heroics. She's also super jazzed about Gritty. Maybe a little too jazzed!</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
