  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, back on May 5, 1787, James Madison concluded that the loose confederate of states was going to collapse and decided that in order to rescue the republic, the future nation needed a new governing document, hence the Constitutional Convention. Madison proposed the Virginia Plan which called for a central government with three branches of government. Yet still today, despite the history of this nation, the progeny of Marx and Hegel follows the fascistic lead of Speaker Nancy Pelosi to railroad ridiculous legislation through congress without Representatives even getting the chance to vote. Then, governors across America are embracing tyranny, The big question here is: where does this power come from? Later, the New York Times continues manipulating scientific models that are flawed and suspected to be leaked. The internal document has been debunked by a multitude of healthcare experts yet again exposing the Times' propagandistic practices. It’s clear that this is just another attempt from the left to hurt President Trump, just like the current smear on Lincoln and Reagan in an attempt to sabotage the November election. Afterward, Tea Party Patriots leader Jenny Beth Martin joins the program to discuss the protests by brave Americans to reopen the economy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
