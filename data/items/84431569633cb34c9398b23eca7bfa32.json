  "title": "33 - Angry Jesus and Outraged Christians",
  "description": "In this episode we talk about the angry Jesus and Christians who blow up the internet when something bad happens.  In a handful of episodes, Jesus is at odds with situations in which he reveals incredible solutions.  In relationship to the weekend we are deeply saddened by the events in Orlando both the mass murder at Pulse and the murder of Christina Grimmie.  We want to preface that this was recorded prior to those events, so please consider this is a conversation around anger relating beyond these events and are not limited to them.  Our prayers go out to the families and people effected by these tragic events, and hope to see Jesus' love, association, and overwhelming grace extended to those who need, patience, time to grieve and empathy in these very moments.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
