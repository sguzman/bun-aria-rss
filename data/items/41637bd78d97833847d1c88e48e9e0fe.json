Later that day, Patrick stopped by his ex-wife's house in St. Charles, Missouri. Then, Patrick made the nearly 3 hour trip to Mill Spring, Missouri, where he planned to stay with the family of a woman he had recently been dating. They claimed that Patrick seemed to be acting strange that night, and by the following morning, Patrick and his vehicle were gone. It would be several more weeks before Patrick's friends and family learned anything was amiss, after the last people to see Patrick reported him missing. What has occurred since that time has been a bizarre string of events, and Patrick's loved ones have been trying to put all of the puzzle pieces together in order to find him.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Patrick Chapman, please contact Missouri State Highway Patrol Troop E at (573) 609-4439 or the Wayne County Sheriff's Office at 573-224-3219.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://doordash.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Doordash</a>- For a limited time, our listeners can get 25% off and zero delivery fees on their first order of $15or more, when you download the DoorDash app and enter code&nbsp;<strong><em>VANISHED</em></strong>.</p><p><a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thrive Market</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>thrivemarket.com/VANISHED</strong></a>.
