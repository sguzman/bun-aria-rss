  "title": "NFL Conference Championship Recap: Bucs-Chiefs set for Super Bowl LV as Tom Brady makes 10th appearance and Kansas City looks to go back-to-back (Football 1/25)",
  "description": "Super Bowl LV is set. Tom Brady will be back on the big stage, but this time leading a different team from a different conference. Meanwhile, the defending champs will look to defend their crown. The Bucs beat the Packers and the Chiefs beat the Bills to get to our matchup in Tampa in two weeks. On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down the conference championship games and look ahead to the Super Bowl. First, the guys have to discuss Matt LaFleur's decision making at the end of the NFC Championship Game (3:00). Why kick in that situation? Aaron Rodgers distanced himself from the decision and our crew tends to do the same. They also break down defensive lapses from the Packers and Kevin King, a somewhat controversial late pass interference call and much more. Rodgers outplayed Brady, but that didn't lead to the result you'd think. Then, the Pick Six Superfriends analyze Kansas City's dominant defeat of Buffalo and ability to flip the switch in the AFC Championship Game (34:00). Andy Reid could be the best coach on the planet right now and his team is clicking headed back to another Super Bowl. Brinson, Wilson and Breech begin to set the scene for Tampa with much more to come on the Pick Six podcast. Finally, they finish with winners & losers from championship Sunday (55:30).\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
