  "description": "<p>“Let’s do&nbsp;<em>Bartonella&nbsp;</em>next,” we said. “It’ll be straightforward and fun,” we promised ourselves. Turns out we were half right. In this fun but not quite straightforward episode, we tackle not one, not two, but three different species of Bartonella bacteria that can cause disease in humans:&nbsp;<em>Bartonella bacilliformis&nbsp;</em>(Carrión’s disease),&nbsp;<em>B. quintana</em>&nbsp;(trench fever),&nbsp;<em>B. henselae</em>&nbsp;(cat scratch disease). Essentially, we’re giving you three mini-turned-maxisodes for the price of one! For each pathogen, we review its surprisingly strange biology, take a brief tour of its history, and wrap up with a look at its current status across the globe, comparing and contrasting along the way. By the end of this ride, you’ll be bursting with&nbsp;<em>Bartonella</em>&nbsp;trivia, in awe of dental pulp, and scratching your head about the transmission of cat scratch fever.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
