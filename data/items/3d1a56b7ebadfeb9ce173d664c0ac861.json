  "itunes:summary": "I have been involved in hosting or helping a small group on Alpha for over thirty years. During this time, I have noticed a shift in our culture. There is a change in the attitude towards Jesus, especially among young people. Many will say that they believe in God and are even open to the idea of the Holy Spirit. But increasingly, Jesus has become the stumbling-block. Some youth and young people say things like, ‘I don’t get the reason for Jesus.’\nAs Cardinal Raniero Cantalamessa has often said, ‘The battle today is around Jesus.’\nIs Jesus the universal Saviour? This is the same battle as the first century. People today are happy to accept Jesus as ‘one of many’. It is the uniqueness of Jesus that causes offence. In the passages for today we see that while we meet some exceptional people throughout the Bible, like Moses, Joshua, Elijah and John the Baptist, there was no one like Jesus. Jesus is unique. He is the universal Saviour.",
