Matthew Hutchins spoke out publicly for the first time to the Today Show. Hutchins said he “felt so angry” watching Baldwin claim he was not responsible for the 42-year-old mother’s death.. Halyna Hutchins died on the Santa Fe set of Rust after the gun Baldwin was handling fired a live round, hitting her and the film’s director Joel Souza. He suffered non-fatal injuries. Baldwin said in an ABC interview that he was told the gun was “cold,” meaning it did not contain any live bullets. Matthew Hutchins says he finds the idea that the person holding the gun is not responsible, absurd.
