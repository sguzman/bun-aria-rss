  "description": "<p>We consider a system with a Base Station (BS) and multiple mobile/stationary\nusers. BS uses millimeter waves (mmWaves) for data transmission and hence needs\nto align beams in the directions of the end-users. The idea is to avail regular\nuser-position estimates, which help in accurate beam alignment towards multiple\nusers, paving way for opportunistic mmWave schedulers. We propose an online\nalgorithm that uses a dual opportunistic and fair scheduler to allocate data as\nwell as position-update channels, in each slot. Towards this, well-known\nalpha-fair objective functions of utilities of various users, which further\ndepend upon the age of position-information, are optimized. We illustrate the\nadvantages of the opportunistic scheduler, by comparing it with the previously\nproposed mmWave schemes; these schedulers choose one user in each slot and\nstart data transmission only after accurate beam alignment. We also discuss two\nways of introducing fairness in such schemes, both of which perform inferior to\nthe proposed age-based opportunistic scheduler.\n</p>",
