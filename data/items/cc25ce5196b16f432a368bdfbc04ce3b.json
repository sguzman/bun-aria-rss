  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat is joined by former professional golfer on the European and PGA Tour, 1989 Ryder Cup Champion, current golf broadcaster, host of the TV show “Feherty,” which will be airing it’s 10th season soon, the legend from Bangor, County Down, Northern Ireland, David Feherty. Pat and David chat about how his career as a broadcaster and Tiger’s career have been about the same length so he’s gotten to ride the Tiger wave, whether or not Tiger has a chance to win this weekend at The Memorial, what he thinks about the next generation of golfers, and why he thinks golf is the greatest sport in the world. David also tells Pat and the boys a couple of hilarious stories from his time as a professional (1:43-19:40). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports talk as AJ is officially back from Lake Tahoe. Pat and AJ discuss everything going on with different players having to sign the franchise tag, where the Cowboys are at with Dak Prescott’s longterm extension, and how the Chiefs have money to pay everyone. Pat and AJ also describe what it’s like to be in a pile or scrum in an NFL game, and Pat chats about what went into recovering his own onside kick against the Texans, plus Pat, AJ, and the boys get into a heated discussion about whether or not meatball sub’s are good sandwiches (22:01-1:44:51). Later, 2019 NFL rushing touchdown co-leader, one of the most underrated players in the NFL, current Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Jones joins the program. Pat and Aaron chat about why the Packers seem to be disrespected so much by the media, what Aaron is focused on going into a contract year, what he has heard about the return to play and whether or not he thinks they’ll be in camp by July 28th, his thoughts on the Packers drafting a RB in the 2nd round, why he doesn’t really care about the Madden ratings, and why he thinks he and Aaron Rodgers may be primed to have their best years yet (1:44:53-1:59:36).
