  "description": "<p>Veteran investment research Laurence (Larry) Siegel’s response to all the doomsday stories in the daily news is his book “Fewer, Richer, Greener,” which offers a long view of the progress and economic growth our world has known, despite the proverbial bumps on the road. This podcast (20:40) challenges Siegel with a bit of the gloom and doom that we’re seeing. The financial analyst concedes that a sober view of markets is justified, but defends the view that the broader economy is progressing. In this interview and in his book, Siegel prefers to light a candle than to curse the darkness. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices</p>",
