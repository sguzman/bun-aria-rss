  "description": "<p>In this article, we employ a collection of stochastic differential equations\nwith drift and diffusion coefficients approximated by neural networks to\npredict the trend of chaotic time series which has big jump properties. Our\ncontributions are, first, we propose a model called L\\'evy induced stochastic\ndifferential equation network, which explores compounded stochastic\ndifferential equations with $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy motion to model complex time\nseries data and solve the problem through neural network approximation. Second,\nwe theoretically prove that the numerical solution through our algorithm\nconverges in probability to the solution of corresponding stochastic\ndifferential equation, without curse of dimensionality. Finally, we illustrate\nour method by applying it to real financial time series data and find the\naccuracy increases through the use of non-Gaussian L\\'evy processes. We also\npresent detailed comparisons in terms of data patterns, various models,\ndifferent shapes of L\\'evy motion and the prediction lengths.\n</p>",
