  "description": "<p>Palm Springs has a huge architecture event called Modernism Week every February.  It’s a fascinating array of architecture, lectures, parties, tours, exhibits, and the occasional plastic surgery gone awry.  Host <strong>George Smart</strong> was there earlier this year talking with nearly all the speakers, authors, and special guests who make the week (actually 11 days) a blast!</p> <p>The photographers documenting the mid-century movement provide us a wealth of information, perspective, and enjoyment, capturing not only amazing houses but the lives and careers of their owners and architects. From poolside at the swanky Hotel Skylark, you’ll meet authors <strong>Emily Bills</strong> and <strong>Pierluigi Serraino</strong> talking about one largely undiscovered Modernist photographer,  <strong>Marvin Rand</strong>.  Their new book along with <strong>Sam Lubell</strong>, California Captured, puts Rand front and center in the same world class as <strong>Julius Shulman</strong> and <strong>Ezra Stoller.</strong>  Later we join photographer <strong>Andrew Pielage</strong> about his quest to shoot every <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong> building in the world. </p>",
