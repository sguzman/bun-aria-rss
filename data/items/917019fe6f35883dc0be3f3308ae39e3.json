  "description": "<p>Why would a spirit hang around their grave? We recall that we had a listener named Maya write us a few months back and she had wondered if cemeteries were haunted because spirits were guarding their bodies, particularly from grave robbers. And we had wondered if maybe some spirits were hanging around because that is where their family would come to visit them. We may never know why a cemetery is haunted, but there are plenty to investigate to try to find out why. On this episode we have The Lost Cemetery of Infants from Texas, Citizens Cemetery in Arizona, 100 Steps Cemetery and Stepp Cemetery in Indiana and Erie Street Cemetery in Ohio. We also will be discussing cremation and a haunted crematory! Join us for Haunted Cemeteries 18! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jeannie Nolan and features Lost Lake Hole and This Month in History features Rita Moreno winning the first Oscar for a Hispanic woman.</p> <p>Our sponsors for this episode include:</p> <p>Bizarre Times Podcast, check it out on any podcast catcher you listen to and the website: http://www.bizarretimespodcast.com</p> <p>Smile Brilliant, use this code for 30% off: https://www.smilebrilliant.com/?coupon=bump#podcast</p> <p>HelloFresh, go to HelloFresh.com/bump12 and use code bump12 for 12 free meals, including free shipping!</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2021/04/hgb-ep-382-haunted-cemeteries-18-and.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Zombie Cemetery by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
