  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   For many investors, Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition was the death knell for brick and mortar retail…   This week, Steve Koomar, former derivative trader at Goldman Sachs and editor of Vigilante Investor, breaks down the acquisition…  but explains how retail's downward spiral has created one of the largest disconnects in the market today.   This disconnect, Steve says, has opened the gates for private equity firms or companies like Amazon – companies desperately looking to improve earnings – to scoop up exceptional brick and mortars at rock-bottom valuations.   He also shares a list of companies that could be the next takeover target… and fantastic opportunities for value investors…   In addition, Steve explains why the iron and steel industry is poised for a sharp turnaround... and three \"disruptive\" tailwinds for U.S. producers going forward.   But don’t sign off once Steve leaves. For this week’s Educational Segment [52:10], I'll give you an important oil sector update… and discuss one of the greatest arts of investing: Learning how to adapt.   As always, thanks for listening and good investing!   Frank Curzio",
