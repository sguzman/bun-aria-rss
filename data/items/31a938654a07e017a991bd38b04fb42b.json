  "description": "<p>Those tiny pinpoints of light glittering in the night sky are actually incredibly distant, giant, churning balls of gas. They produce huge quantities of light and heat. In this episode, Mars interviews the biggest star in his eyes: the sun! We also ask astronomer Moiya McTier to help us count all the stars in the universe. And we'll hear a couple of the stories that people here on earth tell about the stars. Plus, a brand new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: how do whales drink?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Ancestry.com (<a href=\"http://ancestry.com/brains\" class=\"default\">http://ancestry.com/brains</a>) and School Mask Pack (<a href=\"http://ancestry.com/brains\" class=\"default\">http://schoolmaskpack.com/brainson</a>).
