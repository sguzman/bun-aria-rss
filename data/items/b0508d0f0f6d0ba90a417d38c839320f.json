  "description": "Contributor(s): Rob Sharp, Dr Eva Polonska-Kimunguyi, Professor Myria Georgiou, Abdulrahman Bdiwi | Over the past decades, and across continents, numerous refugee “crises” have led to the explosion of the global refugee population, which has more than doubled in the last ten years.\nAs so many are forced to leave their homes, not all refugees gain the same level of visibility, welcome, and recognition. What are the consequences for the lives of those who move and those who receive them? How do media representations of refugees affect their reception? And how do refugees use digital media to themselves tell their stories of uprooting and migration?",
