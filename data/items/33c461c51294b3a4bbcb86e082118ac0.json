  "description": "Trump delivered a magnificent speech last night packed with made-to-go-viral moments. He also spoke about life and faith issues in a way that most other Republicans wouldn't dare. This should be our focus today, but instead everyone is talking about Nancy Pelosi tearing up the speech afterwards. I'll explain why Pelosi's stunt, while petulant and childish, may have been a brilliant political move. Also, a straight woman \"politically opposed to heterosexuality\" writes to Slate asking for advice. And I'll answer your emails.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
