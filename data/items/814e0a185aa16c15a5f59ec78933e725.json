  "description": "<p>We are just a few weeks out from the 2022 midterms and there is a lot to unpack — makeup of the House, will the Senate flip, the very future of our democracy! To help us understand what is truly at stake this Nov. 8, Katie brings on three political strategists to break it all down. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie is joined by her former podcast co-host (and current Democratic political and media strategist) Brian Goldsmith, as well as Lis Smith, who is a 20-year veteran of Democratic political campaigns -- from Barack Obama 2012 to Pete Buttigieg 2020 -- and Republican political consultant Mike Murphy who, with David Axelrod, hosts the political podcast “<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hacks-on-tap/id1467297559\">Hacks on Tap</a>”. The group walks through the biggest issues driving voters to the polls, the impact of <em>Roe</em>, the races that could change up Congress and how all of this affects what’s to come in 2024. Check out Lis Smith’s new memoir, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Any-Given-Tuesday-Political-Story/dp/0063084392\">Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story.</a>”</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
