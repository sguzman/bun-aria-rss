We also hear from Bloomberg Tax's Amanda Iacone about why these disclosure rules could be a boon for accountants. After all, someone has to audit all of those new corporate climate statements.\n\nDo you have feedback on this episode of On The Merits? Give us a call and leave a voicemail at 703-341-3690.",
