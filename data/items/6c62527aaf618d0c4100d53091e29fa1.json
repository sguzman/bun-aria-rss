  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats have been pushing the lie that the Russians elected Donald Trump in 2016 for years. This was the worst abuse in modern American history but for the subsequent abuses from Democrats toward the sitting President. Those who hate liberty are using the Constitution in order to destroy the Constitution. Then, Ketanji Brown Jackson dodged the question of defining a woman is because she intends to help Democrats redefine the legal definition of what a woman is in future supreme court cases on women's sports and transgender school cases. This activist Judge is a happy progressive warrior. Later, wheat shortages in Russia and Ukraine will not impact the U.S, but President Biden's energy and economic policies are doing plenty of damage. Rising gas prices and inflation are driving up the cost of American goods. Biden is the cause of food shortages in America, not Putin. Afterward, U.S Senate candidate from Pennsylvania Dr. Mehmet Oz calls in to discuss how we was unceremoniously dismissed from the President's Council on Fitness and Nutrition over what he surmises was Biden's unhappiness with his political positions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
