This is Films To Be Buried With perfection, as anyone with even a passing interest in cinema has surely fallen in love with Mark’s podcasts and books, and it’s such a great chance to hear him talk at length about those favourites of his along with a healthy dose of sprinkled in gems and treasures from his life in film criticism. From being a fan of cold water swimming (I hope Mark is familiar with Wim Hof, that’s a team up waiting to happen), to The Exorcist (a lifelong obsession), to crying in cinemas, to meeting his wife aka “the good lady professor her indoors”, to the fetishistic act of loading a film onto a projector, to old cinemas, and ultimate salvation through film.
