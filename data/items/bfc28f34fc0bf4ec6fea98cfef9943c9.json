  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. If you’re interested in buying some video game stocks but don’t understand the differences between the U.S-based big three; Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)... Today’s show is right up your alley. In comparison to movies, TV studios, and other corners of the entertainment industry, no other sector has seen this much success in recent quarters. In fact, video game stocks have been in an all-out frenzy...  Revenues are growing… share prices are reaching new all-time highs almost every week… and the combined market-cap of these companies now reach over $80 billion. Over the last two years alone, shares of Take-Two have nearly tripled, Activision has more than doubled, and EA is up over 80%.  Unlike, let’s say, just five years ago… Video game companies no longer have to wait till Christmas time to make their profits. Those days are over. Today, digital revenues now come from an array of sources like in-game advertising, downloadable map-packs, full-game downloads, subscriptions… along with the consumer's ability to purchase virtual cars, clothes, and guns with real dollars - pushing company valuations even higher. Let’s not forget to mention their impact on the world of mobile gaming... Now although I wouldn’t be going all-in at these levels, on today’s show, I jump into the nitty-gritty. And give away my favorite bet out of the three. Switching gears, I turn my focus to a sector that is showing no signs of slowing down. It’s sort of like the video game industry with only more potential. Like four times the potential.  I’m calling out what some investors in this sector are failing to do:  Looking at the bottom-line numbers and fundamentals… NOT only the stock price. (Yes, some are expensive) Investing in future growth catalysts… NOT only in momentum (cough, cough, Nvidia).  The truth is, there are still several companies out there climbing at only 15x forward earnings… in a sector that’s still very much in its infancy. Special thanks to George, Sheryl, and Jerry for all the questions. Keep them coming at Frank@CurzioResearch.com Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
