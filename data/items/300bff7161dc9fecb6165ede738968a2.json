We are taking selections from the 9 PAGES of Ask Us Anything questions that we were sent by our listeners and answering them here on the podcast. If your question had to do with books and reading, we probably didn’t answer it, not because we don’t love it, but because many of them lend themselves to a full deep-dive! Any books or resources that we mentioned are linked up below for your reference, along with time-stamps, of course.
