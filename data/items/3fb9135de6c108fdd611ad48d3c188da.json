  "description": "<p>Benchmarks, such as COCO, play a crucial role in object detection. However,\nexisting benchmarks are insufficient in scale variation, and their protocols\nare inadequate for fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce the\nUniversal-Scale object detection Benchmark (USB). USB has variations in object\nscales and image domains by incorporating COCO with the recently proposed Waymo\nOpen Dataset and Manga109-s dataset. To enable fair comparison and inclusive\nresearch, we propose training and evaluation protocols. They have multiple\ndivisions for training epochs and evaluation image resolutions, like weight\nclasses in sports, and compatibility across training protocols, like the\nbackward compatibility of the Universal Serial Bus. Specifically, we request\nparticipants to report results with not only higher protocols (longer training)\nbut also lower protocols (shorter training). Using the proposed benchmark and\nprotocols, we conducted extensive experiments using 15 methods and found\nweaknesses of existing COCO-biased methods.
