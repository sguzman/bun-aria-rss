  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's MNF game and how the Patriots stink, if the Bills are for real, and much much more. Joining the show, per usual, is the probable 2020 NFL MVP, QB for the Green Bay Packers, and good friend of the program, Aaron Rodgers. Aaron and Pat chat about the likelihood that he's named MVP, why it does mean a lot to him, teams having to go through Lambeau in the playoffs, Sunday's statement win against the Titans, and much much more (20:29-1:08:13). Also joining the program fresh off a breakthrough performance on Sunday Night Football, 2nd round pick of the Green Bay Packers, \"The Sauce,\" AJ Dillon. Pat and AJ chat about his huge game against the Titans, how that moment was the result of a lot of hard work, and how good it felt afterwards, whether or not Connor actually met him in the hole and drove him out of bounds in high school, what it's like having Aaron as a teammate, and how special that Running Back room in Green Bay is (1:14:12-1:37:11). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, current ESPN NFL analyst, and friend of the show, Ryan Clark joins the program. Pat and Ryan chat about everything happening around the NFL and look ahead at what's still to come in the NFL playoffs (1:37:13-2:00:52).
