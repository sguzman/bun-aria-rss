  "description": "Live coverage of mass shooting in Brooklyn subway station. Buck says, \"They're saying it's not being investigated as an act of terror yet. That can change. I think it's likely to change.\" Bidenflation hits 41-year high of 8.5%. Clay notes this would probably be unheard of to anyone but those who lived through the Jimmy Carter era. China's lockdown zero-covid strategies are cruel and delusional, and, C&B say, a reminder to everyone how far governments will go to fight covid and that it's not done here either. Philadelphia brings back mask mandates. How many other cities will follow suit, as the lib ones usually do? After spending $300 million, the \"staggering\" news is that CNN+ draws fewer than 10,000 daily views. November 8th must be a \"reckoning.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
