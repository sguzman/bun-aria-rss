    "media:description": "Where do complex functions come from? In this video we explore the idea of analytic continuation, a powerful technique which allows us to extend functions such as sin(x) from the real numbers into the complex plane. Using analytic continuation we can finally define the zeta function for complex inputs and make sense of what it is the Riemann Hypothesis is claiming.\n\nIf you would like to support the production of our content, we have a Patreon!
