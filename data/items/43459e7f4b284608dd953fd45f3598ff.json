  "description": "<p>In this week’s episode, we cover a bacterium whose recent emergence and rapid spread has been largely an epidemic of our own making.&nbsp;<em>Clostridium difficile</em>&nbsp;isn’t your typical pathogen - in many cases it’s not even considered a pathogen, just a normal member of our gut microbiota. But when something disrupts our gut microbiota, like antibiotics,&nbsp;<em>C. difficile</em>&nbsp;is given the freedom to spread its wings, wreaking deadly havoc on our bodies especially when it refuses to leave. We explore the characteristics of this bacterium that make it such a terrifying public health threat, delve into its recent-but-not-as-recent-as-you-might-think history, and chat about the current status of&nbsp;<em>C. diff</em>&nbsp;before asking the question, “what can poo do for you?” That’s right, we’re taking this opportunity to talk about one of our all-time favorite medical interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation.
