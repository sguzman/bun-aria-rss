  "title": "PMS 2.0 187 - Rhodes Scholar & NFL Alum, Dr. Myron Rolle, Clay Matthews, & Ike Taylor Stop By For Incredible Convos.. Also, Legend, AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by Rhodes Scholar, former Florida State Legend and Tennessee Titan, and current neurosurgeon, Dr. Myron Rolle. Dr. Rolle explains what the Rhodes Scholar is and why it was so important to him, how he managed to juggle going pre-med while playing football at Florida State, and what the experience at Oxford was like. Dr. Rolle also explains what things have been like at Mass General in Boston during the covid19 pandemic, and he chats about where we are currently at with it, where he sees it going over the next few months, and answers some common misconceptions about the virus (00:00:56-26:40). On another edition of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome on Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2010 PFWA NFL Defensive Player of the Year, former Green Bay Packer and Los Angeles Ram, Clay Matthews. Clay chats with the guys about being snubbed by the all-decade team, and why he thinks he may have been overlooked, his recent tweets about the Rams being late on payments to both he and Todd Gurley, and Clay reminisces on his time at USC and remembers meeting Pat when they were at the Rookie Symposium together (1:15:30-1:38:28). Pat and AJ also discuss their plans for the 2020 NFL Draft, and everything else going on both the football and sports world (26:42-1:57:29). To close things out, 2x Super Bowl Champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor, FaceTimes with Pat and the boys. They discuss what it was like playing against Aaron Rodgers in Super Bowl XLV, and describes what it is like when a quarterback enters \"the matrix,\" and Ike gives his thoughts on Tua's injury history and how he thinks that translates to the NFL, and whether or not playing in the SEC is in anyway similar to being in the NFL (1:57:31-2:17:16). Be sure to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch, and stay safe this weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
