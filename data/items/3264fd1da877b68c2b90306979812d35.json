  "description": "To celebrate the fourth anniversary of Deep State Radio (which is to say something like 750 podcasts and a growing audience throughout), we have convened our inner circle of experts, our regular Deep State family, for a look four years from now. As you might expect, we have optimism, pessimism, realism, idealism, and a host of other flavors of outlook from which you can choose. It is the right way to celebrate the past four years and--especially--our deep gratitude to each and every Deep State nerd out there who has helped make the podcast and all of its spin-offs such a success. Don't miss it. And...thank you everybody! We look forward to the next four years!  \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
