Specifically, Connor and Dan discuss French philosopher Jacques Derrida (AKA Dr. Jack Dorito) who is the father of deconstruction. They take on binaries and ideologies and all the terribly comfortable things we take for granted without ever examining. Also discussed, ska podcasts, adults on scooters, and 70s talk shows. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
