  "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to the fiftieth episode special of Economics Detective Radio! Today we have Ash Navabi back on the program, but we’re flipping the script: Ash will be interviewing me about the show and about all the things I’ve learned while making it.</p> <p>In this episode, I alienate the political right by discussing the importance of labour mobility and the desirability of open borders. I also alienate the political left by expressing a lukewarm position on climate change. I also discuss my own research plans relating to <a href= \"http://economicsdetective.com/2016/12/wrongful-convictions-exoneration-criminal-justice-samuel-gross/\" target=\"_blank\">law and economics</a>.</p> <p>Finally, we discuss literature!
