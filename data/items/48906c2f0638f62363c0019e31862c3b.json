  "description": "<p>January 22, 1984. New Orleans, Louisiana. The police received a 911 call from the Mintz home. Aaron Mintz claimed that&nbsp;he woke up to a loud bang and found his wife, Palma, dead in the master bedroom with a gunshot wound to the head. However, investigators suspected him of murder after they found a pillow with an obvious bullet hole in another room and Palma’s arm at an angle inconsistent with having shot herself. Did Aaron Mintz shoot his wife and stage it to look like a suicide? Or was there another explanation?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
