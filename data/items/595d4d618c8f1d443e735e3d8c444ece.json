  "title": "#126: Christianity, Masculinity and Some Manly Maxims With Stephen Mansfield",
  "description": "<p>During the past few centuries, Christian churches have had some difficulty reaching men. During the late 19th century and even today, Christian churches have created special programs to get men in the pews.<br />But why does trouble exist in the first place? And what can be done about it?<br />In today's podcast I talk to author and speaker Stephen Mansfield about this issue as well as his book Mansfield's Book of Manly Men. If you're a Christian, you'll find Stephen's insights about the church and men interesting; if you're not a Christian, you can still get a lot out of our later conversation about the virtues and ideals Stephen thinks men should strive for and the great men from history we should study and emulate.</p>\n",
