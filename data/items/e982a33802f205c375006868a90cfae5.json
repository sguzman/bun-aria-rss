  "description": "I did my PhD at Monash University under the supervision of Ingrid Zukerman and Fabian Bohnert. I started in March 2009 and submitted my thesis in August 2012. When excluding time spent on conference trips and three months of an internship with Google, it took about three years of work to complete the PhD, which is not too bad for a 100% research program (no coursework was required at the time)."
