  "description": "<p>If you struggle to lose weight, you may blame an inherently slow metabolism. But is your metabolism really to blame, and can you increase it in order to burn more fat?</p><p>Today we tackle these questions and more with Dr. John Berardi, who earned a PhD in exercise physiology and nutrient biochemistry, and is a writer, athlete, coach, and professor, as well as the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/about/john-berardi\" target=\"_blank\">Precision Nutrition</a> and the founder of the <a href=\"https://www.changemakeracademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Change Maker Academy</a>. John and I begin our discussion with what metabolism is, the components that make it up, how much each element contributes to your body's energy expenditures, and which can be controlled. We then get into whether or not it's true that some people have an inherently slow or fast metabolism, and how diet and exercise influences your metabolism, including whether or not dieting itself can slow your metabolism down, and why you might want to consider wearing a weight vest around once you lose body fat. We then discuss how intermittent fasting can increase your metabolic flexibility, whether there are certain foods that boost your metabolic rate, and the best exercise routine for optimizing your metabolism. We also also talk about how stress and sleep effect your metabolic health. We end our conversation with John's best tips for maintaining optimal metabolic health and losing weight in general.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/metabolism\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/metabolism</a>.</p>\n",
