  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat celebrates his 32nd birthday by looking ahead at what’s to come this next year, and reflects a little bit on the past. Pat also previews a massive opportunity presenting itself after some having some meetings with Westwood One, and he also addresses the Monday Night Football situation and his thoughts on the what is potentially next. Pat and the guys also talk about the Walmart by Pat’s house, and discuss his love for Applebee’s and the drastic deviation in their service from visit to visit. The guys also cover whether or not Jeopardy! is fixed with the current champion, wonder what Regis Philbin is up to, and try to decide how people in Hollywood manage to not age at all. For Throwback Thursday, stick around after the show for an incredible interview with Bob Pennington and Scott Neil, two of the original horse soldiers/Green Beret’s that the film “12 Strong,” starring Chris Hemsworth, was based on. They do a deep dive into their mission, describing a part of our world that very few humans know about, chat about what they thought of the film based on them, and discuss their new Horse Soldier Bourbon Whiskey from their new company American Freedom Distillery (1:14:08-2:18:18). It’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
