  "description": "<p>I recently had a friend admit to me that he didn't feel \"worthy of success.\" The reality is...a lot of people feel like that. They feel like a fraud. They feel like they are running behind. They feel like there is some \"secret formula\" that's complicated & too sophisticated for them to understand. Listen...all of us feel lost & like we don't know what we're doing. In this episode, I talk about how to overcome that & we share OG stories about the early days of MFCEO. (Oh...& we announce contest winners!)</p>",
