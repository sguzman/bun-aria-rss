  "description": "Frank is on the road, so I (Daniel) am behind the mic to break down the extreme market volatility… I review last Friday’s higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading… the resulting selloff… how the Fed is rattling the markets… and what to expect from tomorrow’s Fed meeting (where we should expect more aggressive rate hikes). Turning to the selloff in cryptocurrencies, I highlight what’s causing investors to panic… and two crypto bulls handling the negativity the right way.  In this episode:  The real reason behind Friday’s selloff [1:15] Why extreme volatility is the new normal [5:50] How to take advantage of bear market rallies [8:25]  What to expect from the Fed meeting tomorrow [13:15]  What’s causing panic in the crypto markets? [18:30]  Pay attention to this crypto CEO [21:40]  Enjoyed this episode?
