  "description": "<p>As president of the Los Angeles Lakers, Jeanie Buss is one of the most powerful women in global sports. In her 18th season with the club, Buss leads all aspects of the franchise's business operations, which includes marketing, sponsorship and media relationships. Buss also oversees basketball operations, which she recently entrusted to former Lakers great Magic Johnson after firing not only her brother, Jim, but longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak after what would be described in business as a hostile takeover attempt. Buss is a member of the NBA's powerful finance and labor committees, and is now charged with getting the Lakers past Slowtime and back to Showtime. Buss speaks with Business of Sports co-hosts Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr about seizing control of the team, Magic, resurrecting the Lakers and, of course, whether she'd pick Lonzo Ball with the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
