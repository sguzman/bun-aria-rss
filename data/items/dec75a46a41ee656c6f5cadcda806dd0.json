  "description": "In today's podcast we discuss Internet-of-things threats, not only botnets assembled from compromised security cameras, but also medical device hacking (with Conficker) as a way of stealing patient information. More insurance sector breaches appear to be in progress, too. The Sprashivai social network is compromised. The Infy espionage infrastructure is taken down (but may return—they often do). NERC standards for power grid cyber security take effect today. John Leisebeor from Quintessence Labs explains key management within a security framework, and we learn about DevOps from Cybric's Mike Kail and eGlobalTech's Branko Primetica.",
