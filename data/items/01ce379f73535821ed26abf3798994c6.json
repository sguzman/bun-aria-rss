  "description": "The wait is over... It’s been a long time coming, but the AT&T-Time Warner merger is happening. This is one of the largest deals in history, and I’ll break it all down for you on today’s show… I’ll also tell you why this is such an amazing opportunity for AT&T investors. And, this week, I welcome back my good friend―and host of The Disciplined Investor―Andrew Horowitz. Andrew and I have a spirited discussion on everything from the Fed to commodities to tariffs to ―of course―cryptocurrencies... Andrew also shares some of his favorite investing ideas―both on the long and short side. Trust me… you’ll want to listen to this interview more than once... so let’s get started.  Note: In case you didn’t see my email earlier... I decided to reopen the best deal we’ll ever offer on our new Crypto Intelligence service until Friday. After Friday, no one will ever see this offer again…  to get the charter deal.",
