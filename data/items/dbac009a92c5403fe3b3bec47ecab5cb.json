Part of her winning strategy was to shut down all her mental chatter and completely focus on the competition. But when the cameras are off, she struggles to find the same calm. For today’s show, Amy tries a body scan practice to connect with her body and quiet her busy mind. Later we hear from Jonathan Greenberg, a Harvard psychology professor. He explains how mindfulness can make us better problem solvers, and how that can benefit our emotional health, too.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Find a quiet place where you feel safe and comfortable. You can be standing, sitting, or lying down.</p></li>\n<li><p>Close your eyes, and take a few deep, long breaths.</p></li>\n<li><p>Move your attention through your body slowly, part by part, starting with your feet.
