  "title": "NFC North Offseason Priorities: What's the Bears solution at quarterback? How the Packers can keep building around Rodgers (Football 2/25)",
  "description": "Our offseason priority series continues with a focus on the NFC North. On this episode, Will Brinson and Jordan Dajani tackle the needs for the Lions (4:00), Vikings (13:30), Bears (21:00) and Packers (28:45). Detroit has a new coach and a new quarterback and pretty much needs help across the board. But where should they target first? Minnesota has some pieces but could use a boost at all three levels of their defense. We then arrive at Chicago and a looming decision they must make on the future of Mitchell Trubisky with their organization. Green Bay is in a good spot but their roster building will be critical for getting them over the hump after two consecutive NFC Championship Game losses.\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
