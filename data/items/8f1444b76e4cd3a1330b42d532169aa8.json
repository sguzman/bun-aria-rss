  "description": "if you are a frequent listener of anything goes, you know i love talking about life, life philosophy, society as whole, etc... i like sharing my opinions, discussing those things broadly and openly. there's two things about that: 1) i don't know everything and 2) i'm 21 and i'm still learning a lot and so naturally, i'm not always going to get it right. sometimes i will get it right, but i'm not always going to get it right and i am open to that. so in today's episode, i'm going to address some of the times when people disagreed with me heavily and i'm going to talk about it. i'm going to talk about whether i still stand by what i said, or if maybe my opinion has changed. i wanted to do this, because i feel like a lot of people are afraid of the natural and healthy evolution of the human mind over the course of your life where your ideas and your moral compass change over time. it can be humbling because you have to admit that you were wrong or didn't know enough about a topic at the time, but it's so so important. let's get into it. \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
