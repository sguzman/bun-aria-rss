  "title": "249 - H.P. Lovecraft, the Cthulhu Mythos, and the Horror You Love Today",
  "description": "<p>Hope you have as fun listening to this one as I had making it! I had no idea prior to digging into this topic, that Lovecraft was so influential on modern horror. Like Stranger Things? Heavily influenced by Lovecraft. Like Stephen King's It? The cosmic monster who presents as Pennywise is a creature who could have come directly from the Cthulhu mythos. Much of the Twilight Zone, the X-Files, the BBC's Black Mirror and more - so influenced by Lovecraft. And, in a way, fictional universes like the Marvel cinematic universe and George Lucas's Star Wars universe - influenced by the cosmic worldbuilding of Lovecraft. We feel a lot of his influence today - but who was the man? We'll take a look at that as well - including the ugly parts. And we'll meet some of his creatures and dissect the structure of some of Lovecraft's most influential stories. A very Weird Tales edition of Timesuck awaits! <br /><br />The first Bad Magic Productions June charity we are proud to donate $7,050 towards is Trinity Stables. They run a specialty program in Georgia called Stable Moments, a weekly mentorship program that utilizes equine-assisted learning to achieve life skills that better prepare foster and adopted kids for healthy transitions into adulthood.
