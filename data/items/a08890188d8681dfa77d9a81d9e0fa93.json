  "description": "<p>We live increasingly busy and complex lives and the same is true of our money. Repeatedly making smart money moves is hard. It’s easy for us to forget or just get plain lazy when it comes to doing the right thing with our funds. Between our different bank accounts, multiple credit cards, and debt obligations, it can be difficult for us to take action on a consistent basis that will have a long-lasting effect on our personal finances. That’s where automation comes in- it helps us to engineer money success ahead of time, instead of trusting ourselves in the moment to continually muster the willpower to make it happen. But like many of the financial tools at our disposal, it’s not all puppies and rainbows. So, in addition to the clear benefits, be sure to listen and learn why you should also be careful when it comes to employing automation in your personal finance life.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Dayglow IPA by Elysian Brewing Company - a big thanks to Joe in Minnesota for donating the beers to the show this week!
