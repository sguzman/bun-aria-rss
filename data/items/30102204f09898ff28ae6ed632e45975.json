  "description": "Now even Republican politicians are pushing voters to support red flag laws, but the MeToo movement already proved that people will ABUSE that power.

Dr. Robert Epstein joins the program to set the facts straight on his research into Google’s search result bias and the 2016 election — and why the mainstream media is denouncing it. Kevin Williamson joins the program to discuss his latest book, “The Smallest Minority,” about why people are becoming so hysterical over politics. And should we make our whole lives political, from working at Mojo Burrito to making movies?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
