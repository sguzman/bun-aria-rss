  "description": "<p>Meditation: Continuous Space Suffused with Awareness (2018-03-28) - By learning to inhabit the body, we discover the space and aliveness that fills the universe. In this meditation we are guided through the body, filling different domains with presence. We then open into the continuous awake space that is both within and surrounds the body. When we notice the mind drifts, we relax back to <em>be</em> that awake space, aware of the changing flow of sensations, thoughts, feelings and sounds.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation: \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\" when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
