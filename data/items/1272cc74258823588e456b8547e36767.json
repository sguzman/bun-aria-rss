  "description": "<p>We know that as viruses spread, their genetic makeup can change, meaning the virus can mutate into variants. In a scenario with mass vaccination, a mechanism called antibody-dependent enhancement can occur. This means that instead of stopping an infection, antibodies actually can become more infectious.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On today’s show, we’re diving into a new study on antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE. You’re going to learn specifics about how certain antibodies behave in the body, and how COVID-19 can become more infectious and transmissible through ADE. We’re going to talk about vaccination campaigns and efficacy, and what we should consider about vaccines.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>More importantly, we’re going to talk about the most urgent and relevant topic of all: how we can get our citizens and communities healthier to ward off disease and viral infections.
