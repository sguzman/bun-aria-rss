  "description": "<p>After the Equifax data breach where 148 million people’s personal information was compromised, it's especially easy to see how vulnerable we are as consumers. So now more than ever, is the time to freeze your credit! A new federal law has made it completely free to freeze and thaw your credit, so you don't have any more excuses. In this episode we talk about why this is so important, we cover what a freeze does (and what it doesn't do), and then we tell you exactly how to do it. Seriously it's so incredibly easy that it shouldn't take you more than about 5 minutes from start to finish!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Focal Banger by the Alchemist which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A huge thanks to our friend and pastor Matthew for donating this beer and supporting the show!
