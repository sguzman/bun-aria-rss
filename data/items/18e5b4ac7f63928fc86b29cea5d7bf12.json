  "description": "<p>What the Hell is going on in Northeastern Utah? If you just drove by, you might think that Skinwalker Ranch is just an innocent-seeming 512-acre parcel of land about 150 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. But this small patch of high desert ranch-land, and the Uintah Basin around it, is arguably home to more paranormal sightings over the last eighty years than any other similarly-sized geographical area in the world. Why? Why have thousands of UFO and cryptid sightings been reported? Demonic activity has been reported. There have been allegations of secret government psyops, wormhole sightings, and more. So many crazy stories! We look at the long history of alleged encounters in today's odd and very X-Files-ish edition of Timesuck! </p>\n<p><strong>Donating $6600 to the YWCA's Idaho County Fund!</strong> <br /><br />To donate yourself to this important cause, go to <strong><a href=\"http://ywcaidaho.org\">ywcaidaho.org</a> </strong>and earmark your donation to “General Fund Idaho County” by typing that in the comments section of the online donation form.
