April 25th is World Penguin Day and there’s never been a better time to sit down with renown Penguinologist Dr. Tom Hart, a research fellow with Oxford University. We chat all about life on Antarctica, how he counts colonies, how you can help him count colonies, what penguins smell like, behaviors he’s witnessed, and why he does NOT find penguins cute. Rather he sees them as stoic, badass, majestic and worthy of our respect. Also, which penguins are jackasses. Hint: it’s not jackass penguins.
