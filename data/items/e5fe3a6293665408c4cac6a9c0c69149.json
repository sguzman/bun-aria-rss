  "title": "Ep. 484 - A Tale Of Two Marches",
  "description": "Nearly 100,000 pro-lifers descend on Washington, D.C., for the 47th annual March For Life just one week after fewer than 10,000 shrieking, pink hat-clad leftists took to the nation’s capital for the fourth annual Women’s March. We will examine how the two back-to-back marches show us the stark difference between the modern Left and Right. Then, Bernie surges to the top of the polls just days before the Iowa caucuses. We will analyze how a decrepit communist became the future of the Democratic Party. Finally, in some sad news, basketball superstar Kobe Bryant and his young daughter die in a helicopter crash in California. We will try to make sense of the tragic news.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
