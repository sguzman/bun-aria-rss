  "description": "The BEST place to call someone out for talking sh*t is your own podcast.\n\nSofia is BACK and is joined by cult leader, Indy Blue! For the FIRST time we get a in-depth look at what life is like growing up as a young woman in the Mormon church and we learn quite a few things! Have you ever heard of the Provo Push? Maybe you should try it. Indy also explains her “beef” with Addison Rae, life as a young mom (shout out baby Seven), and her brand Lonely Ghosts. If you don’t want to move to Utah after this episode then you probably never will. Love you say it back, Sloots. \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nEpisode promo codes:\nAthena Club: http://www.athenaclub.com promo code: SOFIA\nLiquid IV: http://www.liquidiv.com promo code: SOFIA\nTheragun: http://www.theragun.com/SOFIA\nBrooklinen: http://www.brooklinen.com promo code: SOFIA\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
