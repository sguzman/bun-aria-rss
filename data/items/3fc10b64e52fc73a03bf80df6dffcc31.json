  "description": "Taking cues from soft robotics and the natural world, conceptual artist Anicka Yi builds lighter-than-air machines that roam and react like autonomous life forms. Her floating \"aerobes\" inspire us to think about new ways of living with machines -- and to ponder how they could evolve into living creatures. \"What if our machines could be more than just our tools, and instead, a new type of companion species?\" she asks.",
