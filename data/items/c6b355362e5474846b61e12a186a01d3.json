  "title": "87 - LIVE Questions VOX Podcast - Rob Bell, Embarrassed By The Bible, And Judgement.",
  "description": "1. Hi mike again - thank you for answering my question on your podcast.\nMy question is, what are your thoughts on Rob Bell? With a new book coming out and a successful podcast, Were you a part of the evangelical voice to excommunicate him or do you understand his perspective and theological journey?\n\n2. First of all, I was disheartened by the joke regarding a future podcast about your embarrassment with the Bible, when speaking in the context of the Noah story. That \"slippery slope\" may cause seekers to doubt the inspired Word of God. But then, when discussing the virtues of the meek from the Sermon on the Mount, you referenced Psalm 37 which is filled with God's righteous judgement towards evil/wicked people. Is that not the Noah story ( the one that embarrasses you), God's destruction of evil/wicked people to allow the meek or righteous to inherit the land?\n\n3. Can you help me understand Matthew 18:8, does judgement last forever? If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away, it is better for you to lose part of your body and live forever than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns forever.”\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
