  "title": "The most famous wallpaper in the world with Katy Polsby of CW Stockwell",
  "description": "<p>You may not be familiar with the name CW Stockwell, but you know its most iconic pattern: Martinique, the banana leaf print that graces the walls of the Beverly Hills Hotel.  Martinique was first released in 1942 - over the next eighty years it has become one of the world’s most recognizable wallpapers, but the company itself fell into neglect. Last year entrepreneur <strong>Katy Polsby</strong> relaunched the brand, and is in the process of bringing Martinique, alongside a fresh collection of patterns, to a new generation. In this episode of the <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, Polsby speaks with host Dennis Scully about how a career at West Elm, Serena & Lily and Warby Parker prepared her to be an entrepreneur, the legal challenges that come with owning a frequently copied pattern, and why she’s prioritizing a great website over showroom representation.  <i>This episode is sponsored by High Point Market and Paintzen. </i></p>\n",
