  "description": "<p>In this episode, Middlekauff gives his thoughts on Mel Tucker jumping ship from Colorado to Michigan State, why it's just another example of the Pac-12 being a \"Power 5\" conference in name only, why he agrees with former Texans GM Rick Smith that NFL teams should be spending more resources developing draft prospects instead of just evaluating them, and why the dead cap hit for a vet QB like Matt Stafford - and other big names - will prevent teams from trading them. He also answers listener questions in Middlekauff's Mailbag.
