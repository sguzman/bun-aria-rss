  "description": "I know I’m not supposed to talk about politics… but since they’re so directly tied to the stock market, it’s hard to avoid. For instance, with all the noise surrounding Trump’s impeachment trial, why is the stock market ignoring it? And what will it mean for the elections in November? There’s also plenty of noise about the recent Phase 1 deal with China. Don’t listen to the naysayers… this is a huge deal. Today I break down all of these headlines… and give you several names to pay attention to as one important sector begins to stabilize. That’s all in my educational segment [20:51]. But first, Andrew Horowitz, president and founder of Horowitz & Company, joins me for a wide-ranging interview. We discuss the record-setting bull market in stocks... the Federal Reserve’s influence on asset prices.... the coronavirus in China and how it could affect travel-related stocks... and more. And of course, Andrew shares a couple of his favorite ideas right now [54:04].  P.S. Most of you know I just returned from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas—the largest technology conference in the world—where I had exclusive access to some of the newest, coolest gadgets from the world’s biggest tech trends. Check out  for exclusive videos and interviews from CES 2020. -------------------------------- Enjoyed this episode?
