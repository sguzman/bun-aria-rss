  "description": "Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage’s last speech to the European Union put the “great” back in “Great Britain.” Echoing the American Revolution, he made clear that Britain is tired of the EU’s “anti-democratic” reign. And does Joe Biden even want to be president? He’s admitting that even he knows he’s too old. Author Peter Schweizer joins to discuss what must be asked of Hunter Biden and the whistleblower if they are called as witnesses in the Senate trial. But it seems the American people are more worried about the spreading coronavirus than impeachment. Senator Tom Cotton warns that this is China’s “Chernobyl,” and its data can’t be trusted. And StoryCorps’ Dave Isay brings another real-life story of the spirit of humanity.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
