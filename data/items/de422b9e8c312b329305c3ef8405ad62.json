  "description": "<p>Which branch of the military has the toughest training course for its officers and special operators is a matter of animated debate, but there's no question that the Army's Ranger School is a viable candidate for carrying that designation. Over nine weeks, and three grueling phases, soldiers undergo physical, mental, and emotional challenges that test their endurance, resilience, and leadership.</p>\n<p>My guest today went through Ranger School twice: first as an infantry officer in 2004, and then just last year as the first journalist to embed with a class all the way through the course. His name is <a href=\"https://www.willbardenwerper.com/\">Will Bardenwerper</a> and he wrote an article about his experience for <em>Outside Magazine</em> called <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2411895/army-ranger-school#:~:text=Will%20Bardenwerper%20is%20a%20former,and%20What%20History%20Leaves%20Unsaid.\">\"Army Ranger School Is a Laboratory of Human Endurance.\"</a> Will and I begin our conversation with why he wanted to observe Ranger School from a third-party perspective after participating in it firsthand as a soldier. Will then explains the difference between earning your tab by graduating from Ranger School and being an official Army Ranger who belongs to the Ranger Regiment special operations force. Will then gives us a big picture overview of the three phases of Ranger School: Benning Phase, Mountain Phase, and Swamp Phase. We then dive into what happens in each phase, taking side trips along the way into the controversy of allowing women into the course, whether or not it's gotten easier since Will went through, and the importance of doing well in the combat patrol exercises and peer reviews in which the students participate. We end our conversation discussing the lessons in endurance that civilians can take away from those who graduate from Ranger School and earn the tab.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/rangerschool\">aom.is/rangerschool</a>.</p>\n",
