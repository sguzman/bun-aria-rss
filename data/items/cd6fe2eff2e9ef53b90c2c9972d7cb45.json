    "media:description": "In this video I'm showing how to setup urql, a GraphQL client-side library, in Next.js with TypeScript and GraphQL Codegen.\n\nurql is a highly customisable and versatile GraphQL client with which you add on features like normalized caching. It's built to be both easy to use for newcomers to GraphQL, and extensible, to grow to support dynamic single-app applications and highly customized GraphQL infrastructure. In short, urql prioritises usability and adaptability. urql also generates the smallest client-side bundles with around 6kb, compared to Apollo GraphQL or Relay clients.",
