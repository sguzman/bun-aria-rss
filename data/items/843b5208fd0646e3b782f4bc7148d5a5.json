  "description": "EDM DJ 3LAU joins us today to discuss the intersection of blockchain technology and the music industry, breaking down the positive impact for both artists and fans. 3LAU first began to explore blockchain's potential role in the industry in 2018, when he launched the first ever blockchain-powered music festival, called Our Music Festival (OMF). Beginning in 2020, 3LAU began to experiment with selling his work as NFTs. In March of this year, he hosted an NFT auction of unreleased music and experiences, netting over $11 million from the sale. Drawing on these experiences, 3LAU tells us how blockchain technology allows artists to protect their work and has the potential to more directly involve fans in music festival curation, artists' creative processes, and more.",
