  "description": "The real story of the Little Mermaid is way more violent and grim than the Disney version, and does not have a happy ending. It's the story of a teenage mermaid who falls in love with a human and makes a deal to get legs, but that's where the similarities end. The original includes bald mermaids, daggers, and a great way to blackmail your kids into being good.<br>If you've ever wanted to know way, way too much detail about a mermaid society, but hate it when your characters have names or plausible motivations, this story is for you. But really, it's very weird, and it makes you wonder why it has not only survived to the modern day, but is incredibly popular and has inspired multiple retellings.<br>In the creature of the week, an ape man you can't hide anything from, but who has an extremely short attention span.<br>Connect with me on twitter: @mythpodcast<br>My e-mail: jason@mythpodcast.com<br>Find the show on iTunes!<br>Songs:<br>“The Temperature of the Air on the Bow of the Kaleetan” by Chris Zabriskie<br>\"Hypnic Jerk\" by Smith Comma John<br>\"La Valse de Marian\" by Marian Badoi<br>\"Keep on Moving\" by Ton<br>\"Rewound\" by Chris Zabriskie<br>\"Archimedes\" by Jason Staczek<br>\"Something Elated\" by Broke for Free<br>\"Wandering\" by Steve Combs<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
