  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is on location in Austin, Texas ahead of College GameDay tomorrow, as AJ Hawk is in studio with the boys. Pat, AJ, and the boys recap last night's Sunday Night Football on a Thursday game between the Bills and Rams, question why they doubted the Rams and how good Josh Allen is, how scary Buffalo's pass rush is going to be, try to diagnose what went wrong for the Rams and how they can improve things going forward. They also discuss Pat's experience thus far in the production meetings of College GameDay, how hot it is going to be tomorrow, and rebuilding chemistry with the other guys on the show. Later, Pat and AJ go through the entire Week 1 NFL slate and make their picks as we prepare for an incredible weekend of football (1:23:36-1:46:09). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> to watch the show. We appreciate the hell out of all you. Enjoy the games this weekend. We'll see you on Overreaction Monday. Cheers.</p>\n",
