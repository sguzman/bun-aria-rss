  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt discus the latest content from Disney, it’s ‘Lightyear’, the movie Andy saw that inspired his love for the Buzz Lightyear character and toys! Is it a fitting sorta’ origin for Buzz? And where is poor, poor Tim Allen? Then it’s time for the guys to grow up one more time with the latest coming-of-age film, ‘Cha Chan Real Smooth’. This time, a young man is adrift after college and falls for an older woman with her own personal challenges. And heartfelt hilarity follows from there. As it always does…? Chris and Matt have a quick discussion on Fathom’s “presentation” of The Thing” to celebrate its 40th&nbsp;Anniversary.&nbsp; There’s the interstellar review of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Straight To DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week! Then Matt and Chris close out the show by sharing their 5 Favorite Pixar Characters? I wouldn’t hold out hope for a Lightning McQueen appearance. Vroom Vroom! It’s The First Run!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-13:35: <strong>Intro/Lightyear</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">13:36-19:57: <strong>40th Anniversary Screening of The Thing</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">19:58-35:35: <strong>Physical Media Picks</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">35:36-46:44: <strong>Cha Cha Real Smooth</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">46:45-55:41: <strong>5 Favorite Pixar Characters</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">55:42-57:20: <strong>Wrap Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
