  "description": "Talented country artist Meghan Patrick sits down virtually with Fred this week to sip and talk whiskey. The conversation goes from a mutual love of Cheez-Its, wearing sweat pants during quarantine, bear hunting in Canada, dealing with \"miserable\" Internet trolls, and her bitter breakup with Jack Daniel's. Meghan surprisingly picks Woodinville Whiskey over contenders like Russell's Reserve Single Barrel, Smooth Amber Contradiction, Weller Antique Collection and Elijah Craig 12 year old, prompting Fred to excitedly declare it \"an upset of epic proportions.\" And, of course, they agree that vodka sucks.\n\nFOLLOW MEGHAN\n\nhttps://www.meghanpatrickmusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MegPatrickMusic/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MegPatrickMusic/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MegPatrickMusic/\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\n291 Colorado Whiskey: https://distillery291.com/ \n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
