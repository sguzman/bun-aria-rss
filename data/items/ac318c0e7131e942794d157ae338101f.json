  "title": "Country targeting update for products in Content API for Shopping and Google Ads API",
  "content": "<strong>On August 10, 2022, we announced a change to country targeting for shopping products with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products#Product.FIELDS.feed_label\"><code>feedLabel</code></a> field.</strong> We’d like to update you on the progress of this change. Here are our previous announcements: <ul>  <li>See <a href=\"http://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2022/08/feed-label-replaces-target-country-in.html\">Feed label replaces target country in Content API for Shopping</a> for the original announcement for the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/quickstart\">Content API for Shopping</a>.</li>  <li>See <a href=\"http://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2022/08/country-targeting-in-shopping-ads.html\">Country targeting in Shopping Ads campaigns is changing in August 2022</a> for the original announcement for the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/start\">Google Ads API</a>.</li></ul> <strong>What’s already changed</strong><br /><br /> <em>Google Ads:</em><br /> Any Google Ads account can set the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v11/Campaign.ShoppingSetting#feed_label\"><code>feed_label</code></a> field in <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v11/Campaign.ShoppingSetting\"><code>ShoppingSetting</code></a> for Shopping and Performance Max campaigns. You can set <code>feed_label</code> in the Google Ads UI and the Google Ads API.<br /><br /> <em>Merchant Center &amp; Content API:</em><br /> As of September 14th, 2022 we‘ve started the gradual rollout of feed labels in the Merchant Center UI. When this feature is enabled in the UI, merchants will be able to create a new feed with <strong>feed label</strong> set to any valid string. See <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12453549\">Use feed labels to advertise products from specific feeds</a> for more information.<br /><br /> In the Content API, you might see the following</em>: <ul>  <li>Products that have only <code>feedLabel</code>, and not <code>targetCountry</code>, if they were added in the Merchant Center UI.</li>  <li>Products with feed labels that aren’t two-letter country codes.</li></ul> You can now use <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products/update\"><code>Products.update</code></a> to update products by <code>feedLabel</code>. For example, if you had a product with <code>offerId</code> of “111111111” and a <code>feedLabel</code> set to “WINTERPRODUCTS”, you can now update attributes such as <code>salePrice</code> for that product by making the following call:<br /> HTTP request:<br /><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-json\"><br />PATCH https://shoppingcontent.googleapis.com/content/v2.1/{merchantId}/products/online:en:WINTERPRODUCTS:1111111111<br /></pre> Example request body:<br /><pre class=\"prettyprint lang-json\"><br />{<br />  \"salePrice\": {<br />    \"value\": \"17.99\",<br />    \"currency\": \"USD\"<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre> <em>Behavior summary:</em><br /> Here’s a clarification of the current API behavior for <code>feedLabel</code>: <ul>  <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> You can only call <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products/insert\"><code>Products.insert</code></a> on products with a matching <code>feedLabel</code> and <code>targetCountry</code>. Currently, <code>Products.insert</code> might return an error if you don’t provide a matching <code>targetCountry</code>. This behavior hasn’t changed if you continue to use only <code>targetCountry</code>.</li>  <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> If you set <code>feedLabel</code> to a valid 2-letter CLDR territory code, you must still set the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products#ProductShipping\">shipping</a> attribute of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products#resource:-product\">products</a> resource to the same country in order to target that country. For example, if you set a new <code>feedLabel</code> to “US”, you must also set the <code>country</code> field in the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products#ProductShipping\">shipping</a> attribute to “US”. If you don’t set both fields, the product might not be eligible to serve in that country. You can configure targeting for an entire feed in the Merchant Center UI.</li>  <li><strong>Get/List:</strong> When you use <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products/list\"><code>Products.list</code></a> or <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products/get\"><code>Products.get</code></a>, you might see products that only have <code>feedLabel</code> (and not <code>targetCountry</code>) set if they were added in the Merchant Center UI.</li>  <li><strong>Product IDs:</strong> Once a <code>feedLabel</code> is set for a product it becomes part of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/products/feed-labels#offer_id\">product Id</a>. This means you can’t modify the <code>feedLabel</code> for that product (this is similar to how <code>language</code> works). If you wish to change the <code>feedLabel</code> you will need to create a new product with a different product Id.</li></ul> <strong>What’s coming next</strong><br /><br /> <em>Products:</em><br />Once the gradual rollout of feed labels in the Merchant Center UI is complete, we will accept <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products/insert\"><code>Products.insert</code></a> calls with <code>feedLabel</code> set to any string. At this point, including <code>targetCountry</code> will become optional.<br /><br /> <em>Datafeeds:</em><br />In late September, we will also update the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/datafeeds\"><code>datafeeds</code></a> resource to include feedLabel in the Content API for Shopping.<br /><br /> <strong>Opt out of receiving products and datafeeds without a country</strong><br />If you’re concerned your codebase cannot handle products and datafeeds without a country, and you want to opt out of receiving them via the Content API for Shopping, fill out the following form: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezbSFNu6Hu3XCYVo7qs0hD8yjQML-3pklC_cp-3z-tJnjhgA/viewform?usp=sf_link\">Feed label replaces target country in the Content API for Shopping - temporary exemption</a>. When you’re ready to support <code>feedLabel</code>, you can opt back in to receiving these offers.<br />If you have any questions about this change, please visit the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-content-api-for-shopping\">Content API for Shopping forum</a>.<br /> <span class='byline-author'><img height=\"40\" width=\"40\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DDE180jto6tcgXfgP8OUY-mE6P57Zpll9sZ8d1WDzi98Yfa0ZIsMFtg4RI-XDuwszxfcd58rPtmss-jzzFkdLdTS6cKlMX0mZi5SFUe8uYi2c0x4VTSEpFNO8fcd6b6WBVpGxbC6rA\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; border:none;\"/> Ian Ballantyne, Content API for Shopping Team</span>",
