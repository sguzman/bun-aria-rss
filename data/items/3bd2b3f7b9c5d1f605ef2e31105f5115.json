  "title": "Disease Ecology (LYME/TICK-BORNE ILLNESSES) with Andrea Swei",
  "description": "<p>Lyme Disease! Powassan virus! That Lonestar tick meat allergy! Paralysis ticks! Acarology taught us all about the eight-legged villains that aim for our crevices, but Disease Ecologist Dr. Andrea Swei offers a deep dive under the skin to learn more about what nasties a tick can give us. We chat a whole bunch about Lyme Disease: its prevalence, testing, treatment, which animals carry it, “chronic Lyme” vs. post-treatment Lyme. We also cover how lizards might harbor a helpful protein, two Ukrainian princesses by the names of Borrelia and Babesia, why you'll want chickens and possums hanging out at your barbecues, Lyme vaccines, pet care, symptoms, prevention and what scares her most. This one's a wonderful episode on its own, but is even better as a follow up to Acarology: the nightmare lesson of how ticks work. </p><p>Listen to the Acarology (TICKS) episode: <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/acarology\" target=\"_blank\">alieward.com/ologies/acarology</a></p><p>Follow Dr. Swei on Twitter @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Andeswei\" target=\"_blank\">Andeswei<strong> </strong></a>or @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SweiLab\" target=\"_blank\">SweiLab </a></p><p>Donations went to: <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org\" target=\"_blank\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, and <a href=\"https://826valencia.org\" target=\"_blank\">826 Valencia</a></p><p>Sponsor links: “You” podcast by Okta; <a href=\"http://Kiwico.com/Ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Kiwico.com/Ologies</a>; <a href=\"http://HelixSleep.com/Ologies\" target=\"_blank\">HelixSleep.com/Ologies</a>; <a href=\"http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">thegreatcoursesplus.com/ologies</a></p><p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/diseaseecology\" target=\"_blank\">alieward.com/ologies/diseaseecology</a></p><p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/ologies</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/ologies</a></p><p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/AlieWard</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/AlieWard</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"http://instagram.com/Jarrett_Sleeper\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of <a href=\"http://www.mindjammedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MindJam Media</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
