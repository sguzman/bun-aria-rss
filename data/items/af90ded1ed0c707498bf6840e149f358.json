We are slaves to vices and devices, to our schedules and our poor self-talk. We’re reactive.

We are chained down in a prison of our own making and it’s high time for us to break out, to break free.</p><p>But how? The answer comes from Marcus Aurelius and the fact that it came from such a busy man with so many obligations and responsibilities should not be forgotten:</p><p><b><em>If you seek tranquillity, do less. Or (more accurately) do what’s essential – what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.</em></b></p><p><b><em>Because most of what we say and do is not essential.
