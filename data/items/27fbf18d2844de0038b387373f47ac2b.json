    "media:description": "New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 23 \n\nYou have probably heard the quip: \"data is the new oil.\" What does that mean, and what does it imply?

This is truly an issue of global importance!\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
