The motivation behind the event was to create a tactile, analog experience for 1,100 people to gather around shared purpose and passion. An opportunity to cultivate community. Raise consciousness. Elevate intimacy. Deepen personal connectivity around our collective humanity — and the important ideas of our time.</p><p>An unforgettable lifetime moment, the resulting impact exceeded my wildest expectations. I'm still basing in the glow. And deeply grateful for an experience that left me feeling more intimately connected with all of you — and optimistic about the future of our planet.</p><p>The program opens with the poetic spoken word genius of my friend and two-time podcast guest IN-Q (check out <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-81-spoken-word-poet-in-q-on-reimagining-your-truth/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 81</a>&nbsp;&&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/in-q-have-you-ever-been-excited-for-now-rrp-118/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 118</a>).</p><p>Named to Oprah Winfrey's <a href=\"http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-100/creatives/in-q\" target=\"_blank\">SuperSoul 100</a> list of the world's most influential thought leaders, IN-Q is a National Poetry Slam Champion, multi-platinum songwriter, and world-renowned keynote speaker.

He has been featured in major media ranging from Forbes to AdWeek and several of his recent videos have gone viral with over 60 million combined views.</p><br><p>I then take the stage to share some thoughts, including a powerful listener e-mail, before settling into a fascinating conversation with Paul Hawken — one of the world's pre-eminent authorities on global climate change and a man who has indelibly shaped my personal perspective on ecological responsibility.</p><p>A pioneering environmentalist, activist, entrepreneur, architect of corporate reform, and multiple New York Times bestselling author, Paul has dedicated his life to environmental sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment. His work includes founding successful ecologically conscious businesses (including the natural foods market Erewhon), writing about the impacts of commerce on living systems and consulting with heads of state and CEOs on economic development, industrial ecology and environmental policy.&nbsp;In addition to penning countless op-eds and peer reviewed articles, Paul has written 8 books, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143130447/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0143130447&linkId=47021ecf265e6d02f0fc7ce0f972420c\" target=\"_blank\">Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming.</a>&nbsp;Paul is also the Founder and Founding Executive Director of <a href=\"https://www.drawdown.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Drawdown,</a> an extraordinary non-profit dedicated to researching and implementing solutions for reversing global warming</p><p>Paul has lectured everywhere, including Harvard, Stanford and Wharton.
