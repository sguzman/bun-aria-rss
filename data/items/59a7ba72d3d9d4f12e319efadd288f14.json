  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 82: Bye Bruins, Caps Year, Game 7 & More",
  "description": "<p><p>This week's first playoff episode kicks off discussing the Caps finally slaying the Penguins and getting out of the Second Round. The boys then do a Bruins autopsy after the Lightning licked them in five games. Spittin' Chiclets has been marveling at what the Vegas Golden Knights have done since October and the crew gets into how they took apart San Jose (it's Marc-Andre Fleury). Then they get into Nashville and Winnipeg Game 7 just as the Preds close out the Jets in Game 6. In addition to the pucks, the guys also go off on their usual addled rants and RA gets Simpsons Tourette Syndrome again.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
