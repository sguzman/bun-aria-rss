  "description": "Contributor(s): Leena Koni Hoffmann, Rachel Bezner-Kerr, Miltone Ayieko | The COVID-19 pandemic is set to radically increase food insecurity in Africa, exacerbating an issue that has only worsened in recent years. The World Bank warns Africa is heading from a health crisis into a food crisis, and the United Nations predicts the rate of chronic malnutrition over the next twelve months could double.\nDecisive lockdowns, imposed by many African governments to prevent the virus’ spread, have disrupted the continent’s supply chains and led to rising unemployment. At the same time, huge locust swarms continue to devastate crops across East Africa and, in the continent’s southern region, years of drought have led to repeated crop failures. African countries have quickly become more reliant on externally sourced food at a time when international markets are experiencing unprecedented changes.\nGovernment and international interventions are already in motion, but questions remain about the scale and nature of their delivery. This is especially the case for people living in conflict-affected regions, where humanitarian food aid is harder to deliver.\nWhat can be done to address the upcoming emergency? If regional or global collaboration is needed, how and when can this be delivered for those most in need?\nJoin our event as experts discuss the outlook for the continent’s food security, and what measures should be taken.",
