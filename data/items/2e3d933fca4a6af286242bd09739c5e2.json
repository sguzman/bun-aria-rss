  "description": "President Biden's Cyber Executive Order includes provision for a software bill of materials in government contracts. It's a critical and necessary first measure for protecting the software supply chain. To defend against cyber attacks like the ones that affected SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline, organizations also need transparency about the way the software in their supply chain behaves–how, and with whom, that software engages in and outside of their networks.\nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, we explore how behavior transparency can give organizations an advantage by distinguishing between expected noise and indications of compromise..Guest and CyberWire Podcast Partner Caleb Barlow shares his insights with the CyberWire's Rick Howard, and Ben Higgins and Ted Driggs from sponsor ExtraHop offer their thoughts to the CyberWire's Dave Bittner.",
