  "title": "How Do I Find My Style? [55]",
  "description": "<p>This week's episode was inspired by a question from an artist who wrote: \"I can draw well, and I paint in watercolour and acrylics but my style is all over the place. How can I find a style and settle on it?\" We discuss whether you need to settle on a specific style, or whether it's OK to have multiple strings to your bow. Perhaps this varies depending on your goals for your art. We also share our own individual journeys, &nbsp;and debate whether there are concrete steps you can take to find your own style. An artist's style, we agree, is the result of many different choices (subject matter, media, process, and decisions about colour and design and value among many other things). But it is also something that evolves - and that is perhaps never fully defined. After all, many of the \"greats\" changed styles multiple times as they explored different ideas or different ways of making their work. Most of, we both feel that your style is something that comes through doing rather than thinking - you must make work and in the process of making that work, you find your style.</p>\n<p>This is also one with giggles over builders, a few tears and even disagreements over confectionery!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Join the free Art2Life online workshop HERE: <a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/art2life/\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/art2life/</a></p>\n<p>Lesley Birch: <a href=\"https://www.lesleybirchartist.com/\">https://www.lesleybirchartist.com/</a></p>\n<p>Alice Sheridan - Canopy: <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/landscape-unlocked/\">https://alicesheridan.com/landscape-unlocked/</a></p>\n<p>Laura Horn Art podcast: <a href=\"https://www.laurahornart.com/thepodcast\">https://www.laurahornart.com/thepodcast</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
