  "description": "<p>In the History Goes Bump Podcast's second Bonuscast, we share an interview we did in October before Halloween of 2014 with the Writestream Radio Network.  The interview was done at Blog Talk Radio, so we apologize for the horrible audio quality.  Host and writer Daria DiGiovanni picks both of our brains about the topic of the paranormal, specifically ghosts and asks us about the show and its origins.  If you missed this interview when we shared it on social media at the time we conducted, then this is your chance to get to know us hosts a little better!</p> <p>Check out Daria's website here: <a href= \"http://www.dariadigiovanni.com/\">http://www.dariadigiovanni.com/</a></p> <p>Writestream Radio network can be found here:  <a href= \"http://www.writestreamradio.com/\">http://www.writestreamradio.com/</a></p> <p>Check out our website here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p>",
