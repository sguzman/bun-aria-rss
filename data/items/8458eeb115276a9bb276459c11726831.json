    "media:description": "Black Lives Matter and Antifa activists in Seattle have long sought to transform the city into a progressive utopia. But after the death of George Floyd, they accelerated their plans—and sought to implement them by force. \n\nThis short documentary explores the left-wing violence plaguing the city, the rise and fall of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ, and the continuing unrest dominating Seattle's streets. \n\nThis film tells the story of the recent BLM riots—and the anarchy to come.\n\nWebsite: https://christopherrufo.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/realchrisrufo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo\nBecome a Patron: https://christopherrufo.com/support\nResearch Center: https://discovery.org/econ",
