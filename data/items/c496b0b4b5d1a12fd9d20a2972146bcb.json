The key to successful parenting is to make the time to address these challenges, and to listen with an open heart and mind. </p><br><p>My guest on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy, Dr. Shefali Tsabary, is a clinical psychologist, an international speaker and wisdom teacher, and she’s written two bestselling books, The Conscious Parent and The Awakened Family. In this episode, we dive into parenting and family dynamics. I personally have seen a lot of trauma from family dynamics manifest into physical illness, especially the relationship between child and parent. Dr. Shefali challenges traditional family roles, and encourages us to rethink the way we raise our kids. How can we let go of the toxic expectations that stand in the way of real, authentic, and loving relationships? </p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
