    "media:description": "In this video I'll solve every Precalculus problem from the book James Stewart Calculus, which is commonly used in US universities for learning Calculus. \n\nBefore you can start learning Calculus you must master Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry. To do that you must memorize and understand when to use certain rules to simplify equations. I show many of them in this video.\n\nThe book I'll use for this course James Stewart Calculus : https://amzn.to/3qAfxKf\n\nThis video was originally a Livestream so many people ask questions during its filming.
