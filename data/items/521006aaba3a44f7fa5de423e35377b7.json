  "description": "<p>\"Hey Chris, this is Whitney. I love the podcast! You should come visit me in the pyramid next time you're in Montana.\"</p> <p>It had been four decades since I'd heard from Whitney Lake, who was a legend at Cazenovia High School in 1979-80. His reputation for brilliant disruption greeted me when I moved to town, halfway through senior year. He still excels at brilliant disruption. He lives in a pyramid he designed himself, is a multi-instrumentalist, designs and builds string instruments, wind turbines, and various other devices (patents pending). Dude is mad smart, funny, charming, and generous. And his BBQ sauce is amazing!
