While these prevalent and dreaded diseases are caused by multiple factors, my guest says they also all share a common thread: a ubiquitous and too-little-understood condition called insulin resistance.</p><p>His name is Dr. Benjamin Bikman and he's a professor of biology and physiology, an expert in obesity and metabolic disorders, and the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3anQvoW\"><i>Why We Get Sick: The Hidden Epidemic at the Root of Most Chronic Disease — and How to Fight It</i></a>. Ben begins our conversation by explaining insulin's role in the body, how it goes awry when it comes to Type I and II diabetes, and how giving Type II diabetics insulin to treat their disease actually makes them “fatter and sicker, and kills them faster.” We then turn to the fact that even if you don't have diabetes, you very likely still have insulin resistance (something helpful to keep in mind during this conversation is that \"insulin resistance\" is bad and \"insulin sensitivity\" is good), and the condition's three primary causes. Benjamin then unpacks how insulin resistance correlates with cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and reproductive health problems, including the fact that erectile dysfunction isn't a function of low testosterone, but insulin resistance. We then talk about the role of insulin resistance in someone's susceptibility to COVID-19. We end our conversation with the four pillars of reversing insulin resistance, including the role of diet and physical activity, and how these lifestyle changes can work to help relatively healthy people get healthier, all the way up to allowing diabetics to get off their medication.</p><p>I can't tell you how motivating this conversation was for me to start a habit of walking more during the day, as well as after dinner. I bet it will have the same effect on you.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance\">Insulin resistance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7512468/\">Connection between high blood pressure and insulin resistance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17498710/\">Erectile dysfunction and insulin resistance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/cancer-and-obesity-the-link-is-insulin/\">Connection between cancer and insulin resistance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-021-00639-2\">COVID-19 severity and insulin resistance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/tag/testosterone/\">AoM's series on testosterone</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/\">AoM's fitness articles</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/cold-shower-benefits/\">AoM's article on the benefits of cold showers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-intermittent-fasting/\">AoM podcast on intermittent fasting</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/intermittent-fasting/\">AoM article on intermittent fasting</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gethlth.com/about-us/\">HLTHCode</a> (We're not affiliated with this company and they're not a sponsor, but we tried it, and love it, and have been consuming it daily.)</li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Benjamin Bikman</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://cell.byu.edu/bikman-lab\">Benjamin's lab website</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/benbikmanphd/\">Benjamin on Instagram</a></li></ul>\n",
