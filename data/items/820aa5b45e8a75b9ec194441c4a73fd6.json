That's exactly what happened to the 24 (yes <strong>twenty four</strong>) residents of Leith, North Dakota.Â  As you might have guessed,the bad-ass residents of Leith were not having it and an all out war was waged to run the Nazis out of town. Maybe they shouldn't have been Nazis, you know?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Join <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">our Patreon community</a> to find our monthly full bonus episodes and our weekly mini episodes!
