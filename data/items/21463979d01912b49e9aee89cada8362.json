  "description": "<p>This week, we dip back into the brain damage sports, with a longtime NFL player, who just happens to be a REALLY terrible person! He says all the right things, but they all seem to not be true. Like when he said that he didn't kick his girlfriend, in the head, because she wanted to feed their newborn baby at 4am, or when he said he didn't try to run that woman, on that bicycle down, with his SUV, or when he said that he didn't rape that developmentally disabled woman. Things like that. But, the question is, do the courts believe him?? </p><p> </p><p>Be a perennial pro bowl defensive lineman, have the police not arrest you, even though you told them that you kicked your girlfriend, and spend possibly life in prison with Dana Stubblefield!!</p><p> </p><p>Check us out, every Tuesday!</p><p> </p><p>!We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!! </p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p> </p><p>Donate at... patreon.com/crimeinsports or with paypal.com using our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p><p> </p><p>Get all the CIS & STM merch at crimeinsports.threadless.com </p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things CIS & STM!! </p><p> </p><p>Contact us on... twitter.com/crimeinsports </p><p>crimeinsports@gmail.com </p><p>facebook.com/Crimeinsports </p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
