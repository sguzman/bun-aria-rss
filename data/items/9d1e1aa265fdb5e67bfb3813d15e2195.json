In-depth stories of their military careers and how they answered the call to join the SOF community are powerful and inspiring.<br />Command Chief Smith tells his experiences battling leukemia from a deployment to Afghanistan after September 11th and being exposed to microwave radiation. His experiences helped him to understand the importance of SOCOM’s Warrior Care Program and Preservation of the Force and Family.<br /><br />Sergeant Major Parrish describes how he initially looked at joining the Marines, SEALS and then ended up enlisting as an 18X Green Beret. He walked into the Army recruiting office with a ‘Pantera’ goatee because he wanted to test himself. He went to Ranger school after becoming a Green Beret. <br /><br />Both of these senior enlisted leaders share their experiences with answering the call to special operations, injuries catching up to them and the lessons they have learned about themselves and the SOF community over their careers. <br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> SOFcast is the U.S. Special Operations Command official podcast where we harness the power of storytelling to connect you directly to thought-provoking and unique perspectives from our force.
