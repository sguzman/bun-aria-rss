  "description": "<p>Your significant other has DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), a mental health condition where a person has two or more separate identities. These personalities, or &ldquo;alters&rdquo; control the person&rsquo;s behavior at different times, and each alter often has its own history, traits, likes, and dislikes. It's a very complex disorder &mdash; one that clinicians are still coming to understand &mdash; and it makes relationships quite hard. So what can you do to be supportive to your loved one as well as yourself? We'll try to find an answer to this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
