  "description": "<p>Stress is an unavoidable part of life. It’s not about having a stress-free life- it’s about learning how to deal with it gracefully. Think of the last stressful moment you had. How did you react? Did you get angry and tense up? Or were you able to breathe and move through it? The more we work on our reaction when things go differently than we’d hoped, the happier we will be. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Dan Millman where he shared his definition of stress and the practice that helps him with it. Dan Millman is a former world champion athlete, university coach, martial arts instructor, and college professor. After an intensive, twenty-year spiritual quest, Dan’s teaching found its form as the Peaceful Warrior’s Way. He has now written seventeen books. Learn how to move through life without tension in Episode 852.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nDan’s definition of stress (2:30)<br />\nStress with tension vs. stress without tension (3:50)<br />\nHow martial arts can help with stress (4:30)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes, and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/852 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
