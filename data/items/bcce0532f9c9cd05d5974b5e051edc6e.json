June Thomas joins in for a quick game about queer tropes and culture before the hosts discuss what being queer and embracing queer culture means, and their first experiences establishing their queer identities. Then Slate contributor Evan Urquhart and trans activist Andy Bowen sit down with Christina to think through what it means to be a trans person. Finally, they end the show by answering an advice question about presenting as bi, and of course a round of the gay agenda. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
