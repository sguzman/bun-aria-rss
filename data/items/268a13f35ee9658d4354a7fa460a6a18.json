  "description": "<p>It's a new era of The Kirk Minihane Show. Justin leads off by pitching himself to Kirk for a full-time job and will have a formal presentation later this week. Kirk recaps the Madawaska live event and the hit piece about him in the Fiddlehead Focus written Hannah Caitlin. Another win for Kirk as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld a lower-court judge’s move to dismiss Curtatone’s lawsuit.  Kirk announces the next live show that will be held at the Saco Drive-In yet again. Tickets are on-sale right now. \n\nSupport Our Sponsors:\n\nAllBirds- Discover your perfect pair at barstool.link/AllbirdsBSS\n\nBetter Help- Get 10% off your first month at barstool.link/KIRKBetterHelp\n\nMiltons- Shop online at barstool.link/MiltonsBSS\n\nSimpli Safe- Go to barstool.link/simplisafeKIRK today to customize your system\n\nVincero Watches- Go to barstool.link/kirkvincero</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
