  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP works for a trio of bosses. Two of the bosses are brothers, and they never ever clean their concrete stirring stick. They leave that job to OP, which takes a full hour out of his day to clean the concrete. Eventually, OP gets sick of spending so much time chipping the concrete of the stick. When his bosses tell him, \"It's your job!\" OP grabs the concrete stick and smashes it against his boss's van, shattering the concrete and instantly cleaning the stick.</p>\n",
