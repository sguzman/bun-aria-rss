Being constantly connected can make us feel like we’re getting a lot done, but my guest today makes the case that we’d all be better off if we practiced the ancient tradition of the Sabbath. His name Aaron Edelheit and he’s the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1940858496/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1940858496&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Hard Break: The Case for a 24/6 Lifestyle</em>. </a></p><p>We begin our show discussing the burnout Aaron experienced as an entrepreneur working non-stop, how he rediscovered the Jewish tradition of the Sabbath, and how it changed his life and even helped him sell his business for over 200 million dollars. Along the way, we explore America’s workaholism and how it’s making us miserable and less productive, and costing businesses money. Aaron then digs into how you can start implementing a Sabbath practice regardless of your beliefs, and the benefits that accrue to your life, your health, your creativity, and even your bottom line when you take a weekly reset.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/hardbreak\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/hardbreak</a>.</p>\n",
