UK professor Ferguson whose faulty model led to the lockdown now says Sweden's results show the lockdowns were not necessary. Mission of Drive-By Media is to drive wedge between Trump and his base by making you think everyone else hates Trump, blames him for everything, disapproves of everything. It's not true.

Rush's prediction from 2014 that Obama would be treated as if he's still president during the next president's term. Obama to upstage Biden's race speech.
