  "description": "[This episode first aired February 27, 2010.]What's in a pet's name? Martha and Grant swap stories about how they came up with names for their dogs. Also this week: Have you ever been called a \"stump-jumper\"? How about a snicklefritz? And what's the last word in the dictionary? Depending on which dictionary you consult, it might be \"zythum,\" \"zyzzyva,\" \"zyxomma,\" or \"zyxt.\"Sometimes the process of naming a pet takes a while. The hosts talk about how their dogs' names evolved.A native Japanese speaker is mystified by the expression \"happy as a clam.\" In Japanese, she says, if you had a good night's sleep you might say you \"slept like a clam\" or \"slept like mud.\" So why do English speakers think clams are content? What's the very last word in the dictionary? Depending on which dictionary you're using, you may see \"zythum,\" \"zyzzyva,\" \"zyxomma,\" or \"zyxt.\"This week's word puzzle from Quiz Guy Greg Pliska involves taking a word, adding an \"i\" to the beginning, as if creating an Apple product, to get an entirely new word. For instance: \"This is how Steve Jobs begins a card game.\"A caller from Princeton, Texas, remembers that after a satisfying meal, her late father used to push back from the table and say, \"I am sufficiently suffonsified. Anything more would be purely obnoxious to my taste. No thank you.\" What heck did he mean by that?A Vermonter says he's sometimes called a \"stump-jumper.\" Should he be flattered or insulted?Martha shares a couple of \"Tom Swifties,\" those funny sentences that make great punny use of adverbs, like \"'My bicycle wheel is damaged,' Tom said outspokenly.\"Why do we say that someone who's happy is in \"hog heaven\"?Martha tells the story behind the term \"Tom Swifty.\" Grant shares some more funny examples from the \"A Way with Words\" discussion forum http://www.waywordradio.org/discussion/episodes-1/a-whole-nother-full-episode/.\"Gradoo\" is a word for something undesirable, the kind of thing you'd rather scrape off your shoe.
