He was a hunter and an environmentalist. He was a nerd and an athlete. He flirted with white supremacist ideas and yet was very progressive about race by the standards of his day. He was a big proponent of personal responsibility and supported quasi-Socialist policies.</p><p class=\"\">Love him or hate him, he was larger than life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">He was Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p class=\"\">In this episode:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\">The Youngest American President: Juvenile and Proud-Roosevelt and Racism</p></li><li><p class=\"\">“Unless we keep the barbarian virtues, gaining the civilized ones will be of little avail.”</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Losing sight in one eye while sparring, and Judo days</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Going to battle with JP Morgan.
