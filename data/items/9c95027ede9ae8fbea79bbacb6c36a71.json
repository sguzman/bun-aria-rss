  "title": "237: Is It Still OK to Be Happy? | Sylvia Boorstein",
  "description": "Even in the middle of a pandemic, it's still OK to experience delight. That's per legendary meditation teacher, Sylvia Boostein. In fact, she says, moments of happiness can fortify you to deal with the difficulties we are all facing. In other words, joy is a necessity, not a luxury right now. That is just one of many wisdom bombs Boorstein drops in this conversation. We also discuss how to cultivate \"inner cordiality\" and the quality of mind that has become her \"savior\" in these dark days.\nBoorstein is a genuine contemplative O.G., part of the vanguard of teachers who introduced mindfulness into the American mainstream. She is still going strong in her mid-eighties, after having lived a colorful life. Not only is she one of America's most respected teachers, but she is also a psychotherapist, peace activist, and grandmother. As you'll hear, when she is not meditating, she is a gifted storyteller. She self-deprecatingly refers to it as \"boundless talk-aremia,\" but I suspect that, for you, listening to Sylvia will, in itself, be a source of delight.\nWhere to find Sylvia Boorstein online:\nWebsite: http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/\nSocial Media:\nTwitter: @SylviaBoorstein https://twitter.com/sylviaboorstein\nFacebook: Sylvia Boorstein - https://www.facebook.com/sylviaboorstein/\nBook Mentioned:\nPay Attention, for Goodness' Sake by Sylvia Boorstein - http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/books\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/sylvia-boorstein-237\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Health Care Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
