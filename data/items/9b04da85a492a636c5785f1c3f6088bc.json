  "description": "<p>Have you ever been disappointed from unmet expectations in a relationship? Or hurt by a miscommunication with your spouse? It certainly happens to the best of us. And it certainly happens on the once a year Day of Love - Valentine's Day! Whether you are in a serious relationship, recently engaged, or newly married - this holiday can come with some weight from heavy expectations. Listen in to this special episode to glean both a male and female’s perspective on how to kick the pressure and step into a fun and memory-making Valentine’s Day, and every other day of the year really. You’ll hear from both Jordan and her husband on their first Valentine’s Day as a married couple, why it didn’t exactly go according to ‘plan’, and the lessons they learned the hard way that day that they carry with them into everyday situations. Whether you are a modern day cupid or more bitter toward this Valentine’s Day, listen in for humorous stories and tangible tips on how to manage the hype that can harm your joy.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details: <a href=\"http://jordanleedooley.com/managing-expectations-in-your-relationship-or-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">http://jordanleedooley.com/managing-expectations-in-your-relationship-or-marriage</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media network of podcasts.
