  "title": "A Messy Conversation About Modesty | Sadie Robertson Huff & Korie Robertson",
  "description": "Sadie & Korie dive into the tricky topic of modesty. But first, what does \"modesty\" even mean? Is it a strict set of rules that must be followed about what you wear? Does it only refer to your outward appearance? Sadie shares three questions we should ask ourselves as we get ready for the day or to go out for the evening — but these questions can apply to EVERY part of our lives, not just how we dress. And \"modesty\" isn't just about ourselves but about how we treat others. Sadie talks about how hurtful it was to receive so much backlash from other Christians regarding what she wore on \"Duck Dynasty\" and \"Dancing with the Stars.\" It ALL comes back to the heart! \n\nhttps://lomi.com/whoa — Get $50 off your Lomi with code WHOA!\n\nhttps://vegamour.com/whoa — Get 20% off your first order!
