  "itunes:summary": "New Discourses Bullets, Ep. 22 \n\nWe've all heard it and done everything we can to avoid rolling our eyes now. \"It's my lived experience!\" as though that's evidence or, actually, even better than evidence. \"Lived experience\" is a particular result of Leftist dialectical thought, however, that allows them to convince people that whatever they say is right and whatever anyone else says is dumb or bad. It is, in fact, the dialectical synthesis of evidence and the Leftist phenomenological interpretation of the circumstances in which that evidence presents. It's even better than evidence, then, because while evidence is objective, \"lived experience\" is both objective and subjective at the same time, with the subjectivity coming from a place of higher consciousness.
