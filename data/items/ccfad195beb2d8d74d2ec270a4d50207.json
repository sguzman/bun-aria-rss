  "itunes:summary": "Since 1982, Anna Homler has incanted the character of Bread woman - an ancient storyteller housed in bread that emerged out of the downtown Los Angeles performance art scene. Kneading language into music; toys into instruments, Homler’s vocal, visual and performance practice explores alternative means of communication and the poetics of ordinary things. This performance with special guests Samuel Karmel and Lilian Steiner was recorded at M Pavillion on the 28th of January 2018.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/breadwoman-mpavilion\n\nSound Spaces\nMPavillion, Melbourne\n28 January 2018\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, MOFO, All Are Welcome and MUMA\n\nImage: Jacqui Shelton\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
