  "description": "<p>Johann is the author of <em>Chasing the Scream</em> and <em>Lost Connections</em> -- both of which are largely about the traumas created by trying to live in a pathogenic society. He's a brilliant writer and conversationalist. In the first part of this podcast, we're in his hotel room in Beverly Hills (Thanks, Rupert Murdock!). The second part is in my car, headed south on the 405. I had a great time hanging with Johann, and hope you enjoy it, too.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
