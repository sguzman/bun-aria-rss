  "description": "The Trump bucks are here! Coronavirus stimulus checks hit people’s bank accounts yesterday, giving much-needed relief to millions of Americans, and the mainstream media are furious about it. But are left-wing journalists angry about the policy, or are they just upset that President Trump is getting all the credit? Then, liberal governors give us even more evidence that the coronavirus pandemic is politically a thing of the past, the government power grab leaves victims dead in its wake, and, speaking of criminals, a new report alleges that Jussie Smollett had sex with his attacker, which is particularly awkward since Jussie Smollett attacked himself. We’ll take a broad look at love in the time of self-isolation.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
