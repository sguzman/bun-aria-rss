  "description": "Sloots, today we welcome the legendary and absolutely beautiful Baylen Dupree! Baylen is a TikTok SUPERSTAR amassing nearly 7 million followers where she documents her life as a normal 20 year old girl while raising awareness for Tourettes syndrome. Known for her loving personality and hilarious commentary about figuring out life as a young adult, Baylen has captured the hearts of EVERYONE - from your favorite celebrity, to probably even your postman. In today's episode, Sofia and Baylen dive into discussing what it’s truly like to live with Tourette's syndrome, the misconceptions surrounding it, and dealing with the utterly ignorant people that exist in the world around us. Of course, it wouldn’t be Sofia if we didn’t get into the juicy stuff, so Baylen tells us ALL about the infamous Hunter and why we should ALWAYS recognize the red flags and put ourselves first - no matter how cute or charming he is (especially if you found him on Hinge). Baylen is the true definition of what it means to be a Sloot: empowering, raw, and living life to the fullest degree without giving a single shit about what anyone has to say about it… PS: Fuck You Hunter!\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
