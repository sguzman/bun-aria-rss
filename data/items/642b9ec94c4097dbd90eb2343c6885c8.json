  "description": "Aaron Watkins was just 18 years-old when he vanished from New Jersey on November 11, 2007.  Aaron had a tough childhood going from a home with his mother and siblings into foster care and eventually being adopted by a very strict, religious family.  Before he disappeared, he was struggling to figure out where he fit in this world and who he belonged with.  On November 11, 2007, he made a series of phone calls to those close to him and then the Jeep he was driving was found abandoned on the Driscoll Bridge.  What happened to Aaron?  Did he jump that day?  Did take off and start over somewhere else?  Did someone make his disappearance look like a suicide?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
