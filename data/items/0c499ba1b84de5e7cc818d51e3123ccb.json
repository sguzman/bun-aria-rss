While this <a href=\"http://github.com/benfred/implicit\">matrix factorization code</a> \nwas already <a href=\"https://github.com/benfred/implicit/blob/master/examples/benchmark.py\">extremely fast</a>, it still \nwasnâ€™t implementing the fastest algorithm I know about for doing this matrix factorization.</p>\n\n<p>This post is just a quick follow up, talking about why this algorithm is important, where the\ncommon solution is slow and how to massively speed up training using a paper based on using the Conjugate Gradient\nmethod.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/fast-implicit-matrix-factorization/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
