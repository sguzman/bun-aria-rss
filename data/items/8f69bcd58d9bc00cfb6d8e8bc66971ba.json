  "description": "On Wednesdays Mark Levin Show, Rep Trey Gowdy is very popular today for claiming that the FBI did the right thing by planting a spy in the Trump campaign, and we're all supposed to follow him. It’s very slippery and convenient when he says that Trump isn't the target of the Robert Mueller investigation since they haven't found anything on Trump. Why did Trump Inc. have to turn over thousands of documents if Trump wasn't the target? It’s unbelievable how easy these phony civil libertarians overlook the unmasking, spying, and concealment of this investigation from congressional oversight for over 8 months. The Left has what it wants thanks to Gowdy, another putative Republican, retiring so he’s free to, speak his mind, such as it is. Also, the media takes the word of a porn star and root for a genocidal regime hoping Trump will fail. Yet we still don't know what happened in the January 5, 2017 meeting of Obama Administration officials Loretta Lynch, Sally Yates, and Susan Rice. We still don't know what President Obama knew about this investigation or when he knew it. Later, Rosanne Barr should be condemned. But you need to be careful with these people in popular culture that were once leftists, especially before you hitch your name and reputation to them. Despite Joy Reid's vicious homophobic tweets she's still employed at MSNBC. DNC Vice Chair Keith Ellison has mislead us for years hiding his association with racist anti-Semite minister Louis Farrakhan. Why isn't Farrakhan condemned by the left, the Democrats, or the NY Times?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
