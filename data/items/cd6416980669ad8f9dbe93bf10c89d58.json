  "title": "Anthony Abraham Jack, \"The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students\" (Harvard UP, 2019)",
  "description": "The Ivy League looks different than it used to. College presidents and deans of admission have opened their doors—and their coffers—to support a more diverse student body. But is it enough just to admit these students? In this bracing exposé, Anthony Jack shows that many students’ struggles continue long after they’ve settled in their dorms. Admission, they quickly learn, is not the same as acceptance. This powerfully argued book documents how university policies and campus culture can exacerbate preexisting inequalities and reveals why some students are harder hit than others.\nJoao Souto-Maior is a PhD Student in Sociology of Education at the New York University. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
