He called his new company Amazon and warned many of his early investors that there was a 70 percent chance the venture would either fail or go bankrupt.  Twenty-five years later, it's very clear that Bezos' idea did not fail. Amazon not only survived, it thrived. It’s now the world's largest online sales company, and the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services.  Bezos recently sat down with Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein.
