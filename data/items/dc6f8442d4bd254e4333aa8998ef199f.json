  "description": "Wake Up Happy is not only the title of his New York Times best-selling book, it’s something that Michael Strahan does every day. From the NFL Hall of Fame to becoming a household name, Michael’s road to happiness and success is unpacked in this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.  During a storied 15-year career in the NFL, Michael set the record for most sacks in a single season, won a Super Bowl ring and through his do or die play, left such an enduring mark on the sport that he was inducted into the hall of fame. And his success in football honestly was just the beginning. To understand the dizzying heights he's climbed to since retiring, you need to only understand his world view. In his words, there's a difference between improbable and impossible. And his life story is proof that this statement is true: He managed to get a full ride scholarship to play football in college, even though he grew up in Germany and didn't play until his senior year in high school. Post football, he turned his attention to hosting for TV. Not only did he become a full-time fixture on Fox Sports, but he also landed the job of co-host on 'Live! with Kelly and Michael'. From there he reinvented himself again and joined Good Morning America, one of the most coveted roles in morning television.  Michael also wrote the New York Times best-seller “Wake Up Happy: The Dream Big, Win Big Guide to Transforming Your Life” His jaw-dropping level of success as an athlete, host and entrepreneur may be improbable, but he's truly proven that impossible only exists in the mind. Watch this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu to learn how Michael Strahan built a life of happiness through hard work, routine, and a belief that anything is possible. WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:  How to remove all self-limitations [3:52]   How to remedy any difficult relationship [8:54]   How to develop a winning mindset [21:07]   Why simple routines are often the best [24:03]   How to manifest happiness [27:22]   The blessings of an imperfect life [38:04]   How to put the work in [45:33]   ",
