  "description": "In this episode, Stephen A., Keyshawn Johnson, and Jeff Saturday discuss the Chiefs-Raiders MNF matchup and debate the merits of the controversial playcall by McDaniels to go for (and fail) a 2-pt conversion rather than a game-tying extra point. The Raiders blew a 17-point lead to Kansas City, but do our guys think the Raiders had an epic collapse or the Chiefs mounted an impressive comeback? The crew reacts to another roughing the passer call in last night's game and debates whether or not the officials have gone too far on this one. Plus, Davante Adams was visibly upset after last night's loss and pushed an employee out of his way en route to the locker room. Should he face discipline for his outburst? Cooper Rush is 5-0 as a starter for the Cowboys, but does the crew think he can take Dak's job in Dallas?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
