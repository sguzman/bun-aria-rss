  "description": "<p>The gut microbiome is likely the most important regulator of our overall health. Unfortunately, our modern diet, gut-busting lifestyle, environmental toxins, and other factors all feed the bad bugs in our gut and drive inflammation, which is at the root of almost all chronic diseases and obesity. Sixty percent of our immune system is in our gut, right under a one-cell thin layer of gut lining. When we treat this lining unkindly, we develop a leaky gut, allowing food proteins, microbes, and microbial toxins to “leak” into our bloodstream, triggering our immune system to start fighting the foreign invaders. We call this dysbiosis (as opposed to symbiosis) an imbalanced gut microbiome. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman discusses how to eat for gut health, the fifteenth principle in his new book, “The Pegan Diet: 21 Practical Principles for Reclaiming Your Health in a Nutritionally Confusing World” available now at <a href=\"https://pegandiet.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pegandiet.com</a></p><br><p>The Pegan Diet is Dr. Hyman’s definitive guide to using food as medicine and understanding how food impacts every system of our body.
