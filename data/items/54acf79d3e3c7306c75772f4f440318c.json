  "description": "<p><em><strong>Unified- Part 1: Lines and Erasers</strong></em>. This is the first episode in a longer conversation on 'Unity.' We have received many questions about how we can have unity with people we vehemently disagree with... Here, Mike and Tim first discuss how we define unity, or what it means to be unified. Then, Mike walks us through different \"sets\" we use (as first explored by Paul Hiebert, via Mark Baker). What is a 'Bounded Set,' and how do we relate to and understand that way of living? How has a 'Bounded Set' been realized in our churches and communities? The next is a 'Fuzzy Set.' How does this relate to 'Bounded?' How might we overcorrect from one and land in the other? Lastly, Mike walks us through the 'Centered Set.' How is this characterized? How might we restructure our communal dynamics to better embody this mindset?</p>\n<p>How does all of this relate to deconstruction and leaving the Church? There is so much to unpack here, hence the beginning of a longer conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike also reads a few more listener 'deconstruction' stories. We love this engagement!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
