Laundrie’s parents said he was headed into the Carlton Nature Reserve in Sarasota County. The focus this time is on the backside of the reserve. On Sunday, investigators found human remains matching Petito’s description in Bridger-Teton National Forest, weeks after Petito fell out of contact with her family during a cross-country road trip with Laundrie. Laundrie returned to Florida on September 1 in a converted camper van registered to his girlfriend, but without Petito.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Dale Carson - Criminal Defense Attorney (Jacksonville), Former FBI Agent, Former Police Officer, Author: \"Arrest-Proof Yourself, DaleCarsonLaw.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Alan Blotcky Ph.D. - Clinical and Forensic Psychologist (Birmingham, AL) specializing in Criminal, Child Custody and Abuse</li>\n<li>Sheryl McCollum - Forensic Expert & Cold Case Investigative Research Institute Founder, ColdCaseCrimes.org, Twitter: @ColdCaseTips</li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Featured on \"The Piketon Massacre: Return to Pike County\" on iHeartRadio</li>\n<li>Audrey Conklin - Reporter, Fox News Digital, Twitter: @audpants</li>\n<li>Michael Ruiz - Reporter, Fox News Digital, Twitter: @MikeRreports</li>\n</ul>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
