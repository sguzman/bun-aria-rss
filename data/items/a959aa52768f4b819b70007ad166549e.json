  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden pretends to be the great uniter while he does everything he can to divide this nation. Biden gave a speech laying blame on Donald Trump for the horrific murders of six Asians and two Whites at a massage parlor. Biden's speech to racialize this horrific Atlanta shooting is the latest attempt to further divide this nation despite the FBI saying that the shooting was not a racially-motivated crime. State and local law enforcement do not believe that race was a motivator in this attack, but the suspect's mental illness, yet the Democrat's evil demagoguery continues. Then, China has no respect for Biden and they don't fear America with him as President. At a meeting in Anchorage, AK the Chinese propagandists came prepared with CNN quips and regurgitated Democrat talking points to insult America in face of Secretary of State Blinken. Biden's approach to foreign policy is amateurish. Later, Admiral Brett Giroir, M.D. joins the show to explain how the Trump administration contracted for 900 million vaccine doses, retail distribution, 70,000 vaccine sites, partnerships with private pharmaceutical companies, and lined up support from the National Guard to administer and deliver the vaccines. Giroir added that he held over 300 transition meetings in Washington, DC, and left all of this work ready for the Biden administration to just \"press a button\" to activate the distribution plan. Giroir was clear, \"there's infection control and then there's what's good for the country...President Trump was the best thing for saving lives and the numbers prove that.\" \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
