With negotiations ongoing, Bruegel senior fellow André Sapir explains the UK's options, and explores the scope for a new kind of relationship between the two parties.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis latest episode of 'The Sound of Economics' considers what it might mean, in reality, for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU but to leave the single market, as well as what the examples of Turkey and Norway can indicate about the UK's potential future dealings with the EU.&#13;\n&#13;\nAndré Sapir has also co-authored a blog post with Bruegel deputy director, Maria Demertzis, elaborating on the various paths open to the UK [in phase two of the Brexit negotiations](http://bruegel.org/2017/12/brexit-phase-two-and-beyond-the-future-of-the-eu-uk-relationship/).&#13;\n&#13;\nMaria Demertzis has more recently considered [in a blog post](http://bruegel.org/2018/02/why-a-good-brexit-outcome-matters-and-its-not-just-the-economy-stupid/) why a positive Brexit outcome matters not just for the UK, but for the EU too.",
