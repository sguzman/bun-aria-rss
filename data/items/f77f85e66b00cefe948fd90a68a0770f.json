  "description": "<p>It's Cinco De Mayo, and we're celebrating by making fun of our favorite Bravo stars.  First we open the Bravo Mailbag and unleash some crazy scenarios involving \"Carrie,\" \"Frozen,\" and mall food.  Then it's on to \"Real Housewives of New York\" as Bethenny makes mincemeat of Jules and LuAnn and whoever else gets in her way.  We then discuss \"Here Comes The Motherhood\" briefly before moving on to the premiere of \"Below Deck: Mediterranean.\"  Finally, we wrap up with part III of the \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" reunion.
