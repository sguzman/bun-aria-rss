  "description": "While you wait for Part 2 of Frank Vitkovic....  \n\nI was honoured to guest host an episode of In Sight Podcast. If you haven't had a chance to listen via In Sight's stream, here is it. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with In Sight, I highly recommend checking it out.  \n\nOn January 29 2009, Arthur Freeman was driving his three children across the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. It would be his 4-year-old daughter, Darcey’s first day of school. Unfortunately she would never make it. For reasons no one would ever be able to explain, Freeman calmly exits his vehicle with Darcey in his arms and tosses her off the bridge. Freeman goes back to his car with his other two children inside and drives away. It would not be long before Freeman is apprehended, arrested and charged with the little girl’s murder. What would cause a loving, doting father to murder his own daughter? \n\nwww.patreon.com/insightpod  \n\nFacebook/insightpod\n\nTwitter @insightfulpod\n\nInstagram @insightpod\n\ninsightfulpod@gmail.com\n\ninsightpod.com\n\nMusic by Scott Buckley",
