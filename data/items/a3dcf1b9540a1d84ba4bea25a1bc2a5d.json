  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President George H.W. Bush was an extremely loyal, humble, kind, a military hero as well as a wonderful father and grandfather that raised a President and a Governor. Whenever we lose a president we feel as if we lost a family member given their length of service and time in the public eye. The media's disrespectful and classless attacks on President Trump disguised as coverage of President Bush's passing are unacceptable. Then, CRTV and TheBlaze merged into a new company - Blaze Media - becoming the largest Conservative digital media company. This is not a merger of personalities, it is a merger of pioneers. The old media environment is toxic, destructive, and undermining this republic. It is ideologically driven and dressed up as freedom of the press. The progressive agenda is the antithesis to freedom of the press. It’s the antithesis to constitutional republicanism. The purpose of freedom of the press, like freedom of speech, is to have a robust debate. Finally, the Financial Times cites America as the nation holding the upper hand in renewed tarade war negotiations with China, whom accepted Trump's concessions. China's hope is that Trump will be distracted by Robert Mueller's investigation as his report is set to be released soon. So now our enemies are rooting for Mueller, the media is rooting for Mueller, so who's rooting for America?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
