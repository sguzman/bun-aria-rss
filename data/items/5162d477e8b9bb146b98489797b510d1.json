  "description": "<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">When Steve Coogan realized he was good at doing impressions</span>, he also realized it was a really good way to get attention. But Steve also knew he had to deliver beyond the impressions if he wanted to get funnier. Steve talks with Marc about that evolution, with some help from \"Michael Caine,\" \"Sean Connery,\" and others. Plus, Steve explains how his new Alan Partridge series will force the beloved presenter to adapt to a changing world, how his new movie Stan and Ollie is really a love story about comedy, and how he became friends with his co-star John C. Reilly much the same way the real Stan and Ollie did. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.adultswim.com/videos/tigtone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tigtone on Adult Swim</a>, <a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe</a> and <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/timescrossword\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the New York Times Crossword App</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
