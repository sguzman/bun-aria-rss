  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Love You Always by Lucy Darling\n\nJust when I thought I had it all, Kimmy Kennedy falls right into my lap and makes me realize my life is empty, because all this time it’s been missing her.\n\nI knew it would be a fight to have her. She is young, beautiful, and full of life that she only just began. That isn’t the only problem. She&#039;s also my best friend’s little sister.\n\nWhen our spark ignites far brighter than we could’ve ever known, it brings attention. She wants to keep us a secret. I want the world to know she&#039;s mine.\n\nThere’s no hiding the fact that I want her with a desperate need I can&#039;t ignore. She’s all mine, and nothing and no one will ever change that. Not her or her brother. \n\nEnter Giveaway: https://bit.ly/35njOFz\n209 Wedding Lane: https://amzn.to/3zmXudf\nLove You Always eBook / Love Series Bundle: https://amzn.to/2SCDGSl\n\nOther Book Mentions:\n\nIce Planet Barbarians by Ruby Dixon\nZorn Warriors by Laurann Dohner\nDetective Kim Stone Series by Angela Marsons\nFrankie Love - Anya Mora\nPark Avenue Daddy by Mila Crawford\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
