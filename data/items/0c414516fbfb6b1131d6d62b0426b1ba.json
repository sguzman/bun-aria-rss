Rather than treating national identity as cause or consequence of a state's foreign policy, she repositions foreign policy as an arena in which contestation among competing proposals for national identity takes place.\n\nHintz is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nMusic for this season's podcast was created by Feras Arrabi.
