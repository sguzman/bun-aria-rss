    "media:description": "This is another video of mine where I do philosophy.  There is no transcript.  The part with the waterfall of Chantara at the Troodos mountain range (Cyprus) starts after the 15:00 mark.  I noticed that whenever I toggled between the front and rear cameras, there was an interruption or distortion to the audio.  I think nothing critical is lost, though I will try to find ways to improve this while still keeping it recording in one go.\n\nSome of the other videos of mine that I mention here:\n\n- On meditation, walking, and acceptance :: https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-07-meditation-walking-acceptance/\n- On self-importance and elitism :: https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-09-self-importance-elitism/\n- Practicality, honesty, and patience :: https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-10-13-practicality-honesty-patience/\n\nThe main points I covered:\n\n- There is a distinction between showing off and demonstrating something, but in practice it is hard to draw clear lines.\n- I am an Internet stranger to you (and you to me), which means that you have no means of verifying my claims.  This adds to the problem with the unclear lines.\n- In turn, I cannot control how you perceive of what I consider \"demonstration\"---you may still think it is me \"showing off\".\n- Explanation of the perils of overthinking. Life is practical, not theoretical.\n- My corpus of work---such as this video of me walking and talking---is a demonstration against overthinking.  It proves that I managed to overcome a major problem I had.",
