  "description": "Today I will be reviewing Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport. DEEP work is the ability to spend four or more, disconnected, undistracted & entirely focused hours a day practising new skills or generating high-level output while leveraging an expertise. In this book, Cal Newport describes how to become a practitioner of deep work and the impact it can have on your personal and professional life. This book is practical which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed it. The steps that Cal describes to go into a state of Deep work can prove beneficial as it has done for Bill Gates and Carl Jung to name a few. The book is supplemented by a brief PDF that describes some of the key themes and points Cal explains, and I have found this useful when implementing the strategies he outlines. This book is for those who want to increase productivity while also becoming a leader in their field. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
