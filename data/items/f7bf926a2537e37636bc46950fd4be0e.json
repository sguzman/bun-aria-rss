  "description": "<p>Is that the voice of the wise owl in the woods? Is it the ghost of a grandma who wants to cremate her cares? Or is it Chrisitne in her old elementary school play costume trying to infiltrate a secret society? This week on episode 218, Em takes us deep into the Bohemian Grove, an exclusive club and \"summer camp for presidents\" with some wild allegations attached to it. Then Christine closes out her first two-parter with the conclusion of her story on Richard Ramirez, the \"second-hand\" nightstalker and true terror of a serial killer. We also contemplate some gossip we have to bleep out and Satan's divine intervention... and that's why we drink! <br /><br /><em>An enormous thank you and sincerest apologies to Talk Murder With Me by Natalie DeGroot.
