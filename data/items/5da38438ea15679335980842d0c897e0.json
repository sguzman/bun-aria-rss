Join Anna and Rosie for a hilarious discussion about their awkward celebrity encounters, kissing Allison Janney, and how Rosie became close friends with Madonna at the height of her fame when the two filmed “A League of Their Own.” Then, in a surprise twist, Rosie takes a call from the supremely talented Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Rec).

Anna and Rosie also help a female liberal arts student with her issues dating “soft boys,” and talk to a young man who wonders if it’s okay to be a “prude” despite societal pressures to the contrary in the gay community.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
