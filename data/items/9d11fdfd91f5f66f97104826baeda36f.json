  "description": "Support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign is thin on Wall Street. The financial industry has by and large cast its bet with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Not Anthony Scaramucci. The founder of SkyBridge capital, who once backed fellow Harvard Law graduate Barack Obama, is now one of the New York real estate developer's economic advisors. Scaramucci swung by Times Square to discuss why he's with Trump, and the impact that decision has had on his business and life among the financial elite.\n  \n The Exchange is a regular conversation with influential and interesting people hosted by Rob Cox, global editor of Breakingviews, the financial commentary publication of Thomson Reuters. From Reuters’ global headquarters in New York’s Times Square, Rob and his colleagues debate and discuss trends in finance, business and economics with those who shape them, from central bankers and corporate executives to authors and artists.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
