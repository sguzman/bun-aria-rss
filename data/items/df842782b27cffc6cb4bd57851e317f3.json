  "description": "<p>The pandemic pushed parents, particularly working mothers, past a breaking point. As the U.S. begins to recover from the economic and social setbacks stemming from so many women leaving the workforce to care for their kids, we look at the history and future of childcare. Host Sonari Glinton talks with three working mothers who have lived through the ups and downs of childcare. Sonia McDaniel is an essential hospital worker and single parent to four daughters between the ages of three and 20. During the pandemic, with daycares and schools closed, she had to find creative solutions to keep her working and keep everyone safe. Ciera Maul has three kids under the age of five and if it weren’t for her company’s onsite daycare, she wouldn’t be in the workforce. Finally, we hear from Julie Kashen, working mother, and economist at The Century Foundation. She has devoted her career to finding public policy solutions for domestic workers and working moms and she feels like people are finally paying attention to childcare and the care economy. </p><p>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
