  "description": "<p>Ep13 Part 2: Angels of Death            In Part Two, the gals get into the cases of a couple of real-life Angels of Death: nurse \"Jolly Jane\" Toppan and Nazi monster Josef Mengele, plus a few \"doc-tators,\" including one former ophthalmologist who turned out to be a big fan of chemical weapons. This episode is paired with Whispering Angel Ros√©, so grab a bottle and try not to drink the entire liter in one sitting. (Or do, we don't judge.)</p>\n",
