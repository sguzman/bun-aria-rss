  "description": "<p>EPISODE 21- JOHN CROWLEY - Director</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with friend and collaborator, John Crowley, director of such films as BOY A, BROOKLYN, and THE GOLDFINCH. We do a deep dive into the craft of storytelling and directing. John eloquently shares with us his thoughts on directing and the challenges he faces on set. We look at how you tell a story in film, the power of the human face in the closeup, what differences the budget makes, working with actors and the pleasure of the entire filmmaking process. We also talk about Boy A, an early film of John’s, which is a favorite film of ours. A great discussion with a passionate filmmaker.</p>",
