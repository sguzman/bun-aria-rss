One of the things we as women, but especially Black women, don’t do often enough is recognize when we’ve made progress. This is why I’m sharing three ways to know that you’ve grown and are healthier. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason I decided it was time for this type of episode was because of a conversation I had with one of my coaching students. We were talking about some things going on in her life and she kept prefacing her comments with, “I’m love avoidant…” or “I’m trying to be less love avoidant…” </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As she was talking I had to stop her and point out that she isn’t love avoidant anymore. She’d made huge progress and was actually approaching various situations in completely new ways and had really stepped away from being love avoidant. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem was, she couldn’t see it. She didn’t recognize her growth for what it was and continued to see herself as the person she was when she first started her work. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is why you need to do the work, but then recognize it when you’ve grown. If you’ve started pausing before you react, been more open to alternative viewpoints, and have started feeling your emotions, then you’ve grown. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen in to hear more and then take a moment to celebrate your growth and give yourself a pat on the back.
