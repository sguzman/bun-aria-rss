  "description": "Judi Rever’s In Praise of Blood: The Crimes of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (Random House, 2018) is investigative journalism at its finest. Through great personal risk to so many of those involved, Rever and her sources tell a story far different from the one most people who are familiar with the Rwandan Genocide would recognize. Synthesizing field research; testimonies from refugees, defectors and dissenters, and governmental and intergovernmental officials; and analysis of primary documents, Rever offers readers the most in-depth account yet of suspected crimes committed by Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front, before, during, and after the genocide in Rwandan against the Tutsi population.\nJeff Bachman is a Lecturer in Human Rights at American University’s School of International Service in Washington, DC. He is the author of The United States and Genocide: (Re)Defining the Relationship and editor of the volume Cultural Genocide: Law, Politics, and Global Manifestations.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
