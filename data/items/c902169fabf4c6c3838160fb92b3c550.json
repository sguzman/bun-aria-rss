  "description": "<p>With the true crime boom, we have been awash in stories of dead women and girls. And while those stories have been used to romanticize the police and advocate for \"safety\" measures that just end in more surveillance and oppression, occasionally these stories show us just how broken our institutions from justice to politics have become. Sonia Faleiro is the author of the new book The Good Girls about two teenage girls found hanging from a tree in their family's orchard, but as you will learn from this episode, the story is much larger than that.</p> <p>Support this podcast: http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</p>",
