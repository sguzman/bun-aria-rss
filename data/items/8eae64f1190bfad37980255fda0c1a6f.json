  "description": "<p>This week we’re starting a series on connecting with others. Based loosely on his book <em>Everyone Communicates, Few Connect</em>, John Maxwell shares four of what he calls his “disconnects.” These are areas early on in his leadership journey that kept him from connecting with the people he led. This series will help you become a leader who draws people into your ideas and captures them with your vision.</p> <p>We’re also excited to introduce Chris Goede to you as the co-host throughout this series! Chris leads the Corporate Leadership Solutions team for the John Maxwell Enterprise. In this series, he and Mark discuss their own journeys from simply communicating to connecting.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Don’t Just Communicate, Connect Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Connecting and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Everyone-Communicates-Few-Connect-Hardcover_p_2783.html\"> <em>Everyone Communicates, Few Connect</em> by John C.
