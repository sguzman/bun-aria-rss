  "description": "<p>This is a conversation about the science, neurobiology and use cases for clinical hypnosis with the world’s leading researcher and clinician in the field,&nbsp;Dr. David Spiegel.</p><br><p>Dr. Spiegel is the associate chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, the director of the Stanford Center on Stress and Health, and&nbsp;has published over 480 journal articles, 170 book chapters, and a whopping 13 books on the subject of hypnosis and related topics.</p><br><p>Hypnosis is unfortunately a loaded term, one I admittedly met with skepticism. But as you’ll soon discover, clinical hypnosis, as opposed to ‘stage’ hypnosis, is a genuine and efficacious therapeutic protocol that induces a unique brain state—one that can be leveraged to improve everything from sleep states to high performance. It can be a powerful tool against addiction. And hypnosis has proven efficacious in the alleviation of trauma-related symptoms such as anxiety, chronic pain, and more.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Spiegel explains hypnosis, distinguishes the ‘stage’ variety from the clinical definition, and dispels the many myths associated with the field.</p><br><p>We discuss the many aforementioned efficacious use cases for hypnosis, and a process Dr. Spiegel calls&nbsp;'<em>tranceformation'.&nbsp;</em></p><br><p>Finally, we cover helpful tools for self-hypnosis, a simple test to gauge your own receptivity to hypnosis, and many other topics.</p><br><p>Watch:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/davidspiegel711\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>.</p><br><p>Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/david-spiegel-711/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Show notes</a>.</p><br><p><u>Today's Sponsors</u>:</p><br><p>Athletic Greens:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.athleticgreens.com/richroll\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/richroll</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Levels:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://levels.link/RICHROLL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">levels.link/RICHROLL</a></p><br><p>Calm:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.calm.com/richroll\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">calm.com/richroll</a>.</p><br><p>LMNT:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.drinklmnt.com/RICHROLL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drinkLMNT.com/RICHROLL</a></p><br><p>For a special discount on the&nbsp;Reveri mobile app (iOs & Android),&nbsp;visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reveri.com/richroll\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reveri.com/richroll</a> where you will be entitled to purchase a yearly or lifetime membership at a reduced price.&nbsp;I receive no benefit or remuneration from this offer.</p><br><p>Please enjoy what I think you will find to be a truly fascinating, potentially life-altering conversation.</p><br><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p>Rich</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
