But maybe not.  Maybe the graph thing is just an artifact of the power point era.</p>\n<p><strong>Rich guys . . .</strong></p>\n<p>I think the other problem is that people give these rich guys a lot of slack because, y&#8217;know, they&#8217;re rich, so they must know what they&#8217;re doing, right?  That&#8217;s not a ridiculous bit of reasoning.  But there are a few complications:</p>\n<p>1.  Overconfidence.  You&#8217;re successful so you start to believe your own hype.  It feels good to make big pronouncements, kinda like when Patrick Ewing kept &#8220;guaranteeing&#8221; the Knicks would win.</p>\n<p>2.  Luck.  Successful people typically have had some lucky breaks.   It can be natural to attribute that to skill.</p>\n<p>3.  Domain specificity.  Skill in one endeavor does not necessarily translate to skill in another.  You might be really skillful at persuading people to invest money in your company, or you might have had some really good ideas for starting a business, but that won&#8217;t necessarily translate into expertise in transportation forecasting.  Indeed, your previous success in other areas might reduce your motivation to check with actual experts before mouthing off.</p>\n<p>4.  No safe haven.  As indicated by the last graph above, some of the official transportation experts don&#8217;t know jack.  So it&#8217;s not clear that it would even make sense to consult an official transportation expert before making your forecast.  There&#8217;s no safe play, no good anchor for your forecast, so anything goes.</p>\n<p>5.  Selection.  More extreme forecasts get attention.  It&#8217;s the man-bites-dog thing.  We don&#8217;t hear so much about all the non-ridiculous things that people say.</p>\n<p>6.  Motivations other than truth.  Without commenting on this particular case, in general people can have financial incentives to take certain positions.  Someone with a lot of money invested in a particular industry will want people to think that this industry has a bright future.  That&#8217;s true of me too:  I want to spread the good news about Stan.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, rich people speak with a lot of authority, but we should be careful not to take their <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/03/27/pushback-against-internet-self-help-gurus/\">internet-style confident</a> assertions too seriously.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  I have no reason to be believe that rich people make stupider graphs than poor people do.  Richies just have more resources so we all get to see their follies.</p>\n",
