Two really need your support: a Catholic priest who preached that the BLM leaders are “wolves in wolves’ clothing” and Tucker Carlson. 24-year-old GOP congressional candidate Madison Cawthorn joins after beating a Trump-backed candidate to set the record straight about why he’s running. Jarrett Stepman, author of “The War on History,” discusses the 1619 Project and how today’s revolution is more French than American. The NBA will allow players to wear social justice messages, but what about “Free Hong Kong”? Environmentalist Michael Shellenberger, author of “Apocalypse Never,” argues why climate alarmism has become a false religion that goes against humanity and the environment.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
