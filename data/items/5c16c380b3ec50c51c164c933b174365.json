  "description": "<p>We recently released a brand-new digital course called “Leadershift,” where John C. Maxwell teaches on the 11 Essential Changes Every Leader Must Embrace. The Communication Shift is one of those important changes. In fact, it’s so important that we want to share it with you now. This episode includes John’s lesson from the online course, as well as Mark Cole and Richard Chancy walking through how to apply it. </p> <p>John readily admits that making the communication shift was not a natural one for him. His upbringing, profession, and personality meant he leaned towards being a leader who directed rather than connected. However, he successfully made the shift, and now he shares the seven keys to connecting, as well as the difference it makes in the effectiveness of your leadership and your organization. </p> <p>Being highly relational requires a great deal of intentionality. One must be intentional to listen, encourage, ask questions, and be generous—all to build authentic connection. Mark Cole and Richard Chancy walk through what it has looked like for them to put John’s advice into practice and make their own shifts from directing to connecting.  </p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Communication Shift Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes and exercises from John’s teaching.
