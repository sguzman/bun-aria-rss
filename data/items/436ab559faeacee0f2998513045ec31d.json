The media aren't media, they aren't journalists, they're just partisans who take the opposite position from Trump on everything. Two weeks ago they wanted Trump to unilaterally close the economy, now they call him a king for saying he can unilaterally open it. Trump has flattened the curve, and instead of acknowledging it, they say he's going to be responsible for deaths after we reopen. Economic devastation is heartbreaking.
