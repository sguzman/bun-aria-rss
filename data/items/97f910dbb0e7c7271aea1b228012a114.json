Stephen Kinnock is very much his own man and his own politician, and his new project 'Labour Renaissance' has published a fascinating report into the voters Labour lost and what the party can do about it. This is a brilliant analysis of where Labour has gone wrong, combined with practical recommendations about how it reconnects with the public.
