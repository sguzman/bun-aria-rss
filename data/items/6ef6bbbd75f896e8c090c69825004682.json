  "description": "<p>Lady Luck roll those dice because we’re breaking down Casino Night written by Steve Carell! We start this JAM packed episode by explaining how Steve ended up writing this episode, we chat about Pam's wink to Jim, and Jenna shares some behind the scenes tidbits about the Scrantonicity video. Then we get some fan catches about Pam's casino night dress paired with her watch, and that Dwangela slap heard around the world. Finally, we call up the one and only, John Krasinski, to talk about his memories about this episode, the teapot, and that iconic episode ending. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can check out John Krasinski's, Some Good News on it's YouTube channel  here <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.youtube.com_watch-3Fv-3DNDjNX3nEfYo&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=qpgMd9vtgSARBH1194_8yCGGOSi9j-lQUS3o2YAJLV4&s=q67VN7YGFBXOQa0MkEzyYRc0sos8U-xRV5XwxaGdOgw&e=\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDjNX3nEfYo</a></p>\n",
