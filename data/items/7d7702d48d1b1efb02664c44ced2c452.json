  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 47: Featuring Mike Commodore",
  "description": "<p><p>The NHL is finally back and the boys kick off Episode 47 by going over a highly-entertaining Opening Night dominated by Wayne Simmonds, Connor McDavid, and Toronto's offense. They also chat about Jack Eichel's new $80M deal before bringing on the always hilarious Mike Commodore. Commie gives us his thoughts on Jagr playing at 45, just how great McDavid can be, possibly getting into the biz (media), a hysterical story about fighting Shawn Thornton, and a bunch more. Once again, Commie does not disappoint. The fellas close things up with #AllRightHamilton and some closing words about real life stuff.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
