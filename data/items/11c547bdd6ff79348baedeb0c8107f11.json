  "description": "It’s hard to say no. Really hard. If you were raised to be a “good kid,” to be agreeable, to make other people happy… well, then it makes complete sense that it’s hard for you to prioritize yourself as an adult.

And as a recovering people pleaser herself, Dr. Becky knows exactly how to connect with this part while strengthening other parts of yourself—so that you can set healthy boundaries, respond to pushback, and reduce guilt. Even better: This episode’s scripts and strategies won’t only help you stop the people pleasing cycle for yourself, but also for the next generation. Let’s model how to honor our own needs while staying connected to others, so our kids can do the same. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
