  "description": "Kane finally gets the opportunity to make a record and the song that takes off from his 12\" is \"Just Rhymin' With Biz\".  It was a freestyle with Kane and Biz Markie rhyming over the beat to Kane's \"Somethin' Funky\" track.  The record did well at radio in the tri-state, but Kane couldn't get booked for a show.  But he knew why.  Sitting at home broke, Kane kept pressuring Fly Ty from Cold Chillin'/Prism to put out a new record.  Once the green light was given, Kane brought a couple records to Marley's house to sample for his next single.  The outcome.....RAW.
