  "title": "Linear Programming for Maximum Independent Set",
  "summary": "Maximum independent set, or \"maximum stable\" set is one of classical NP-complete problems described in Richard Karp's 1972 paper \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\". Other NP-complete problems often have a simple reduction to it, for instance, p.3 of Tony Jebara's \"MAP Estimation, Message Passing, and Perfect Graphs\" shows how MAP inference in an arbitrary MRF reduces to Maximum Weight",
