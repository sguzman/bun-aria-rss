  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden attempted to silence free speech by nominating Gigi Sohn to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to control the airwaves and destroy conservative talk radio. Sohn says she will shackle broadband providers and censor Fox News by preventing cable providers from carrying the network. If confirmed, Sohn will likely end free speech on the airwaves unless patriots speak up. Then, in March of 2017 when this program deduced from publicly available reports that candidate Trump had been spied on, we were attacked yet it turned out to be true. Despite the top intelligence and law enforcement officials being aware of these false claims they still injected them into their spheres of influence. Newly declassified memos show that current National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan delivered some of this false information to then-President Obama and others in the White House. This whole scheme was hatched by Hillary Clinton, the Obama Administration, and the Democrat National Committee and truly is the greatest insurrection in American history. Later, columnist Julie Kelly calls in with an update on the pretrial detention of the January 6th political prisoners. It's nonsensical to think that the FBI was not involved since the FBI had so many informants inside of these various groups. It's interesting to note that AG Garland wouldn't comment on this when questioned in Congress. Was this attack actually instigated by the feds? Meanwhile, it seems abundantly clear that Kyle Rittenhouse did not murder anyone. In fact, the government's star witness (a communist sympathizer) made the self-defense case for the prosecution. Afterward, former White House Press Secretary and author Sean Spicer joins the show to discuss his new book \" RADICAL NATION: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s Dangerous Plan for America.\"  Spicer added that America can become radicalized right under our noses if citizens don't pay attention and take action.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
