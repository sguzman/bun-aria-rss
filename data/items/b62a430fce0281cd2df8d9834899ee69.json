  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason shares his thoughts on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ugly Thursday Night Football loss to Nick Foles and the Chicago Bears. The Bucs thoroughly outplayed the Bears, and were it not for a few flag-happy referees we may have seen a different outcome. And while many will point to Tom Brady's sideline blowup towards his offensive linemen or him forgetting what down it was on the final drive, Jason encourages Bucs fans to stop, take a deep breath and give TB12 a few more weeks with a healthy roster before you start to pass judgement. Plus, NBA champion Eddie House swings by to explain why he was so surprised to see the Los Angeles Clippers fire his former coach Doc Rivers, tell us why he has a hard time considering Giannis Antetokounmpo to be a true 'superstar' given the way he's flamed out in the playoffs the past two years, discuss the idea that this year's NBA title should have an asterisk next to it, explain why he would vote for LeBron James as this year's NBA Finals MVP (but with a hat tip to Rajon Rondo), tell us why he would still pick Michael Jordan as the GOAT over his former teammate LeBron, and much more! Later, Jason closes the show with a very special 3-for-1 NFL week 5 edition of The Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
