In this case, some Libertarians are misreading the Constitution; Congress has the power to end a war via the power of the purse but it has no power to tell the President what to do or micromanage the Commander-In-Chief. Kellogg-Briand Pact was drafted to outlaw war, and this goes to the heart of the idiocy behind the philosophy that the radical Libertarians and code pink Republicans ascribe to. These imaginative efforts to pretend that there aren't evil people and regimes that want to slaughter good people. Later, Speaker Pelosi continues to obstruct the Senate from conducting an impeachment trial as is mandated under the Constitution. Afterward, the Democrats continue defending General Soleimani.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
