  "description": "<p>No one gave me permission to build a career in the health and wellness field, to start a podcast, to write a book, or become a speaker. Making your dreams a reality is something you must take control over. If you wait around for someone to give you the green light to pursue your passions, you’ll never be able to move forward.</p> <p>Every single successful person I’ve interviewed has had the audacity to write their own permission slip, and today’s guest is no exception. When I asked Lori Harder how she landed ten magazine covers, she explained that in every single instance, she relentlessly pitched her story. She put in the time, the persistence, and she granted herself permission.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On this episode, Lori is sharing her incredible story of overcoming deeply ingrained limiting beliefs, speaking your dreams into reality, and what can happen when you choose to reframe negative events in your life. Lori’s mission is to help you create a life you’re obsessed with, and I’m positive this interview will inspire you to give yourself permission to do so.
