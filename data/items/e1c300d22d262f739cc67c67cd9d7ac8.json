  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, believe all women has been reborn, except now it has been racialized. Before we were told that we must believe any woman who claims she was sexually assaulted or harassed. Now we are told that we must believe any non-white person who claims they were the victim of racism. But this idea is just as dangerous and irrational as “believe all women.” Also Five Headlines, including a true American hero who stood up against two women hectoring him over not wearing a mask. You have to see the video. And in our daily cancellation, I cancel the makers of a children’s toy, for causing me life threatening injuries.\n\nBen's new book \"How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps\" is coming out July 21st.
