  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Congress isn't capable of addressing the real issues facing our country and the media simply chooses not to. Rep's Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are Jew-haters and they have made statements that prove as much. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has compared border detention centers to concentration camps, yet not one fraction of 1% of the media has addressed their statements. What exactly has Omar done for women of color? Nothing! What has Rashida Tlaib done for women of color? Nothing! What has Ocasio-Cortez done for women of color? Nothing! Why do they hate this country? Now, what has President Trump done for women of color, for Muslims? Trump saved women of color, men of color, and children of color who were under chemical attack in Syria until Trump ordered a bomb strike to stop that regime for this genocide. Although you don't hear much about ISIS anymore, they were raping Muslim and Yazidi women until Trump ordered the U.S military to put an end to ISIS. Does this sound like a racist? Yet, Omar and Tlaib lob racial and islamophobic insults at Trump. Then, Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul have stalled the 9/11 Victims Compensation bill because it has no end date and no limit on how much money can be spent in the bill. After, as noted in \"Unfreedom of the Press\" the media has made it their mission to assassinate the character of Donald Trump. Finally, Daniel Horowitz calls in to discuss the Republicans deal with the Democrats on a budget deal.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
