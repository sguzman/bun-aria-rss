The book is a collaboration from several American and Chinese academics: Leslie Grant, James Stronge, Xianxuan Xu, Patricia Popp, Yaling Sun, and Catherine Little.\n\nDr. Grant, Assistant Professor of Education at The College of William and Mary, joins New Books in Education to discuss West Meets East.

Grant and her coauthors interviewed teachers across the US and China whom had all been honored with teaching awards by their respective countries. The authors explored four characteristics of these teachers: personal qualities, planning and assessment, instructional practices, and classroom management. While their comparative educational study showed distinct differences amongst the two groups, the researchers also found that some characteristics that cross over to both cultural groups of great teachers, like a shared sense of purpose and responsibility.
