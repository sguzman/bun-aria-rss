  "description": "In December 1951, Walter Wanger (Jon Hamm) points his gun at Jennings Lang’s (Griffin Dunne) groin and fires -- and Joan Bennett’s (Zooey Deschanel) life and that of her family will never be the same. Though it’s her husband who commits a shocking act of violence, and it’s he who is actually sent to jail, Joan finds herself painted in the press as the perpetrator. As Hollywood and America rally around the gun-toting man, the adulterous woman is thrown to the wolves to fend for herself and her family. Also featuring Brian Comstock as Police Chief. \nListen and subscribe at http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\n\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
