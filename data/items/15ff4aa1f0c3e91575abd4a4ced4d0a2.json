  "title": "#143 What Did They Know & When Did They Know It? (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 143rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we discuss how some stories diagnose a system: What does it mean when a college declares its (non-racist) professors racist? What does it mean when journalists only recognize election fraud if it works against their team? What does it mean when “science” is invoked only to support foregone conclusions? Discussing these and more examples from the last two and a half years of Covid, we talk about the need for functional journalism, science, higher ed, and government, and of “skepticism kill switches.” How do you get people to stop being skeptical? Tell them that asking questions renders them a racist, a murderer, or a TERF.<br/><br/>Our store:  https://www.darkhorsestore.org<br/><br/>Our book: A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-Gatherers-Guide-21st-Century-Challenges/dp/0593086880/).
