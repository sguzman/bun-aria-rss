  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life, we wrap up our discussion of Shakespeare’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38QzoKf\">A Winter’s Tale</a></em> with a look at Act 5. Our hosts, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks also announce our next book to read together, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vW6w4u\">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em> by Oscar Wilde. Angelina notes that Act 5 is all about reconciliation and redemption. Thomas points out that Shakespeare had a challenge here in how to bring this play to a close with all those relationships resolved. Cindy brings up Paulina’s character and the significance of her name.</p> <p>Our hosts discuss the truth that though in an ultimate sense all will be made right, this play reminds us that in this life, there are some things that are not fully redeemed. They also talk about how Shakespeare plays with both the audience’s expectations and with the form in this act. Leontes’ imagination is also in need of redemption, and we see that happen here at the end of the play. Thomas makes the connection between the myth of Pygmalion, Euripedes’ <em>Alcestis</em> and <em>A Winter’s Tale</em>.</p> <p>The theme of resurrection is so prevalent in this final act, particularly in the case of Hermoine, but also in other characters and plot points. The winter is over, and spring has come to Sicily. The old order is not restored. A new order has been brought into being.</p> <h3>Upcoming Events:</h3> <p>We are excited to announce a new online conference coming on March 13-14, 2020. Our theme will be <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/\">Re-enchanting the World: The Legacy of the Inklings</a>. Our keynote speaker is Inklings scholar, Joseph Pearce.
