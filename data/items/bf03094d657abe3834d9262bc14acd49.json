  "description": "<p>Yesterday, we brought you the first installment of Isaac Seidel’s story. You learned a lot about Isaac’s life and the events that occurred in the lead-up to his disappearance. You also learned that Isaac disappeared along with his bike, phone, and backpack. Everything else seemed to be left behind at his home. Isaac hadn’t told anyone that he planned to go anywhere. In fact, it appeared that Isaac had gone about his regular Sunday routine. He had his chicken out thawing, which is something he would do on Sunday to prep his meals for the week. It looked like he had gone for a bike ride with plans to return before dinner. But something happened to Isaac Seidel, and whatever happened to him remains a mystery nearly nine months later.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Isaac Seidel, please contact the Pennsylvania State Police at (717) 567-3110. Missing along with Isaac is his dark green Cannondale bicycle.</p><p>Megan has a social media page for Isaac to help spread awareness.
