He was Director of Communications at Number 10 the last time the Conservatives won a majority and before that he was editor of the BBC News at Ten and BBC News at Six. Is the BBC biased? Does it matter if the Tory campaign has crossed the line of decency? What's the best way to deal with stories that are completely untrue?
