But she complains that when she's about halfway through a project, Todd tends to voice strong opinions that start to change the direction. She would like him to let her carry out her original vision, but Todd thinks that this is part of the process. Who's right? Who's wrong?</p> <p>Thank you to Megan Hodgkiss for naming this week's case!
