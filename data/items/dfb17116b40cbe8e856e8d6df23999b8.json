  "description": "<p>The First Annual Kirk Minihane Ice Fishing Expedition to Madawaska was an enormous success by any measure -- with one exception. Blind Mike disobeyed a direct order from Kirk not to consume too much alcohol before the show, and the result was what we all heard yesterday. On today's show, Kirk wrestles with how to handle Mike now and going forward. Plus: Two MAJOR announcements about the future of KMS live shows. (Wilbur tickets are on sale now: https://thewilbur.com/artist/kirk-minihane/)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
