  "description": "<p>Barstool Sports' days partnering with Sirius XM to distribute Barstool Radio may be numbered, according to Dave Portnoy's tweets throwing down the gauntlet. Kirk talks about the news that the once-great Howard Stern will is reportedly getting a new $100 million deal from Sirius at the same time. What does the post-Sirirus future look like for Barstool Radio? Disgraced former-Calif. Rep. Katie Hill is now going to get the Hollywood treatment in a biopic starring Elizabeth Moss.

Music author and host of the Rivals podcast Steven Hyden joins the show to talk about the late Eddie Van Halen, Bruce Springsteen, and the next musical feuds he'll be covering on his show.
