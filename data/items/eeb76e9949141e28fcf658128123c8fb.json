  "description": "<p>\"What if I get successful and lose all my friends?\" That's a question that The MFCEO gets all the time. \"Listen,\" says Andy Frisella. \"As you move up the ladder of accomplishment, your peer group will change.\" Why?

It doesn't mean certain members of your old peer group are bad people. It just means that you've become very different people with different hopes, dream, and goals--and moving apart is natural. You better accept it. The alternative is keeping your friends--and staying average and mediocre.</p>",
