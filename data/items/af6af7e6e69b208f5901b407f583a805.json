For one, they are recommendations that would only work for someone who is already healthy, yet close to 90% of our population in the US is metabolically unhealthy. They also don’t take ethnicity and socioeconomic status into account, among many other factors. This is a big issue. Clearly, we should be providing Americans with guidelines that will actually serve their health. And research shows that whether we like it or not, as a society we’ve followed the guidelines over several decades and suffered the consequences of worsening health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Today’s guest has been a huge inspiration to me, as she’s challenged the conventional wisdom on nutrition and continues to expose the truth behind our guidelines and the food industry. Nina Teicholz is a science journalist and author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>The Big Fat Surprise</em>, which upended the conventional wisdom on dietary fat—especially saturated fat—and spurred a new conversation about whether these fats in fact cause heart disease. Named a Best Book of the Year by the <em>Economist</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> and <em>Mother Jones</em>, among others, it continues to be called a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the amazing story of how we came to believe fat is bad for our health—and what a better diet might look like.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Tushy, Essentia, and Four Sigmatic</p><br><p>The Tushy bidet is a sleek attachment that clips onto your existing toilet and connects to the water supply behind your toilet to spray you with clean, fresh water.
