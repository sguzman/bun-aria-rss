  "description": "NoSleep Podcast Presents The New Decayed Episode 05\nIt's episode 05 of The New Decayed. On this week's show we bid farewell to our miniseason with five tales about evil encounters, cruel creations and reprehensible relationships.\nDisclaimer: This is our first experimental miniseason. For this five-part series you’ll be joining Jessica McEvoy and Olivia White as they delve into the experimental, dark abyss of horror. Instead of taking an extended break during the European tour, we thought we’d try out something new. We’ll be taking this miniseason in directions outside of the usual mandate of The NoSleep Podcast. Some episodes of this miniseason are not for the faint of heart. Some are not for the squeamish. It’s not mandatory listening. If you choose to consider this a break and wait for Season 14, that’s fine. If you choose to join us, then brace yourselves. We’ll be taking you places.\n\"I Sold My Name at a Crossroads\" written by A.S.
