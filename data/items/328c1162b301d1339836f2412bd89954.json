  "description": "<p>In this 65th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we begin by offering gratitude to Bill Maher and his crew for having us on on January 29—but why didn’t Heather answer his question about vaccines? She does so here, and we discuss a bit more about vaccine technology (also see episode 58 for more on that). Next: What does consensus look like in science, and when are we looking at forced consensus, one which may not accurately reflect underlying reality? What does this have to do with the “lab leak hypothesis” regarding the origin of SARS-CoV2? Following that: how does diet affect COVID—either in terms of mitigating risk of contracting it, or of reducing symptoms if you have it? Short advice: eat more ferment, and buy local. We finish by talking about tuna, and sea stars. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
