    "media:description": "This follow-up discusses fluid simulation related information reduction in view of time irreversibility of the governing evolution equations.\n\nWe gain an overview of a statistical perspective on the microscopic motion and highlight the implied time irreversibility as well as the exclusion of anti-dissipation.\n\nTopics covered/used: Kinetic Theory of Gases, Boltzmann Equation, One-Particle Phase Space Density Function, Information Reduction, Laws of Evolution, Microscopic and Macroscopic Perspective, Laws of Motion, Time Reversibility vs. Time Irreversibility, Dissipation.\n\nTimetable:\n-----------------\n00:00 - Microscopic Motion vs. Macroscopic Experience\n01:33 - Macroscopic Influence on Microscopic Motion and Dissipative Tendency\n04:38 - Statistical Perspective on Microscopic Motion and Information Reduction\n08:54 - Time Irreversibility of the Statistical Perspective\n10:13 - What's coming next? (Fluid Simulation Series!)\n\n\nImportant Note:\n-----------------\nI recommend exploring the literature further (see a few selected references below), as there are many more aspects necessary to fully understand the nature of time irreversibility, which may be covered in an extended version of this part. In particular, for brevity, I have chosen not to introduce the n-particle phase-space density perspective here, useful to talk about densities of (anti-)trajectories what could be done to define dissipation and related concepts probabilistically. This is addressed more verbally by saying things like \"some anti-time behavior\", implying that probabilities should not be attached to individual trajectories, but rather that one should think in terms of probability densities. For the short version, I have tried to convey such aspects at least verbally, but if you are interested, you should know that there is of course much more to say.\n\n\nSelected Papers and Learning Resources:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nBook: Evans, Denis James, Debra Joy Searles, and Stephen Rodney Williams.

For the sake of clarity, I had to omit many interesting aspects of the topics addressed in the video.
