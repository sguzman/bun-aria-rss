    "media:description": "Donâ€™t miss this mind bending hour with the co-founder of Immuse.xyz (http://IMMUSE.xyz) - CEO Chris Nunes (https://tinyurl.com/4p5w8kc5), head of business development Scott Clark (https://tinyurl.com/yfznp529) & creative director BC Biermann (https://tinyurl.com/3zp2jjke).\n\nChris, Scott and BC introduce the idea of remixing music in lived spaces. This is a new form of discovery and entertainment that has potential to push the boundaries of spatial music and the relationship between creator and fan. I hope you enjoy these amazing AR demos that have the potential to materialize as NFTs. Will this change how we see live shows, recycle, remix and play with sound and space? Maybe?... get ready to be red pilled!\n\nHosted by,\nRaphael Hyde\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-hyde-4416494/\nGoogle web3 community lead | Google UX | web3 Angel\n\nMusic by Sunset Music Inc",
