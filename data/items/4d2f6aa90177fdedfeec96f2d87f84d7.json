  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Gov Andrew Cuomo remains in the spotlight for his deadly decision to sign an executive order directing COVID infected patients to convalesce in nursing homes with the nation's most medically vulnerable citizens. But for, Elaine Healy, MD a brave whistle-blower that runs and represents an association of nursing home managers who called this program In March 2020 to blast Cuomo and his deadly decision, it may have gone largely unnoticed. Yet, all of the media organizations that monitor this program failed to report on this critical caller's complaint of Cuomo. Then, Doanld Trump was very well represented in today's impeachment trial by Michael Van der Veen, David Schoen, and Bruce Castor. Each attorney brilliantly presented video evidence of democrats calling for violence and challenging the 2017 Electoral College vote count. Presenting evidence that is not in context, as the Democrats have, would be thrown out of any court of law for being tainted. Democrats have failed to meet the evidentiary standards that any lawyer or judge would expect. Later, a national sex offender operation has been interrupted at the southern border as a result of President Biden's lax immigration policy. New policies allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country and avoid deportation even if they're arrested for drunk driving. Trump Advisor Stephen Miller calls in to discuss how benching Trump's immigration policies helps criminal alien gang members while hurting law-abiding US citizens. Afterward, another Lincoln Project founder, Steve Schmidt, resigns after using Trump to revive their failed RINO consultancies.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
