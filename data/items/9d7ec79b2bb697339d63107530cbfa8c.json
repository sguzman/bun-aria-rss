  "description": "<p>The Self-Optimization (SO) model is a useful computational model for\ninvestigating self-organization in \"soft\" Artificial life (ALife) as it has\nbeen shown to be general enough to model various complex adaptive systems. So\nfar, existing work has been done on relatively small network sizes, precluding\nthe investigation of novel phenomena that might emerge from the complexity\narising from large numbers of nodes interacting in interconnected networks.\nThis work introduces a novel implementation of the SO model that scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ with respect to the number of nodes $N$, and\ndemonstrates the applicability of the SO model to networks with system sizes\nseveral orders of magnitude higher than previously was investigated. Removing\nthe prohibitive computational cost of the naive $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{3}\\right)$\nalgorithm, our on-the-fly computation paves the way for investigating\nsubstantially larger system sizes, allowing for more variety and complexity in\nfuture studies.\n</p>",
