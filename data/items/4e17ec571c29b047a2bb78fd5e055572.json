  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is scheduled to testify in Congress Wednesday, wrote an outrageous report with footnotes that are laughable and not taken seriously by the Department of Justice. Volume two is an illegitimate report by an illegitimate prosecutor. If Mueller believed that President Trump should be indicted he should have written it in his report, but he didn't. Instead, he used vague ambiguous language to skirt the truth. The fact is that the elements of obstruction were not there! On Wednesday, Republicans should ask Mueller to make Don McGahn’s 30 hours of testimony available to Congress and the American people to determine if there are any exculpatory statements. He should be asked of his and his staff's communications with the media and the whereabouts of the phone records if such communications exist. Despite Mueller stating that he could not exonerate Trump, which was an irrelevant statement of fact because prosecutors don't have the power to exonerate anyone, he was implying that he couldn't indict him due to the DOJ policy on indicting a sitting president. Then, the silence of Jewish members of Congress and the media on the hateful anti-Semitic remarks from Rep's. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Tlaib is a loathsome hateful human being and continues her support of the anti-Semitic BDS movement. Sadly they don't realize that making false comparisons to the civil rights movement won't make their hatred of Jews any less despicable. Later, the center has moved to the left and the national debt continues to be ignored by both parties; which will eventually destroy our society. Ignore, the cheerleaders saying all is well — the Progressives in Washington have won; Republicans have willfully bought into the progressive addiction to spending. Discretionary spending is up 22% over Obama's presidency. This is not okay! The swamp's massive federal spending is a bad thing!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
