  "description": "<p>Standup comedian and host of The Bonfire and Legion of Skanks (in that order) Big Jay Oakerson talks about his struggle with anxiety disorder with comedian and host of nothing Ari Shaffir. Jay really went through it, man. He was fine and then one afternoon, he wasn’t. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think straight, and the walls started crashing in. Ari has always been intrigued by mental disorders and this is the first time he has been able to really take a deep dive into anxiety. It was a very revealing and interesting discussion.</p> <p>Check out Big Jay Oakerson every week on the Legion of Skanks podcast. Ari Shaffir is the President of that podcast.
