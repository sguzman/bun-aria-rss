  "description": "<p>A listener from Ontario, Canada writes “Hi Wes, I had a very bizarre situation when I was 15. I have never told anyone before but after listening to you for the last month I think I can tell you.</p> <p>It’s a crazy story I will give you the outline if you are interested you can let me know. I am in Ontario and this happened in a village in southwestern ont. my parents found god and thought I was to adventurous so moved me to the middle of nowhere. I have grown up surrounded byweird happenings. I found out a few years ago that my great great grandmother was full Ojibwa so weird gifts I have now make sense. I have always been connected to animals so the country was not bad.</p> <p>We had an old barn that we did not use but to park the car in. Where the animals were kept at one time you had to go down a ladder which was broken or threw a door you had to climb down broken up old stone stairs. My parents like I said we’re constantly praying and stuff so I would hide in the barn. It was late fall but the snow was falling early. I was in the hay loft and I heard a noise which was weird because we had no animals. I came down the later on to the main floor seen nothing. I sensed something there. I heard a noise under me. I am a curious person. I went around to the steep steps and seen the door open it was a split door and they were both open. The damn door was very hard to open because of the age. I could not get it a quarter of the way open it was wide open.</p> <p>I went to the door and peeked around it. It was still filled with hay from the previous tenants. Underneath the hay this massive blob was there. I was worried one of the neighbors horses was hurt so went a little closer and it uncovered its head. Which was pointed away from me and grunted like a gorilla does when it sends out a warning. I don’t know why but I said sorry and backed away. Went in the house and that was it. I was freaked and my parents did not believe in that stuff. They said that was the devil playing games. So I said nothing. Whenever I went to hide in the loft i would bang my feet if I heard a huff I would leave. This went on for a few months. I always noticed the farmers always bringing the animals in at night which I thought was weird.</p> <p>One day we were suppose to get a blizzard a bad one. For some reason I was thinking about the big ape. I did not really know what Bigfoot was. I thought it was a big ape. It always closed the big door when it left. So I figured if it starts snowing it could not get in so I got the door open and I threw fruit and vegetables in and left. The blizzard came and in the end my brother and I climbed out my bedroom window to dig out the doors. We were stuck for a week. After the storm I peeked around to see if my buddy was stuck but the top part of the door was open and there was a huge path to the forest. I could not get to it because of the snow was so high. I did not hear it again till early summer.</p> <p>It was our first long weekend and I had an argument with my parents and it was dark we were surrounded by bush and I would walk into town during the day but this was first time at night. I knew there was wild farm dogs. I was walking down the main road and I heard one of those dogs coming from the bush. I was scared because there was no houses around. I all of a sudden heard A big boom from a tree falling then there was the dog growling and I could see it’s eyes. It was moving towards me. All of a sudden there was a growl that shook me. And the dog stopped and turned. There was another growl and a Big Bang I seen its eyes it was about 7 feet. The dog ran and I walked off shaking in my shoes.</p> <p>A month latter I was out wondering and a man in a totally black truck pulled up and introduced himself as a neighbor which I knew he was not. He started ask questions about big bears. I played stupid. Then a week later I was outside at night smoking and I heard gunfire it was not any shot gun either. My mom came running outside and asked where the noise came from. I knew they killed it. So I got on the bus and asked where the war was I was mad. One girl looked at another girl looked at me said a bear got in a barn. So to push it I said I hope you called and reported it. I said it against the law not to. That night I was out walking and my so called neighbor pulled up and started chatting at me and he said oh sorry to disturb your family. I said I hope you have your rocket launchers registered. He just looked at me. I have a smart mouth which he reminded me of. I smiled and said yup. He said we had a big bear in the barn. I said sure it was not a monkey. His face went stone cold. He scared me so I laughed and said no I understand you have to protect your family and your animals. I said I would have done the same thing. He nodded at me and smiled and he said good answer. Have a good day and drove off. Freaked me out.”</p>",
