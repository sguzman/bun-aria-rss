  "description": "First and foremost… Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall in the Carolinas on Friday. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families that will be impacted by this terrible event. Please be safe! Today I welcome back Chris Versace, co-founder and chief investment officer of Tematica Research. He’s an amazing stock analyst with over 20 years of experience. Chris is also a good friend. We worked together at The Street over 10 years ago. He has an incredible track record for finding great stock ideas ahead of Wall Street.   In this interview, Chris explains the easiest way for individual investors to find those ideas. He also shares several of his favorite picks… so be sure to have a pen and paper handy. Then, in my educational segment [48:26], I break down a sector most believe is dying a slow death. But fears have been blown out of proportion… giving you a great opportunity to buy these stocks at an incredibly cheap price.   Note: I suggest paying close attention to Chris Versace’s stock recommendations. The last time I interviewed a member from his team was in late June. She mentioned a stock idea that’s up about 60% in just over two months.  This is just one of the expert picks we’re tracking in the Wall Street Unplugged All-Star Portfolio. To learn more about this incredible group of stock-pickers—and how to easily access their favorite ideas—.",
