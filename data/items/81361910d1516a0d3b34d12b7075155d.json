  "description": "<p>Round 1: With Christmas over, we take a look back at what makes gift giving special. I think it’s a personal touch like giving someone their own leg that was amputated. That’d be nice. \n \nRound 2: Can eating a healthy person’s shit make you healthy? You’re unsure? So are scientists who are researching the power of poop. \n \nRound 3: A british cop has an unreal ability. He can recognize faces unlike most folks. Because of that, he’s basically been assigned firewatch forever. \n\nRound 4: President Trump issued some pardons right before Christmas and we are in full support of one of the pardons that is making waves. \n\nRound 5: A video of a fella using a flame thrower to clear his driveway of snow went viral this week. Our guy Woody Williams would be proud. But, that cant be the best weapon to clear snow.
