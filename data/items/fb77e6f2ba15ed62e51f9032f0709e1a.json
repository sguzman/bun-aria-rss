In the previous two parts, James Lindsay presented the ideas in the sixth chapter of that book, wherein we see how Freire Marxified education itself (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freires-marxification-of-education/) and explained the groomer \"dialogical\" model (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freire-birth-of-groomer-schools/). The previous parts of this series, covering the earlier chapters of the book can be found here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freires-politics-of-education/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/paulo-freire-educating-to-proclaim-the-world/), here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/04/social-work-education/), and here (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/05/paulo-freire-birth-of-groomer-schools/).\n\nIn this episode, James takes up the seventh chapter of The Politics of Education, wherein Freire outlines the need for and process of \"conscientization.\" That is, in this chapter, Freire makes it clear that the neo-Marxist consciousness-raising process is what education is actually about. Join him to understand that for Freire, education is about becoming a Marxist and a radical explicitly in the mold of revolutionary guerrillas like Che Guevara.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
