Next, Darius Butler joins the progrum to overreact to everything that happened in the games this weekend, why he thinks the Bengals are so tough, the Rams potentially giving them problems in two weeks, and more (1:19:54-1:36:42). Lastly, co-host of Good Morning Football, NFL Insider for FOX, Peter Schrager joins the show to chat about if he's had any conversations with Sean McVay, what he see's for Sean McVay moving forward, if Jimmy G has thrown his last pass as a 49ers QB, what he's hearing about the different coaching vacancies in the NFL, and who he thinks is going to win the Super Bowl (1:37:52-1:58:08).
