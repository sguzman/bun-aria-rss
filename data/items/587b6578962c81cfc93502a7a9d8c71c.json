But they all want one thing - your soul. First, Sapphire tells the tale of a little girl’s troubling best friend. After that, we’ll try to figure out why a girl is constantly finding herself in harm’s way. Then, we’ll observe a young medium attempt to banish an evil spirit, encounter the dangerous Flical, and summon a Sladkishko. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
