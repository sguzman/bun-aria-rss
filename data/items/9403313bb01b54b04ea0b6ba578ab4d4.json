  "description": "Having previously shown love to Nichole’s southern roots, we now skip across the pond to shine the spotlight on some of Bim’s British countrymen. We talk to writer Bridget Minamore about everything from roadmen to posh geeks, and ponder why Americans love a British accent. Plus, Bridget reads a naughty poem about Charlie Cox that might just put this week’s Fanfic Wars to shame...\n(We cannot be responsible for any texts you send after listening. Things get hot enough to bake a scone or two.)\nWe are loving your drabbles, so keep sending ‘em! \n\nFind show notes, fanfic, and more on our Tumblr.\nFollow us on Twitter for thirsty GIFs. Bim is @bimadew and Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman. Be there for the #ThirstyThursdayGIFParty.\nOur music is by Tanya Morgan.\nRemember to rate, review and subscribe!  \n\nAnd another thing!
