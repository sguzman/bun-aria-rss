They give a full recap of everything that happened in the Netflix phenomenon \"Tiger King\" and give their thoughts, reactions, and also try to cast the eventual biopic that we hope will be coming out soon. The guys also recap the Sweet Sixteen of March Sadness and look ahead to the Elite 8 where America's Sweetheart, SDDEO (she doesn't dump em out) looks to continue its storybook run to a national title. Today's a fun one. Stay safe this weekend, and enjoy.</p>\n",
