Of course, to the Stoics, what really mattered was that final bucket—getting wiser. Understanding yourself and the world better was their primary focus.</p><p>So if your goal is to get smarter this year, where will you start? For most people, the obvious answer is books. A lot of people begin the year committing to read a certain number of books. <em>I am going to read 50 books this year.

It’s designed that way, in fact. (It’s also on sale for $1.99 on <a href='https://geni.us/wND5i'>Amazon in the US right now</a>, and <a href='https://geni.us/wND5i'>on sale in the UK</a> as well). Tolstoy’s <a href='https://geni.us/bUXJA8K'><em>A Calendar of Wisdom </em></a>is similar. One page a day, every day, for a year. It’s an awesome format, one not used often enough. </p><p>But you could also break down Seneca’s letters this way—read one letter a day. Or <a href='https://dailystoic.com/meditations-marcus-aurelius/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=convertkit&utm_campaign=must-commit'>one passage from Marcus</a> each morning. Or one poem <a href='https://geni.us/7SJpeSM'>from Emily Dickinson</a> each day. Or one page of the Bible each evening before bed. For thousands of years, the Jewish people have divided up the Torah in what they call Parashat ha-Shavua (portion of the week) to be read aloud at synagogue, so that the entire Torah can be cycled through annually. </p><p>Beautiful. </p><p>A new year sits before you.
