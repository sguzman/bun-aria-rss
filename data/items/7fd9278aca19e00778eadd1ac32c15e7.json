  "description": "Episode 149 -  Most people worry about the future, though they have no idea if they'll even be alive tomorrow. It makes no sense to focus on something that isn't even here yet and may never get here. In this episode I talk about how life is like headlights, you can only see 15 feet in front of you so just focus on making those the most perfect 15 feet that you can. Listen to the episode for more information!<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
