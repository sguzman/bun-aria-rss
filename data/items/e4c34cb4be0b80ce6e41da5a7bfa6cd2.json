  "title": "ðŸš¨ Jaguars hire Urban Meyer - Emergency Podcast (Football 1/14)",
  "description": "One of the greatest college coaches ever is now headed to the pros. Urban Meyer has officially been hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars after days of speculation. So that means we sounded the emergency siren for Ryan Wilson and John Breech to react to the news. Meyer has a decorated career but will that translate at a different level? The #1 pick and plenty of cap space surely will aid his start. Wilson says stop debating over the top selection because there's no way Jacksonville isn't taking Trevor Lawrence in that spot. Breech thinks the organization can compete for the AFC South within a few seasons. Listen as the guys give their full breakdown and grade the Urban Meyer hire!\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts.Â \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
