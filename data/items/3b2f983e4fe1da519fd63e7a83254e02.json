He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer, and&nbsp;behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.</p><p>A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.yogawestla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoga West,</a>&nbsp;his Los Angeles home base.</p><br><p>Today's conversation is intimate exploration into cultivating compassion, developing discernment, embracing our divinity, and ultimately expanding our capacity to do what we are here to do –&nbsp;to love ourselves and love others to the best of our abilities.</p><p>We discuss the root of psychic and emotional pain and the nature of violence. We imagine new educational modalities for future generations. We dive deep into&nbsp;the power of group consciousness to drive cultural change.</p><p>And we consider the importance of maturing the social infantilism of our&nbsp;emotional infrastructure&nbsp;as a social imperative.</p><p>Over the last couple years, I have grown quite close with Guru Singh, a beautiful and highly relatable consciousness I’m proud to call friend, family and mentor. It’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.</p><p>My hope is that this conversation will empower you to more&nbsp;deeply invest in the development of your conscious awareness, personal boundaries, and spiritual growth.</p><p>Because, to quote Guru Singh,&nbsp;life is not about controlling the outside world, it's about mastering perceptions from the inside.</p><p>Note: If you missed our initial two conversations, you can find them <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/guru-singh/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/guru-singh-2/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p><p>Another Note:&nbsp;We recorded this episode back in mid-February, so the topical events we discuss are not quite as current as they were on the date of the conversation.
