  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Today I have an exclusive interview for you with Jeff Phillips, President of Global Market Development. If you haven't heard of Jeff, that's likely because he rarely gives interviews. But he's one of the most trusted names in the resource industry – like frequent guest and close friend, Marin Katusa. After financing over 100 different resource companies, Jeff has developed a unique approach to investing in this highly volatile sector. He’s helped me and my listeners generate a ton of money over the years. And he could do the same for you today... In this 30 minute interview, Jeff reveals…  Why today’s resource bear market may finally coming off its bottoms. His current investment thesis for the gold, uranium, and rare-earth metal industries. And the names of four junior miners he believes are “buys” right now...  Don't miss what he has to say. Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
