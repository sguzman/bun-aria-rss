Many of us have had to pivot our work situations, how we educate our children, and how we connect with our loved ones. Some folks have struggled to make ends meet and lost access to important outlets like gyms and therapists. Even worse, some people have experienced loss.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Pandemic fatigue has set in, leaving many people feeling exhausted, burnt out, and pushed to their limits. And as you can imagine, living in a place of constant stress and fear can take a toll on our health—both mentally and physically.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On this episode of The Model Health Show, we’re diving back into the studies on COVID-19.
