  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by one of his good old pals and director of Superbob, Corner Boys and MUCH more, it’s JON DREVER!</p><br><p>The self-described work-wife of Brett, having worked alongside each other for a good amount of years on all kinds of projects, Jon provides a perfect brotherly dynamic right here on Films To Be Buried With - if by brotherly we’re talking about sly digs, anger and an undercurrent of passive-aggressiveness… Just messing, of course! It’s a great one with the two, very much the family get together Christmas episode, and a wonderful opportunity to get to know Jon up close and personal, in the most intimate way - through his cinematic choices! Beginning with a letter from Jon himself, read out by Brett, to foreshadow what’s to come, the two go in on it all - their chemistry, their work together, Jon’s film commandments (take note), him not being good with horrors or teary films, and of course, the much hinted at FURIOUS ANGER of Brett in response to a pick of Jon’s. A treat in itself. We always knew that cool, calm and happy veneer would crack soon, right? PLEASE ENJOY, and a very happy Christmas to you too if you get down with such festivities.
