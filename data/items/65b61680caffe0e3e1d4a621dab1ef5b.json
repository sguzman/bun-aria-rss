  "description": "Late at night in the office of Chief of Staff John Kelly.  The phone rings.  He picks it up and hears heavy breathing.  Then a raspy voice…could it be Bannon…could it be Wolff…says “Have you checked the President?”  Kelly lurches forward and grabs a secure line.  “Trace the call!”  Then, the chilling answer comes back.  The call is coming from inside the White House!!!  You think that’s a horror story?  Then you haven’t been reading the news.  Fortunately for you our special Deep State Radio guests have.  Join Lawfare’s Susan Hennessey, the NY Times David Sanger, the Atlantic Council’s Evelyn Farkas and our own soon-to-be relocating author-teacher-expert Kori Schake for an exploration through the terrifying underbrush of the past few days on our latest episode.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
