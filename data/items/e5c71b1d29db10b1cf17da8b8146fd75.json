  "description": "In this episode we have with us Edward Reisert, the National Sales Director of Libeco Home who is going to be talking to us about linens. Ed tells us the origin story of their linens and what defines the quality. We talk about the many different benefits of living in linen from a study showing people who sleep in linen, sleep 20% better to how this fabric helps your body thermoregulate and is 8 times more absorbent than cotton.  We also get some tips on the wear and tear of linen, how long it lasts and how to care for it.  <br /><br />Shop our linen collection here:  <a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/collections/shop-dear-alice\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/collections/shop-dear-alice</a><br /><br />Background on the origin of linen and what separates Ed’s company 2:06<br />The benefits of sleeping with linen sheets 7:11<br />Linen towels 14:40<br />Wear and tear of linen 26:01<br /><br />“We as Americans grow cotton here. So it is the fabric of our lives and it has fabulous usage for our lives, and I’m not going to knock cotton because I use it. I’m wearing it from head to toe right now, but it’s got its limitations and it’s where I think linen takes off is in the home textile arena in particular. The ability for it to give us these functions with as light a footprint on the planet that it does, we think that’s just the perfect recipe for a home textile.” 24:53<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-reisert-2b874726/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-reisert-2b874726/</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
