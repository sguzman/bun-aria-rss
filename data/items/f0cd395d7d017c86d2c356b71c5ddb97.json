  "description": "<p>No one speaks their mind quite like comedian, TV host Samantha Bee, and this time she's upfront and personal with Tig. Together they advise a listener on how to snap out of a crush on their therapist and tackle the tough issue of figuring out if someone actually likes you or is just being polite. Then Tig and Samantha bond over how and when they each had that \"birds and bees talk\" with their own kids and also how they personally cope with grieving a lost loved one. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp Online Counseling (betterhelp.com/tig) and Indeed (indeed.com/tig). </p>\n<p>Need advice?
