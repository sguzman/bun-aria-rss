  "description": "<p>No matter what your goal is, a clearly defined purpose is key to success. If you haven’t outlined why you’re working toward change, you’ll quickly become unmotivated and give up.</p> <p>But it’s not enough to simply have a motive. In order to create lasting change, your why should have meaning behind it. Your why should give you a purpose, bring you fulfillment, and inspire you on days when motivation is lacking.</p> <p>Once you define your why, everything becomes much clearer. Whether we’re talking about fitness, money, or life in general, a fulfilling purpose is a catalyst for change.</p> <p>On today’s show, my friend Drew Manning is back to share the lessons he’s learned about discovering a meaningful purpose, practicing gratitude, and developing a stronger sense of empathy. We’ll talk about the dangers of staying in your comfort zone, the importance of learning self-love, and how to find strength in vulnerability.</p> <h2>In this episode you’ll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>The biggest lesson Drew learned throughout gaining and losing 70 pounds.</li> <li>Why changing your perceptionis so important for your health.</li> <li>How our culture’s “all or nothing” mindset fails us.</li> <li>The importance of self-lovewhen striving toward your goals.</li> <li>Why you should honor your body’s individual version of healthy.</li> <li>Three key thingsyou can do to motivate people in your life to be healthier.</li> <li>What it truly means to live by example (and why the alternative doesn’t work!)</li> <li>How judgement and misunderstanding have created a huge gap in the fitness world.</li> <li>How to begin to build empathy, and why it can be so life-changing.</li> <li>The power of vulnerabilityin health, fitness, and life.</li> <li>Why having an aesthetics-based motive isn’t sustainable long-term.</li> <li>The truth about channeling motivation (even for fit people!)</li> <li>How to avoid burning outin fitness.</li> <li>Why you should be open to doing things you aren’t good at.</li> <li>The importance of breaking outside of your comfort zone.</li> <li>How practicing gratitude can influence your success.</li> <li>The profound effects of positive affirmations.</li> <li>Why being stagnant is actually moving backwards.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.takecontrolwithet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Takecontrolwithet.com</a>⇐ Use promo code HEALTH for 10% off conference tickets!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/Model</a>⇐ Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/thrivemarket\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thrivemarket.com/modelhealth</a>⇐ 25% off your entire 1st order + free shipping!</li> <li><a href=\"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/drew-manning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weight Loss Breakthroughs and Accountability with Drew Manning – Episode 110</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/weight-loss-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Winning the Weight Loss Race Together with Drew Manning – Episode 139</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/take-control-your-health-fitness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3 Simple Keys to Take Control of Your Health and Fitness – Episode 296</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/mark-hyman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battling Conflicting Diet Information & Nutritionism with Dr. Mark Hyman – Episode 270</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Full-Body-Light-Therapy-Joovv/dp/B01DH8XK6W\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LED Red Light Therapy by Joovv</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Vulnerability-Teachings-Authenticity-Connection/dp/B00D1Z9RFU/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Power of Vulnerability by Brene Brown </a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Fit2Fat2Fit-Unexpected-Lessons-Gaining-Purpose/dp/0062194216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fit2Fat2Fit by Drew Manning</a></li> <li>Fit2Fat2Fit Experience Podcast <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fit2fat2fit-experience/id1037173387?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-fit2fat2fit-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.fit2fat2fit.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Website</a></li> <li>Connect with Drew Manning <a href= \"https://twitter.com/fit2fat2fit\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a>/ <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/fit2fat2fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+299.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
