  "description": "<p>We further develop the string $1/c^2$ expansion of closed bosonic string\ntheory, where $c$ is the speed of light. The expansion will be performed up to\nand including the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We show that the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) theory is equal to the Gomis--Ooguri string,\ngeneralised to a curved target space, provided the target space geometry admits\na certain class of co-dimension-2 foliations. We compute the energy of the\nstring up to NNLO for a flat target space with a circle that must be wound by\nthe string, and we show that it agrees with the $1/c^2$ expansion of the\nrelativistic energy. We also compute the algebra of Noether charges for a flat\ntarget space and show that this matches order-by-order with an appropriate\nexpansion of the Poincar\\'e algebra, which at NLO gives the string Bargmann\nalgebra. Finally, we expand the phase space action, which allows us to perform\nthe Dirac procedure and pass to the quantum theory. It turns out that the\nPoisson brackets change at each order, and we show that the normal ordering\nconstant of the relativistic theory, which does not depend on $c$, can be\nreproduced by the NLO and NNLO theories.\n</p>",
