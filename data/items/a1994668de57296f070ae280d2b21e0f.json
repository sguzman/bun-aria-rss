  "description": "<p>Gerry and Kirk had a long talk yesterday that has apparently left them both on good terms. Vindog might be the funniest person at Barstool after reading a blog he posted. Joy Ann-Reid picks a strange time to criticize people for paying too much attention to missing white girls. Kirk answers some questions about potential niche categories on The Dozen. The Emmy's are just a giant advertisement put on by network TV for streaming services. A draft of Kirkâ€™s high school friends takes place which might be the most inside segment in all of podcasting.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
