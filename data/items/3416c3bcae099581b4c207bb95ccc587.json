Do you embrace it, filled with hope for the future? Or are you somebody who’s more cautious, even worried about what change might portend?

Listen in for Rinne’s unique perspective.\nApril Rinne is one of the 50 leading female futurists in the world, a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum and a Fulbright Scholar. She’s also traveled to over 100 countries as part of having a front-row seat to a world in flux.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of nine books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc.
