When she was set up on a blind date with an older man named Mel Ignatow, she thought she had finally found the right guy. He was successful and gave Brenda a lot of attention. After a while, though, things began to sour and it was learned that Mel was very controlling and abusive. After Brenda broke things off with him, she went missing.
