  "title": "Karmen MacKendrick, “The Matter of Voice: Sensual Soundings” (Fordham UP, 2016)",
  "description": "Philosophers have long tried to silence the physical musicality of voice in favor of the purity of ideas without matter, souls without bodies. But voices resonate among bodies and texts; they are singular, as unique as fingerprints, but irreducibly collective too. They are material, somatic, and musical. Voices also give body to concepts that cannot exist in abstraction, essential to sense yet in excess of it. They complicate the logos of the beginning and emphasize the enfleshing of all words. Karmen MacKendrick’s The Matter of Voice: Sensual Soundings (Fordham University Press, 2016) explores all this and more through theology and philosophy, pedagogy, translation, and semiotics. It is a beautifully written and challenging book.\n\nKarmen MacKendrick  is Professor of Philosophy at Le Moyne College\n\n\n\nHillary Kaell co-hosts NBIR and is Associate Professor of Religion at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
