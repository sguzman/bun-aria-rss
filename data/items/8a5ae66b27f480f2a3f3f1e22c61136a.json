  "description": "A shooting at St. Stephen's Church, which is about 10 minutes from our studio, has left two dead and a gunman in custody. The initial reports say the gunman previously attended the church and opened fire at a \"Boomer's Potluck\" event hosted by the church. In other news, Trump accurately predicted every catastrophe should Biden be elected. Father's Day is this weekend, so we run down our favorite Father's Day gifts. Why are thousands of cattle dropping dead in Kansas? And speaking of dropping dead, Biden attempts to offer condolences and it doesn't go great.  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
