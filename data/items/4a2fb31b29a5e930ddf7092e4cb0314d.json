  "description": "Our audiobook this week is RING YOUR NECK by Jaycee Wolfe\n\nPierce:\n\nBaseball and Milly—the only two things I’ve cared about since I was five years old. I may have lost her, but if I have to lose the other to get her back, then so be it. Being forced to leave her the first time nearly killed me. Once I find her again, I’m binding her to me forever.\n\nMilly:\n\nWatching my best friend, the other half of my soul, and the only boy I would ever love drive off, leaving me alone in a town where no one, and I mean no one, understands me. Yeah, that rocked me to my core. I thought I had finally gotten over it, over him. Then he waltzes back into town, revealing old secrets and opening even older wounds. Once the answers to the questions I have been fighting against for so long are revealed, I only hope they are enough to fix my shattered heart and bind us together again.
