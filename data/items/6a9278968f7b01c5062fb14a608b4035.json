  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/janefinette/\">Jane Finette</a> learned about the value of leadership coaching late in her career, but when she finally did, it changed everything. </p><p>She left her position as Chief of Staff to the CEO of Mozilla, the global internet company behind the Firefox browser, to launch <a href=\"https://tcfs.org/\">The Coaching Fellowship</a>. This non-profit organization helps advance young women as social change leaders by giving them the coaching they need to become their best selves.  It’s a community of professionally-trained, volunteer coaches who span more than 25 countries. Since its inception in 2014, more than 1,000 women from 70 countries have graduated from the Coaching Fellowship. </p><p>“I’ve had a lot of training over my 25-year career, but never anything quite like coaching.  And it cracked my world open,” says Jane Finette.“I immediately realized I was in the wrong career and understood that most of my successes so far were not much more than happy accidents.  It wasn’t until I experienced coaching, that I could make solid decisions with positive intention.” </p><p>Jane has recently published her first book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1636767427/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_PQ1V1B6NFRXRJJE1FJDR\">Unlocked – How Empowered Women Empower Women</a> as both a referendum on women’s inequality and a toolkit for leveling the playfield for women and girls.It’s a collection of real-world short stories about female leaders who are working to propel women and girls forward.</p><p>“Sexual violence statistics are through the roof, sub-Saharan girls are not in school, US women are losing many rights and in Afghanistan, 20 years of headway was wiped out in a few days. Reading these headlines in the throes of the pandemic, I realized that women lost a generation of progress in 2020,” says Jane.  “But I believe we can turn this around when every woman stands up for other women. That’s why my book Unlocked is part inspiration, part practical guide.”   </p><p>In this episode, you’ll learn about Jane’s own experience of leadership coaching and how it changed the trajectory of her career and her life.  You’ll learn how she’s taken what she learned from coaching and turned it into a global movement to empower women and girls. You’ll be inspired by Jane’s uplifting and instructive view of the power of women in leadership. </p><h1>Listener Competition</h1><p>Win a signed copy of <i>Unlocked – How Empowered Women Empower Women,</i> by Jane Finette, founder of The Coaching Fellowship. </p><p>To enter the draw, share a link to this podcast on social media and tag Trilogy Effect (our social media profiles are linked below).
