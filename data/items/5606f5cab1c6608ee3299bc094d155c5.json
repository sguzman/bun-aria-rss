  "description": "Tania Joya grew up in a British Muslim community believing that she was only half as valuable as a man. She was radicalized by a college friend who told her America “deserved” 9/11 and soon after became a mail-order bride to an American who would rise in the ranks of ISIS. But through it all, she sensed something truly evil about the oppressive, hate-filled culture of Islamism that told her she had no rights. She now proudly says that the FBI and America saved her life – and gave her the freedom to tell quite a story. Tania doesn’t hold back as she lays out exactly what jihadism is and what she’s doing now to deradicalize the individuals it has enslaved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
