  "description": "<p>Rampant consumerism and consumption is becoming the norm, and this is partly due to the fact that it is so easy to make purchases online. $Pro Katy Wolk-Stanley is challenging that notion by refusing to buy new stuff, and instead, she’s prioritizing her goals and values when it comes to consumption. Free piles of stuff on the sidewalk and your local Buy Nothing group can be great, but they’re not the only way to drastically cut back. Listen as we’re challenged by Katy and as we seek to save more of our money by spending less on junk we don’t need.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an AZ Dreamsicle by Arizona Wilderness which you can find on Untappd. A huge thanks to Brandon for donating this beer to the show!
