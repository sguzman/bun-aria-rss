  "description": "The penultimate day is here and it's time to make sure you're updated and fulfilled as we declare it the games of Ester Ledecka and Canadian bronze with day 15 of PyeongChang 2018. Why is it such a big deal for Canada to break the bronze drought in Men's Ice Hockey and eclipse the fortune of the great Grenoble 68 side?

Can Jarrod try and explain to us the rules of mass start speed skating? And why has Australia just packed up and gone home? Listen in, get educated and excited as another episode comes through your ears! ",
