A handsome, fit, successful doctor? She was interested. But, beginning with their first date, there were warning signs...something wasn't quite right here. But she ignored her instincts and allowed him to move quickly. He moved in with her after a few weeks and convince her to marry him after just two months. All the while, her adult children begged her to pay attention to the red flags, lies, and abusive behavior.<br>\n<br>\nIn Part 1, we learn about Debra and John's whirlwind romance, see how he groomed her, and meet several other women he victimized and terrorized over the years. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 100 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more!
