  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! I begin today's episode by covering one of the most talked about companies on Wall Street - Apple. Their earnings were just released, beating expectations across the board. And since the news, analysts' reactions have been overwhelmingly bullish. But I can't say I agree… And I'm not so sure about Apple's quarter being \"dynamic\" either. After doing some of my own digging, I've realized there are some underlying truths about Apple’s 2016 end results... catalysts' that no one else cares to mention. Year-over-year, earnings have only grown 2% - mostly influenced by buybacks and a favorable tax rate. Yes, they blew expectations out of the water. But how much were earnings estimates lowered? Thus far, I've had a pretty good track record on covering this tech giant... and considering all of the noise surrounding this story - I have to warn my listeners. So, before my guest signs on, I'll be explaining why I'm not buying into all of the hype. Then, for today's main segment… I'll be introducing listeners to a stock that should 100% - be on everyone’s radar. The following company has the potential to become the next \"market dominator.\" And shares are still selling for under $1. That’s why I brought on today’s guest, Garth Braun - President and CEO of Blackbird Energy (BBI.V). Garth's Blackbird Energy was by far, in my opinion, the most impressive company at last week's Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - which hosted over 200 names in the sector. Garth has done the unthinkable. And I was sold in less than 5 minutes of talking to him… Garth has taken Blackbird from a small, speculative explorer - to a $300 Million dollar company. And unlike most junior's in the sector, they don't just have a stake in the ground... waiting for a price-tag or an industry-leader acquisition... They are actually drilling and producing some of the finest natural-gas condensate in the world - located smack in the middle of the Montney Formation - Canada's next big energy bet. \"Over the last 18 months, some of the largest transactions in Canada, outside of the oil sands, have been located in this region.\" Industry leaders like Encana, Apache, Shell, and Sinopec now have holdings practically located in Blackbird's backyard. To make matters better, Garth was one of the first to discover this liquid-rich area. In 2014, he says, people considered this land as \"moose pasture.\" But it doesn't stop there… Due to the low priced oil market, Garth's team has been determined to innovate. And as a result, Blackbird Energy has made significant advancements. They've cut costs \"dramatically\" with state of the art technology. And experts are calling their innovations \"disruptive.\" Garth has clearly lead his company through an amazing transformation. Although the stock price is currently resting at 52-week highs, the recent jump has been well deserved. This is not meant to be a promotion. I truly believe this company has more upside potential than any other stock priced below $1. However, as we all know, rewards will come with risks. Stocks that are priced this low can still be very volatile - especially in the oil industry. So I’m urging all listeners to do their own research. Still, Blackbird’s story is one you don’t want to miss. And finally, for today's Educational Segment, we're throwing stocks, finance, and economics out the door. I will be making one of boldest bets all year.",
