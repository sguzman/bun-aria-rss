  "description": "Pop some popcorn, imagine the flashing lights, and step right into the big top of your mind. The sounds of laughter and carnival music are so loud you almost can’t hear the clowns feasting on the children or the screams behind the curtains. This circus is free to enter but it will take something that you’ll miss...if you make it out alive. Enjoy the show at the Carn-evil of Frights. First, \"Fancy Flopsy\" is your clown friend till the end. Next, a death-defying high-wire act goes wrong in \"The White Rabbit\". After that, a detour to the real-life haunted clown Motel. And finally, a circus trinket goes POP and you’re next, in Jack in the Box (Abridged) by Michael Thomas Lee. \n\n                         \nLearn more about your ad choices.
