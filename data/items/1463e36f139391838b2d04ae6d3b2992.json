  "description": "<p>There are times in our lives as consumers, that we’re faced with a decision: even though I can’t afford it, do I buy this thing that I really want? “Ohhh, that new iPhone looks really awesome” or “It would be a ton of fun to take a trip to the mountains next month!”. We often already know that the answer to these questions should be “No, I don’t have the money” because we know it’s not worth going into debt for these types of expenses. But sometimes the answer isn’t always as cut and dried as we’d like it to be. What if, as someone looking to invest in yourself, you’re thinking about taking out some student loans? Or what if you’re considering purchasing a home and you don’t have hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside? Occasionally, we find ourselves in these situations where debt might make sense. Listen as we talk through some of those scenarios as well as what else to keep in mind when you’re considering taking on debt.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Czech Pilsner by yEAST Atlanta Brewers- a big thanks to our beer brewing friend John Francis for donating this beer to the show!
