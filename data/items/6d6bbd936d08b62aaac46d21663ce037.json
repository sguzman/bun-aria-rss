  "description": "As the 70th anniversary of the partition of British India approaches, Owen Bennett Jones is in Pakistan. In the massive, energetic, creative and sometimes violent city of Karachi, Owen and his guests ask how successful has Pakistan been, what was its purpose and have these goals been fulfilled?  Also, was it meant to be an Islamic state at its birth and if so, how has that project gone? Pakistanis often blame foreign powers for their problems but how fair is that?  Join Owen for Newshour Extra as we consider Pakistan's record and ask where the country might be heading.\n\n(Photo: a Pakistani labourer hangs wedding fabrics to dry after the dyeing process in Lahore.
