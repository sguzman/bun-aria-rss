  "title": "331: How to Understand Oneness | Roshi Norma Wong",
  "description": "Today we’re diving into a concept that is simultaneously one of the oldest contemplative cliches and one of the most profound head scratchers — oneness. Can *you* be one with everything if *you* don’t really exist? And, even if we manage to grok this idea, what are the practical ramifications? Actually, this is just one of the many riddles and paradoxes we’ll be exploring today. \nMy guest is Roshi Norma Wong. She was recommended to us by frequent guest and friend of TPH, The Reverend angel Kyodo Williams. Roshi Norma is a Zen Master, a life-long resident of Hawaii, a former State legislator, and abbot of a Zen temple called Anko-in. In this conversation, we talk about:\n•\tUnderstanding -- and experiencing -- oneness\n•\tRemoving the binary between relaxation and focus\n•\tWhy she thinks we need to cultivate pride and humility simultaneously\n•\tWhy she thinks that before we try to solve the world’s problems, we need to become better people\n•\tAnd why our current moment of compounding global catastrophes presents us with an unprecedented opportunity\nSpeaking of transformation in the face of crisis, we’ve always done our best to use this podcast as a place to figure out how to navigate our ever-shifting world. Over the last year, for example, we’ve spoken with experts about how to cope with the coronavirus, from dealing with anxiety and grief to parenting in a pandemic to worries about money.\nThe practice of meditation undergirds all of the practical takeaways you hear us discuss on this podcast–and many of our podcast guests have contributed to our companion meditation app. Our app helps you understand both how to practice meditation and how meditation can help you navigate our ever-changing world.\nWe hope that you'll subscribe to our app to learn how to care for yourself and others during crises (which are, after all, inevitable). \nTo make it easier, we're offering 40% off the price of an annual subscription for our podcast \tlisteners. We don’t do discounts of this size all the time, and of course nothing is permanent—so get this deal before it ends on April 1st by going to www.tenpercent.com/march, for 40% off your subscription.\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/roshi-norma-wong-331\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
