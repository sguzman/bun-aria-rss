  "itunes:summary": "Del Lumanta is an artist, musician, DJ, educator and organiser living and working on Eora Country. Their expansive practice moves between genres and mediums, explored under pseudonyms and collaborative projects. \n\nFellow DIY and experimental musician Emma Ramsay takes a deep dive into the internal and lateral workings of Del Lumanta's sonic practice in Out of Field: The Sonic Practice of Del Lumanta published on LA’s online journal Disclaimer. Ramsay's profile traces Lumanta’s experimental roots within Sydney's community radio and DIY communities and underscores the way in which their incessant development of band projects and collaborations provides a freedom of movement in process and approach, to discard and pick up new creative processes at whim.\n\nToday on the podcast, Del Lumanta talks through how field recordings became a part of their music production, the affect of performance contexts within both institutions and the diy scene, and their work within community projects such as New Age Noise and Radio Skid Row. \n\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/out-of-field-the-sonic-practice-of-del-lumanta\n\nImage: Warwick Baker\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
