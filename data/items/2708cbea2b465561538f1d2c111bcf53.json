  "description": "<p>In 2020 the United States experienced a nearly 30 percent rise in homicides from 2019. That’s the single biggest one-year increase since we started keeping national records in 1960. And violence has continued to rise well into 2021.</p><p>To deny or downplay the seriousness of this spike is neither morally justified nor politically wise. Violence takes lives, traumatizes children, instills fear, destroys community life and entrenches racial and economic inequality. Public opinion responds in kind:<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/\"> Polling</a><a href=\"https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/70_of_voters_say_crime_is_out_of_control\"> indicates</a> that Americans are increasingly worried about violent crime. And if November’s state and local campaigns were any indication, public safety will be a defining issue in upcoming election cycles.</p><p>Liberals and progressives need an answer to the question of how to handle rising violence. But that answer doesn’t need to involve a return to the punitive, tough-on-crime approach that has devastated Black and brown communities for decades and led millions of people to take to the streets in protest last summer.</p><p>Patrick Sharkey is a sociologist at Princeton University and the author of<a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/Uneasy-Peace/\"> “Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence.”</a> The central claim of his work is this: Police are effective at reducing violence, but they aren’t the only actors capable of doing so. Sharkey has studied community-based models for addressing violence in places as varied as rural Australia and New York City. As a result, he has developed a compelling, evidence-backed vision of how cities and communities can tackle violent crime without relying heavily on police.</p><p>So this conversation is about what an alternative approach to addressing the current homicide spike could look like and all the messy, difficult questions it raises. It also explores the causes of the homicide spike, why Sharkey thinks policing is ultimately an “unsustainable” solution to crime, how New York City managed to reduce gun violence by 50 percent while reducing arrests and prison populations, whether it’s possible to overcome the punitive politics of rising crime, why America has such abnormally high levels of violent crime in the first place and more. </p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417736289?journalCode=asra\">“Community and the Crime Decline: The Causal Effect of Local Nonprofits on Violent Crime”</a> by Patrick Sharkey, Gerard Torrats-Espinosa and Delaram Takyar </p><p><a href=\"https://johnjayrec.nyc/2020/11/09/av2020/\">“Reducing Violence Without Police: A Review of Research Evidence”</a></p><p><a href=\"https://squareonejustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CJLJ8743-Social-Fabric-Square-One-WEB-report-210406.pdf\">“Social Fabric: A New Model For Public Safety and Vital Neighborhoods”</a> by Elizabeth Glazer and Patrick Sharkey</p><p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.22323\">“Can Precision Policing Reduce Gun Violence?
