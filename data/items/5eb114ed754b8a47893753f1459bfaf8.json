  "description": "<p>You can have ALL the money in the world but TIME is your most valuable asset. </p> <p>Trusting in the PLAN doesn’t mean that the plan is always going to be easy. Sometimes you have to weather the storm and have FAITH that it’s all happening FOR you and not TO you.  </p> <p>In this interview, we touch on topics that have never been discussed before on this show and we dive deep into the darkness that Jenna encountered with her devastating struggle with multiple miscarriages.</p> <p>Jenna shares the super-power she used in building her brand and business and how all of it came from the heart. She gets real on the dynamic of her marriage and how she and Drew keep it all together.</p> <p>Many of us are so FOCUSED on taking care of others, but when you are on an airplane the flight attendant always says “if there is a loss in cabin pressure, put on YOUR oxygen mask before helping someone else.” This is because if you don’t take care of yourself FIRST, you cannot help anyone else. You can’t pour from an empty cup!</p> <p>Typically our own worst enemy is our inner dialogue. This episode will teach you how to SHIFT this dialogue and make a choice every day to EMBODY these words not just speak them.</p> <p>We both shed a couple of tears in this interview. It’s a POWERFUL and MOVING conversation that we all can gain a lot from.</p> <p> </p>\n",
