  "description": "<p>“FOOD IS MEDICINE. IT WORKS FASTER, BETTER, AND CHEAPER THAN ALMOST ANY DRUG.”<br />\nI know how hard it is to eat a healthy diet.<br />\nIt requires time and energy that you often feel like you don’t have. But what if I told you the time and energy you think you don’t have is because of the food you’re currently putting into your body?<br />\nIt's easy to be skeptical about this idea. But that’s what the food industry wants us to think. It wants us to continue eating its food, not giving a second thought to the sugars and fat we’re putting into our system.<br />\nTo break free from this mindset, it's really helpful to talk to the experts. And today, I have one of the most knowledgeable people in the field: Dr. Mark Hyman.<br />\nDr. Mark Hyman, M.D. is the founder and medical director of the UltraWellness Center, Director of the Cleveland Clinical Center for Functional Medicine, and the Chairman of the Board of the Institute for Functional Medicine.<br />\nHe is a New York Times bestselling author with books like 10-Day Detox Diet and Eat Fat, Get Thin. His latest book Food: What The Heck Should I Eat? provides an explanation of the nutritional science around food and why the political, environmental, economic and social issues corrupt our understanding of food.<br />\nDr. Hyman is one of my favorite people to learn about health from because he is so honest about what's going on. Instead of trying to push his own agenda, he's got humanity's best interest at heart.<br />\nIf you’re looking to learn about the connection between food and energy or how the food industry manipulates what we see on TV, tune into Episode 616 to forever change your eating habits.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow does our food impact everything? (6:45)<br />\nHow does funding affect the public discourse about food? (12:47)<br />\nDo you think all inflammation, chronic pain and disease can be eliminated from the foods we eat? (16:30)<br />\nCan you gain muscle mass living a fully vegetarian/vegan lifestyle? (20:48)<br />\nWhat are the 3 basic food rules you live by? (24:55)<br />\nWhat do you think the main thing people are feeding themselves that’s hurting them? (30:42)<br />\nWhat’s the biggest challenge you face in your life? (32:13)<br />\nIs there anything now you believe in that you think will eventually be debunked? (38:15)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nHow Dr. Hyman sees food affecting our environment (8:13)<br />\nWhen Dr. Hyman’s opinion was influenced by the food industry (12:59)<br />\nWhat Dr. Hyman, being a functional doctor, sees as the root of disease (16:38)<br />\nThe question Dr. Hyman asks himself when food shopping (25:00)<br />\nWhat Dr. Hyman sees as the greater footprint beyond your own health (28:24)<br />\nHow Dr. Hyman sees the power of the individual vs. the food system (34:00)<br />\nWhat Dr. Hyman sees as the problems with grouping disease by symptoms and not causes (38:15)</p>\n",
