Thomas’ work in these areas has had a great impact, most notably, through her 2018 books <a href= \"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Absolute-Time-Modern-British-Metaphysics/dp/0198807937/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Emily+Thomas+philosophy&qid=1553769348&s=gateway&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Absolute Time: Rifts in Early Modern British Metaphysics</a> and <a href= \"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Modern-Women-Metaphysics-Thomas/dp/1107178681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Early Modern Women on Metaphysics.</a></p> <p>In this episode, we’ll be discussing Emily Thomas’ forthcoming work on The Idealism and Pantheism of <a href= \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Sinclair\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">May Sinclair</a>. Born in 1863, May Sinclair was a prolific novelist, as well as a deeply influential poet, translator, critic and philosopher. It Is this last field, philosophy, which perhaps she is least well known for her work. Amongst her many great novels, short stories and poems, May Sinclair published her philosophical treatise in A Defence of Idealism in 1917, and The New Idealism in 1922, which both form the focus of today’s discussion. Sinclair’s unusual take on questions concerning space and time, god, and classic philosophical problems such as Zeno’s paradox, provide us with a refreshing and exciting approach to our understanding of the universe. Combined with her great passion, wit, and her breathtaking writing style, it is no stretch to say that May Sinclair is one of the 20th-centuries most underrated philosophers.</p>",
