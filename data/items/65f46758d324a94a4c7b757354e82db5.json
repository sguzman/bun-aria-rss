  "description": "<div>I’ve talks to countless individuals, families, and investigators about their haunting encounters and quite honestly, the story of The Bothell Hell House is one of the most terrifying I’ve ever heard. I can’t recall a case where so many dark and seemingly demonic signs and actions were taken against the living with such force and hate. This is truly a stunning case about pure evil and its desire to wreak havoc on the lives of the living.<br>\n<br>\nTo listen to both parts of the interview become a Grave Keeper at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\">http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks</a><br>\n<br>\nVisit our episode page at <a href=\"http://www.thegravetalks.com/the-bothell-hell-house/\">http://www.thegravetalks.com/the-bothell-hell-house/</a>\n</div>\n",
