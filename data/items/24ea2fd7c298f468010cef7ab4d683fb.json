  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin! The concept of sanctuaries has a deep history and it evolved from protecting what is right under the law to rebelling against the letter of the law as we see in today's sanctuary cities and states. This flippant approach to the rule of law is why the democrats have rejected the peaceful transition of power. The party of slavery and Jim Crow has become the Party of open borders. In the same way that leftists have used nullification to defy federal immigration law, cities, counties, and states should nullify local laws that impose limitations on the second Amendment. It’s why the nullification movement has grown to include law enforcement officials that are now refusing to enforce laws they believe are unconstitutional. Sadly, for so many 'progressives' the Constitution and our individual liberties mean nothing! The free will of the people is being hindered more and more by the iron fist of the central government and once freedom is gone you don't get it back. Then, illegal immigration is the Democrats tool to remake the American electorate. Later, globalism, the adherence to internal norms in governance, is the left's solution to destroying capitalism. Iran remains a threat to their region. Iran, now armed with $150 billion refunded to them by President Obama, is free to develop a missile program to hurt America, our allies and our interests. Despite Obama providing this type of aid to a known enemy impeachment was never pursued.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
