  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, July 4th, 1776, didn't just happen it was carefully planned. A lot of blood was spilled to achieve independence from England. There were protests and then massacres over taxation. In the Spring of 1774, following the Boston Tea Party, laws were passed to pay for the housing of British soldiers and demand restitution for the lost tea. Next, the British planned to take the gun powder of the militiamen and this led to Paul Revere’s famous midnight run warning that \"The red coats are coming!\" which set off the Revolutionary War. Then, Judge Ketanji Brown-Jackson has been sworn in as the newest Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. By her own admission during her confirmation hearing, Brown-Jackson wouldn't commit to a philosophy of natural rights or rights that are endowed to us by God our creator. Later, President Biden was embarrassingly asked if America was going backward while he was in Spain and trashed the US Supreme Court in the process. Biden's misstatements embolden the radical culture of death perpetrated by the left. Afterward, Fox News Anchor Maria Bartiromo joins the show to explain how the Democrats' economic policy is hurting America. Bartiromo added that the Chinese Communist Party has gained tremendous influence in the United States, particularly with the Democrat Party.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
