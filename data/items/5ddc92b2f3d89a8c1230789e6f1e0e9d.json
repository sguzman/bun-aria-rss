  "description": "<div> <p>We’re huge fans of S.A. Cosby’s pulse-pounding noir novels set in Red Hill County, VA—and we’re not alone: Dennis Lehane, Walter Mosley, Lee Child, Stephen King and Laura Lippman are too. But <em>Blacktop Wasteland</em> and <em>Razorblade Tears</em> are more than action-packed thrill rides where the bad guys are <em>very</em> bad and the good guys are doing the best they can with what they have. S.A. Cosby joins us on the show to talk about redemption, family, writers he loves, and making up lies to find the truth. Featured books: Razorblade Tears and Blacktop Wasteland by S.A. Cosby, A Thousand Acres by Jane Smiley, and The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollack. Produced/Hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.</p> </div>",
