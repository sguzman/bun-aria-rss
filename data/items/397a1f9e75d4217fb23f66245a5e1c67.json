  "description": "<p>I love a good scandal. So this week’s podcast covers the best of the last 30 years. From Champagne to a corrupt Canadian wine critic to Austria’s downfall in the 80s, we discuss the wrongdoing of some big time players in the industry. Then we move on to the fun stories of a world of which we’ll never be a part: the wealthy, elite collectors of rare, old (and appallingly expensive) wines and how a few cunning dudes defrauded collectors and duped critics. We cover Hardy Rodenstock, the subject of The Billlionaire’s Vinegar (a great book! Shameless plug: Go to www.audibletrial.com/winefornormalpeople to get a FREE audiobook download) and Rudy Kurniawan, whose story is even crazier and more recent. The Grape of the Week is Melon de Bourgogne/Muscadet. Per our recommendation: make sure to look for Muscadet Sevre et Maine and sur lie on the labels for quality. Enjoy!
