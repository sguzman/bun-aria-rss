  "description": "As you probably know, I just got back from the Crypto Connect & NFT Expo… And despite the crypto bear market, the attendees' energy was electric. I highlight the critical feature that has everybody excited about the metaverse’s game-changing potential. Longtime listeners know I’ve been pounding the table on metaverse investing. If you’re still on the fence, the ultimate validation is this: investment banks have been quietly pouring billions into this tech—during a bear market. They predict it will be the biggest tech trend we’ve seen yet. On Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak from Jackson Hole. Daniel shares what he expects to hear—and the major announcement he foresees from the Fed over the next few months. I break down previous Fed speeches from Jackson Hole—and how investors should prepare to react to Friday’s updates. Despite the economic uncertainty, several stocks are trading near 52-week highs. We discuss a handful of great stocks to consider… plus, what investors should pay attention to—and avoid—when shopping for stocks. Enjoyed this episode?
