  "description": "<div>You might think that in a country as tightly controlled as China, diversity of opinion is hard to come by in written form. But as I find out in this episode, there is a vibrant conversation going on with vastly different views, especially in the intellectual elite amongst professors and journalists. So what do these intellectuals think, and how much can they get away with saying?<br>\n<br>\nWith Professor David Ownby, who founded the website <a href=\"https://www.readingthechinadream.com/\">Reading the China Dream</a>, which translates writings from Chinese intellectuals into English. He tells me:<br>\n<br>\n<em>'A casual observer of China in the West will think that all Chinese are sitting at home, with the blinds closed, waiting for the Chinese Communist Party to fall apart before the police come and get them... But that's not the life led by most Chinese intellectuals... By knowing what they talk about, it humanises China.'</em><br>\n<br>\nIn the episode, we also discuss Cai Xia, a former CCP professor now living in exile, and the article she wrote from the US.
