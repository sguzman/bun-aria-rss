Moment in Oddity features the Skunk Ape and This Day in History features the sinking of the Larchmont.</p> <p>Check out our website here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-27-barren-hill-tavern.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-27-barren-hill-tavern.html</a></p>",
