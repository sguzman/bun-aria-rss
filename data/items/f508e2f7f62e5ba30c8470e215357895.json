  "description": "<p>This week on Let’s Eat In, Cathy Erway is joined by Peter Kaminsky, food writer and author of the new book Culinary Intelligence. Peter talks about his own health and motivation for writing Culinary Intelligence, as well as the importance of getting the most flavor for your calorie. Peter also digs into his past, as he reads a passage from his book about his local butcher in Kensington, Brooklyn. Hear about how fresh, quality ingredients not only add to flavor, but also that “feeling of satisfaction.” Finally, hear what Peter would cook at home as his ideal date meal, and the upcoming events for the release of Culinary Intelligence.
