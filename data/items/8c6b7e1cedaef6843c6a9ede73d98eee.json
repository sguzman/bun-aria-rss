  "description": "Position battles are a Training Camp rite of passage. Even with an uncertain few weeks ahead for the NFL, we still think we can count on some intense battles across the league. On this episode, Cody Benjamin joins Will Brinson to break down the biggest ones as we he late July. The list is comprised of mostly quarterbacks, but Cody submits a surprise at #5 (15:00). Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Herbert were picked high in the draft, but what are the chances they supplant the veterans in their respective locker rooms? The Patriots brought in Cam Newton, but could Jarrett Stidham still get a fair shot at the starting gig in New England (36:30)? And of course, the Bears are seemingly never settled at QB and that's no different this year. The one that wins the job might not be able to keep it however.\nNominate Pick Six for The People's Choice Podcast Awards: https://www.podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @CodyJBenjamin\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
