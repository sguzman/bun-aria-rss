  "description": "<p>Virginia Military Institute was founded over 180 years ago and the institute takes pride in having a competitive educational program that also develops cadets to be citizen soldiers and many have gone on to be officers in the various branches of the military. One of the members of the faculty was Stonewall Jackson and there are those who claim his spirit haunts the place. That's not the only ghost here though. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Virginia Military Institute! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Scott Booker and features dentures and This Month in History features the James/Younger Gang attacked by townspeople.
