Heard the fear slipping through the receiver, saw it oozing from Dad’s eyeballs and into the living room as he tried to phone home.</em><br><em>What she can’t process now, she’ll be haunted by later; the spirits hounding her will make sure of that…</em><br><em>‘Operation Desert Storm; you won’t lose a wink of sleep over it. Except your Daddy. Your Daddy’s shitting his pants. Enjoy your Viennetta.’</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Baghdaddy</em><em>&nbsp;is a playfully devastating coming-of-age story, told through clowning and memory to explore the complexities of cultural identity, generational trauma and a father-daughter relationship amidst global conflict.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jasmine Naziha Jones</strong><em>’s&nbsp;debut play was developed as part of an Introduction to Playwriting group at the Royal Court.
