  "description": "Mike Winkelmann is an American graphic designer. In May 2007 he drew an image of his Uncle Joe, called it Uber Jay (Mike's nickname for his uncle) and shared it online. The next day he made another image and once again posted it online. He did the same thing the next day, and then the next day. Last week Christies Auction House sold one of his paintings for $70 Million dollars. On this episode we talk about how that happened and what it means for the creator economy. Watch the episode here: https://youtu.be/Ptk6P7Lc6rs",
