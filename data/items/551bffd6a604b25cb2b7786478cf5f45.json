  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the highest law in the United States is the Constitution and all who serve in the government must adhere to our laws otherwise they are violating these laws. It's no surprise that the radical leftists in charge of Congress: Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and Maxine Waters come from leftwing metropolitan areas with sanctuary cities that violate federal immigration through nullification. These radicals are abusing their power by impeaching a President without a single eye-witness that can attest to President Trump committing treason, high crimes, or misdemeanors. They have rejected exculpatory statements from President Zelensky of Ukraine and misstated the facts from the outset. Just like Barack Obama overstepped with his unlawful Executive Order decreeing that DACA was legal, the democrats have done the same. Indeed Democrats have a long documented history of using their political power punitively. Then, Attorney General Bill Barr pointed out 51 instances where the FBI omitted information in Inspector General Michal Horowitz's report, behavior he described as appalling. Further, he acknowledged that the human source that was surveilling the Trump Campaign returned exculpatory evidence, yet the FBI pushed on irrespective of the facts and withheld exculpatory evidence from the FISA Court when applying for warrants to \"spy\" on members of the Trump campaign. Barr concluded that the dossier was a \"very flimsy\", \"garbage\" source that was baseless. Afterward, progressivism has not only devoured the media, our government, and our culture, but it has also had an erosive effect on religion. Despite the anti-Jewish hatred that is growing within the progressive movement, Trump has emerged an unexpected advocate for our ally Israel by pushing back on antisemitism in public schools. Finally, Congressman Chop Roy calls in to discuss the impeachment process and his 2020 race for Congress.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
