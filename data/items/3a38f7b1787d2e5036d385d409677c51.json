  "description": "<p>On today's episode of The Pod, Digs masterfully works his way through a bout of CTE brain that was brought on by his new workout schedule. The guys listen to an absolute banger of a submission for theme song to the show, hand out their Stooge/Sellaht of the week which includes a local weatherman taking an interesting approach to a woman grieving, the guy drinking out of the soup ladle at a supermarket, LaVar Ball, and the prince that is trying to swindle Zeet for 100k. The guys also dive into another round of Digs Debates, answer questions from The People of The Pod, and get into a lot more nonsense along the way. Enjoy.</p>\n",
