  "title": "PMS 2.0 165 - Feels Great To Be Back. Kyle “Juice” Juszczyk & Kyle “Legend” Williams Stop By For Fantastic Conversations. Let’s Go.",
  "description": "Pat is back from Hawaii and today’s show is a good one. Pat and the boys break down Drew Brees announcing that he’ll be coming back for a 20th season, and what that means for Taysom Hill and Teddy Bridgewater. They also speculate on where some of the other free agent Quarterbacks may end up going this offseason. Also joining the show is 4x Pro Bowler, the first Harvard man to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, 49ers Fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Pat and Kyle chat about the Super Bowl and what Coach Shanahan’s message was going into the offseason, what it’s like having Jimmy G in the huddle and how he responds to the criticism, how his game differs at FB, what it was like going to Harvard, and they chat about his apparel line Juice 44 (14:46-30:29). Next, 6x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, former Buffalo Bills defensive tackle and friend of the show, Kyle Williams joins Pat and the guys. They talk about whether a guy like Chris Jones is going to resign with the Chiefs, or go and get a massive amount of money elsewhere now that he has a ring. Kyle describes what it was like playing for a Nick Saban coached team and how he has used a lot of those lessons throughout his career and how they’ve impacted who he is as a person, they discuss Joe Burrow talking about his leverage in the NFL Draft, and Kyle and Pat reminisce on the first time they met (32:58-51:57). Also included is Pat’s distaste for arguably the biggest stooge in America right now, Rob Manfred. Pat reacts to the current situation going on in the MLB, and he and the guys figure out a way to fix baseball. Today’s a good one, come laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
