  "description": "<p>Can’t get enough of Arctic Circle? Neither could we. We jump into Season 2 to see what Nina, Venla, and Marita, are up to now.&nbsp;Are Nina and Dr. Thomas still together? Has Esko stepped up to be a better father? What has Nina’s biological father — whom she’s been estranged from all her life — have to do with a cold case she is assigned to about a female Judo Champion’s murder? One thing we can say, there are even MORE mysterious men prowling around this season. And storylines, wow, do they ever get dark. So so dark. But Lisa’s favorite character Stenius is back, as dry and cryptic as ever!
