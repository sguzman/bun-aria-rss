    "media:description": "When it comes to building applications, there's no shortage of frameworks that claim to do it all but the reality is that they either focus on iOS and Android, or desktop, or they're just a web technology. This session provides an overview of the Uno Platform, a set of tools and technologies that allow you to deliver native applications for iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux and Web, all from a single codebase of C# and XAML. Whilst other technologies are still scrambling to simply ship a stable product, Uno also delivers tooling such as hot reload, plugins for Figma and Extensions to help with Configuration, Logging and Navigation. You leave this session with a roadmap for how you can get started building your next application for mobile, desktop or even the web.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcmelbourne.com/",
