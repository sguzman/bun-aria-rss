The biggest surprise is his claim of self defense, and the twisted tale that says lead up to the deaths.  This one goes all over the place, before settling on a meth fueled, septic tank fixing tirade that left three dead.  Just when you think this one is over... More crazy pops up, seemingly from thin air!!</p><p>Along the way, we find out meth makes you not be able to fix things, that some people just may wear condoms with the expectation of later usage, and that some situations don't lend themselves well to claims of self defense!!</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday! </p><p><br></p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p><p><br></p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on... </p><p><br></p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p><p><br></p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p><p><br></p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p><p><br></p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
