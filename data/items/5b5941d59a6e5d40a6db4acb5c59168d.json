  "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">Welcome to the 35th installment of our blog series “My Path to Google.” These are real stories from Googlers, interns, and alumni highlighting how they got to Google, what their roles are like, and even some tips on how to prepare for interviews.<br /><br />Today’s post is all about Goodman Lepota.

I was fortunate to have spent the past five years living and studying in the United States on an academic scholarship awarded by MasterCard. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Marist College in New York. I am also a graduate of the <a href=\"http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org/\">African Leadership Academy</a>.<br /><br />When I am not working you can find me reading. I was a publisher of three student newspapers from high school, prep school, to college. I am still fascinated by the different forms of creativity writers employ in their storytelling.<br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U23EXWcc8B0/XWapG6Sp7PI/AAAAAAAAApw/C8w13z0LQZQ-K0ScPojtt318l-tezyYowCEwYBhgL/s1600/4%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U23EXWcc8B0/XWapG6Sp7PI/AAAAAAAAApw/C8w13z0LQZQ-K0ScPojtt318l-tezyYowCEwYBhgL/s640/4%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">(photo credit: Googler Zach Louw)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><b>What’s your role at Google?</b><br />I am an Associate Account Strategist in Dublin, Ireland (Google's Europe, Middle East, and Africa headquarters) working with the Sub Saharan African Google Customer Solutions team.<br /><br />I often say what we do is like getting a free MBA, because you learn so much from different people. My role includes consulting over 120 clients, focusing on digital growth for their businesses, and advertising. We have an unprecedented scope of successful business models across Africa.<br /><br />My favorite part about the job is that I get to make an impact and help small and medium sized businesses grow. I work with some of the most exceptional and supportive people everyday. Everyone on our team is invested in making sure everyone else succeeds.<br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><br /></b><b>Complete the following: \"I [choose one: code/create/design/build] for...\"&nbsp;</b></div>I build for a more inclusive and prosperous future.<br /><b><br /></b><b>What inspires you to come in every day?</b><br />I am excited about Google’s projects in Africa, particularly focusing on internet access such as <a href=\"https://station.google.com/\">Google Station</a>&nbsp;and other internet infrastructure projects. Google is a status equalizer. It gives access to the same level of information&nbsp;for someone living in a rural area with less resources as it does for someone in a cosmopolitan urban area. Google creates opportunity.<br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qcmgKkpqJc4/XWQ-EP1EKNI/AAAAAAAAApQ/N3UzfJz9FlYOepnfF8FRzx8RaOU8uYpyQCLcBGAs/s1600/2%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1131\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qcmgKkpqJc4/XWQ-EP1EKNI/AAAAAAAAApQ/N3UzfJz9FlYOepnfF8FRzx8RaOU8uYpyQCLcBGAs/s640/2%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;Goodman (center right) with teammates Sashin Pillay (Associate Account Strategist), José Alguem (Google Customer Solutions, Africa lead), and Kristin Ransome, (Associate Account Strategist).<br />(photo credit: Googler Zach Louw)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>How did the recruitment process go for you?</b><br />I came across the opportunity on LinkedIn and applied directly on the <a href=\"http://goo.gl/aoD9fB\">Google Student Careers website</a>. I had five interviews with Google. Although I was in the process of interviewing for other companies, Google’s hiring process was probably one of the best. Here’s why: they paired me up with a recruiter who facilitated and communicated with me as I prepared for all the interviews. The Googlers who interviewed me also influenced my decision because I felt they were invested in me succeeding during the interviews.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Can you tell us about your decision to enter the process?</b><br />I was always interested in business marketing, technology, and policy making. I was excited by the idea of taking on a challenging role after graduating from college, but even more so, I wanted to work for an organization with an amazing team. Google was that place.<br /><div><br /></div><b></b><b>What do you wish you’d known when you started the process?</b></div>There are some myths about interviewing for Google like asking you tricky and unsolvable questions, which I found to be far from reality.<br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x0j9KeLqMmM/XWaoDF-vtFI/AAAAAAAAApk/byduuWE33owdijVAEnguAlsUMLx19db9gCLcBGAs/s1600/3%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1067\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x0j9KeLqMmM/XWaoDF-vtFI/AAAAAAAAApk/byduuWE33owdijVAEnguAlsUMLx19db9gCLcBGAs/s640/3%2BGOOGLE%2BEMEA%2BHQ.JPG\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">(photo credit: Googler Zach Louw)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><b>Do you have any tips you’d like to share with aspiring Googlers?</b><br />I wanted to share my advice to two kinds of students. The first one is to someone who grew up not imagining they could join Google. I can tell you now that Google will make you feel welcome.<br /><br />The second one is for the students who are studying in a country that is different from their home country and looking for an amazing opportunity. Google has an exceptional team to support you in relocating in the event that you get accepted.<br /><br />And I always say this to people — you always have to have that strong conviction that your dreams in life are possible.<br /><br /></div>",
