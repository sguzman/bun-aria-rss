What does it feel like?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications ðŸ””  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nSC Johnsonâ€™s Administrative Building and Research Tower in Racine, Wisconsin, have become legendary as corporate headquarters buildings. The Administrative Buildingâ€™s Great Workroom is a stunning example of architect Frank Lloyd Wrightâ€™s unique approach to office design.\n\nBut what did it really feel like? Voxâ€™s Phil Edwards visited the HQ to find out â€” and try actually working there. He also visited the Hardy House, an earlier Wright design that features many of the same Wright signatures found in the SC Johnson building, from custom designed furniture to ideas about compression and expansion.\n\nWatch the video to see what it really feels like to work in such a space.\n\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Johnson-Buildings/dp/048642748X\nJonathan Lipmanâ€™s book about Sc Johnson is one of the best-sourced and most comprehensive books about the buildingâ€™s history.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wrights-Hardy-House/dp/0764937618\nMark Hertzbergâ€™s exhaustive knowledge of the Hardy House â€” and his experiencing photographing it â€” is evident in his book about the building. His blog, Wright in Racine (https://wrightinracine.wordpress.com/) also has great facts and stories about Wrightâ€™s work.\n\nhttps://www.scjohnson.com/en/interacting-with-sc-johnson/tours-and-architecture/tours-and-films/youre-always-welcome-for-tours\nSC Johnson provides free tours of the Administrative Building as well as of Wingspread, a nearby home that Wright also designed.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
