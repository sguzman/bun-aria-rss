Is it the course correction the DCEU has been waiting for?&nbsp; Then the guys make one last trip to the Quik Stop with ‘Clerks III’.&nbsp; Kevin Smith revisits the much beloved convenience store in Red Bank, NJ. But can you really go home again, again? The Werewolf Marathon continues with the barely relevant, ‘Wolfen’, featuring Albert Finney facing off against urban blight, gentrification, and some really ticked off not-quite werewolves. There’s the bone-chilling breakdown of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Streaming and Straight-To-DVD picks of the week. Then Matt and Chris wrap up the show with their 5 Favorite View Askew Universe Characters.
