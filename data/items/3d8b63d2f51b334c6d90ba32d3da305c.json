  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">I was broke-ass poor growing up. Momma worked minimum wage jobs, trying her best to keep my baby brother and I fed. Those days were when I learned a lot of my eating habits. Things like:</p> <p>\"Eat all you can because who knows when the next meal is coming...\"</p> <p>\"Fast food is not only cheap, but it's a good way to get a lot of food after a long, hard day.\"</p> <p>But those days also taught me something else. A lot of people can't afford to lose weight. They don't have the money for programs, kits, and trainers.</p> <p>My mother tried many diets and often quit because she didn't have the money.</p> <p>I wish she had someone like me pumping out help. Knowing my mom, and how scrappy she was, she'd be all over my podcast and free course like stink on shit.</p> <p>Today's podcast is all about making the most out of all the free resources I offer. Maybe you'll join No BS one day because you love what I teach so much. But, you might be someone who can never join and need all the help you can get.</p> <p>Either way, today I'm going to lay out exactly how I would use the Losing 100lbs Podcast and the Free Course to lose all the weight you want.</p> <p>First, take the Free Course. I know you've done that already because you got this email. Just in case you want to share it with a friend, the link to the course is: <a href= \"http://www.NoBSFreeCourse.com\">www.NoBSFreeCourse.com.</a></p> <p>Second, make the podcast your weightloss university. In the podcast, we'll tell you what to do and give you some episodes to listen to that help with food planning, getting support from your family, mistakes most of us make (and how to avoid them) and how to quit overeating.</p> <p>Third, follow me on social. I post a lot of motivational stuff you don't want to miss.</p> <p>You can follow me at:</p> <p><u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"https://www.instagram.com/corinne_crabtree/\">https://www.instagram.com/corinne_crabtree</a></u></p> <p><u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"https://www.facebook.com/losing100podcast\">https://www.facebook.com/losing100podcast</a></u></p> <p>Last, always read my emails. I send two a week, and each one will link you to new resources or give you a little kick in the ass. You'll want to move them to your SAFE SENDER (because email service providers can be asshats sending my good shit to the spam).</p> <p>Listen to Episode 261: How to Use the Podcast for Weightloss.</p> <p>You'll thank yourself for taking the time to listen.<br /> <br /></p> <p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Get the Free Course here:<br /> <u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"http://NoBSFreeCourse.com\">http://NoBSFreeCourse.com</a></u></p>",
