  "description": "<p>We are in the <strong>age of social media</strong>, so how do you <strong>use that to your advantage</strong>? How do you <strong>create a platform that helps you reach your career goals</strong>? What content should you create to target your desired audience? Today’s guest,<strong> Kerwin Donis</strong>, shares how he and his brothers have built the platforms that have helped them<strong> partner in over 600 units of </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/apartment-syndication-passive-income-retire-early\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>apartment syndication</strong></a><strong> deals</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Donis Brothers</strong> have a wide range of platforms, from YouTube to TikTok, where they document their journey and share their wealth of knowledge. They have <strong>about 12,000 followers on Instagram and 63,000 on </strong>TikTok, but their main focus is their podcast. Kerwin, the<strong> head of their social media</strong>, says their initial goal was to document their journey and <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-11-15-how-to-build-credibility\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>build credibility</strong></a> as young investors.
