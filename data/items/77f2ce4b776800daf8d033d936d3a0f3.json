  "description": "<p>This week, in Middle River, Maryland, a troubled man, who is rightfully called \"pure evil\" at many points in his life, gives up on trying to make a go of a normal existence, and decides to go on a killing spree. He is cruel, angry, and completely out of his mind.  When he is caught, he not only confesses, but is proud of what he did.  His final statement at his trial may be the craziest thing ever said in a court of law. Will he gets executed, like he wants to be?? Absolute insanity!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out faeries may not need a whole festival, that when someone says that they're Satan, maybe you should listen to them, and if you want to kill yourself, there are easier ways than having the state do it!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
