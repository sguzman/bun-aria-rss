  "description": "<p>This paper illustrates the power of the entropy method in addressing problems\nfrom large deviation theory. We provide and review entropy proofs for most\nfundamental results in large deviation theory, including Cramer's theorem, the\nG\\\"artner--Ellis theorem, and Sanov's theorem. Moreover, by the entropy method,\nwe also strengthen Sanov's theorem to the strong version.\n</p>",
