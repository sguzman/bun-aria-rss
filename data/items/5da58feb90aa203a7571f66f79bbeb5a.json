That’s what John discusses in the first episode of a new, three-part series we’re calling <em>The Picture of Leadership</em>.</p> <p>Throughout this series, John will dive into the “4 Cs” of leadership and provide a clear picture of what great leadership looks like. This week is all about how leaders <em>choose</em>.</p> <p>If you’ve ever struggled with finding a clear vision for your organization, or if you have a difficult time leading your team to own that vision, John’s teaching will be especially helpful to you.</p> <p>According to John, your ability to take the vision from “me to we” defines you as a leader. In this episode, Mark and Richard examine their experiences with this teaching as they’ve led their own teams to hold the organization’s vision.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Picture of Leadership Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
