  "description": "<p>\"Watch What Crappens\" has turned 200, and to celebrate, Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) and Ben Mandelker (The Banter Blender) spend over two hours reminiscing on their favorite jokes and moments from the podcast.  Along the way, the two also recap the latest episode of \"Real Housewives of Orange County,\" which features Vicki sadly losing her mother (and Shannon hilariously losing her mind).<br />\nThen it's on to \"Married to Medicine\" as Lisa Nicole throws a glass at Quad, and all hell breaks loose.  It's a jam packed podcast (and we even have audio from our very first show).
