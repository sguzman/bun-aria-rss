  "title": "PMS 2.0 204 - Mark Cuban, Yes, That Mark Cuban, Matt Light, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For A Fantastic Friday Conversation. Let's Go.",
  "description": "Today’s show is highlighted by an incredible interview with arguably the most successful person to ever come on the show as billionaire, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and one of the main characters of Shark Tank, Mark Cuban joins the program. Pat and Mark chat about the NBA continuing its season, what he’s heard on the conference calls about opening sports back up and when he anticipates fans returning to stadiums. They also chat about whether or not Mark has any interest in buying any other professional sports teams, if he’s at all considering a presidential run, and if he would’ve done everything in his power to keep Tom Brady if he was Robert Kraft (00:00:40-24:14). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk with AJ coming to us live from a closet in Jordy Nelson’s house. Pat and AJ discuss the Mark Cuban interview and what it means for fans coming back into stadiums, whether or not the NFL should try and construct a tier system for quarterback’s that doesn’t count against the team’s salary cap, Pat and AJ each recount some old hunting stories, give their thoughts on Pete Rose, and react to the news (that ended up being BS) that Dak Prescott was reportedly offered a 5 year, $175 million contract by the Cowboys (24:16-2:04:25). Lastly, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Patriots’ All-2000’s team and 50th Anniversary Team, Matt Light, joins the show. Pat and Matt discuss the raffle he is conducting to send fans to the Bucs/Saints game next year, what he expects Tom Brady to bring to the Tampa Bay locker room, his thoughts on Jarrett Stidham and why no one from the Patriots organization has had any glowing reviews for him, and Tom Brady requiring his center to wear a specific towel to eliminate any sweat transfer (2:04:27-2:18:55). Don’t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you’re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch, and keep an eye out for a Memorial Day merch sale with 20% off everything in the store. Stay safe this weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
