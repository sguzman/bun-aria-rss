  "description": "<p>Fear of Aging - Finding Freedom in this Impermanent World – Part 1 (2021-03-17) - While it’s natural to have fears of what’s ahead, when we learn to face the inevitability of change and loss without resistance, we discover true peace and freedom in the midst. In a very direct way, our awareness of impermanence awakens unconditional loving. These two talks explore the ways we habitually deny or resist reality, and the three interrelated pathways—refuge in the present moment, love and awareness—that liberate us. NOTE: The quoted prayer \"And all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well\" is from 14th century mystic, Julian of Norwich, in her work “Revelations of Divine Love.”</p>",
