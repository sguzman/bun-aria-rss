  "description": "Two stories from Greek Mythology: first, it's the story of Sisyphus, who you might know from his interminable, crushing labor, but who actually really deserved that punishment because of how horrible he was. The second story is of good-guy-Bellerophon, Sisyphus's grandson, who is constantly having that football pulled out from under him just as he is about to kick it. The creature is an 80-foot-tall, sneaky Japanese skeleton who has a drinking problem...in that he has a difficult time drinking the blood spewing from his decapitated victims. Loot Crate is awesome. Check out Loot Crate. (Don't forget the code LEGENDS).
