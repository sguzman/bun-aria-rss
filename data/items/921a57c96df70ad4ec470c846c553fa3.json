The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Edge Native is the new Cloud Native - Modern Apps at the Edge- Marilyn Basanta, VMware\n\nEdge computing is the next evolution of cloud. Over the last decade, we’ve learned a lot about running applications on elastic clouds. Infrastructure Operators and Developers can apply much of what we’ve learned to Edge deployments, so that you can be confident that the same app is up to date and secure at many locations simultaneously. The two concepts we’ll cover in this quick talk are disposable infrastructure and using abstractions to enable t-shirt sizing at the Edge.",
