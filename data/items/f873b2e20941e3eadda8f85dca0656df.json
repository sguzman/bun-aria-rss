He lost a family member, so he broke up with his girlfriend so he could have time to heal. The girl did NOT take it well and started harassing and stalking her ex-boyfriend. Eventually, she took it way too far when she broke into OP's house, redecorated a room, and served her ex-boyfriend a cake. OP decided to press charges for breaking and entering, but now people are calling him a butthole. What do you think?</p>\n",
