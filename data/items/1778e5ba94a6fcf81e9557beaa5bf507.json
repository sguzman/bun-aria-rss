  "description": "<p>In this special episode of DEEP QUESTIONS, I rebroadcast a conversation recorded earlier this summer, featuring me and the bestselling author Greg McKeown. It originally aired on Greg's fantastic podcast, WHAT'S ESSENTIAL (https://gregmckeown.com/podcast/).<br/><br/>You probably know Greg from his influential 2014 book, ESSENTIALISM, which I recommend all the time. In this conversation, we talk about unplugging from distraction, the art of doing less (without accomplishing less), and how to improve your ability to focus.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it. <br/><br/>Thanks to our sponsors Magic Spoon (use magicspoon.com/CAL to receive free shipping) and Blinkist (use blinkist.com/DEEP for a 7 day free trial).<br/><br/>Also thanks to listener Jay Kerstens for the intro music.</p>",
