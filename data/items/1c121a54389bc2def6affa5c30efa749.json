  "description": "<p>Valley Springs, California. April 27, 2013. Twelve year old Isiah Fowler asked to stay home while his father and stepmother took his siblings to a baseball game. His sister, eight year old Leila, wished to remain at home as well. The parents agreed to let them stay. Isiah made pancakes and the two watched a movie. Sometime later, Isiah called his parents to report that an intruder was in the home. The 911 dispatcher, after being called by Isiah's stepmother, Crystal, wanted to speak with the boy. Sometime during the call it was learned that his sister had been attacked. A subsequent investigation revealed curious evidence and inconsistencies in the home and in Isiah's statements to police. Could this twelve year old have murdered his own sister? Or did he really witness an intruder in his home at the time of the attack?
