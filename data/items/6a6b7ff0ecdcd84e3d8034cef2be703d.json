Highlights include:</p><br><p>* 2013: world record for most pullups in a 24 hour period (4,030);</p><p>* 2007: 3rd place — Badwater 135 – a 135 mile ultramarathon across Death Valley widely considered to be the world’s most difficult foot race;</p><p>* 2006: 2nd&nbsp;place — Ultraman World Championships, a double-ironman distance race widely considered to be the world's most difficult triathlon;</p><p>* 2007: 1st place — 48-Hour National Championship endurance foot race, where he ran 203.5 miles, beating the previous record by 20 miles; and</p><p>* 2007 – 2016 — additional top finishes at dozens of the world's most grueling endurance races, including The HURT 100, Leadville 100, Western States & more.</p><br><p><br></p><p>But perhaps David’s greatest accomplishment is that throughout his life, he has faced and overcome a concatenation of seemingly&nbsp;insurmountable obstacles to become the man he is today – obstacles like asthma, sickle cell anemia, psychological and physical abuse, obesity, academic struggles, and even a congenital heart defect that often left him competing — and winning — on a mere fraction of his actual physical capabilities.</p><p>In addition to being one of the most remarkable people I have ever met, David has had a profound impact on me personally. It was his singular example that ignited my passion for ultra-endurance and fueled the self-belief required to pursue a new life. In truth, I’m not sure I would have achieved&nbsp;my athletic and life goals&nbsp;had he not blazed the path before me. I simply cannot ever repay the debt of gratitude I have for this man.</p><p>One of the most powerful podcasts I have ever produced, this a conversation about the primacy of purpose to cultivate your inner voice. It's about passion and self-accountability. It's about the limiting beliefs that hold us back and the importance of mindset to overcome them.

It's time to check your excuses at the door. It's time to stop talking yourselves out of being great. It's time to get comfortable being uncomfortable. It's time to wake up.
