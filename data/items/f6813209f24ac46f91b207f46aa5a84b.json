  "title": "Truly reversing insulin resistance & Type 2 Diabetes with Robby and Cyrus from Mastering Diabetes",
  "description": "In Episode 74 I sit down with Robby & Cyrus from Mastering Diabetes to chat about Diabetes (Type 1, 1a, Pre, and Type 2) and the role that nutrition plays on insulin resistance. We go through the body of scientific literature and explain what causes insulin resistance and how to actually reverse it.\n\nSpecifically we cover:\n\nTheir personal journeys with Type 1 Diabetes\n\nPathophysiology of Insulin Resistance\n\nDifference between low carb ketogenic type diets for Insulin Resistance and High Carb Low Fat diets\n\nWhy Keto diets can promote insulin resistance (poorer ability to handle carbohydrates)\n\nWhat truly reversing insulin resistance actually means - specifically the the difference between reversing insulin resistance and managing blood glucose control\n\nCommon diabetic complications and why reversing insulin resistance is so important\n\nNutrition for reversing insulin resistance & diabetic complications (the practical stuff)\n\nand so much more\n\n\nStrap yourselves in this is a long one (2.5 hours) but I guarantee by the end of it you will have learned so much about Diabetes and finally understand the mechanism that causes insulin resistance and how to reverse it and improve health outcomes. Not only is this understanding important for people with Diabetes but really anyone looking to better their health, particularly anyone who is overweight (millions of people have undiagnosed pre diabetes). Insulin resistance is a spectrum and eating to promote optimal glucose tolerance means you will be able to enjoy some of the most healthful food groups in the world associated with longevity.\n\nIf you any comments or questions, Robby, Cyrus (@masteringdiabetes) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you.
