  "description": "<p>In this 136th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>This week, we discuss the tragic tale of a woman who became a murderer….or actually, we discuss a murderer who claims to have become a woman. We talk about the order to close Tavistock, the gender identity clinic in England, and whether “affirmative care” for children who declare themselves trans may soon be a thing of the past. We discuss Wikipedia, which was once the Universe’s best encyclopedia, and how far it has fallen. We discuss definitions, including the definition of “recession.” And we discuss the drinking age for young adults.</p><p>*****</p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p>Farrow SkinFood is a lard-based skincare company with products that nourish the skin without preservatives or added chemicals.
