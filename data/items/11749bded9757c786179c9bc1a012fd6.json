  "description": "Welcome to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. He's back… Managing Director at Point View Wealth Management and Wall Street Unplugged all-time favorite, John Petrides, joins the show once again. And apart from our quarterly routine, jumping from one sector to another, today we're turning all of our focus on one. Just last week, a surprisingly big acquisition took place in the retail sector; Private equity firm Sycamore bought out Staples for $10.25 per share… in a deal valued close to $7 billion. Shares of Staples, which have been on a steady decline for the past decade, finally found some life - after shares surged more than 8% in late session trading. All of which, has got John thinking... Helped along by today’s low interest rate environment, on top of a severely depressed, cheap, and hated retail sector… John’s prediction is that we’re still in the early innings of these takeover deals. On today’s show, we each give away our best guesses at which retailer is next. Including one big-box that just might be Jeff Bezos’s next lunch. You heard it here first. Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
