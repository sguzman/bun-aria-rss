  "description": "In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, citizens across America took to the streets to demand police reform and accountability. Now almost a year later dozens of cities and states have changed policies, or enacted laws that restrict the use of violent force by police.\nIn addition to municipal and state level changes, in March the House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which was passed on March 3. What are some of the key aspects of that bill?\nBut while many Democrats are touting the bill, a broader pushback against the “defund the police” movement is springing up in a number of GOP-lead statehouses that aim discourage or punish cities seeking to cut police budgets, by withholding state funding.\nIn this episode we speak with: Ayanna Alexander, BLaw social justice reporter. Greg Casar, a member of the Austin City Council, and Robert Blaine, director of the Institute for Youth Education and Families at the National League of Cities.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
