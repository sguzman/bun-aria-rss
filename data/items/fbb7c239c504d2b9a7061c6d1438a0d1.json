  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden is pretending that he is not campaigning because he is 'following the science.' Biden is incapable of campaigning in a manner similar to President Trump. Biden is proving that he will not be able to withstand the demands of the presidency. He resists any scrutiny on his 110-page manifesto to destroy America. Then, the democrats are desperate to eliminate the filibuster which would radically weaken the bi-cameral system of the American legislative branch. Speake Nancy Pelosi continues attacking Trump as an enemy of the state as she spreads lies about the post office. Later, Anthony Fauci, and the federal bureaucracy have long opposed new or off-label uses for medications. Back in the 1980s during the AIDS crisis, Fauci was skeptical of treatments that many of his peers were prescribing. It’s the same approach he's taking with Hydroxychloroquine. Afterward, Police in Wisconsin fatally shot Jacob Blake as he allegedly evaded them. The facts remain to be seen as the investigation is on-going. However, Democrats have pounced on the issue and began blaming it on Trump. Finally, Kevin McCarthy calls in to explain that Pelosi has already shown how reckless she is with all the rules that the democrats have re-written from proxy voting. Even Democrats say that the Postal Service is sufficiently funded and has a line of credit through the recent CARES act. Yet that doesn't satisfy the Democrats because their goal is it jam up the mail system with ballots. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
