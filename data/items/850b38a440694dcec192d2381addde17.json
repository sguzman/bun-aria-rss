  "title": "Next stop in Iowa — Des Moines!",
  "content": "Last month, we started offering service to customers in West Des Moines. The response has been great, and we’re looking forward to bringing fast, reliable internet to even more Iowans. In fact, later this year, we’re planning to start construction so we can bring Google Fiber to our neighbors to the east —&nbsp; Des Moines! <br /><br /><img alt=\"Thumbnail\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QKc12VNN7Z_wW0op7coLugGolc7oqgz4z_5HLJHH2d4cGN12q8uGJOraAC5-QyLghxgyezydjSsl5W95ZWuuN_DHAd_TvCZBGHxD5DPQd4kwLrw34S5FyP9ZXLOARlmISdXsAF7uZ1LBKNCVGiRtjss4FSbSZcdArlM2E4IdrKDEl7ij=s16000\" title=\"Andy Simpson, General Manager, Central Region\" /><br /><br />We’re currently in the planning stages, working with the City of Des Moines on next steps to get started with the permitting process. Being next door in West Des Moines gives us a running start in Des Moines, as network construction takes time. Des Moines residents who want more information on what’s happening can sign up for emails <a href=\"http://google.com/fiber/desmoines\">here</a>. <br /><br />Google Fiber believes that everyone deserves quality internet, and we’re expanding our footprint in all our cities, including the newest! <br /><br />And of course, we’re continuing to roll out service across West Des Moines. As the city completes new sections of the conduit network, we’ll pull our fiber through the conduit and open up sign-ups in new neighborhoods.
