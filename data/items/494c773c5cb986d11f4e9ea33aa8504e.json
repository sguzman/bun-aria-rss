I don't want to just live in a depressed world, there has to be more fire than that.” Lydia Millet — finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize (<em>Love in Infant Monkeys</em>) and the National Book Award (<em>A Children’s Bible</em>) — joins us on the show to talk about her latest, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dinosaurs-lydia-millet/1140914156?ean=9781324021469\"> <em>Dinosaurs: A Novel</em></a>, including how the story morphed while she was writing, illusions of normalcy, literal and figurative dinosaurs, how we talk to each other through books, and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.
