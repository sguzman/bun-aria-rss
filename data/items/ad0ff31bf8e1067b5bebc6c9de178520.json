  "description": "<p>There are professionals who can help us in almost every aspect of our lives. In some cases it’s a slam dunk easy decision, but there are other times when we can, and should, handle it ourselves. The problem is knowing <em>when</em> to DIY it and when to call in the big guns, the professionals, in this case- the financial advisor. There are a lot of aspects of our personal finances that don’t require professional help. You don’t need a financial advisor to tell you that you need to start paying down your debt and get that employer match in your 401k. But there are some more complicated issues that might arise when it would make sense to hire a pro. Listen to this episode and see if you should be considering hiring a financial advisor or going it alone.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Catharsis by Treehouse Brewing- thanks to Bryan and Caitlin for donating this one to the show!
