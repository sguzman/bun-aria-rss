  "description": "<p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and a wide range of\nmobile devices, the conventional cloud computing paradigm faces significant\nchallenges (high latency, bandwidth cost, etc.). Motivated by those constraints\nand concerns for the future of the IoT, modern architectures are gearing toward\ndistributing the cloud computational resources to remote locations where most\nend-devices are located. Edge and fog computing are considered as the key\nenablers for applications where centralized cloud-based solutions are not\nsuitable. In this paper, we review the high-level definition of edge, fog,\ncloud computing, and their configurations in various IoT scenarios. We further\ndiscuss their interactions and collaborations in many applications such as\ncloud offloading, smart cities, health care, and smart agriculture. Though\nthere are still challenges in the development of such distributed systems,\nearly research to tackle those limitations have also surfaced.\n</p>",
