  "description": "McKamey Manor is so intense that it requires a 40-page waiver and a safe phrase, and NO ONE has made it to the finish line (and the prize)! Founder Russ McKamey walks Glenn through the tactics the Manor uses and what the petition to shut it down has gotten completely wrong. Bill O’Reilly has the latest impeachment news: It’s all a game to the Left, but Trump is relieved that Devin Nunes is involved. Bill and Glenn debate whether the pope is a good man after he says it’s “an honor” to be attacked by conservatives and whether Barack Obama is “woke.” But reformed Westboro Baptist member Megan Phelps-Roper recognizes the division overtaking our country. Her new book, “Unfollow,” details how to help people who hate others. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
