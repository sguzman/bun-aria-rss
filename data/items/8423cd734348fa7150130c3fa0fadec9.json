  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today’s interview I bring back the most connected expert in the mining industry – founder of Katusa Research, Marin Katusa. Before Marin joins us, however, the episode begins with this week’s Educational Segment. The recent AT&T-Time Warner deal has the potential to bring the biggest trends in the world under one umbrella. Forget what the all the analysts are saying… as I explain why I’ll soon be adding more stock to my current position. Then, stay tuned as I’m joined by resource legend, Marin Katusa. As he puts it, the gold “trend is our friend.” After years of setbacks, Marin talks about how major gold producers are finally in position for growth. Switching gears, Marin then dives into the future of alternative energy. He explains how the sector has changed significantly… and what these new technologies mean for investors going forward. To end the interview, Marin and I discuss the evolution of personal finance. Investors don’t need typical brokers anymore… or huge investment banks either. Ordinary investors now have opportunities to privately invest with the biggest names in the industry – at the same price. Listen-in as Marin shares his experiences to prove it. Also, after Marin signs off, I give listeners a bit more details on my newsletter [1:00:50]. Mark your calendars… the launch is THIS Saturday! The moment we’ve all been waiting for is finally here.",
