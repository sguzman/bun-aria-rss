  "description": "<em>BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks speaks with the Belgian designer about his new community-centred art hub and why the clothing store could do with a makeover.</em>   LONDON, United Kingdom — It’s been just over two weeks since Dries Van Noten opened his latest store in downtown Los Angeles — a 8,500-square-foot, multi-storey building intended as a hub for art, fashion, music and community. In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, the Belgian designer speaks with BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about the inspiration behind his new brick-and-mortar venture and his plans for future fashion weeks. <ul> <li>It may seem counterintuitive to debut a new store during a pandemic, when shops are open one day and forced to close the next, but Van Noten’s latest venture is an attempt to reimagine what brick and mortar can be. “Stores become very static. I wanted to have more of a youth club, where people can just come in… and do things,” he said. He recently had four local artists come in and repaint the walls in an homage to street art.</li> <li>One of the rooms in Van Noten’s store serves as an archive of unsold garments from the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. It was inspired by the idea to slow down the fashion industry. “We have a room for men and a room for women where you have a selection of pieces from old collections.”</li> <li>When looking to the future, Van Noten reflects on the possibility of combining fashion shows with alternative ways to present collections — like fashion films or lookbooks. “By the time we go back to fashion shows, perhaps the fashion shows will be changed,” Van Noten said. “It felt not right to see — in the times we are in — a fashion show.”</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/at-dries-van-noten-new-ways-of-seeing'> At Dries Van Noten, New Ways of Seeing</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/dries-van-noten-proposes-reset-to-fashions-deliveries-and-discounting-calendar'> Dries Van Noten Proposes Reset to Fashion’s Deliveries and Discounting Calendar</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/fashion-week-change-fendi-chanel'> What Happened to Rethinking the Fashion System?</a></p> <p> </p> <em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
