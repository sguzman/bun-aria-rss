There are so many technological advances with AI, space travel, NFTs, and a rapidly changing culture with social media, it’s near impossible to just turn ‘off’. Let’s admit it, FOMO is real and it keeps a lot of people connected when they’re not even sure why they’re connected. When was the last time you unplugged and took on a challenge you weren’t sure you’d complete? How long has it been since you’ve sat with yourself in total silence or allowed yourself to just be bored out of your mind? Author and journalist, Michael Easter, joins me today to discuss his journey and share the lessons and insights he’s gained from spending a month in the Arctic surviving. Hunting his own food, carrying heavy loads, and sitting with absolute boredom are just part of his story. As you listen to his story, it is my hope you will consider ways you step out of your comfort zone. There is something very freeing about being able to shake things up and break your routines and habits to improve the quality of your life in unconventional ways. This episode is about facing discomfort and finding new ways to challenge yourself for the better.   Order Michael Easter’s new book, The Comfort Crisis - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ihebjB\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3ihebjB</a>   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction to Michael Easter 1:05 | The Comfort Crisis Explained 3:02 | Journey to the Arctic 5:03 | Recovering from Alcohol 7:40 | Outside the Comfort Zone 8:55 | Helicopter Parenting Losing Challenges 12:16 | Touching Controversial Topics 14:53 | Challenges Surviving the Arctic 20:11 | Problem Creep 28:05 | Need for Rite of Passage 35:12 | Metaphorical Lions for Passage 41:19 | Comfort Creep & Habits 44:22 | Breaking Routine to be Present 47:45 | Discomfort and Boredom 50:00 | Benefits of Boredom 57:12 | Daily Routine 1:02:11 | Rucking & Human Design 1:14:05 | Killing His 1st Caribou 1:17:16 | Life Cycle & Mortality 1:27:16 | “This Too Shall Pass” 1:30:31 | Want to Live Forever? 1:39:12 | Assigning Meaning to Life 1:42:20 | Rites of Passage Transformation 1:46:12 | Problem Creep Comparison 1:50:34 | Finding Gratitude   QUOTES: “By never putting yourself in a position where you are uncomfortable, whether that is physically or mentally or with, what you think to be true? You're not gonna, you're not gonna learn anything about yourself.” [7:41]   “As humans face fewer and fewer problems in our lives, we don't actually experience fewer problems. We just redefine what a problem is.” [22:50]   “If we never put ourselves in the position of true challenge, then we don't really learn something about ourselves” [40:26]   “The idea of trying to do new things, learn new things that totally shake up a routine.
