Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to A Boogie and PNB Rock for jumping Lil B, and not successfully at that because Lil B was still able to get back on stage afterwards and speak on it. Moreover, we also had your favorite segment \"Shoot Your Shot\" where this time the listener should not have even tried to shoot because her crush was not interested. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
