  "description": "<p>At the age of 49 Rae was reminded of a goal she had set for herself many years earlier. Inching ever closer to her 50th birthday, the gap in accomplishing her goal seemed to be closing in fast, so she needed to take some action right away.</p> <p>It was 19 years earlier that she was deeply impacted by a phenomenal woman that she had seen on the television screen. This woman motivated Rae to complete her first marathon. And this is where the story begins...</p> <p>This episode is a powerful testament to what's possible no matter what age, background, or level you're at right now. You can achieve far more than you know.</p> <p>Rae went on to accomplish some amazing feats including: completing the Boston Marathon, completing a marathon in each of the 50 states in the U.S., and a HUGE accomplishment that she's going to tell you about that puts her in a fraction of a percent of people to ever achieve this running goal. And she started all of this during the time that most people are looking forward to retirement.</p> <p>Today you're going to learn the secrets that have helped Rae to maintain the levels of health and vitality that she has today. Not only does she train and compete herself, but she is a wonderful teacher that instructs fitness classes to help others to achieve their fitness goals as well.</p> <p>If you're going to have (and keep) your health and vitality well into your senior years, then you need to learn from people who've done it.
