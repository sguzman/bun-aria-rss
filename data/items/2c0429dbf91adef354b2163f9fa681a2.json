  "title": "271 - Asking, Seeking & Knocking",
  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter Twelve - \"Asking, Seeking & Knocking.\" Matthew 6:5-8 & Luke 7:7-12. Today, we wade into the waters of prayer, an often misunderstood, confusing and difficult facet of the Christian faith. How does Jesus frame our relationship with prayer? What is our role? How should we approach God? How does Jesus set up the model for prayer? How does asking, seeking and knocking fit in to what Jesus is saying in the sermon on the mount? Remember the through line Jesus has been laying out during the entirety of the sermon, and where prayer fits into it as a whole. Brick by brick, the foundation of the Kingdom is being laid.\n\nThis is still the beginning of the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
