  "description": "A man-sized bird creature that stands 6 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet, and ominous glowing red eyes. There have been many speculations as to Mothman's origins since he was first spotted in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966. Some believe he is an alien creature or a government experiment gone wrong. Skeptics dismiss the phenomena saying Mothman sightings are really just sightings of a Sandhill Crane or an elaborate teenage prank. So what exactly is Mothman? And more importantly, does he visit cities and towns to warn them of impending danger or is his presence what causes the tragedies?\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices.
