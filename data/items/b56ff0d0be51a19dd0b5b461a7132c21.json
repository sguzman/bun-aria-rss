We've all got family members who like bourbon but not on our level. Do you bring the goods or some of the regular stuff you want to deplete?\n\nWhat's your favorite $50. That cuts out things like OWA as well as pretty much any LTO\n\nWhat's the furthest you've traveled for a bottle and what did you get?\n\nSo this past week on Twitter, Kerry finally got Julian to drop a bomb.",
