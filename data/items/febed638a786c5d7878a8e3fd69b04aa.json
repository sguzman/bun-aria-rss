  "description": "<p>And Just Like That... it's the last new episode of Las Culturistas in the year of our good lord 2021. The iconic two (Matt & Bowen) take this time to lay down the law on spoiler culture once and for all, express their thoughts on cum, and really do a deep dive on the new revival of S*x and the C*ty, AND JUST LIKE THAT! TL;DR: we have some concerns and questions (Is Miranda now a queer alcoholic? How annoying is too annoying when it comes to Charlotte? What's the deal with how they're using the new POC characters? Will Samantha return? Why is Steve deaf? Are the third graders from The Morning Show now on this project?) but we will watch every episode, are thankful for it's return and absolutely love everyone involved. All this, more West Side Story thoughts (Tony Kushner is GOOD), Succession finale thoughts (this television show is IMPORTANT) and an examination and performance of Nicole Kidman's iconic AMC Theaters opening presentation (Nicole is a SAVANT). Also, RHOLSC thoughts, Survivor finale predictions, and a talk about how hands are weird. Fear Peloton! Happy New Year! We love you!
