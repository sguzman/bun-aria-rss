  "description": "<p><p>LGBTQ Advocate A.J. Nichols joins the show in studio for an unfiltered discussion about what it's like to be trans in America. No question was off-limits and Blind Mike lost an arm wrestling match. Kirk Minihane grades Mike's performance last night at the WEEI roundtable. Kmarko declined to come on the show today, but Tommy Smokes did not. Mike lost another fight. The parody songs are coming in faster than we can handle and not all of them are Grammy nominees. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
