  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show,  President Trump is taking heat for pushing back on Rep. Elijah Cummings' treatment of Homeland Security officials testifying before Cummings who chairs the House Oversight committee. The Democrats, and by extension the media, are piling on to allege that Trump is racist for, accurately, saying that Baltimore is rat-infested and poorly run. Then, the media called Trump a racist after Hurricane Maria for his past comments on Puerto Rico, now we see that his comments about corruption were correct. Later, Al Sharpton has gone to Baltimore to stoke the flames of demagoguery in the hopes he will poison the well and deter from Trump's recent gains among African American voters due to Trump's record of success with the economy, specifically the president's policies which have led to more Black-Americans having more jobs and earning more money.  Later, a re-cap of the commentary and analysis from two former Attorney's General, Ed Meese and Michael Mukasey, discussing impeachment and the Democrats' attempted subversion of Trump's 2016 campaign.  Finally, Rep. Rashida Tlaib is not getting the credit she deserves for being an anti-Semite.  She is now saying that Israel exists to the detriment of Palestinians.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
