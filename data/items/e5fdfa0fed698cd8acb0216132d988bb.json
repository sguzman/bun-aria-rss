  "description": "A collection of Witness History episodes, this week focusing on global events where women have taken a stand for equality from Sudan to Iran and Australia.\n \nIn Iran in 1979, Islamic rules about how women dressed were just one of the issues women objected to during the Iranian revolution. \n\nThe BBC's Rana Rahimpour discusses the protests currently taking place in Iran triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini with echoes of what happened in 1979. \n\nWe also head to Sudan in 1991 when a law was introduced to control how women acted and dressed in public resulting in arrests, beatings and deaths.  \n\nAnd we hear from a survivor of the 2002 Moscow siege when heavily armed Chechen rebels took an entire theatre full of people hostage, with some disturbing scenes.\n\n(Photo: Women during the Iranian revolution in 1979.
