  "description": "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn has been a long time in the making, and I am excited to finally get to talk about the release of my new book. Initially, this project started as the 4th edition of Python Machine Learning. However, we made so many changes to the book that we thought it deserved a new title to reflect that. So, what's new, you may wonder? In this post, I am excited to tell you all about it.",
