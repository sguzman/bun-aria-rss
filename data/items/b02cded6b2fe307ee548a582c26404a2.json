  "description": "In this message, Joel reminds us about the power of a life lived with integrity. Integrity is the foundation that a successful life is built on. God is looking for people who are willing to live at a higher standard. Often, challenges in life are integrity tests—will you compromise when no one is watching; do you live differently behind closed doors? A life of openness and honesty is a life that God can bless. When you live with integrity, God can trust you with great things.Proving your character begins in the small things—in how you talk to your family, how you honor your commitments, the way you spend your time at work.
