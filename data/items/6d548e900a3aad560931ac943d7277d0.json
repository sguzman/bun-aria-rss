  "description": "<p>It’s our Thanksgiving Special! Host Chris Hill and Motley Fool analysts Ron Gross and Jason Moser explain why they’re thankful for Cerence, Nike, and PayPal. We discuss why investors might want to avoid stock market turkeys Blue Apron, Macy’s, and Slack. And since no Thanksgiving is complete without dessert, we dig into a few slices of humble pie and talk Zillow and EPR Properties. Our analysts explain why they don’t want to talk about Robinhood, stock splits, or “Stay at home” stocks at the Thanksgiving table. Plus, we revisit our conversation with Collaborative Fund’s Morgan Housel, author of the best-selling book, <em>The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness. </em></p>",
