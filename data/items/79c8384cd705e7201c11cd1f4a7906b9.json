The Reno was born. \n\nThe nightclub became a particularly important space for Manchester's mixed heritage community, who felt unwelcome in city centre venues. \n\nPhil’s youngest daughter, Lisa Ayegun has been sharing her memories of the Reno with Matt Pintus.\n\nThis programme contains descriptions of racial discrimination.\n\n(Photo: Phil Magbotiwan (right) standing in front of the Reno nightclub in Manchester.
