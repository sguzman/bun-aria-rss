  "description": "Happy April! The Readheads are back and they are recapping, discussing and roasting this month's book, Our Country Friends. They are talking about their favorite and least favorite characters, storylines, and moments throughout the novel. Plus they take listener questions and share the other books they read over the last 2 months and whether or not they'd recommend them. The next book is Margo's choice and she chose All Rhodes Lead Here by Mariana Zapata.
