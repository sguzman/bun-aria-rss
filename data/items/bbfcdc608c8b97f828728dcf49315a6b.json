  "description": "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says that Bitcoin is way below its actual fair value by 70%, and that the bottom is likely already in for the king crypto.\n\nIn a new interview with MarketWatch, the veteran hedge fund manager says his firm’s metrics put the current Bitcoin value at roughly $40,000 per coin.\n\n“We believe that the leverage has been blown out of the system. I don’t think it’s going below the low that was reached for this cycle, which would be at around $17,500.\n\nAccording to our fair market value metrics based on adoption, wallet size, use cases, growth of wallets, we think the fair market value for bitcoin right now is about $40,000.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
