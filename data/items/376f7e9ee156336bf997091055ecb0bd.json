  "description": "<p>EPISODE 105 - CHRIS MENGES - Cinematographer</p> <p>Teams Deakins speaks with the talented cinematographer, Chris Menges (MICHAEL COLLINS, THE KILLING FIELDS, KES). We talk at length about his start in documentaries and what you learn from shooting documentaries - learning to force the image, working in impossible situations, looking and noticing light and making sure you get the shot. He also shares his experiences of working with director Ken Loach and the rules that they set as well as working on The Empire Strikes Back, The Killing Fields, and Waiting for the Barbarians. Chris talks about directing “A World Apart”, the difficult transition back to DP work after directing and covers the subject of adapting books to screen and why it doesn’t always work. A fascinating conversation with a visual master!</p>",
