OP wasn't able to finish a homework assignment because he was literally in a coma for a few days. The teacher refuses to believe him, so she demands that OP does the homework anyway. OP complies by handwriting the homework on hospital stationary, and also includes a few photos of himself hooked up to hospital equipment just to seal the deal!</p>\n<p>Get $10 in free Bitcoin at Coinbase.com/rslash</p>\n",
