The opportunities to learn new things were limited, which lead to no growth and it became less and less exciting to me every day.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>I realized I had to switch to software and upgrade my skills as per the demand to stay relevant throughout my career. I spoke with many of my peers, did some research, and found a few career choices viable as per the market right now. <a href=\"https://dimensionless.in\">Data Science</a> looked like an interesting career choice but I still remember having so many doubts!</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Why Dimensionless?</h4>\n<!-- /divi:heading -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>As I was researching, I came across Dimensionless on Google and enrolled for a Demo session. I asked them all the questions and doubts I had about taking up Data Science. I literally bombarded them with questions like…<br>How difficult is it going to be without having much of programming knowledge?<br>Is having no previous work-experience okay? And does it count?<br>How does <a href=\"https://dimensionless.in/data-science-using-r-python/\">Data Science</a> fit in my domain (Aerospace)?</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>They answered all of it with patience and logic. I also had a one-on-one career counselling session with their counsellor.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>Then there were other things to consider, like if I can attend the classes regularly, if the fee is viable, if I can get back to studies after such a long break, etc.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I went for the <strong>Experience and Pay</strong> option. Attended the classes for 2 weeks, I liked their methodology, and since I could understand what I was learning, I found myself attending lectures regularly along with my work and without being too stressed. And then, I continued and completed the entire course.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Experience with Dimensionless?</h4>\n<!-- /divi:heading -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>The course structure and methodology is not too stressing. The teaching pace wasn’t too stressing. Doubt-solving was immediate. I could get my doubts solved during the class, in the doubt-solving sessions or even one-on-one with the respective teacher. And trust me, coming from a non-programming background, I had a lot of doubts. Mentors and teachers were always available answering doubts.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Career Transition to Data Science</h3>\n<!-- /divi:heading -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>Resume-building sessions made me understand how to steer my career towards Data Science in Aerospace. When mentors started giving us projects, I got to choose projects from my domain so I could build upon my experience. This helped me get ready for interviews more than anything. Knowing theory is one thing, but the interviewers ask very technical and practical questions. <br></p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:paragraph -->\n<p>About only 70% of the course was done when I applied for an internal-switch at my company and got accepted. In fact, I even got a promotion and didn’t have to apply anywhere else.</p>\n<!-- /divi:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- divi:pullquote -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>I went from an Electronics Engineer to Machine Learning Engineer, within just 4 months into the course.
