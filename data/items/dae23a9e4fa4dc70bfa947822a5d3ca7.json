  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Rich Zeoli from WPHT fills in. Just like the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", President Trump went to Washington, in part, to build a wall at the southern border.

Will we survive a months-long government shutdown? Of course we will. Drones and sensors are being promoted for border security as opposed to a physical barrier such as a border wall, and intend to filibuster using this argument. The simple fact is that walls work. Liberals will argue that they don't, but walls work every single time. Invaders will always choose to invade the country without walls as opposed to the country with walls, its that simple.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
