  "title": "Ep 564 | Jase Calls Out the Worst Sin of All & Are Unbelievers Willfully Ignorant?",
  "description": "Jase wishes people believed that God is the one who makes the seeds grow — not \"Mother Nature\" — and Phil points out that God is also the one who can prevent things from growing. Zach says people who don't believe are willfully ignorant. Jase highlights how different Jesus was than the messiah the Jews expected — they were awaiting a messiah who would conquer Rome and bring an end to wars, but Jesus ate with tax collectors, healed people, raised people from the dead, and challenged the Pharisees. Zach says our problems in the world do not need a political fix. Jase warns us all to remain open-minded and to stay away from any traditions or groups of people who don't focus on Jesus and his grace. And Phil and Jase compete over who had the lowest grades.\n\nhttps://www.40daysforlife.com — Get your free quarterly magazine, podcast, and essential updates from 40 Days for Life.\n\nhttps://faithfulcounseling.com/unashamed — Get 10% off your first month!\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
