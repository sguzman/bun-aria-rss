  "description": "You can clearly see J.R.R. Tolkien's inspiration in this episode, what with that cursed ring finally making an appearance, a legendary sword reforged, and a selfish psychopath of a dragon sitting atop a pile of gold. Loki casually says something when he walks out the door which tears a family apart, and Odin is not fooling anyone when he (seemingly constantly) pretends to be an old man wandering the wilderness. There are also more huge Viking battles as well as more people transforming into animals for no reason at all.<br>The creature of the week is a relative of the leprechaun whose sole goal in life is to get drunk in your basement and harass dogs.<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
