    "media:description": "Experience a day in the life of Stanford undergraduate Carly Mae Smith, â€™23, as she conducts summer research in the Heller Lab at the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance. \n\nWorking on the fourth floor of the Gilbert Biological Sciences Building, Smith has been operating  treadmill tests to measure how bodies respond to high-heat environments during exercise, and to gauge the effectiveness of new mitigation technologies that could assist fire fighters and other affected professionals. \n\nCarly grew up on a cow farm in the small mountain town of Rocky Mount, Virginia, and this fall will start her last year as a human biology major at Stanford. \n\nFor more on undergraduate research opportunities at Stanford, visit: https://undergradresearch.stanford.edu/\n\nMusicbed SyncIDs: MB01VY0BDCKIY3B | MB01PDINKON0KHT",
