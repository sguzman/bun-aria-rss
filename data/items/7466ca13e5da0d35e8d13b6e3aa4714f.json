  "description": "<p>A rather nondescript and falling apart farmhouse in Hinsdale, New York has been described as one of the most haunted places in the state. The house has a mysterious history and unexplained paranormal activity that eventually led to an exorcism being performed. Many families have tried to live in the house, but not many have stayed. The experiences of one of those families, the Dandys, was featured on a 2006 episode of \"A Haunting.\" Paranormal Investigator and co-host of the Curiosity Radio Show Tim Shaw joins us again to talk about this creepy location. Tim was actually featured on the Paranormal Lockdown episode about Hinsdale House. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Annji Taft and features Air Bombs and the Bermuda Triangle and This Month in History features Janis Joplin found dead.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/10/hgb-ep-227-hinsdale-house.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/10/hgb-ep-227-hinsdale-house.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive producer and join the HGB Losers Club: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>",
