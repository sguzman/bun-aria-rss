It’s a question many scientists and sci-fi authors have speculated on, and is a fascinating rabbit hole to go down.\n\nSo, for this entry into the archive, we’ll explore relevant phenomena in evolution and physics to determine if extraterrestrials are more likely to look like Earth animals, or something far stranger...\n\n0:00 How ‘Alien’ Should Aliens Look?\n0:57 Convergent Evolution\n3:34 Evolve to Crab\n4:56 Alien Convergence\n8:43 Intelligent Aliens \n10:52 The Question of Gravity\n14:01 Beyond Mortal Comprehension\n16:11 The Answer?\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
