  "title": "Puerto Rico’s crisis and the curse of American colonialism",
  "description": "Yochi, Jenn, and Zack look at how the Trump administration’s bungled response to the crisis in Puerto Rico reflects the longstanding challenges facing an island that is neither a full US state (with all the benefits that brings) nor a fully independent country (which can more easily ask for, and receive, financial aid). That leaves Puerto Rico in many cases getting the worst of both worlds, with its people paying a heavy price. On Elsewhere, they look at what happens if Secretary of State Rex Tillerson loses his job after reportedly calling Trump a “moron” — and after being publicly humiliated for months by a president he clearly doesn’t respect. Zack takes a brave stand against colonialism, Jenn decides to run for president, and Yochi prepares for the darkness that will descend if Mr. Charisma Rex Tillerson moves on. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
