[11:20]</p><p>What was Cal’s focus in high school and college? [24:03]</p><p>How did Cal consciously set out to sharpen his writing skills in college, and what part have humor and mathematics played in their evolution?

But why did he initially refuse to sign up for Facebook when it was the shiny new thing everyone was talking about? [53:11]</p><p>Documents and disciplines Cal and I find instrumental in crafting the lives we desire. [58:41]</p><p>How Cal integrates seasonality into his routine for ample periods of downtime, where he roams to recharge and reset, and his pen of choice for taking notes both literary and mathematical. [1:06:11]</p><p>Why Cal and I are big fans of Scrivener software for writing. [1:13:37]</p><p>How Cal uses Trello to organize tasks under the different hats he wears throughout the day. [1:17:17]</p><p>Books in the “anti-productivity” category Cal thinks might be worth your while. [1:21:34]</p><p>Who was John Newport? [1:28:18]</p><p>Who Paul Tillich was, an explanation of the confusing term “Christian apologist,” and understanding why Cal describes himself as a concentration apologist. [1:30:53]</p><p>How does Cal focus on contemplation and matters of the soul? Why does he believe someone who’s quick to dismiss a philosophy or religion without trying to understand its most basic foundation does themselves a disservice? What are his thoughts on the takes Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson have on moral frameworks, and what need is satisfied by such contemplations? [1:33:06]</p><p>Considering the spiritual as an exercise of meticulous craft and creation, and understanding that some materials serve the purpose better than others. [1:41:09]</p><p>With so many options from which to choose, how might someone who has had either bad experiences with religion, no experience with religion, or no interest in religion explore spirituality? Are we programmed to seek out religion? [1:45:44]</p><p>Can you make it through Cal’s 30-day digital minimalism declutter? Here’s how to set the rules that are right for you and give it a whirl. [1:54:13]</p><p>What shutdown ritual does Cal use at the end of his workday? [2:03:06]</p><p>Parting thoughts.
