  "description": "What do you do when your congressman is an a**hole who celebrates the January 6 insurrection and uses it to try propel himself to governor of New York? You run against him and f*cking beat him.\nAt least that’s what attorney and former Onion writer Austin Smith plans to do. And he’s using his “furious, blood-boiling” anger toward Lee Zeldin and the rest of Trump’s losers to help the people of New York’s first district to finally get a decent guy to represent them.\nSmith, who previously worked for the campaigns of both John McCain and Hillary Clinton, has a clear mission in Congress once he unseats Zeldin: help people understand and navigate the ridiculous stupidity of student loans. He discusses his lawsuits against the deceitful companies who keep people buried in debt and shares well-hidden secrets for people who might not know they’re eligible to discharge their loans.\nListen here to what he has to say and then support his intellectual and for-the-people campaign here. Or just send him your junk (no, really).\nAlso in this week’s episode of Useful Idiots:\n–Nina Turner gets the much-coveted “Jim Clyburn backs the other candidate” bump\n–Katie goes from inviting a NYT writer onto the show to cursing him out in a record-setting 7 minutes\n–Republicans love their ugly confederate heroes\n–And Matt laughs louder than he ever has on Useful Idiots\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode.
