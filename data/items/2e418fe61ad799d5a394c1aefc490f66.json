  "description": "2012-10-24 - Wise Investigation: Dissolving the Trance - If we are suffering, it is because we are believing something that is not true and caught in emotional reactivity. A key tool in meditation is investigation--actively inquiring into what is happening inside us. When we investigate with sincere interest and care, the light of our attention untangles difficult emotions and nourishes intimate relationships.  As this light is turned toward awareness itself, it reveals the radiance and emptiness of our true nature. Please support this podcast by donating at www.tarabrach.com or www.imcw.org.
