  "description": "<p>In today's <b>Books with Hooks</b>, <b>Carly</b> and <b>CeCe</b> look at two queries each, in the process discussing what is meant when agents want specificity in a query, particularly when it comes to world building; the hurdles of writing a book centered around trauma or featuring particularly traumatic scenes; using fewer comps for greater agent interest; the use of interiority in a query letter; advice on how to successfully write in the omniscient POV; curiosity seeds not being watered; and the difficulty with starting your pages with a character's regular day.<br/><br/>After which, <b>CeCe</b> interviews <b>Bianca</b> about her upcoming novel, <em>The Witches of Moonshyne Manor</em>. During the conversation they discuss an author working collaboratively with an agent; character development and naming with an ensemble cast; planting curiosity seeds to keep the reader turning pages, the concessions that need to be made with regards to plot when you focus on character development; getting confused as to which character's heads you're in when writing in omniscient POV; and which editorial notes Bianca most feared and how she worked on them. CeCe also challenges Bianca to see who's going to dance on Twitter! <br/><br/>Find us on our socials:<br/>Twitter: @TSNOTYAW @BiancaM_author @carlywatters @ceciliaclyra<br/>Instagram: @biancamarais_author @carlywatters @cece_lyra_agent @ the_shit_about_writing<br/>Facebook: @tsnotyaw<br/>Website: <a href='http://www.biancamarais.com/'>www.biancamarais.c</a>om and www.theshitaboutwriting.com<br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p> </p>",
