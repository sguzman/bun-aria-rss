  "title": "260 - Lust, Shame & Modesty",
  "description": "Sermon On The Mount: Part 5. Lust. Shame. Coveting. Jesus, as He does, is cutting straight to the core. But what is He saying exactly? And to whom? What is lust? How does what Jesus is saying actually translate? How does sexual desire play into the equation? \n\nOur history with sexual desire and shame is a long and troubled one, too often dictated by voices and agendas that are made to cloud Jesus’s message. He is disrupting more than the idea of impure thoughts. Jesus is challenging the long history of the marginalization of women and how much objectification and imbalanced gender dynamics have influenced that. He is offering freedom, not condemnation.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
