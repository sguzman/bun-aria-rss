  "title": "317 - The Casanova Killer: Paul John Knowles",
  "description": "<p>For four months in 1974, 28 year old Paul John Knowles went on a reckless murder spree across the United States that claimed the lives of at least 18 people. He killed men, women, seniors, and small children. He strangled some, shot others, and stabbed still others. Some crimes were sexual, and some weren't.  The man who had spent more than half his life incarcerated in some form for a variety of petty, generally theft-related crimes suddenly became very, VERY violent. Why? That's what we explore in today's real-life monster, fit-for-October, true crime edition of Timesuck. <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>: This month we donated $15,029 to Guide Dogs for the Blind, with an additional $1,669 added to our Scholarship Fund!
