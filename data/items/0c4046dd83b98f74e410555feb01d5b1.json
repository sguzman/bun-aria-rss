  "description": "<p>Success is not just about knowing what to do. It's about doing it. Information, plans and goals, alone, will not get you where you want to go. Nor will willpower. Success at anything truly meaningful is about something bigger. Today’s show and, in fact, the first three Thursday episodes of the year are going to be very different. Instead of deep-dive conversations with guests, it’s just going to be Jonathan, going deep into three key topics.</p><p>Today’s immersion is all about how to find success accomplishing big, meaningful things. There’ll be a ton of myth-busting and you'll learn something called Success Scaffolding™, a unique approach to making big things happen, especially things you’ve tried and failed at many times before. We’ve shared Success Scaffolding before, but over the years, we keep refining it and making it better and better. So, you’ll want to give this episode a listen with fresh ears even if you've listened to past episodes about it, because there are a bunch of new insights, changes and additions.&nbsp;</p><p>You may also want to open your \"notes\" app to take notes.
