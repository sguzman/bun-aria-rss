  "description": "In her new book Aerial Imagination in Cuba: Stories from Above the Rooftops (Routledge, 2019), Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier looks up at the sky, and from there she begins her stories about wifi, pigeons, cacti, the lottery and congas. This dense and surprising ethnography considers the everyday lives of Cubans as they navigate, invent, and strategize ways to sustain what is most important to them. The book offers a new account of what has been called the Special Period in Cuba, and it does so through powerful storytelling. The emphasis here is on the ambiguous role of the state, the condition of infrastructures, and the nature of belief and faith and the ongoing transnational connections beyond Cuba. With compelling prose and evocative artwork, this book makes essential intellectual and aesthetic contributions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
