  "description": "<p>On the last nonfiction episode of 2020, the Battles & Banter crew tackle the Battle of Kamdesh, or more famously known as the Battle of Combat Outpost Keating, which occurred on October 3, 2009. Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Justin Voithofer to discuss one of the most pivotal battles of the War in Afghanistan and its lasting ramifications on how the US wages war in country. From discussing the reasons why the outpost was put in such a precarious position to the physical layout of the camp itself, the guys discuss the significance of COP Keating and how the battle played out for the men on the ground. They also compare the real life event to the movie adaptation that was directed by Rod Lurie that came out earlier this year. Enjoy!</p>",
