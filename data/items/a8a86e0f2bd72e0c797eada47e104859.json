The alarming thing is that millions of people are eating these foods everyday, and they have no idea of what damage they're doing.</p> <p>All of these foods are actually \"new\" foods in the human diet. But because of marketing, lobbying, and strategic implementation in our culture, most people believe that these \"health foods\" are normal. Nothing could be further from the truth, and today you're going to find out exactly what foods you need to avoid to become the healthiest, fittest version of yourself.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>What food contains the highest amount of plant estrogens and why it's so dangerous.</li> <li>The popular high protein food that actually blocks your ability to absorb protein.</li> <li>Where so-called \"vegetable oils\" actually come from.</li> <li>Why vegetable oils are one of the most inflammatory foods you can consume.</li> <li>How cooking vegetable oils can damage your system and lead to numerous diseases.</li> <li>What's added to processed meats to keep them looking fresh (long after they've gone bad).</li> <li>Why eating processed meats contributes to different forms of cancer.</li> <li>What you can use as an alternative to eating conventional processed meats.</li> <li>The preservative added to conventional peanut butter that makes it a spreadable plastic.</li> <li>Why peanut butter may be a significant gut irritant for many people.</li> <li>What amazing alternatives you can use instead of conventional peanut butter.</li> <li>The compound found in conventional whole wheat bread that causes autoimmune diseases.</li> <li>How whole wheat bread can block your ability to absorb nutrients.</li> <li>Why bread is proven to lead to long-term weight gain.</li> <li>The critical factor you need to consider when choosing beef (what to look for/what to avoid).</li> <li>How conventional, store-bought beef can lead to chronic inflammation and disease.</li> <li>The harmful effects that pasteurization and homogenization has on milk.</li> <li>What milk alternative you might want to stay away from (bonus food to avoid).</li> <li>Why processed foods are so addictive.</li> <li>The truth about artificial sweeteners and their deadly effects.</li> <li>What artificial sweetener is linked to brain damage, cancer, ADHD, seizures and more.</li> <li>Why diet sodas actually lead to long-term weight gain.</li> <li>What natural sweeteners provide some significant health benefits.</li> <li>The \"trendy\" natural sweetener that's more dangerous than high fructose corn syrup.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this podcast include: </h2> <p>* <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/dangers-of-soy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Are The Dangers Of Soy? - The Model Health Show</a></p> <p>* <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/aspartame-a-sweetener-to-die-for/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aspartame: A Sweetener To Die For</a></p> <p>* <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/natural-treatment-heart-disease-blood-pressure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Natural Treatment For Heart Disease, High Cholesterol, and High Blood Pressure - The Model Health Show</a></p> <p>* <a href= \"http://www.naturalnews.com/008191_alloxan_diabetes.html\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">White flour contains diabetes-causing contaminant alloxan</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
