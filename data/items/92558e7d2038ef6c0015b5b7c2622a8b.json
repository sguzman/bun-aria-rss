  "description": "What makes a good player? To the casual NBA fan, oftentimes the bottom line is scoring. And let's be honest... many of the top players in the game are indeed elite scorers. But if you look a little closer, and you know the game well, you know that so many other aspects of the game are just as important. And if you can find a player that does the little things - whether it's taking a charge, diving for a loose ball, coming up with a key defensive stop - chances are you have yourself a winner. Well, Jose Alvarado does ALL of those things, and combines all of it with an atomic force of energy that gives opponents fits, and his teammates confidence. Jose joins JJ and Tommy for this incredibly humble interview and shows what makes him so special on and off the court. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
