  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, retired Science Editor at The New York Times Nicholas Wade questioned how much Dr. Anthony Fauci knew about the Coronavirus in an interview with Mark Levin on the Fox News Channel. Wade outlined the case that it was not likely that the coronavirus was transferred from animals to humans. The bats at the wet market was a cover-up promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and the media was too happy to blame President Trump to even look into it. Conversely, currently available scientific information supports the hypothesis that the virus leaked from a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. What will the Biden Administration do anything about China’s role in the virus? Jen Psaki says there is no underlying data available to take any action. The White House will rely on the World Health Organization. Serious economic pressure must be out on the Chinese government and Fauci and the US must also get to the bottom of who signed off on third-party funding. Later, not a single mosque was attacked in the United States amidst the Hamas attacks on Israel but several synagogues and Jews across America have been terrorized for publicly gathering to support Israel. Similarly, leftists that embrace Critical Race Theory continue attacking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's concept of a color-blind society. Finally, Governor Ron DeSantis discusses his legislation against Big Tech censorship. If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently and discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will be held accountable in Florida. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
