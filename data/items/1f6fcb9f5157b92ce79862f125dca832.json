  "description": "<div>The boys learn about virginity auctions, wonder if they ever fished for cum on the magic school bus, and compete to see who's the best at taking off bras. They also hear from a listener who's extremely good at etch-a-sketch and decide that having a journal was a good way to get bullied.<br>\n<br>\nSupport the boys, get 4 bonus eps a month, and instant access to the Patreon back catalog for $5/month at <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod\">https://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod</a><br>\n<br>\nThanks to Athletic Greens for sponsoring this episode.  <a href=\"https://www.athleticgreens.com/socks\">https://www.athleticgreens.com/socks</a><br>\n<br>\nThanks to FRE for sponsoring this episode.
