  "description": "Ines Mergel, assistant professor of public administration at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and the School of Information Studies (iSchool) at Syracuse University, is the author of Social Media in the Public Sector: A Guide to Participation, Collaboration and Transparency in the Networked World (Jossey-Bass 2012). This timely and insightful book can be read by a host of audiences, from the scholar to the practitioner. The book relates the development of social media technologies to the open government movement of the last generation. It demonstrates how government agencies can better integrate tools such as Twitter and Facebook into their operations. In doing so, agencies can open a door to public input and deliberation. This is a book that should be read by political scientists interested in how federal agencies grown and change, but also by those in federal agencies who want to respond to calls for greater openness.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
