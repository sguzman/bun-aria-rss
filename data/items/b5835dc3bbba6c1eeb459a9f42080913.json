  "description": "In order to run a successful SOC, security leaders rely on tools with different strengths to create layers of defense. This has led to a highly siloed industry with over 2,000 vendors, each with their own specific function and who very seldom work together. To gain an advantage on attackers, we need to start seeing cybersecurity as a team sport–united for a shared mission.\nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, the CyberWire's CSO, Chief Analyst, and Senior Fellow, Rick Howard, is joined in the first half by two Hash Table members, Ted Wagner, CISO at SAP National Security Services, and Jenn Reed, CISO at Aviatrix. In the second half of the show, CyberWire podcast host Dave Bittner talks with our episode sponsor ExtraHop's Senior Product Marketing Manager, Chase Snyder, and CrowdStrike's Head of Product Marketing, Janani Nagarajan .They discuss why and how vendors should work together to enable better integrated security for their customers. They’ll answer questions like “what is XDR?” and “how do I get my vendors to work together?”.",
