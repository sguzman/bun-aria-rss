    "media:description": "A vapor chamber is a vacuum sealed heat spreader with a wick structure lining its inside walls. The wick is saturated with a working fluid and when heat is applied, the fluid at that location immediately vaporizes and the vapor rushes to fill the vacuum. When the vapor meets a cooler wall surface it condenses, releasing its latent heat. Learn more about how they function and their role in the thermal management of electronics with this video.\n\n\nhttps://www.qats.com&#13;\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.&#13;\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.&#13;\n&#13;\nService, Products and Training&#13;\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System&#13;\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design&#13;\n• Design Services&#13;\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions&#13;\n• Rapid Prototyping&#13;\n• Custom Heat Sink Design&#13;\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments&#13;\n• Engineering Training&#13;\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories&#13;\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
