  "description": "<p>In the late 1960’s a creature simply known as the “Abominable Chicken Man” had been reported on a farm west of Oklahoma City near El Reno. According to the Oklahoma Journal, a farmer found the door to his chicken coop ripped off and lying on the ground. On the surface of the door and inside the coop itself were strange hand prints about seven inches long and five inches wide. When he saw that several of his chickens had disappeared without a trace, he called the local state game ranger. The door was shipped to zoologist Lawrence Curtis, director of the Oklahoma City Zoo. After a study that included comparisons with the hand and paw prints of human beings, apes, monkeys, bears and other animals, Curtis confessed his bafflement. “I don’t know what this is,” he said. “It resembles a gorilla but it’s more like a man.” According to Curtis the creature’s thumb crooks inward as if deformed or injured.</p> <p>I will be speaking with a law enforcement officer who has had his own run ins with Sasquatch. He says in several parts of Oklahoma, the locals still call this creature the Chicken Man because of the incident that took place back in the 1960’s and 70’s. It is interesting how around the U.S. everyone calls this creature Bigfoot or Sasquatch, but in the Midwest and in the South the locals who have been seeing these creatures for a long time give them names based on what they observe them doing, like “Corn Man”, “Chicken Man”, “Night Stalker” and “Wild Man”. The list goes on and on with local names. The Chicken Man Incident is an interesting case because so much physical evidence was left behind and was examined. Locals in the area would report seeing a large upright orangutan like creature harassing and killing their livestock.</p>",
