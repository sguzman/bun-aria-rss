  "description": "The Juice Crew were clicking and touring as a unit.  Marley Marl was now focusing on his own album and wanted Kane and G. Rap to be on a track together.  But when Marley suggested an unknown Masta Ace join the song, tension got thick.  Reluctantly the song got recorded and ended up becoming \"The Symphony\", one of the greatest posse cuts in history.  Kane also reflects on the Juice Crew/BDP wars and how his relationship with both MC Shan and KRS-ONE made him sit that one out...sort of.  Then he finds himself in a battle that was more fabricated than reality.  Fueled by fans, the Kane vs Rakim rumors was something everyone wanted to see, but something that wasn't being talked about behind the scenes. Additional commentary by Masta Ace, Mister Cee, Cutmaster Cool V and Steve Brown\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
