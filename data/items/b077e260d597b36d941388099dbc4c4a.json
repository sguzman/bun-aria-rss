  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, during President Barack Obama's terms in office Democrats lost over 1000 seats in elected office. Either of the Obama’s campaigning for Democrats will not change the trajectory of this election. Then, this program is concerned with the election denial displayed by a majority of Democrats with respect to the election of every Republican president for the past two decades. Later, President Biden and Democrats have weakened our country from within by weakening our military. China's army is twice as big but lacks combat experience. Afterward, it’s easier to get an abortion than baby formula. Yet Stacy Abrams argues that children are the reason for high gas cost worries and therefore the answer to inflation is abortion. Afterward, New Jersey Republican Candidate Frank Pallotta joins the show to discuss his campaign against Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05). Pallotta noted that his opponent says one thing in the district and votes opposite to that in Washington, DC. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
