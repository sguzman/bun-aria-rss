  "description": "On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, the great E-40, the legendary rapper and hip hop artist, joins the show. E-40, whose given name is Earl Stevens, is well known as a pioneer of West Coast rap, the founder of Sick Wid it Records, and a collaborator with artists like Tupac Shakur, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg and countless others. E-40 also is a purveyor of spirits, from wine to cognac to tequila to his new bourbon brand, Kuiper Belt. During this week's interview, Earl and Fred sip whiskey (obviously) and discuss topics such as his spirits brands, how hip hop would be different if Tupac was still alive, San Francisco 49ers football, and a lot more.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nRussell's Reserve Barrel Pick (12:34)\nEagle Rare Vintage 1970s (31:48)\nOld Schenley Vintage 1940s (53:54)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and E-40 talk about a wide variety of things, such as:\nThey start things off by talking about E-40's bourbon, Kuiper Belt 8 Year Whiskey, which Fred calls one of the better sourced bourbons he's had in some time. Look for more releases coming soon.\nAmong his many ventures, E-40 even has a cookbook coming out under the moniker Goon With a Spoon.\nThe first whiskey in the session is a Russell's Reserve barrel pick, which Fred says has a similar flavor profile to Kuiper Belt. They do a side by side tasting, and E-40 quickly exclaims, \"Kuiper Belt got 'em!\"\nFred shifts to talking football, and the recent draft pick by the San Francisco 49ers, of which the Bay-area native E-40 is a big fan. The rapper predicts big things for Trey Lance. Talk then turns to Steve Young and Joe Montana. And then? Colin Kaepernick.\nTalk then turns to E-40's life in the 1990s, when he was making his ascent, along with what he was drinking in those days. Back then, he always mixed bourbon with Coca-Cola. \"I wanted it to last all damn day,\" he says. \"All gas, no brake pads.\"\nFred asks what Tupac was drinking during the day, and E-40 offers some interesting commentary at around the 23:00 mark. The choice in those days was Hennessy Cognac. Today? E-40 feels sure it would be his brand, Tycoon Cognac. Why? Because Tupac was all about supporting black-owned business and products.\nE-40 mentions that he misses his friend, and also brings up another friend, Biggie Smalls. He and Fred talk about what the hip hop industry would be like if they were alive today. \"One thing 'Pac did was uplift the inner-city spirits,\" E-40 says. \"Whether it was female or male. No matter what you were going through, he had something to say that was going to uplift your spirits.\"\nBranching off a conversation about family, Fred talks about how the international bourbon community has become a family. At that point, E-40 says, \"Can I stop you for a minute? I'm drunk!\" He then says, \"I'm getting in the studio tonight! I'll probably write the dopest rap ever.\" It's been a while since Fred has laughed this hard on the show.\nAs they head into tasting the vintage Eagle Rare, E-40 collects himself and talks about why he likes to help young rappers, such as Jeezy. E-40's son Droop-E, also a rapper, comes into the conversation, along with the evolution of hip hop.\nWe briefly get into what would happen if E-40 was a deep sea fisherman on Clubhouse.\nHe talks about growing up with a single mother - after age 8, at least - and how life for his family was difficult. As the oldest of four, however, he knew he had to \"figure it out.\" But, he said, \"I did it.\" They bust out the Old Schenley to toast to E-40's mom.\nThen check out a story about the fate of one of his platinum records, as well as some other personal belongings. It's a story he clearly is still frustrated by, but he vowed to let it go. Fred responds with a story of his own that turned out better, but was similarly frustrating.\nWill Fred ever launch his own bourbon brand? Two or three years ago, he would have said \"never.\" But covid helped change his thinking....",
