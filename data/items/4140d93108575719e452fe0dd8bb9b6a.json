  "description": "<p>Spoke to the eyewitness who is from the U.K. but she was in California for business. She shared some very interesting details about what she saw. She said “When the male rushed me the female stopped him and they were chattering back and forth, a very strange gibberish.” She has agreed to come on the show, her account is below.</p> <p>A listener writes “Dear Wes, My Brother suggested that I email you to tell you about an encounter with a group of hairy things, possibly Sasquatches, that I had back in the late 80’s when I was working in California. In brief, I was trying to take pictures of Sea Otters at a beach near Big Sur when a group of six one male, two female and three smaller creatures came down out of a creek and the male waded into the water and started pulling seaweed out and throwing it back to the females that were chewing at its roots and rubbing it into the fur. This was about 100 metres away from where I was sat on some rocks.</p> <p>The group noticed me when I tried to take some photos and the male charge at me whilst the females were screaming. The male stopped about 50 metres away from me and seemed to be having an argument with one of the females as they were gibberish away to each other. The last thing I remember was that it swung its body round to face me again, screamed so loudly that my insides were vibrating and slammed its fists into the beach. I think I must have fainted, but what I have never understood is that I came round about about an hour or so later with my jacket pulled over my head and quite badly bruised about ten metres from my car and could only assume that I was dumped there.</p> <p>I drove back to the hotel I was staying at and they called the police who came and took a statement. I was forcefully told that what I had seen were bears nothing else. When I argued with the man he got really agitated with me and asked me whether we didn’t have Officers like him in positions of authority where I came from. I replied that we did but that they weren’t allowed to tell us what to put into a statement. He then asked whether I understood English to which I replied that I was English. He just looked at me and told me that I had seen bears and not to say anything different to anyone else if I didn’t want to get kicked out of the country.</p> <p>I don’t know whether this is the sort of thing that you would be interested in as I am not from the US and this happened nearly thirty years ago now but I would be happy to write this up in more detail if you think it would be of any use to you.</p> <p>I haven’t spoken to anyone else about this other than my brother who is a primate photographer and suggested that I contact you.”</p>",
