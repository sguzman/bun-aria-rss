  "description": "<p><b>For the final week of our Proverbs series, Amanda and Raechel sit down with author, speaker, and fellow lover of God’s Word, Angie Smith. As the three talk about the wisdom that concerns our material world, they also touch on self-woven bedspreads and why you probably shouldn’t holler at strangers. Together, they explore the dangers of wealth, the surprising relationship between gluttony and generosity, and why even though walking in God’s wisdom looks different depending on the times and seasons, His Word will always be a faithful guide. Bonus points if you catch how many times they mention the word “tacos” or “self-governance”!</b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 4 of the She Reads Truth Proverbs reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Proverbs collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-4-with-angie-smith/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-4-with-angie-smith/</b></a></p>",
