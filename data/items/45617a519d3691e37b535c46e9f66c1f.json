  "description": "<p>Awakening from the Trance - Embracing Unlived Life (2015-08-26) - When physical or emotional pain is too much, our conditioning is to pull away and avoid direct contact with raw feelings. The result is a trance - we are split off from the wholeness of our aliveness, intelligence and capacity to love. This talk explores how this dissociation shows up in our lives and a powerful way that mindfulness enables us to integrate cut-off parts of our being.</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
