  "description": "How can we each do our part to reduce inequality and help the poor, not just in our own communities but around the world? As a devout Christian, Bruce Wydick views helping the poor as an essential requirement of his faith. But is it enough just to give if it may not even be helping? We all have limited time and resources, so where do we allocate them? As an economist, Professor Wydick has the tools to figure out what works, and what works best. As he explains in Shrewd Samaritan: Faith, Economics, and the Road to Loving Our Global Neighbor (Thomas Nelson, 2019), he wants to not just be a Good Samaritan, but a Shrewd Samaritan. Regardless of the foundations of your own ethical system, this book can help you understand not just the latest research findings from development economics, but also all the different ways you can personally contribute to reducing global inequality.\nBruce Wydick is a professor at the University of San Francisco who has conducted research on global development for over twenty-five years, publishing widely in top academic journals. In addition to his academic work, he spends his summers in Guatemala working with a non-profit development organization he founded. He also founded the University of San Francisco’s unique Master’s program in International and Development Economics, which for two decades has trained students from all around the world to be shrewd Samaritans. This program provides students with the international field experience to have a practical understanding of the problems faced by the poor, as well as the quantitative econometric tools needed to shrewdly evaluate how best to help them. Links to his research and other writings can be found here and you can follow him on Twitter here.\nHost Peter Lorentzen is an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco, where he leads a new digital economy-focused Master's program in Applied Economics.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
