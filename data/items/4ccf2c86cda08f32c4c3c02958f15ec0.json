  "description": "<p>Imagine that you have a well paying job but otherwise it sucks and you wish you could leave. And now imagine that an amazing opportunity comes along for you to start your dream business- that thing you’ve always wanted to do, but the problem is that you know you won’t be able to pay yourself for a solid year. What you need is peace out money to keep you afloat! Or maybe some family or health issues have come up and you want to be able to spend time with family, or maybe you just want to take some time off and road trip it for 6 months. Either way, the answer is peace out money! We’re defining this as having enough money on hand to leave situations or jobs where you could technically stay, but you’re choosing not to because you’d rather do something else. You have that peace out money to bridge you to the next job or opportunity that you really want to pursue. Listen to the full episode to hear the additional benefits of peace out money, how it's different than reaching financial independence, and then finally the steps you can take to make sure you have your own peace out money set and ready for when you need it.</p><p>And during this episode we enjoyed a 2014 Oud Bruin by yEast Atlanta Brewers which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
