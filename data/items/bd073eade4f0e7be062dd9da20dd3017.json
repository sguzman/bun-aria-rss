  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust me when I say you’re in for a treat with today’s podcast. I'm chatting with Beth from Crowley House Flower Farm about how she earns a living doing what she loves… growing cut flowers. If you’re thinking, \"I don't need to grow cut flowers,\" or, \"I already grow flowers in my garden, so this episode isn't for me,\" stick with me because, for decades, I didn't put time or effort into growing flowers. Then I started studying herbalism and quickly realized how certain flowers (that double as medicine) can actually help my vegetable garden as well.
