  "description": "<p>Merry Christmas! Anthony ran into Dog Walker Jesus and how Gregg kept Anthony out in his backyard for over an hour on his birthday. We break down Wonder Woman 1984 and how the hell it got made before getting into the best headlines ever: Hilaria Baldwin, a Santa stuck in power lines, and a Covid specimen in a Kohl's box, and the Nashville bomber's cryptic message. You need to listen all the way through to get to the best story of 2020. </p>",
