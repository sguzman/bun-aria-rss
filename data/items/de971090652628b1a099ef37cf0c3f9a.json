The idea was to explain physics in a pedagogical way, concentrating on established ideas rather than speculations, with the twist that I tried to include and explain any equations that seemed useful, even though no prior mathematical knowledge was presumed. I’m in the process of writing a series of three books inspired by those videos, and the first one is coming out now:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/biggestideas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Biggest Ideas In The Universe: Space, Time, and Motion</em></a>. For this solo episode I go through one of the highlights from the book: explaining the mathematical and physical basis of Einstein’s equation of general relativity, relating mass and energy to the curvature of spacetime.
