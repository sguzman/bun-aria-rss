Also, Five Headlines, including the media celebrating over the fact that the US supposedly has the most coronavirus cases of any country in the world. But there's a big problem with that stat. And today we cancel a police department for trying to turn a 'Black Mirror' plot line into real life.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar.
