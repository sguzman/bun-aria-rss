  "description": "Actor James Cromwell leads vegan milk protest at NYC Starbucks in a scene that Clay and Buck say could have come right out of Succession, the acclaimed HBO series that C&B both love and Cromwell appears in. Clay says, \"If you are protesting the price of vegan milk, you are self-satirizing yourself.\" UNEXPECTEDLY! Biden economy gets crappier, inflation higher at 8.3%. Buck notes this constant surprise means, \"It's like idiots rule over us, really.\" Gasparino: Bigwig Wall Street Democrats have no confidence in Biden. Pelosi quotes Bible more than once to defend $40B aid package to defend Ukraine's border, while they do nothing to defend our southern border. C&B callers on the baby formula shortage are all in sync: They mostly can't find it, even after going to as many as 10 stores.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
