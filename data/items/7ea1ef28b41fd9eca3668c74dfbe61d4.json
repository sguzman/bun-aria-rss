  "title": "Ep 139 | Is Ukraine a Convenient War for Democrats? | Kim Iversen | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Nuance is hard to come by these days. Just ask journalist Kim Iversen. She hosts \"The Kim Iversen Show\" and is a host on the Hill’s “Rising,” and just a few years ago, she was a Bernie Sanders supporter. Now, she has repeatedly been the target of outrage for daring to question the approved narrative. Recently, she dared to say on the Hill that Glenn’s take on the Great Reset “isn’t such a crazy conspiracy theory after all.” After that, she took a lot of heat for questioning what President Biden’s motives actually are behind his response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And her takes on China, COVID-19, cancel culture, and California aren’t exactly mainstream-friendly either. Kim joins Glenn to discuss her journey, where the world’s heading next, and how to wake people up to see that the Great Reset is really happening.\n\nSponsors:\n\nFormulated by Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, the world-renowned doctor that President Trump credited with his successful early treatment protocol, Z-Stack is Kosher and GMP certified, and is produced right here in the USA.
