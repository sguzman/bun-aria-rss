  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>Our final interstitial of Season 4 and we’re talking Antiheroines! If she’s a criminal, a grifter, a villain or a generally bad dude, we’re here for her, we support her, and we’re rooting for her to fall in love! Today we’re talking about the way antiheroines play in romance, about how we hold them to different standards than antiheroes (it’s the patriarchy, that’s why!), and about why they seem to be more prevalent in historicals and paranormals than they are in contemporaries. Please tell us about all the bad b*tches in books you love so we can love them, too! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Alyxandra Harvey, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JK8R4l\"><em>How to Marry a Duke</em></a>, and Lumi Labs, creators of Microdose Gummies, for sponsoring the episode.
