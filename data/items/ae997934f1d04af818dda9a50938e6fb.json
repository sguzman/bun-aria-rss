  "description": "Today’s podcast, as you guessed it, is a reflection on what’s been happening with COVID-19. The whiskey industry is going to see some big changes. We’ve seen legislation pass as it relates to shipping and delivery of alcohol because it’s deemed an essential part of living and our culture. How long will this trend stick around and will we see this continue when the pandemic is over? Do you want to see more relaxed liquor laws? Lets hear it in the comments.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about grains.\n\nLots has changed since our last roundtable with COVID-19.\n\nAre people actually drinking more? Or are they just hoarding?\n\nIs distribution down with distilleries producing hand sanitizer?\n\nWill COVID-19 change consumer demand indefinitely with services for shipping and delivery?\n\nKY HB415 has passed. What could this mean for the greater United States?\n\nShould these large corporations that have donated 50k, 500k, or 1M be donating more? Billions in revenue vs a small donation amount in comparison.\n\nWhen this is all over, what’s the best thing that will come out of COVID-19?",
