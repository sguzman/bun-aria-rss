  "description": "The story of Oedipus is fun until it isn't. I've met people with varying degrees of familiarity with the story. Some are familiar only with the central premise of the story, while others' knowledge only extends to a certain disgusting little complex popularized by a similarly-disgusting Viennese psychologist. Regardless, the story of Oedipus is a fascinating commentary on fate, our willing blindness to uncomfortable truths, and why you should, under no circumstances, talk to prophets. Seriously, they will mess up your life. The creature this week is the Tanuki from Japan, with two big surprises for you. ------- Sponsors: Loot Crate this month looks amazing. Batman, Jessica Jones, Stranger Things, and X-files are all fantastic franchises, and I'm super excited for it. You should check it out, too.
