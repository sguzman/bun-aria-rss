  "description": "<p>A.A. Suslin proved a normality theorem for an elementary linear group, which\nsays that an elementary linear group of size bigger than or equal to 3 over a\ncommutative ring with unity is normal in the general linear group of same size.\nSubsequently, V.I. Kopeiko extended this result of Suslin for a symplectic\ngroup defined with respect to the standard skew-symmetric matrix of even size.\nHere we generalise the result of Kopeiko for a symplectic group defined with\nrespect to any invertible skew-symmetric matrix of even size of Pfaffian one.\n</p>",
