  "description": "<p>The Federal Reserve is in tightening mode. And there's that old adage \"don't fight the Fed\" which means in theory it's a bad time for stocks. And yet we saw a surprisingly powerful rally off the bottom in June. But now what? Can the market resume its ascent? Or will we return to the lows, or possibly make new lows?

In our chat, Meisler explains her methodology, and gives her assessment of the market right now. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
