In this episode, we will be talking about the realities of addiction.

So often our humanity gets in the way of who we are in Christ, and leads us down paths we don't want to be on.<br> <br> On this episode of the podcast, Cindy Bultema shares her personal testimony of recovering from addiction and how to live fully and walk freely in Christ. In this honest conversation, we process how to avoid the triggers of temptation, how to get to the root of what causes us to be tempted, and ultimately the freedom we have in Christ to renew our hearts and minds each day. Cindy shares that what we believe about God, and therefore ourselves, matters, and starting with that foundational belief is the key to a full, free life in Christ.</p><p>Related Resources:</p><p><br> If you or someone you love is looking for a Christian counselor, the <a href=\"https://www.aacc.net\">American Association of Christian Counselors</a> is a great resource for finding one that's right for you. <br> Connect with Cindy at <a href=\"https://www.cindybultema.com/gems/\">https://www.cindybultema.com/gems/</a> or on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cindybultema/\">@cindybultema. </a><br> Get Cindy’s book, <a href=\"https://gemsgc.org/product/live-full-walk-free-bible-study-by-cindy-bultema/\"><em>Live Full Walk Free</em></a>, to explore Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians and see how believers today can navigate their way in a wayward and confused culture.<br> Subscribe to receive free <a href=\"https://proverbs31.org/read/devotions/subscribe?utm_source=podcast&utm_medium=show-notes&utm_campaign=DEVO\"><em>Encouragement for Today</em></a> weekday devotions in your inbox.<br> Download the \"Temptation Victory Plan\" on Cindy's website, <a href=\"https://www.cindybultema.com\">cindybultema.com</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://cdn2.proverbs31.org/webcontent/podcast/transcripts/click.php?id=2021-11-09_P31_Podcast_Episode100_Live_Full_Walk_Free_pdf\">Click here</a> to download the transcript for this episode.</p>",
