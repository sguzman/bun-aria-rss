  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys open it up and bounce around from conversation to conversation. They cover dogs, cats, and horses, and some of their individual pets, work through a Last Survivor type contingency plan for who would take over Pat McAfee Inc. if something were to happen to Pat, and discuss whether or not they want kids in the future and how many. Todd wants to know what the names of the horses would be for everyone in the office, which spawns a conversation about whether or not they should get into the owning horses game. They also answer some listener questions including what movie they would choose to be on set for, and the guys get into a long conversation when discussing which three TV shows they would like to bring back. To close out the show, the guys each give out some vitamin thoughts.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @evanfoxy.</p>\n",
