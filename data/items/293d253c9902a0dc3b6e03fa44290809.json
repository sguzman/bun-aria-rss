    "media:description": "How do some sentences trick us into thinking they're good, when really they're not? And what can that tell us about how we process language? In this week's video, we take a look at the comparative illusion, a tricky kind of sentence that seems meaningful, but falls apart when we consider it further. And then we look at what exactly it is about them that confuses our minds.\n\nThis is a shorter format video that we'd been toying with making for a while! Do you like this length? We'll be making more of our regular length videos coming up soon!\n\nLast episode:\nWho Is She? The Syntax and Semantics of Pronouns: https://youtu.be/fvohHpylRkY\n\nOther of our psycholinguistics videos:\nWhy Are There So Many Meanings? Ambiguities: https://youtu.be/E5Pp_wE14HU\nDo Sounds Carry Their Own Meaning? Arbitrariness of the Sign: https://youtu.be/CcSCq8XDTaY\nWhat Can Our Eyes Tell Us about Language?
