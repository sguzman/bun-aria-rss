  "description": "Author and audiobook narrator Julia Whelan says narrating her own second book, <em>Thank You for Listening</em>, was \"so meta, that it just spins off its axis.\" It's about a former on-camera actress who suffered a tragic event that ended her on-camera career. She's found work in narrating audiobooks and while she loves it, it isn't the same as being in front of the camera. Whelan chats with Mary Louise Kelly about how this latest novel pokes fun at romance while honoring it, and the different voices she has had to use to represent the \"voice\" of the book. ",
