The code that was acquired was only partially recovered, but enough to indicate powerful features that the attackers were (ab)using in Google Chrome. The basis for this attack were malicious extensions that the attacker dropped on the compromised system.\nThe research can be found here:\nAbusing Google Chrome extension syncing for data exfiltration and C&C",
