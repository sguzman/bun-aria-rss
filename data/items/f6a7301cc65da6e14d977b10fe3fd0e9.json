  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the tale of a 42-year-old Zamboni driver for a minor-league hockey team who was pressed into action during an NHL game, which he won for the Carolina Hurricanes. David Ayres is a case study on several sports business fronts, including media, scale and the capabilities of retail to capitalize on emotional moments. Also talked about is how the U.S. olympic committee is telling American athletes that it’s business as usual in preparation for the Tokyo Games amid concerns over the global spread of the coronavirus. And also touched on is the National Football League’s decision to allow some of its teams to have betting lounges this season, though they won’t include betting windows. Teams can also accept sponsorships from sportsbook operators.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p><br></p><p>Producer: Tim Herro</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
