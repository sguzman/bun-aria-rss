  "title": "Repost: Why raising the minimum wage doesn’t raise unemployment (with Mayor Eric Garcetti and Alan Krueger)",
  "description": "You may have noticed that the trickle-downers are out in full force again spouting bad ideas in response to the Raise the Wage Act, which will raise the federal minimum wage to $15/hour. To set the record straight, we’re reposting one of our first-ever episodes, from early 2019, that reveals what the research proves (no, raising the minimum wage doesn’t affect employment), and asks why changing public perception around the minimum wage has been so difficult. \n \nEric Garcetti is the Mayor of LA, where he signed a $15 minimum wage ordinance into law in 2015. \n\nThe late Alan Krueger was a leading labor economist best known for his work on the effects of the minimum wage. \n\nShow us some love by leaving a rating or a review!
