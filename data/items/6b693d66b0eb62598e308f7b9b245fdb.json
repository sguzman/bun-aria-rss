  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 61, RA and Whits open with the usual potpourri of topics: the dissing of the city of Winnipeg by a couple of the San Jose Sharks, Paul Maurice's impassioned defense of the 'Peg, why getting upset about All-Star selections is a waste of time, Pierre Maguire's prostate cancer diagnosis and getting checked, and more. Next, longtime Buffalo Sabre and 2007 Stanley Cup winner with Anaheim Brad May joins the show to talk about his lengthy career. He gives us his take on the famous \"May Day!!!\" goal that sunk the '93 Bruins, the sleepless nights leading up to his scrap with Derek Boogaard, winning the Cup with a team that could pummel you, and a whole lot more in a fun interview. The fellas then finish things up with #AllRightHamilton and a few words from RA about some show feedback.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
