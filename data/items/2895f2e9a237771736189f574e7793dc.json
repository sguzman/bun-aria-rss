  "description": "Bernardine Evaristo didn't think there were enough books being published about Black British women, so she wrote one herself. <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em> looks at the lives of many different British women, mostly Black women, from 19 to 93 years old. Some of their stories intertwine while others stay separate. Evaristo told NPR's Scott Simon that she wanted \"to show the heterogeneity of who we are in this society, and to explore us as fully realized, complex, driven, flawed individuals whose stories are as worthy of telling as anyone else's.\"",
