  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s just something about music that helps us remember things we’ve learned in a way that other methods can’t match! In this episode, Emily and Laura celebrate our opportunity to worship God through song. No matter what our singing voices sound like, we can all benefit from remembering God’s goodness and faithfulness through shared songs in the Christian faith. By inviting these moments of worship into our homes, we’re able to experience the joy of knowing God and resting in his promises as a whole family.</span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re grateful to <a href= \"https://christianplanner.com/products/2021-christian-planner?variant=32291994927170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christian Planner</a> for helping make this week’s show possible!
