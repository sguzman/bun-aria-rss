However, when so much of the original The Last of Us' narrative strengths lay in Naughty Dog's unparalleled technical prowess in facial animations and the like, with said technical upgrades being so substantial in nature, they fundamentally alter how you experience that still gripping narrative. If you can (and there are valid reasons why you might want to hold off), this is now the definitive way to play The Last of Us.\n\n0:00 - The Last of Us is defined by its tech\n1:25 - The $70 backlash\n2:31 - Next-level facial animation\n3:53 - Tech changes how you play\n4:48 - DualSense implementation\n6:21 - Graphical fidelity\n7:06 - No really, the facial animation is unbelievable\n8:25 - The personality of environments\n9:06 - Why you shouldn't buy The Last of Us Part 1\n\n---\n\nExtra footage from Marvelous Man - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfgImAiCXdo\n\nIntro text animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames",
