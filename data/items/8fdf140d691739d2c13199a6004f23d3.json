  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, it’s not indigenous people’s day, its Columbus Day and NBA coach Gregg Popovich says that Biden's proclamation is appropriate because acknowledging Christopher Columbus is to acknowledge the new world genocide he presided over. Popovich likely got his erroneous information from communist Howard Zinn's \" A People's History of the United States\" which was written to indoctrinate college students. Then, the first step to liquidate a people is to erase their history. That's why the left teaches this propaganda in every institution they have commandeered since the beginning of the American Marxist takeover of this country. AG Merrick Garland's memo targeting parents that protest critical race theory being taught at school meetings is proof that the conservative anti-Marxist movement is making an impact. Later, Texas and Florida now have COVID rates that continue to drop and Governors Abbott and DeSantis have done a great job tackling the surge of the delta variant. This is why red states are growing while blue states are losing population. Democrats want to impose national standards all over the country to eliminate free thinking Governors. Free states like Florida and Texas have no state income tax and Democrats hate that because it competes with their huge Washington iron fist spending plans. Afterward, Victor David Hanson joins the show to explain how Amazon claimed his book was out of stock when it wasn't. Hanson explained that the relentless attack on the middle class and on the information they receive is part and parcel of why he wrote \"The Dying Citizen\" in the first place.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
