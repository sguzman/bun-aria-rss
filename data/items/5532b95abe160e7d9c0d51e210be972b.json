  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast I’m joined by Thomas Dajer. Thomas is the lead editor for the YouTube Channel, Yes Theory - we’ve had him on the show before to talk the what goes on behind the scenes of Yes Theory and how they craft their stories that reach millions of people. This week, we’re talking about something different, Thomas competed in one of Mr. Beasts challenges - now if you are unfamiliar with Mr. Beast, he’s a creator with over 32 million subscribers - he does these big social experiments that often times end with some sort of cash prize. Thomas not only competed in the video but also Won (and he won $70,000...) We spend the first 20 minutes of the episode talking about the making of that video - so If you haven’t seen it yet - watch Yes Theory’s version on their channel and then listen to the podcast - it’ll make more sense once you’ve watched the video, We also talk about Thomas’ trip through Europe, his modeling career, his on-camera appearances and his efforts to expand his identity, it’s a really interesting conversation that we had a lot of fun having.",
