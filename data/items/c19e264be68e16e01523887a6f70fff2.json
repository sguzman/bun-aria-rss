He's a virtuoso healer. A master consciousness. And a gift to humanity.</p><p>Today Dr. Bush returns to the podcast (his first appearance was <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll353\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #353</a> in March of 2018) for a formidable and moving conversation that will leave you rethinking not only how you eat and live, but what it means to be a conscious consumer and engaged citizen of this precious planet we all share.</p><p>A pioneer in the science of well-being, Dr. Bush is the founder and director of <a href=\"https://themclinic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">M Clinic,</a> an integrative medicine center in Charlottesville, Virginia, and one of the only ‘triple board-certified’ physicians in the country, expert in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, and Hospice/Palliative care.</p><p>How we treat the planet impacts human biology. Intuitively, we understand this to be fact. But what distinguishes Dr. Bush from his medical peers is his rigorous application of science, strength of humanity, and the intelligence of nature to his commitment to transforming our world. A man with a deep understanding of the interdependence of macrocosm and microcosm, Dr. Bush's brilliance truly shines on subjects like soil degeneration and regeneration. The relationship between intensive farming practices and the rise of environmental degradation and&nbsp;chronic disease.

It's time to stop screwing around. It's time to get educated. And it's time to once-and-for-all take control of our personal health and that of the planet we inhabit.</p><p>I ask only that you listen keenly. Take notes. And no matter what, stick around to the very end. Zach concludes the podcast with what I can only describe as the most poignant and moving closing monologue in the history of this program – a bold statement&nbsp;I don't make lightly.</p><p>If you thought last week's podcast with David Goggins was peak RRP, think again, Because today, the doctor is in.</p><p>Final note: the podcast is now available on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a> and viewable on YouTube at:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/zachbush414\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/zachbush414</a></p><p>Final Final Note: My friend and team member David Kahn “DK” joins us this week for an extended introductory segment to discuss his health goals for 2019.
