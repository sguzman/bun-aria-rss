  "description": "Benjamin Wittes is senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution and the editor of Campaign 2012: Twelve Independent Ideas for Improving American Public Policy (Brookings Institution Press 2012). He also directs the Campaign 2012 Project for Brookings.\n\nThis collection of essays on critical national issues ranges from the well-publicized, health care reform, to the wonkish, institutional reform. The book is arranged as a series of critical debates that reflect on the first four years of the Obama administration and ways to improve public policy. Authors include many luminaries in the field including: Thomas Mann, Alice Rivlin, and William Galston. The issues range from domestic, budget deficit and federalism, to international, Iran and Middle East policy. The book could be used in an undergraduate political science course on the election and public policy, but also is a serious evaluation of issues facing policy-makers.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
