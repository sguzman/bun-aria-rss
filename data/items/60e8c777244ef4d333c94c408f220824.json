  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Sen. Marco Rubio and Congressman Adam Schiff tell ABC News that informants are not spies and there’s no evidence to support that the FBI spied on President Trump. Schiff sat there doing the work of the Russians while obstructing Congressmen Devin Nunes, Ron DeSantis, and others from looking into Russian interference. The real road to colluding with the Russians does not lead to the Trump campaign, it leads to the federal government under Barack Obama. Democrats interfered in a huge way through the FBI, CIA, DNI, and others. The Democrats and media are in lockstep trying to discredit Trump on the Sunday shows echoing that he is a liar and a conspiracy theorist. Meanwhile, Ted Kennedy colluded and conspired with the Kremlin to defeat Reagan. Where's Bob Mueller when you need him? After, President Johnson used the federal government to spy on Barry Goldwater's campaign but the media then, and now, are silent on this. Also, what Roseanne Barr tweeted was disgusting, but are we supposed to spend all week talking about her? Barr paid the price but why is Joy Reid still around with her homophobic attacks? Why is the Jew hater Louis Farrakhan still around? Later, former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice’s son, John David Rice-Cameron, started his conservative journey when he listened to Rush Limbaugh in middle school and then found his “political hero” Mark Levin. He is intellectually curious and Mark uses his books, TV and radio shows to bring conservatism to the table and make you think about things like our founders and philosophy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
