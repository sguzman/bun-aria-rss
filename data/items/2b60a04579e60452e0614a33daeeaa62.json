  "description": "Maria Sharapova moved to the U.S. during the collapse of the Soviet Union when she was just six years old. Though she did not speak a word of English, her skills on the tennis court did all the talking, landing her a scholarship with an elite tennis camp. Her insane work ethic led her to turn pro at the age of 14 and secure a victory over Serena Williams in the Wimbledon finals at 17 years old. She continued to climb the ranks becoming the first Russian woman to ascend to the sport's top ranking in 2005. She’s won five Grand Slams, a silver medal in the Olympics, and spent an untold number of years as the highest-paid female athlete.
