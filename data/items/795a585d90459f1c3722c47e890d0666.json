Do face masks actually work? Glenn has on Drs. Scott Jensen and George Rutherford to discuss the benefits and shortcomings and how emotions have hijacked the debate. Then, Dr. Karlyn Borysenko breaks down why there’s such a big political divide over masks. Attorney General Barr testifies to the House Judiciary Committee as Democrats look to impeach him. A viral video by “America’s Frontline Doctors” has been scrubbed from the internet, but it’s now up at BlazeTV.com. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
