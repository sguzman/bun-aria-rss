  "description": "<p>This week on the podcast, Vanessa and Jonah do a deep dive analysis of the 1998 Farrelly brothers film, \"There's Something About Mary.\" Despite its all-star cast, there is a lot of questionable aspects of the film that are rooted in the broader context of comedy movies in the nineties. We've heard about suspending disbelief but you've got to attain anti-gravity levels of suspension to accept Matt Dillion's spy technology, the film's convoluted stalker backstory and the way that the Farrelly Brothers are able to reduce characters to mere caricatures. Despite all this, there are some genuinely funny moments in this film by Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz that embody the awkwardness of adolescence, where the film really shines. Whether you've never seen \"There's Something About Mary\" (which we hadn't) or it's one of your favorite films (grow up?), you'll find something to take away from our expert analysis of this comedy classic.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
