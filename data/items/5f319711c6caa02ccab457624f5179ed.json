Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Private Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs, says that high valuations alone are not enough to warrant underweighting equities. What's important is context: she explains her optimism towards the US economy, as well as the potential risks to her views.\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on January 10, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any securities and such views/opinions may differ from those of Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research or other departments or divisions of Goldman Sachs and its affiliates.
