  "description": "How does understanding business help us understand sex? In The Business of Birth Control: Contraception and Commerce in Britain before the Sexual Revolution (Manchester UP, 2020), Claire Jones, a Senior Lecturer in the History of Medicine at the University of Kent, explores the intersection of commerce and medicine in the interwar period in Britain, as a way of rethinking both the history of contraception and the history of sex. The book uses new archival research, as well as perspectives from business history, to show changing attitudes and practices of people, clinics, and companies in the era before the contraceptive pill. Charting the rise of a new consumer culture, intertwined with company, technology, and medical history, the book is essential reading across the arts, humanities, and social sciences, as well as for anyone interested in sex!\n Dave O'Brien is Chancellor's Fellow, Cultural and Creative Industries, at the University of Edinburgh's College of Art.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
