  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, we won’t allow the FBI to use the cover of atrocities in Afghanistan to release their report indicating that there was no insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th, citing scant evidence of coordination amongst rioters. When you hollow out a country it weakens the resolve of the military, law enforcement, and the nation's foreign policy. America needs its resolve back so that it can inspire others again. Then, President Biden says they were prepared for every contingency but then said they weren't prepared for the rapid collapse. Biden also said Americans weren't having a hard time getting to the Kabul airport, that was a lie! Sec. Lloyd Austin has admitted to members of Congress that Americans are being beaten in Afghanistan and prevented from getting to the airport. This program recommends to Biden to use his staff to immediately draw a plan to extract every single American citizen out of that hell hole and then a plan targeting the top 10 Taliban commanders. Every minute that goes by without American action the Taliban is strengthening their grip. The Taliban is now going door-to-door searching for and hanging people that have sympathized with Americans. Later, Rep. Brian Mast calls in to discuss his dismay over the idea that American civilians and contractors might be killed by American weapons. Did Biden consider that the enemy could use American anti-aircraft weapons against Americans during extraction efforts? Biden has created a situation where we now have American hostages, it seems that every wrong decision imaginable was their plan all along. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
