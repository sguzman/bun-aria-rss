  "title": "PMS 2.0 169 - Joe Burrow….’s QB Coach, Jordan Palmer & Comedy Legend Frank Caliendo Join Us For A FEEL GOOD FRIDAY",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by seven year NFL veteran and now Quarterbacking Guru for QB Summit in which he gets college players ready for the NFL Draft, and aids in current NFL quarterback’s progression in the league, Jordan Palmer in studio. He chats about his process with Joe Burrow this year, and how they build a plan of attack in order to get him ready for his rookie season in the NFL, and not on being drafted by a specific team. He gives his idea for a new combine drill that will help dispel the small hands narrative, and talks about some of the other QB prospects in this year’s draft who he’s coached or watched film of (4:59-24:14). Next, all-time legend of a comedian, the best impressionist to ever walk this earth, friend of the show, Frank Caliendo joins Jordan Palmer on the couch. Pat and Frank have a heartfelt conversation on Frank coming along with his social media game to reintroduce himself to fans, Frank shares a hilarious story about performing at a corporate event for Tony Robbins, and of course Frank crushes impression after impression (26:30-01:11:43). Also included is Pat reacting to more from the CBA negotiations that now has some very elite players publicly voicing why they voted no, and a lot of the middling players on the roster voting yes, and where that leaves us now moving forward. Today’s show is a good time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
