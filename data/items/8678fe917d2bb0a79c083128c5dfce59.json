  "description": "<p>Play in Game night was a dud as the Pacers rolled the Hornets and Jayson Tatum put a burger up on Russell Westbrick and the Wizards (2:56 - 9:17). Stanley Cup playoffs (9:17 - 18:40) Kwame Browns has officially changed his legacy and Tony LaRussa is the last great guardian of unwritten rules (18:40 - 30:43). Hot Seat/Cool Throne including Shohei Ohtani being incredible and politicians pretending to like sports (30:42 - 56:12). Brooks Koepka joins the show ahead of the PGA Championship to talk about his new goatee, a terrible picture that was taken of him and more (56:12 - 72:04). We finish with the return of our good friend Uncle Chaps and listener submitted roasts.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
