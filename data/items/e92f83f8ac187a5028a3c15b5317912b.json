While out walking near the C & O canal Mary was attacked. She was shot twice, died practically instantly and left for someone to find. Police make an arrest and the trial is set. But do they have the right guy? Or was Mary killed by some shadowy agency because of an affair with the late President Kennedy? This week in the garage we continue to look at the unsolved murder of Mary Pinchot Meyer. Was Mary's murder a hit and cover-up put together by an organized group like the C.I.A. or was it a random act of violence committed by a loner? Hmmm, that's funny. Isn't that the same question we ask ourselves about John Kennedy's murder? </p>\n<p>Beer of the week - Conspiracy Theory by Southern Star Brewing CompanyGarage grade - 4 out of 5 bottle caps </p><p><a href=\"https://truecrimegarage.com/home\">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>\n",
