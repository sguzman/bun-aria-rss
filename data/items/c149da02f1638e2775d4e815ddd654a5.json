  "description": "In this installment of Best Of The Gist, with the newly switched-on James Webb Space Telescope dominating the non-political news this week, we chose a space-themed segment from the archives. In this July 11, 2016 interview, Mike talks with Summer Ash, an astronomy educator and writer, about NASA’s Juno Mission to Jupiter. It’s all about the big red spot!\nThen, we’ve got a Gist podcast extra with The Atlantic’s Graeme Wood. He was on the show this past Tuesday talking about Biden’s upcoming rendezvous with Saudi Crown Prince MBS, and in this extra, he talks more generally about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And it sounds like a weird place…unless MBS is reading this, in which case...it sounds totally amazing!\nProduced by Joel Patterson\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
