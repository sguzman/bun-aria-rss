  "description": "Mario, Luigi, Zelda, Tom Nook...all household names we have to thank for hundreds of hours of entertainment - and because of one Japanese businessman and a company called Nintendo. But even though your GameBoy or Wii was the most high-tech thing you could’ve dreamed up when you opened it on Christmas morning, the first Nintendo products were actually much more simplistic...they were handmade playing cards! On this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, we’ll hear about the journey that took Nintendo’s playing cards all the way to some of the most sought-after pieces of technology in the world. Also, Maia will clue us in on an absurd period of time when the world was convinced that musical legend Paul McCartney wasn’t who he said he was.
