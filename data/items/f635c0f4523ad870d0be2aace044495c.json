  "description": "Russian troops are building up along the Ukraine border. Russia's close ally Belarus has provoked a crisis on its European borders by directing refugee flows at its neighbors. Tensions are rising. Are the Russians counting on the US and our NATO allies to be reluctant to respond strongly? Do they not realize that the Biden team is much more inclined toward a tough stance toward Russia than the last two U.S. administrations? Will they go too far? We discuss with former US Ambassador to NATO and CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs Ivo Daalder, Brookings Institution European scholar Constanze Stelzenmuller and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute.
