  "description": "<p>Afraid it’s too late to pursue a career in music? Have a rude relative who is also cold toward your four-year-old kid? Songwriter, composer and Grammy-nominated singer Rufus Wainwright helps Tig weigh in on these problems as well as the debate over whether it’s socially acceptable to pee in the shower. Plus, Rufus gets candid on what he thinks the biggest problem is with today’s pop stars, balancing indulgence with better judgment, and the best advice he’s ever heard in the lyrics of a song. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy), Shopify (go to Shopify.com/TIG for a free 14-day trial and full access to Shopify’s suite of features),  Netsuite (go to Netsuite.com/TIG for a one-of-a-kind financing offer), Zocdoc (go to Zocdoc.com/TIG to download the Zocdoc app for FREE), Macys (go to Macys.com/purpose to celebrate Pride month), Truebill (go to Truebill.com/TIG and start canceling today), Wealthfront (go to Wealthfront.com/TIG to start building your wealth and get your first $5,000 managed for FREE, for life), and Netflix’s The Hall: Honoring the Greats of Stand Up | Accompanying Podcast. </p>\n<p>Need advice?
