  "description": "<p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a powerful class of\nalgorithms that is highly suitable for noisy quantum devices. Therefore,\ninvestigating their design has become key in quantum computing research.\nPrevious works have shown that choosing an effective parameterized quantum\ncircuit (PQC) or ansatz for VQAs is crucial to their overall performance,\nespecially on near-term devices. In this paper, we utilize pulse-level access\nto quantum machines and our understanding of their two-qubit interactions to\noptimize the design of two-qubit entanglers in a manner suitable for VQAs. Our\nanalysis results show that pulse-optimized ansatze reduce state preparation\ntimes by more than half, maintain expressibility relative to standard PQCs, and\nare more trainable through local cost function analysis. Our algorithm\nperformance results show that in three cases, our PQC configuration outperforms\nthe base implementation. Our algorithm performance results, executed on IBM\nQuantum hardware, demonstrate that our pulse-optimized PQC configurations are\nmore capable of solving MaxCut and Chemistry problems compared to a standard\nconfiguration.\n</p>",
