  "description": "The Scream Murder. September 22, 2006. Pocatello, Idaho. 16 year-old Cassie Jo Stoddart was asked to housesit for her aunt and uncle while they were out of town for the weekend. Her boyfriend and two other schoolmates joined her for a while before they left her alone later in the evening. On the following Sunday, her relatives returned home to find Cassie dead. She had been stabbed about thirty times. Her mother arrived soon after the homeowners did, having been concerned that her daughter had not been in contact with her that weekend. The investigation focused on the three boys that had been at the house that evening. After one suspect confesses, detectives soon learned that the killers had made recordings leading up to and after the murder and wore masks and wielded knives when they re-entered the home later in the evening. The inspiration for the killing was the film Scream by Wes Craven. But was everything as it seemed? Was Cassie really murdered for fun and for fame?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
