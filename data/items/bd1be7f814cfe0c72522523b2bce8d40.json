  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast we bring you another fun episode in our “In Search of the Austen Adaptation” series. Hosts Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are joined by resident film aficionado, Atlee Northmore to discuss film adaptations on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cXQ6OM\"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em>.</a> The conversation opens by revisiting the question of what makes a good adaptation of a book when translating it for the screen. They talk about the challenges of showing modern audiences the characters and situations as Jane Austen meant them to be understood. Atlee gives a brief overview of the lesser known film adaptations, as well as a more in depth discussion of the 1995 and 2008 versions.

These are the concepts by which Jane Austen grasps the world. In her we still breathe the air of the <em>Rambler</em> and <em>Idler</em>. All is hard, clear, definable; by some modern standards, even naïvely so. The hardness is, of course, for oneself, not for one’s neighbours. It reveals to Marianne her want ‘of kindness’ and shows Emma that her behaviour has been ‘unfeeling’. Contrasted with the world of modern fiction, Jane Austen’s is at once less soft and less cruel.</p> <cite>C. S.

For by permission and command Of thine own Prince Ferdinand, Poor Ariel sends this silent token Of more than ever can be spoken; Your guardian spirit, Ariel, who From life to life must still pursue Your happiness,-- for thus alone Can Ariel ever find his own. From Prospero's enchanted cell, As the mighty verses tell, To the throne of Naples he Lit you o'er the trackless sea, Flitting on, your prow before, Like a living meteor. When you die, the silent Moon In her interlunar swoon Is not sadder in her cell Than deserted Ariel.</pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Bthxde\">In Vital Harmony</a></em> by Karen Glass</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vrGvpy\">The Story of Charlotte Mason</a></em> by Essex Cholmondeley</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Bq6XDW\">Robert the Bruce</a></em> by Eric Linklater</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cHQksY\">C.
