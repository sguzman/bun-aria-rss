In Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont, loopholes exist that allow for the forced labor of incarcerated citizens, and voters will weigh in on whether to remove them from state constitutions. Christina Carrega, a national criminal justice reporter for Capital B News, joins us. And, \"Listen, World!,\" a new book from Allison Gilbert and Julia Scheerer explores the life of Elsie Robinson, a prolific journalist and columnist born in the early 1900s. She became the most-read woman in America, though many didn't know her name. Author Gilbert joins us. ",
