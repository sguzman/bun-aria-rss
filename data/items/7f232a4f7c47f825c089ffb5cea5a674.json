  "description": "The franchise tag deadline allows for the opportunity to react to both tags that were awarded and not awarded. Will Brinson and Cody Benjamin break down the guys who did get it (Chris Godwin, Allen Robinson, Justin Simmons, Taylor Moton, Leonard Williams, Brandon Scherff, Marcus Maye, Marcus Williams and Cam Robinson) and guys who didn't get it (Kenny Golladay, Hunter Henry, Bud Dupree, Chris Carson, Hasson Reddick, Aaron Jones, Shaquil Griffin, Karl Lawson, Jonnu Smith). What were the biggest surprises? Who has a good chance to get a long-term deal done with their current organization? Those answers on this episode (4:35). But that's not all! Brinson and Benjamin also go through Cody's Free Agency Mock Draft (29:30), with a fun and simple concept...Just pretend that all free agents were entered into the 2021 NFL Draft Order. So, you get the Dolphins targeting Aaron Jones at #3, the Eagles taking JuJu Smith-Schuster at #6 and the Bears correcting a QB mistake they made last year.
