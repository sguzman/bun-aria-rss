Time and time again, I’ve seen that mindset is a defining factor in how successful my patients are on their healing journey. The mind-body connection is a powerful one, so much so that there are numerous reports of spontaneous remission of chronic pain and diseases when people change their headspace. How we think and feel creates our state of being. Digging into our subconscious thoughts and beliefs and redefining how we see our future can have real, long-lasting impacts on our physical health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I was so excited to sit down with Dr. Joe Dispenza to talk about his work in mind-body medicine, helping people overcome their biggest obstacles and form new, healthy, limitless lives. Dr. Joe’s passion can be found at the intersection of the latest findings from the fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions. He uses that knowledge to teach people how to heal their bodies of health conditions, make significant changes in their lives, and evolve their consciousness.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, BiOptimizers, and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
