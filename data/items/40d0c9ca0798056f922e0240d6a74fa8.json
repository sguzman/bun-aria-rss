  "description": "In Episode #213, Dr Jenna Macciochi joins me for a deep dive into the human immune system.\n“Immunity” has become a buzzword in health spheres at the moment. From supplement marketing to recipe promotion, there seem to be countless quick-fix products or ingredients to “boost” and improve the immune system. But is there any validity to these claims? Dr Jenna Macciochi joins me today to look deeper into what actually creates a balanced immune system.\nIn this episode, we cover broader explanations of what the immune system is and what it does before getting into the finer details. Dr Macciochi also provides an abundance of applicable information, explaining the mechanisms behind what impacts the immune system. We discuss the extent of control we have over our own immune system, indications of a disrupted immune system, and the importance of gut health. Dr Macciochi also shares insight into vaccines, inflammation, diet, and supplementation.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBecoming an Immunologist (5:38)\n\nExplaining the Immune System (9:00)\n\nImpact of Genetics (15:05)\n\nImmunity & Immune-Washing (19:07)\n\nReaction to Virus’ (28:04)\n\nPregnancy & Childhood (31:00)\n\nUnderstanding Your Immunity (44:53)\n\nBacterial VS Viral Infections (56:00)\n\nAntibiotics (58:48)\n\nGerm vs Terrain Theory (1:04:36)\n\nNatural Immunity (1:09:23)\n\nInflammation Explained (1:18:38)\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Diets (1:29:28)\n\nPhytonutrients & Toxic Plants (1:44:31)\n\nEat the Rainbow (1:57:52)\n\nBeta-Glucans (2:05:40)\n\nAnimal Foods (2:07:37)\n\nHealthy Fats (2:12:48)\n\nSupplementing Vitamins (2:16:04)\n\nOutro (2:32:10)\n\n\nTo connect with Dr Jenna Macciochi, you can do so on Instagram, Twitter, and her website.
