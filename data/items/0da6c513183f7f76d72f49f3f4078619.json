  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Congress is back in session and they're looking at gun control and impeachment. The Democrats suggest that supporters of the Second Amendment are bought and paid for by the NRA despite the NRA not even existing at that time. The media talk about gun deaths but never talks about Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard deaths. Since 1975, this has been the biggest threat to the left because the automobile represents the ability for citizens to exercise their liberty. So the left attacks combustion engines and the CAFE standards failed to improve the environment or curtail the use of cars. More Americans are killed and maimed by these CAFE standards than soldiers that have fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a truth that CNN won't report. Then, Hydrofracking has paved the way for the U.S to become energy independent, but the left is trying to stop that too. MS-13 gang violence is hurting America yet the media — our destructive free press — turns a blind eye. When the media doesn't do its job and become complicit in advocacy and misinformation it does a disservice to the very same people it's supposed to protect from disinformation. Later, Rep. Jerrold Nadler has reintroduced his idea to impeach the president now that U.S Attorney John Durham has made headway on the criminal investigation that he's overseeing into the abuse of the FISA Court. Nadler's committee is eviscerating the very process that they falsely claim they're trying to defend and they don't even realize that they have opened Pandora's box. Finally, Mark Morgan, the current Acting Commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection, joins the show to discuss the Administration's success in building sections of secure fencing and decreasing the number of illegal border crossings over the past three months.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
