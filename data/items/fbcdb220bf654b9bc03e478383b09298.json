  "description": "<p>Exact solutions describing a fall of a particle to the center of a singular\npotential (collapse) in classical and quantum cases are obtained, inspected,\nand compared. The quantum and classical solutions exhibit striking\nsimilarities. In particular, at zero energy of the particle, both are\nself-similar, and their characteristic spatial scales obey the same temporal\ndependence. In addition to collapsing, exact expanding solutions, corresponding\nto the escape of the particle from the singularity, exist for both problems.\nThe collapse and escape are independent and not linked to each other through\nthe singularity. In the quantum collapse, the wave functions of the exact\nsolutions have time-depended norms. This case requires reconsidering and\ngeneralizing the continuity equations and rules for mean value calculations. It\nhas also been done. The analysis sheds new light on the fundamentals of quantum\nmechanics.\n</p>",
