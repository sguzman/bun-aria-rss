  "title": "24 Assets by Daniel Priestley",
  "description": "In this book Priestley explains how we can create a digital, scalable, valuable and fun business that will thrive in a fast-changing world. The book is specific for businesses, either new or established, wanting to develop their influence through developing 24 specific assets that contribute to the overall impact of a successful business. The 24 assets are sub-divided into both physical and softer assets such as software assets and brand assets, clearly pointing out what is important for businesses to focus on. From a business owner and entrepreneur point of view, this book provides a tremendous amount of value. In particular, I enjoyed how Priestley explains that businesses need strong overall assets across all 24 categories to keep themselves protected in both booms and recessions. The book is specific for individuals interested in developing their own business but there is also a lot of value for casual readers. I rate this book four stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
