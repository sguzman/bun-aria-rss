  "description": "<p>January 2, 2018. Lake Forest, California. Blaze Bernstein left his parents’ home to meet up with a guy he had known from his high school days. The following day, his parents reported him missing when he failed to return home. Samuel Woodward, the man that Blaze had met with, claimed that Blaze had walked away into Borrego Park after an argument and he hadn’t seen him since. However, a week after he disappeared, Blaze’s body was found partially buried in the park. He had been murdered. Quickly, the police zeroed in on Samuel as their prime suspect. As new information arose, the police realized that the murder wasn’t a random event; Blaze had been murdered because he was gay and Jewish.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
