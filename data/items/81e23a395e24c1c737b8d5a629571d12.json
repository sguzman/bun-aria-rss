  "description": "\"Is what I’m doing making the world a better place? Yes or no?\" When best-selling author Ryan Holiday took a good look in the mirror and answered \"no,\" his whole life changed. Now the author of ten books, including “The Obstacle Is the Way” and his latest, “Stillness Is the Key,” Ryan joins Glenn to discuss becoming the good man you’re striving to be, even in a chaotic world. A student of history and philosophy, he explores how bad times call up the best in us and debates what America looks like at some unknown, never-before-seen \"rock bottom.\" Although some have tried to get rid of America’s heroes and legacy, Ryan sees a glimmer of hope in each of us. And stillness, he stresses, is key to finding meaning in the chaos.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
