If you can spare a little more there’s all sorts of bonus content available at the 2, 5 and 10 dollar levels, including early access to ad-free versions of our episodes and bonus material from both The Magnus Archives and The Rusty Quill Gaming Podcast, including character sheets and archive transcripts. It’s taken a lot of money to get things to this stage, and anything you can give will help us to develop the company even more, giving us access to a dedicated recording space, better equipment and the time to create even more podcasts, videos and webcomics. If you want to help out go to patreon.com/rustyquill. We really, really appreciate your enthusiasm and support you’ve all shown us since we started, and we hope to be able to provide you with excellent entertainment for years to come! <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href=\"https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/817720\">Get bonus content on Patreon</a><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
