  "description": "One of the leading poets of his generation, Gerald Dawe is also a fellow emeritus and professor of English at Trinity College Dublin. Throughout his long writing career he has been thinking about the situation of religion in his native Belfast and the ways in which religion has been instrumentalised to serve competing political agendas. But his writing has always recognised the vitality of religious community and experience. His most recent collection of essays, The Sound of the Shuttle: Essays on Cultural Belonging and Protestantism in Northern Ireland (Irish Academic Press, 2020) gathers work from the 1980s to the present day that reflects upon the problem of Protestant culture in Northern Ireland. In this careful and deliberate work, Dawe points past the stereotypes that are projected and often appropriated by this often “faceless” community to identify and defend a broader and more inclusive sense belonging.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
