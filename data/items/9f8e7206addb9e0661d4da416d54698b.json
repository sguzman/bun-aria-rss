  "description": "<p>On this special surprise episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, we’re sharing an unreleased interview Katie did back in February with H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones. The interview's release was held as Katie shifted her attention to the coronavirus pandemic. But the conversation — which was done in front of a live audience in our Manhattan offices (another world, right?) — is surprisingly relevant to issues we are grappling with right now, like how to create more inclusive work environments, and the need for companies to lead with purpose. Jeff also talks about being an “unimpressive” kid, how military academy changed the course of his life, and how persistence helped him land his dream job. Jeff ends the conversation with some thoughtful career advice. And a friendly reminder to our listeners, the new, extended tax deadline is just around the corner — July 15!</p><p>Subscribe to Katie’s Couric’s morning newsletter, “Wake-Up Call,” on <a href=\"https://katiecouric.com/newsletter\">KatieCouric.com</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
