  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss Jackson Browne with Cameron Joseph.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a></u>) and Jeff Blehar (<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a></u>) with guest Cameron Joseph. Cameron is Talking Points Memo’s senior political reporter, where he covers Congress and the permanent campaign. You can find him at <u><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/\">talkingpointsmemo.com</a></u> and at shows standing back by the soundboard. Cameron is on Twitter at <u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cam_joseph\">@cam_joseph</a></u>.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Cameron’s Music Pick: Jackson Browne</strong></span></p>\n<p>One of the faces of the 1970s west coast singer/songwriters movement, Jackson Browne is the writer and performer of some of the most literate and moving songs of his era. His self-titled debut was the work of a man who had spent some six years honing his craft. A Top Ten hit, “Doctor My Eyes,” was emblematic of what was to come over the next decade: a series of preternaturally mature and affecting songs about, life, love, and death. Browne had a rough transition into the 1980s artistically, though his albums continued to sell well for the first half of the decade. A bounceback with I’M ALIVE proved he still had some gas in the engine. Literate, direct, and armed with a tremendous gift for observation, Jackson Browne can sing the soundtrack for your life, if you’ll let him.</p>\n",
