  "description": "<p>This is the third of our four-part series on feelings. Today we're learning why we all get angry and what to do with that emotion. We'll get in touch with our inner Super You Person and learn what physical reactions anger can trigger in our bodies. We'll also hear how our listeners describe their anger and talk to NPR reporter Michaeleen Doucleff about the different flavors of anger that people describe around the world. Plus: Mallika Chopra shares another meditation to try when you're feeling mad. For more on meditation and mindfulness, you can check out Mallika Chopra’s book for kids, <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mallika-chopra/just-breathe/9780762491582/\">Just Breathe</a>.
