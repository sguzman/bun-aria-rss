But this time, it’s more brutal and mature than ever. There’s a clear emphasis on visual authenticity, as director Edward Berger has ensured that the writing, directing, and acting has all come from a German language team. The consensus is shared by many; this film finally captures the true essence of Remarque’s anti-war sentiments, putting on display the full capabilities of human barbarism. \nIn a time when propaganda is just as widespread than ever - if not more so - this film has a particularly fresh way to captivate and resonate with the current generation. Its depiction of The Great War is unflinching, and never shies away from an opportunity to present the visceral horrors of one of the most deadly times in our history, when a global conflict managed to take the lives of around 40 million people.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:11 - Paul Bäumer\n2:26 - Matthias Erzberger\n3:05 - Signing of the Armistice\n3:48 - General Friedrichs\n4:40 - November 11th\n5:42 - Uniforms\n6:34 - Trench Warfare\n7:32 - Armored Warfare\n8:36 - Don’t Mess with Farmers\n\nCheck out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant \n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant  \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/ \n\nOur Website:\nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nWritten by: Max Lichtig\nNarrated by: Joey Criscitello YouTube.com/OfficialJoeyC\nEdited by: Joey Criscitello YouTube.com/OfficialJoeyC\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",
