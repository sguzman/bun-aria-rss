  "description": "<p><em>This is the web version of </em><em>Foreign Exchanges</em><em>, but did you know you can get it delivered right to your inbox? Sign up today:</em></p><p>This time around I’m joined by Stephen Wertheim, Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute and a Research Scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. We’re discussing his brand new book, <em>Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy</em>, which is, ironically enough, coming out tomorrow. In contrast to those who argue that America has always been overtly an imperial project and to those who argue that America reluctantly had empire thrust upon it in the 20th century, in the book Stephen argues that the American Empire stems from a conscious choice made by policymakers during World War II.</p><p>You can buy <em>Tomorrow, the World</em> direct from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674248663\">publisher</a> or wherever you get your books, ebooks, and/or audiobooks. You can also get a preview of what’s in the book from Stephen’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/opinion/america-global-power.html?auth=login-email&login=email\">latest piece</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p>Or from, you know, this interview.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
