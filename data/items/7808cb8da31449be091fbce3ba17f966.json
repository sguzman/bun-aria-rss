  "description": "<p>We construct the first secure multiparty quantum computation with public\nverifiable identifiable abort (MPQC-PVIA) protocol, where PVIA security enables\noutside observers with only classical computational power to agree on the\nidentity of a malicious party in case of an abort. Moreover, our MPQC is the\nfirst quantum setting to provide Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) security, which\nattains full security with an honest majority and is secure with abort if the\nmajority is dishonest. At the heart of our construction is a generic\ntransformation called Auditable Quantum Authentication (AQA) that publicly\nidentifies the malicious sender with overwhelming probability. Our approach\ncomes with several advantages over the traditional way of building MPQC\nprotocols. First, instead of following the Clifford code paradigm, our protocol\ncan be based on a variety of authentication codes. Second, the online phase of\nour MPQC requires only classical communications. Third, our construction can\nachieve distributed computation via a carefully crafted protocol design, which\ncan be adjusted to an MPQC that conditionally guarantees output delivery.\n</p>",
