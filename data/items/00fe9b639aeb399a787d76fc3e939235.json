  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WMAL Radio Host Larry OConnor fills in for Mark. Irrespective of your opinion of Steve Bannon, it's a travesty that he was maligned and found guilty of contempt of Congress. This is bigger than any one person, as this is an affront on equal justice under the law and an attack on Americanism more broadly. Can anyone say with a straight face that Bannon faced a fair trial in Washington? Then, the battle to legislate contraception rages on as Democrats move to play politics following the Roe decision. Democrats pretend there is a massive push by states to ban birth control and need to codify it federally, but there is not. Later, coming out of the pandemic, many have realized that it wasn't the virus that stopped our children's education or their employment. It was their local, state, and federal governments that made those bad choices. President Biden and the Democrats will pay the price for the decisions of leftwing politicians this November.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
