Jase meets a woman at an event who's appalled by his clothes. Phil is thrilled by what you can get away with at 75. Jase is irked that there are places on this planet that people aren't allowed to go. Al realizes Phil has Amish tendencies. And the guys respond to a great question about what happened to people who died without having the opportunity to hear about Jesus. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
