Anyone that's followed me for an extended period of time has without a doubt seen me leverage sponsorships and partnerships to grow my business. However, information on how to take advantage of sponsorships is rarely shared by the influencers benefitting the most from them. This is why I'm thrilled to be joined today by my friend Michelle Visser. Michelle is my marketing and product manager. She handles everything for me including cultivating affiliate relationships, finding companies that align with my beliefs, vetting products, and so much more. If you've ever had a desire to grow your online presence or feel stuck with where you're currently at, Michelle and I are here to spill the beans and give you everything you need to know in order to leverage your following, no matter how big or small it might be.</p><ul><li>Save $15 when you snag a reCAP Mason Jars lid kit and put your mason jar collection to work!
