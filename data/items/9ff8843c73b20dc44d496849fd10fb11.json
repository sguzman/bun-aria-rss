  "description": "<p>Let’s get right into this week’s episode: do many straight men utilize sex education, outside of watching mainstream porn, in order to ensure they’re really putting it down?</p>\n<p>In my opinion…no… as both a sex educator and as someone who’s had sex with straight men, I gotta say The ego that I’ve been met with from straight men has been toxic at times and really sad at others.
