  "description": "<p>The previous upload became corrupt, this is the fixed file...</p>\n<p>It's that time of year again to go over the numbers and look at the State of the Cigar Industry. It's one of our favorite shows of the year because it's stuff we as true stogie geeks want to know. \n\nWe'll be joined in studio from Jarrid Trudeau of Kristoff Cigars who was recently named the VP of Sales for the company. In the first half hour of the show we will light up a cigar from the Care Package, the one that doesn't piss off the boss. After smoking the Kristoff Connecticut we will light up the Kristoff Criollo in the second hour....\n\nAlso there is a chance during the Food Authority segment one of us might need a bucket... \n\nAll this and more on the #1 Cigar Podcast on the internet, The Cigar Authority.</p>\n",
