  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Congress abetted by the media continues harassing the administration now threatening to subpoena staffers and former employees under the guise of \"congressional oversight.\" Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings is looking into why Fox News didn't publish a negative story about President Trump during the 2016 election, suggesting that it may have been an in-kind campaign contribution on behalf of the news network. Yet the left claims that the Administration is authoritarian and fascistic while they are the ones that are using Soviet tactics to stifle our free speech and oust a legitimately elected president. Then, the crisis at the border prevails, even though Trump has been fighting tooth and nail to secure the border since 2016 yet the Democrats just don't relent. Committees going after his family and staff is nothing more than the Democrats using our government for opposition research to oust Trump in 2020 or sooner. Later, the innuendos are still flying around regarding security clearances in the Trump White House. The media is lauding Tricia Newbold, an unelected bureaucrat bent on blocking the president’s access to trusted advisers. While people like John Brennan and Hillary Clinton maintained their clearances despite being private citizens. Judge Royce Lamberth commented in a Judicial Watch case that he concludes that Hillary's former Chief Of Staff and attorney, Cheryl Mills, committed perjury and that he considered her untruthful yet she received immunity in Hillary Clinton's email investigation.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
