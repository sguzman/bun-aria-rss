From 64 episodes ago! He’s been on the road with Bert Kreisher; he’s been on Conan, Comedy Central, and Netflix; and he will be on the upcoming hit series (along with Sean) <em>This Joka </em>on Quibi. We have a great conversation, where we discuss Shane’s hatred of <em>The Irishman </em>and how much of a rapscallion he was in his younger years. Here are five words to describe this ep: fire escapes can’t be fat.</p>",
