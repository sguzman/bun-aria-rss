    "media:description": "In this video, we explore the idea of the uniqueness of coefficients in linear combinations, which leads us to the idea of components.  While components can be thought of as lists of numbers, it is vital to distinguish between a vector and its components.  We also explore some of the computational applications that components allow for.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
