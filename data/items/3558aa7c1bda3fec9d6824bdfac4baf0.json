    "media:description": "Find all my publications on my website: https://protesilaos.com\n\n* * *\n\nI hiked and talked philosophy for a bit more than an hour.  I covered a broad set of topics related to the expression \"sorry for being a burden\".  An overview:\n\n* We start feeling like a burden when we are coping with some difficult situation.  We think that others are doing well, while we are not.\n* We do not want to bring others to our misery, so we avoid them.\n* Not wanting to externalise our negativity in this way comes from a good starting point: we consider the wellness of others.\n* An explanation of how this apparent altruism is biased both against us and against the others.  We think we are worthless while they are impeccable.\n* When we think we are a burden, we develop a sense of egocentrism even though we do not want to.  We do it by obsessing about our condition.\n* Our obsession turns into a misplaced sense of exceptionalism as we think we are special in our agony: \"I am special because I am the only one who suffers\".\n* There is a \"transmission mechanism\" by which this ostensible burden can be distributed.  Explanation of how this relates to the communicative aspect of the human condition.\n* We cannot opt out of our humanity.  To be sorry for being human is pointless.  We always communicate.\n* When we communicate with others, we open ourselves to their positivity.  In general, we remove the obstacles that worsen our condition.\n* Explanation of moderation, of finding a middle way between the extremes.\n* More comments on the perversion of self-hatred that masquerades as altruism.\n* Practical ways to gradually escape from the overthinking loop.  We break the cycle by acting.  Also comment on one's physical condition and how idle energy is contributing to the problem.\n* We live in a world where we forget to be human sometimes and are absorbed in our little bubble---practical step to avoid that.\n* Example with how we do not control how others perceive our messages and why we should not blame our self or them.\n* Don't judge and be patient.",
