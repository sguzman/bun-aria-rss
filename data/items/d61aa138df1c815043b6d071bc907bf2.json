  "description": "<p>James Comey’s “Saving Justice,” arrives three years after his first book, “A Higher Loyalty.” Joe Klein <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/books/review/james-comey-saving-justice.html\" target=\"_blank\">reviews it for us</a>, and visits the podcast this week to discuss, among other subjects, how the new book is different from the first.</p><p>“It doesn’t differ very much at all, actually,” Klein says, “except for one thing: He rehearses all of the confrontations he had with Donald Trump in both books, but in the second book he places that in the context of the need for truth and transparency in government, which I think is a valuable thing. The book is a repetition of the first book, but it’s not an insignificant repetition because of the context that he’s now placed it in.”</p><p>Elisabeth Egan, an editor at the Book Review, is on the podcast to discuss the latest selection for our monthly column Group Text: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/books/05Group-Text-Peter-Ho-Davies.html\" target=\"_blank\">“A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself,”</a> by Peter Ho Davies.</p><p>“What I found especially compelling about this book in this moment, when we’re all still kind of confined to our houses,” Egan says, “is that it was very reassuring to read about parental worry in a moment when we’re all flying blind. But you have this worry with a lot of funny lines and funny observations about parenthood.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed.
