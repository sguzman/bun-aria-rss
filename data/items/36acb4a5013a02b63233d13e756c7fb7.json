  "description": "On the Spoiler Special podcast, Slate critics discuss movies, the occasional TV show, and, once in a blue moon, another podcast, in full spoiler-filled detail. This week, Dana Stevens, Jeffrey Bloomer and Heather Schwedel discuss Uncut Gems. \nHoward Ratner (Adam Sandler), owner of a small jewelry store in Manhattan, racked up a gambling debt while the rest of his life is collapsing. He’s trying to avoid creditors when his shop receives an illegal gem from Ethiopia. This rock, Ratner thinks, is his ticket out of debt. He temporarily trades Kevin Garnett, of the Boston Celtics, the rock for Garnett’s NBA Championship. Ratner pawns the ring to bet on the championship game. Will The Celtics win? Will Garnett get his ring back? Will Ratner finally get out of debt?  \n\nYou can read Dana Stevens’ review here. \n\nYou can also check out past Spoiler Specials, and you can subscribe to the podcast on Apple Podcasts. Note: As the title indicates, spoilers galore.\n\nEmail us at spoilers@slate.com.\n\nPodcast Production by Rosemary Belson. \n\nHosts\nDana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic.\nJeffrey Bloomer is a Slate senior editor. He edits and writes for the human interest and culture sections.\nHeather Schwedel is a Slate staff writer.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
