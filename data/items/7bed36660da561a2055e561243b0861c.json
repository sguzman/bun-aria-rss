Double Olympic Champion Jade Jones finally added a World gold to her list of achievements, but Bianca Walkden's triumph was marred by booing as she won gold in controversial circumstances. We debate booing at a sporting event.</p><br><p>UK Sport has been backing Mental Health Awareness Week and we discuss how sport at an elite level needs to find a balance between medal success and athlete welfare.
