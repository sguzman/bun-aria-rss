  "description": "As we near the end of 2021, investment banks are making predictions for 2022… and they’re calling for volatility. Paying attention to these predictions can give you a massive edge in the markets. [0:30] Now, we all know consensus predictions aren’t always accurate—take the early forecasts on COVID, for instance. You’ve got to be willing to question the “status quo”... and invest accordingly. [2:00] I list several companies poised to continue growing regardless of volatility in 2022. [5:00] Speaking of predictions, I share my expectations for interest rate hikes next year… and why investors should prepare for some large pullbacks in the market. [8:15] Another factor adding to the uncertainty for next year: inflation. I break down why Genia Turanova’s  strategy is my favorite way to hedge against downside risk… while still profiting from market momentum. [18:10] Turning to questions… a listener wants to know how we plan to keep investors updated once our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token begins trading on tZERO. I share why I’m strongly committed to transparency… and the steps we’re taking to ensure we always remain that way. [21:40] Finally, what are my favorite sectors for 2022? I highlight more of my favorite ways to position for next year... including the sectors where I’m seeing enormous momentum and innovation. [24:22] Enjoyed this episode?
