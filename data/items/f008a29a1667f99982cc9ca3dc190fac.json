  "description": "<p>Part two of David Johansen&rsquo;s <em>Your Hometown </em>episode is the portrait of an artist in the process of becoming. If Staten Island was the setting of David&rsquo;s coming of age, Manhattan would him into his next act. Hear David talk with host <strong>Kevin Burke</strong> about living in the East Village, the early days of the New York Dolls, the birth of Buster Poindexter, and performing at the Caf&eacute; Carlyle. David&rsquo;s hometown journey is an invitation to dive into what it means to be an artist and to find what in their origins stories is knowable and what remains enigmatic &ndash; even to them &ndash; as they continue looking around the corner, following their instincts and their muses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Your Hometown </em>is a show where the local is the epic.
