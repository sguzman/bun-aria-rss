  "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles have a new starting quarterback...For now. On this episode Will Brinson is joined by Brady Quinn to break down Philly's decision to bench Carson Wentz and elevate Jalen Hurts. Is Wentz broken for good or will be just be a temporary break to both physically and (more so) mentally recover from a difficult 2020 season? The guys analyze the move from all angles. Then, they discuss Alex Smith after he led the Washington Football Team to a stunning victory over the Steelers on Monday. Should they just rename the Comeback Player of the Year award after him? Elsewhere, Gregg Williams is out as defensive coordinator in New York after a disastrous (but also beneficial in the long term) Jets loss on Sunday.
