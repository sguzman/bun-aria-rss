  "description": "<p>More of us need to be considering dropping a car from our lives - especially as so many of us are now working from home indefinitely! Are we even using those vehicles?! But even if you are going in to work everyday, it’s time to question whether or not it makes sense to continue paying nearly $800 in order to own and maintain that vehicle. Transportation costs are typically the 2nd largest expense we have every single month so getting rid of a car can have a massive effect on your monthly expenses. On top of the positive financial ramifications, there are other awesome side effects too. We’ll dive into all of those benefits as well as how you can go about owning one less car in this episode.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Ourison by Tired Hands Brewing! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
