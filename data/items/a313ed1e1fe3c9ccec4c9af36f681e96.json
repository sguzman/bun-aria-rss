  "description": "<p>It's been a year since the bodies of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were found outside their home. No one has been charged in their murder yet, but there is legal movement in another death, linked to the Murdaugh household. Gloria Satterfield, who was Murdaugh's housekeeper for close to 20 years, died after falling downstairs.</p>\n<p>Maggie and Paul Murdaugh called 911 at the time, reporting that Satterfield was bleeding from her head and left ear.&nbsp; Satterfield died days later at a hospital. Satterfield's cause of death is listed as \"natural\" on her death certificate. No SLED investigators have asked that Satterfield's body be exhumed and autopsied.</p>\n<p>Satterfield's family sued the Murdaughs at Alex Murdaugh's direction and were awarded millions. Murdaugh instead kept the money for his own use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skip Hoagland - Founder, SCWatchdog.com &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Susan E.
