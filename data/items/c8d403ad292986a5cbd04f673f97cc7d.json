  "description": "<p>We made it! Yes my friends, we've made it to the end of another season, and what a season it has been. Throughout the past couple months, I've been discussing how to opt out of many of the systems that govern modern life. While I've enjoyed creating a new style of content and discussing new topics I've never talked about before, it has come with a fair share of criticism. In today's episode, I discuss some of the valid criticism I received over this season, why I object to \"Groupthink\", and why it's important to have disagreements and healthy discussion with people who don't share your point of view. In addition, find out why I think some systems aren't only valuable but essential for society to function. As always, thanks for joining me on the Old Fashioned on Purpose podcast. Enjoy your holiday season, and I look forward to what's coming in the new year!</p><p>This episode is proudly sponsored by Genuine Beef Co.
