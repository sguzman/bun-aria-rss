As he read, he began to take voracious notes, and write down quotes he connected with. Around the same time, he&nbsp;discovered Instagram. So, he began sharing bite-sized wisdom distilled from his favorite books on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thinkgrowprosper/\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkGrowProsp</a><a href=\"http://thinkgrowprosper.org/\" target=\"_blank\">er</a>&nbsp;Instagram account.</p><p>People took notice and a community began to form. That community has now grown to more than two million people around the world, and allowed Ruben to build a business and his career around his passion for learning and sharing wisdom, and work with everyone from authors to large brands along the way.</p><p>We cover a lot of ground in this conversation as Ruben shares his backstory, his deeper motivation for growth, the steps leading to the&nbsp;popularity&nbsp;of his account, and&nbsp;the opportunities and lessons that came&nbsp;with it. We discuss the reluctance many of us feel when sharing our imperfect, in-progress work with the world&nbsp;-- a fear that&nbsp;Ruben debunks by trusting in the compassion and encouragement of community.</p><p>Ruben also touches on the importance of&nbsp;considering your desired lifestyle when weighing career opportunities. In his experience, one can live an equally fulfilling life with less than you might think -- and sometimes, even more so.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in This Episode:</strong></p><ul><li>Connect with Ruben: <a href=\"http://ThinkGrowProsper.org\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkGrowProsper</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://instagram.com/thinkgrowprosper\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://www.motivationmafia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MotivationMafia</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H4J1KPY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Think and Grow Rich</em></a> by Napoleon Hill</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>by Austin Kleon</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Win Friends & Influence People</em></a> by Dale Carnegie</li><li><a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Ferriss</a> - Solopreneur</li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
