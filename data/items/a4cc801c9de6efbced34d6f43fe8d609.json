    "media:description": "This is not a good summation of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is what happens when you stay up reading about it while imbibing moderate-to-inadvisable amounts of beer. (I’m sure Nia and Soren were fine in the end. (More stuff below.))\n\n For a considerably better summation of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics: https://youtu.be/kxvQ3Wyw2M4 \n\nBooks what I wrote, yo ► https://tinyurl.com/ycnl5bo3 \nDiscord server ► https://discord.gg/76ybBSR (just in case that doesn’t work) discord.gg/exurb1a)\nThe Fifth Science Paperback ► https://tinyurl.com/y5zj33s5 (you may need to change your region accordingly: .co.uk, etc) \nT-shirts, mugs, and sadness ► https://teespring.com/stores/exurb1a \nI also make horrendous music ► https://soundcloud.com/exurbia-1 \nFor sending personalised insults ► https://www.facebook.com/exurb1a/ \nHelp me to do this full-time if you're deranged enough ► https://www.patreon.com/exurb1r?ty=h \n\nThe music used ► Karma – Patrick Mottram https://youtu.be/EbvOWk2on5M \n\nA little note about where I’ve been: I’m not dead, unless you mean spiritually. I’m trying my hardest to finish the new book and it takes up most of my time and allotted crying episodes. I’ll do my best to return to something bordering on a ‘normal’ upload schedule when it’s finally finished and out, promise. Hope you’re doing well :)",
