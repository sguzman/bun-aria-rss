  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents I've Seen Dead People: Diary of a Deputy Coroner with guest Donna Francart<br>\n<br>\nDave & Tim open the case files of a former Deputy Coroner, Donna Francart to reveal the tragic nature of her work, her coping mechanisms and  what she learned from the living that had committed crimes and the dead who insisted their stories be heard.<br>\n<br>\nFor nearly nine years, Francart was a deputy coroner who worked medicolegal death investigations, which are those involving suspicious, violent, unexplained or unexpected deaths. Lacking access to structured debriefings, Francart turned to journaling as a way of privately unpacking the profound grief she faced and preserving her own mental well-being. As she did, she found herself in a conundrum of perplexing relationships with both the living and the dead. <br>\nWith her new book, <em>I've Seen Dead People</em>, she shares her unfiltered thoughts and emotions as she navigates a world most of us cannot imagine — a world Francart was drawn to out of a genuine desire to help others during their darkest hours. <br>\n<em></em></p>\n\n<p><em>I</em><em>'ve Seen Dead People</em> also chronicles everyday moments, as Francart tried to provide as normal an upbringing as possible for her two sons. Along the way, they all learned to share their space with the many spirits that Francart encountered, and to embrace the beauty of life.</p>\n\n<p>Get her book here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/2Q3dMpB&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2TQN02EPBjOMMwQ6fiWzfW\">https://amzn.to/2Q3dMpB</a> </p>\n",
