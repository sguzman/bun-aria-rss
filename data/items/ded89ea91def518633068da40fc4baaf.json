  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Russia did interfere with the 2016 election under the Obama administration, so why is President Trump taking more heat than Obama? The left is attacking Trump for not confronting Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, but was fine with Obama knowing about Russian interference and not doing anything about it. Trump is a victim of Russian interference, yet he is the target of a special counsel for collusion when the Obama administration should be investigated. President Trump has been tougher on Russia than Obama, Clinton, or either Bush yet he’s called weak by the media for not attacking Putin – is this a joke? Also, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called Israel the occupier of Palestine, only to later admit she knows nothing about the issue. This is the new face of the Democrat party according to Tom Perez. Later, Shelby Steele joined Mark on Live, Liberty, and Levin to discuss racial tension in America.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
