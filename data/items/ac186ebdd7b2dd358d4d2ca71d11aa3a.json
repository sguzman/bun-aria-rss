  "description": "There is no argument that John Elway is the leader in the clubhouse for NFL players who wore No. 7. Even though there is a half-hearted argument given to Ben Roethlisberger. But is the jersey No. 7 the greatest sports number ever? The gang discusses that and Dave gives his view on who wore No. 7 the best -- Mickey Mantle or Elway.\nThe gang also gets into the business of which Los Angeles Rams jersey is the best of all-time, based off Adam Rank's Pick Six.\nYou might want to sit down for this news -- our own Necktie Milner got us a guest! And a damn good one, if I don't mind saying so -- Jason La Canfora.   Great guest, Dylan.\nIn other words, this was not only a pure delight, but just the first-part of a special edition of the Dave Dameshek Football Program.\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
