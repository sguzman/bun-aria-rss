  "description": "My amazing and talented wife Lisa is releasing her new book Radical Confidence, which you can preorder - and get the bonuses she’s created for you - at <a href=\"https://www.radicalconfidence.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.radicalconfidence.com</a>. When you read this book, Lisa will teach you 10 No-BS Life Lessons to become the hero of your own life and take MASSIVE bold action to achieve your potential!<br /><br />Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist who continues educating audiences about brain development, brain plasticity and the inner workings of dopamine. He’s showing people how to hack their behaviors and rewire their thinking for optimal performance and outcomes.<br /><br />Consider this episode a masterclass on all things dopamine. Dr. Huberman takes the complication out of neuroscience and simplifies how dopamine is tied to motivation, craving, and even perception of time. One of the many takeaways in the episode is that idea that small incremental steps towards a bigger outcome and purpose is worth celebrating if you want to get the benefit of dopamine rewards. Dopamine isn’t necessarily about huge wins and achieving big goals. It’s about the pursuit and craving of those goals. It’s about enjoying the journey and not just focusing on the destination or result. The information Dr. Huberman is unpacking here is going to be significant to anyone in pursuit of a highly successful and meaningful life.<br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Andrew Huberman<br />0:28 | Spike Dopamine for Motivation<br />25:09 | Break Addiction to Negative Thoughts <br />44:06 | Master Focus, Reduce Overindulging<br />1:10:46 | Pursue Challenge, Reward Small Wins <br />1:36:37 | The Power of Dopamine<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“Celebrating the win more than the pursuit, it actually sets you up for failure in the future.” [1:48]<br /><br />“Dopamine itself is not the reward, it's the build up to the reward. And the reward has more of a kind of opioid bliss like property” [15:41]<br /><br />“Pursue rewards, but understand that the pursuit is actually the reward. If you want to have repeated wins.” [16:13]<br /><br />“Pleasure experienced without prior requirements for pursuit is terrible for us.” [17:22]<br /><br />“Agitation and stress were designed to get us up and move us, and when we try and fight that too much, and we try and quiet that stress, that actually can be problematic.” [37:11]<br /><br />“If you have negative thoughts, just remember, I can also introduce positive thoughts the same way I can control running around the block. Positive thoughts are the equivalent of forward physical action.” [42:16]<br /><br />“All the segments of your life are noted by peaks in dopamine, or the way that you happen to conceptualize dopamine.” [45:33]<br /><br />“When people's dopamine is low, they tend to overestimate, okay, okay. And when people's dopamine is high, they tend to underestimate time.” [47:47]<br /><br />“Dopamine is a very misunderstood molecule, it's often talked about only in the context of reward, [...] what's often not discussed is that dopamine is secreted in route to rewards...” [1:22:25]<br /><br />“The molecule dopamine when secreted in the brain, makes us pursue things, build things, create things, makes us want new things that we don't currently already have.” [1:42:45]<br /><br />Follow Andrew Huberman:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hubermanlab.com/</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/andrewhubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/andrewhubermanlab</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/</a> <br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a> <br />Podcast: <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hubermanlab.com/</a>",
