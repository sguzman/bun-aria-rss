  "description": "<p>This is going to be a fun one! We’ve spent a lot of time on some in-depth leadership discussions over the last 11 episodes. So, we decided we would use Episode 12 to have a fun discussion about the best advice John, Mark, and Richard have ever received.</p> <p>John shares some of the best advice he’s gotten over the years from reading, asking questions, observing, and through his personal relationships. He also shares the best advice he’s received from teachers and influencers who have shaped his leadership, career, and character.</p> <p>Mark and Richard take the opportunity to discuss not only the best advice, but also the worst advice they’ve ever received. Let’s just say...there are a couple “don’t try this at home” moments.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is The Best Advice Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes for you to complete throughout John’s teaching.
