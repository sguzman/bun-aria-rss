  "description": "<p>Clay is \"stunned\" because Buck fills out his first March Madness bracket. NBA’s Kyrie Irving is eligible to watch the game as a fan, but not play under NYC covid rules. Does anyone really think Irving is less \"dangerous\" courtside than playing, Buck asks. Pfizer CEO says a fourth booster shot is necessary. C&B note that the vaccines have not done what vaccines have always done. Janet Yellen says more months of high inflation through end of year. Buck reminds that, for many, this equals a \"month of wages lost to inflation.\" C&B incredulous: Nancy Pelosi: \"The government spending is doing the exact reverse, reducing the national debt. It is not inflationary.\" The View says any commenting on the uncomfortable laughter of Kamala Harris is racist and sexist and that what Tucker Carlson says -- that Russia is promoting -- should be investigated by the government!  </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
