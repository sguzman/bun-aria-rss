Some days it feels like justice and accountability are gaining ground and the outcome of this turning point may be a good one. On other days, the threats to our democracy grow and the very real possibility of a turn to authoritarianism in the US looms. There are echoes of this moment throughout our history. We turn to Boston College history professor and noted commentator Heather Cox Richardson to discuss recent developments and long-term historical perspectives. Ryan Goodman of NYU Law School and Just Security and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and formerly of the Obama White House lead the questioning and offer key comments of their own. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
