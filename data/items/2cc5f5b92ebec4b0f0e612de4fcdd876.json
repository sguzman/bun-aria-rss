  "title": "264 - Race, Abortion & Evangelicals - with Phil Vischer",
  "description": "Race, Abortion & Evangelicals. Today we’re diverging from the Sermon on The Mount, to talk about the history of segregation and race relations in America. We’re joined by friend Phil Vischer from our cousin podcast, The Holy Post. Phil recently released a pair of videos on race that went viral and stirred up conversation. What is the history of segregation in the U.S.? What about within the church? What responsibility do we have today for the sins of yesterday? When did abortion become the singular issue the church rallies behind? How can we listen to one another first, before engaging in a posture of angry disagreement? We discuss being Christians with different life experiences coming to radically different conclusions on how each of us should vote and become active. \n\nYou can see Phil’s video here: https://youtu.be/AGUwcs9qJXY\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
