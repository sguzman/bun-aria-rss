  "description": "<div>Sam's guest in this week's Book Club podcast is the historian Anna Keay. In her new book <em>The Restless Republic: Britain Without A Crown</em> she describes the short but traumatic period between the execution of Charles I and the restoration of the monarchy. She tells Sam about the religious turmoil, the explosion of the newspaper industry, the sympathetic side of Oliver Cromwell... and parallels with our own age of constitutional upheaval and viral propaganda.</div>\n",
