That is the new feminism for the left.\" Clay says it means many women will not compete. The story rocking the chess world. Christine Drazan, GOP candidate for governor of Oregon, joins Clay and Buck to talk about how she can win in a deep blue state because Oregonians are fed up with insane liberal policies. We're in a recession and it's just getting started.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
