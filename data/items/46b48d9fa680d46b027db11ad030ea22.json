  "description": "<p>What is the best approach for treating and preventing Alzheimer’s Disease?</p> <p>After my traumatic brain injury, my grandmother became my primary caregiver because my parents had to work multiple jobs. From a young age, I watched her struggle with Alzheimer’s, and I saw firsthand how devastating this disease is. It’s why I’m so passionate about brain health and work with leading experts in their mission to understand, treat, and prevent Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases.</p> <p>To talk more about this very important topic, I’m delighted to have Dr. David Perlmutter back on our show today. Dr. Perlmutter is an MD board-certified neurologist and five-time New York Times best-selling author, including his latest, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Drop Acid: The Surprising New Science of Uric Acid—The Key to Losing Weight, Controlling Blood Sugar, and Achieving Extraordinary Health</em>.</p> <p>When you lose your memory, it can feel like you’re losing a part of yourself. But instead of feeling helpless, I want you to feel empowered to make small changes that can have a long-term impact on your brain and body health. Listen in, as Dr. Perlmutter talks about understanding the role uric acid and inflammation plays in your body and how that impacts the progression of diseases like Alzheimer’s.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
