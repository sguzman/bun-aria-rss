  "description": "In late November of 1991, a college student from Virginia was visiting home for Thanksgiving when he decided to meet with some old friends for a night out. The next day, his parents returned home to find their son dead. At first glance his death appeared to be a suicide and police labeled it open and shut. But then, more details started to emerge, like a car chase through a neighborhood, unreported injuries, and more, turning this case into an Unsolved Mystery. This is the story of Tommy Burkett.\n\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
