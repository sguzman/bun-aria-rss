In the years that followed Chris has been a proponent of gun control in a state that is reluctant to change its gun laws. In the wake of the mass shooting at Virginia Beach on May 31, Virginia’s democratic governor called for a special legislative session to consider new gun laws in the state, but will the Republican Legislature rise to the occasion? \nGuest: Chris Hurst, delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates for the state's 12th District.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
