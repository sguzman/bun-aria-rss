  "description": "<p>Things get a little hot and heavy on this week's episode dedicated to Philip Roth's 1969 novel&nbsp;Portnoy's Complaint. We do, however, start off with some reactions to our Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;episode before diving headlong into the mishmash of sex, psychoanalysis, and American Jewish life that is Portnoy and his titular complaint.</p><p>Caveat Lector: This book necessitated discussing some rather graphic subject matter, so we decided to slap the \"Explicit\" tag on the episode. Not only did this mean talking about a few choice scenes in detail, it also means we're a bit freer with language than we are on a regular basis. Don't say we didn't warn you!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
