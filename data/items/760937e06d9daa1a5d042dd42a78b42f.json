  "description": "<p>A few days after Hae’s body is found, the detectives get a lead that opens the case up for them. They find Jay at work late one night and bring him down to Homicide. At first, he insists he doesn’t know anything about the murder. But eventually he comes clean. He tells them what happened on January 13th. A few weeks later, he’s back at Homicide and his story has changed. In some ways, these changes are small and understandable. In other ways, they’re big and confounding.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Zwr-2iNgrXk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",
