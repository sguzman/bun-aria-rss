  "description": "<p>Motion prediction is crucial in enabling safe motion planning for autonomous\nvehicles in interactive scenarios. It allows the planner to identify potential\nconflicts with other traffic agents and generate safe plans. Existing motion\npredictors often focus on reducing prediction errors, yet it remains an open\nquestion on how well they help identify the conflicts for the planner. In this\npaper, we evaluate state-of-the-art predictors through novel conflict-related\nmetrics, such as the success rate of identifying conflicts. Surprisingly, the\npredictors suffer from a low success rate and thus lead to a large percentage\nof collisions when we test the prediction-planning system in an interactive\nsimulator. To fill the gap, we propose a simple but effective alternative that\ncombines a physics-based trajectory generator and a learning-based relation\npredictor to identify conflicts and infer conflict relations. We demonstrate\nthat our predictor, P4P, achieves superior performance over existing\nlearning-based predictors in realistic interactive driving scenarios from Waymo\nOpen Motion Dataset.\n</p>",
