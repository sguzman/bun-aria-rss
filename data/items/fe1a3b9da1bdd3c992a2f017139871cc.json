  "title": "BONUS 12 - The Zodiac Killer",
  "description": "<p>Who killed five people for sure and possibly many more in central California in late 1968 and 1969 and then taunted the entire Bay Area with letters sent in to the press revealing details of the crimes only the killer and the police would know? Who sent in threats of more violence and strange cyphers that if decoded would allegedly reveal his identity? Someone killed again and again and again, all the while daring the police to discover his identity. And they got away with it. Who is the Zodiac killer? Will we ever know? Today, I present the details of the five murders we know he committed, details of a few other crimes he may have committed, examine the letters and cyphers he sent in to the Bay Area press, and look at the most likely suspects. And then I make my guess. And, once you have the information, you can make yours. Murders, mystery, and a city that lived in fear - all that and more on today’s taunting, threatening, and terrible Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Get tickets to the Feb. 16th Detroit show NOW so we can get many more live Timesuck podcasts going in 2018! Come see me and the guys from Small Town Murder and Crime in Sports. If enough tickets are bought in the next few weeks, a live podcast will be added and more live podcasts dates will appear. <a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/event/dan-cummins-james-pietragallo-the-magic-bag-tickets/7823825?pl=magicbag\">CLICK HERE</a> for tickets to the 7:30 show at the Magic Bag.</p>\n<p>Timesucker Mike Jerningan needs your help.
