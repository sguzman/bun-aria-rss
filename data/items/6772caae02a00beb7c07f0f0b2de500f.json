  "description": "<p>Huge sums of money—more than $2.6bn—have been spent on Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art over the past two weeks in New York. On today’s podcast, Nicholas Maclean (of London and New York dealership Eykyn Maclean) and Allan Schwartzman (co-founder of AAP), discuss with our host Charlotte Burns (editor of <em>In Other Words)</em>, what happened: what the surprises were; what trends we can detect; and what's going to happen next. </p> <p>Here are some choice soundbites:</p> <p><em>\"It is a sign that the market is starved for broadening what it sees as valuable. This is a big triumph; this is a turning point in perception” — Allan Schwartzman </em></p> <p><em>\"I honestly thought that this could be the death knell for the Impressionist market. And then we saw it: that change between 2005 and 2008 was extraordinary” — Nicholas Maclean</em></p> <p><em>\"This question of identities seems to me to be a very American one. I think Americans, and perhaps the American market, are more open to approaching their own identities” — Charlotte Burns</em></p> <p><em>\"True collectors who will just look across the board and look at artists that tell the whole story are becoming rarer” — Nicholas Maclean</em></p> <p>For this and more, tune in today.</p> <p>Transcript link:</p> <p><a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-auction-analysis/\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-auction-analysis/&source=gmail&ust=1527182960876000&usg=AFQjCNEUDgMbSW82gFbp46QfnZR1ia0uFw\"> http://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-auction-analysis/</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
