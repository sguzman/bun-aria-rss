  "title": "Mormon Swingers, Real Housewife Drama, and Todd Chrisley’s Daughter",
  "description": "I went to Jeff Lewis’ party and it was a Bravo star-studded event. The Seafood Tower was not the only drama Peter and I encountered there. Todd Chrisley’s once estranged daughter takes the stand for his defense. Lisa Rinna did more than dance alone in her room this weekend. She pissed off the wrong guy on Instagram and it’s juicy. RHOBH’s Erika Jayne has a new personality. Johnny vs. Amber gave their closing arguments and Johnny’s infamous text has become a reality for Amber. Bravo is getting resistance about their Real Housewives of Dubai premiere and we solved a housewife mystery. Are Mormon TikTokers soft swapping or is it just a lie to gain followers? \n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
