  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Disney's current President and former CEO are making a renewed push to indoctrinate little children with the radical sexual agenda of the rights of adults and their genitalia. Sadly, other organizations that orbit children, like the teacher's union, have signed to help brainwash kids and diminish parental rights. Americans have a choice of whether they will let their young children be manipulated and must choose wisely. Then, if you're wondering why God and prayer have been pushed out of classrooms and why gender has been thrust in? It's because the Marxist left is perverting our children. These people are the saboteurs of America. These are the people destroying the family, destroying faith, and destroying Americanism. Later, President Lincoln did more for Black Americans than Nikole Hannah-Jones ever will yet she still calls America a racist nation. Lincoln died for being against slavery. Yet the media will say that making newly-confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson is an act of verbal racism. Afterward, singer John Ondrasik from the band \"Five for Fighting\" calls in to discuss his song\" Can one man save the world?\" which they've dedicated to the people suffering in Ukraine. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
