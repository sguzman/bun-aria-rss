[35:43] QUOTES: “But if you ask a human being to share with you the moments in life that they're most grateful for, all of those moments often deal with inner states. It's falling in love, it's carrying your first child in your arm. It's the joy of accomplishing your first big win. And all of these, all of these are states of happiness, states of joy, states of human connectivity.” [4:04] “When you get a clear vision of the business you want to create, of the lifestyle you want to create, you move towards that faster.” [19:03] “One of the biggest ways we transform is when we connect with others. And we have shared meanings when we support each other. When you share your vision of the world and I share mine or when we challenge each other's ideas, but it all comes by bringing people together.” [22:58] FOLLOW VISHEN LAKHIANI: WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2nWmjGZ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2nWmjGZ</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OHLRJZ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2OHLRJZ</a> TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2okogAa\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2okogAa</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PLEZI1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PLEZI1</a> PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Ray Kurzweil - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1hro1XM\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1hro1XM</a> [5:04] Michael Singer - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yTHLnt\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2yTHLnt</a> [17:21] Ed Diener - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2S6S2p6\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2S6S2p6</a> [23:28] Lisa Nichols - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/29Q4cRC\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/29Q4cRC</a> [26:41] BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: The Code of the Extraordinary Mind - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rIcjV9\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2rIcjV9</a> [2:06] Altered Traits - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2j8ogmp\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2j8ogmp</a> [8:10] The Surrender Experiment - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2xy9b3b\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2xy9b3b</a> [17:22] COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Mindvalley - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OCb1tr\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2OCb1tr</a> [0:42] Mindvalley U - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2PfK1Qa\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2PfK1Qa</a> [0:53] Omvana - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1Iidw4C\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/1Iidw4C</a> [1:13] Dormio - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2oQN0l7\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2oQN0l7</a> [1:20] Mindvalley Quest - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2R4KZMf\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2R4KZMf</a> [1:24] XPRIZE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2E8aOWy\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2E8aOWy</a> [1:50] STUDIES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: Superbrain - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ypQxKs\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2ypQxKs</a> [28:16]",
