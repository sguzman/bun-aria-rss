  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life Podcast we have our final installment of the series on C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/2FDBwf3\">Til We Have Faces.</a></em> This week, our hosts finish up with Part 2, Chapters 1-4. Opening the conversation, Angelina shares some of her feelings on just having finished the book. She points out the importance of understanding the Cupid and Psyche myth. Cindy brings up the concept of a “sin-eater” in relation to Orual’s taking on of Psyche’s trials.</p> <p>They talk about the ways in which Orual begins to see more clearly and remember things differently at this point in the story. The theme of selfish love versus self-sacrificing love comes full circle as the book closes. Orual’s symbolic death and rebirth are key topics, and the allusions to Christ and the Gospel throughout this story are truly exciting.</p> <p>Join us next week for a special interview with Wendi Capehart on her literary life!</p> <h3>Listen to The Literary Life:</h3> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>I can’t say I learned nothing, at St. Charles Borromeo.

Lewis from “Autumn Journal” <p><em>by Louis Macneice</em></p> <p>In a week I return to work, lecturing, coaching, As impresario of the Ancient Greeks Who wore the chiton and lived on fish and olives And talked philosophy or smut in cliques; Who believed in youth and did not gloze the unpleasant Consequences of age; What is life, one said, or what is pleasant Once you have turned the page Of love? The days grow worse, the dice are loaded Against the living man who pays in tears for breath; Never to be born was the best, call no man happy This side death. Conscious – long before Engels – of necessity And therein free They plotted out their life with truism and humour Between the jealous heaven and the callous sea. And Pindar sang the garland of wild olive And Alcibiades lived from hand to mouth Double-crossing Athens, Persia, Sparta, And many died in the city of plague, and many of drouth In Sicilian quarries, and many by the spear and arrow And many more who told their lies too late Caught in the eternal factions and reactions Of the city state. And free speech shivered on the pikes of Macedonia And later on the swords of Rome And Athens became a mere university city, And the goddess born of the foam Became the kept hetaera, heroine of Menander, And the philosopher narrowed his focus, confined His efforts to putting his own soul in order And keeping a quiet mind. And for a thousand years they went on talking, Making such apt remarks, A race no longer of heroes but of professors And crooked business men and secretaries and clerks Who turned out dapper little elegiac verses On the ironies of fate, the transience of all Affections, carefully shunning the over-statement But working the dying fall.</p> Book List: <p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jtwxfv\">Hallelujah</a></em> by Cindy Rollins</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Hu9VgE\">Giving Up the Ghost: A Memoire</a></em> by Hilary Mantel</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dfat61\">The Dyer’s Hand</a></em> by W.
