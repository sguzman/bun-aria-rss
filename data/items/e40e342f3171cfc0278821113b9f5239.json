  "description": "The most charitable interpretation of the events surrounding the Russian bounty scandal is that we have suffered a catastrophic breakdown in our policy processes. But the scandal likely reveals other, even larger, internal crises--a government wide set of leadership failures from COVID to the economy to social unrest to this national security scandal and, of course, the President's pattern of putting Russia before America in his thoughts and as the prime beneficiary of his actions. We discuss this extraordinarily disturbing series of events with former Trump Special Envoy and advisor to President's Obama, Bush and Clinton, Brett McGurk, former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe Mark Hertling and Vice President for the Third Way's National Security Program Mieke Eoyang. Join co-hosts Ryan Goodman of Just Security and David Rothkopf for this special episode. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
