  "description": "<p>Adrienne Iapalucci came over to my hotel room in Spokane and we sat and talked about dogs for almost 2 hours. She's been a long time dog freak and so have I. And I just recently got my first dog ever so now I can finally join in the conversation from the point of view of an owner. Adrienne is hilarious and you gotta watch her Netflix set on season 2 of The Degenerates. She's also been opening for me for the last year or two so if you've ever wanted to know who that Dark Queen was that went on before me, now you know. </p>",
