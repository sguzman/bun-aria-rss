  "description": "As neurotics on the Left and even on the Right suffer a nervous breakdown and hoard warehouses full of toilet paper, the Trump administration implements policies that will actually help stop the spread of the Wubonic plague. We will examine why hysterics don’t help during a pandemic. Then, Joe Biden confuses every major disease of the past decade while duking it out with Bernie Sanders, Ronald Reagan’s son proselytizes for atheism during the debate, and the Left takes advantage of the global panic.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
