It’s really important that your score is in a healthy range as it impacts loan terms, insurance rates, and even job offers. Luckily we all have free access to our credit scores, credit reports, and the steps we need to take to ensure that our credit score is in great shape. We’re sharing that information with you in this episode. Depending on your history, it could be a long road of rebuilding your credit, but boosting your score can help in more ways than you may even realize!</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Whitewall Wheat by Crank Arm Brewing- a big thanks to Cody in NC for donating this one to the show!
