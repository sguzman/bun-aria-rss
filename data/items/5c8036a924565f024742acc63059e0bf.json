(And Wikileaks says it plans to release more election-related documents, before the US elections.)  GovRAT 2.0 is out in the wild. Congress reports out its investigation of the OPM hack, and we get insider perspective from Cylance's Malcolm Harkins.  Intel sells its security unit (which will go back to its old McAfee name).
