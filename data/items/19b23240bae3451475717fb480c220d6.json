Today on the show, Emily talks to Ambreen Tariq about her new book and her social media initiative, BrownPeopleCamping. For Tariq, both efforts are a part of a common vision — to increase diversity in the outdoors and challenge definitions of what it means to belong in nature. <br/><br/><em>This conversation is part of NPR's collaboration with the </em><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/events/2021-national-book-festival/\"><em>Library of Congress National Book Festival</em></a><em>.  <br/></em><br/>You can email us at <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>.
