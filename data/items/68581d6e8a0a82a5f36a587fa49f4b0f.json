  "description": "<p>Turning Point. What a legendary band and I had the chance to speak to Jay Laughlin, who played guitar in the band as well as Godspeed (highly overlooked post-Turning Point emo band) and his current band, Honey (a rad metal band). We discuss how he views his musical legacy, how much it cost them to record \"It's Always Darkest Before the Dawn\" and being creative at all costs. Jay is a lifer and I am sure glad he's put out all of the music he has.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
