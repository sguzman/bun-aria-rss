This botnet causes huge damage by spreading ransomware and info stealers to its infected systems. Recently, a rise in the number of Emotet infections was observed in France, Japan, and New Zealand. The high number of infections shows the effectiveness of the Emotet malware at staying undetected.\nShimon joins us to discuss how Deep Instinct investigated the payload that was encrypted inside the loader, analyzes the next steps in the infection process, and discovers the techniques used to make this malware difficult to analyze.\nThe original blog post and updated post on the research can be found here:\n\nEmotet Analysis: Why Emotet’s Latest Wave is Harder to Catch than Ever Before\n\nWhy Emotet's latest wave is harder to catch than ever before - Part 2",
