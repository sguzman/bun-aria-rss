  "description": "Our audiobook this week is YES, DADDY by Natalie Knight \n\nHe wanted to play a game; he called it Daddy says.\n\nWhat do three eighteen-year-old girls do on a Thursday night when no one’s home?\n\nThey play a simple game of truth or dare.\n\nExcept, there was nothing simple about mine.\n\nWith my dad out of work, no money in the bank, and a depleted college fund, things were looking pretty dire when it came to my college education and future.\n\nI picked dare, and my friend laid out the terms. All I had to do was go on Cam, make some money, and log off. Easy, considering I could use the funds.\n\nBut then he came online, and I knew my little one-time cam stunt would be anything but easy because he wanted to play a game, and I wanted to play along.\n\nDaddy&#039;s Good Girl: https://amzn.to/3CJl5J9\nStonebridge Daddies: https://amzn.to/3CR8K5P\nNatalie Knight: https://amzn.to/3wLOhey\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/3B3F1oA\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nSaved by the Superhero by Alexa Riley: https://bit.ly/3wIKw9G\nAli Hazelwood: https://amzn.to/3CMqZZO\nHer Shadows, His Secrets by CC Monroe: https://amzn.to/3e0w4n0\nObsessed Alphas by Mayra Statham: https://amzn.to/3RlTQcd\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nForce of Nature\nAmazon:  https://amzn.to/3NtN0OU\nAmazon INTL: https://bit.ly/3ufRu4Q\niBooks: https://apple.co/3PYQb2t\nNook: https://bit.ly/3ukn4yC\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3NAoI62\nGoogle Play: https://bit.ly/3A8m02E\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
