  "description": "<p>Have psychologists recently found evidence for the existence of psychic ability?  Last year, well-known psychologist Daryl Bem published an article called Feeling the Future in which he describes a number of studies, all of which provided support for a kind of phi phenomenon he calls \"retroactive influence\".  The research appeared in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.  The article caused a storm of controversy and calls for changes to how research and the peer review process is conducted. I covered some of those recommendations in video episode 165 Psychological Research Under Fire.  In this episode I interview the lead author, Stuart Ritchie, of the first published replication of one part of Bem's work.  Listen as Stuart describes what he did and what he found on this very controversial topic.</p>",
