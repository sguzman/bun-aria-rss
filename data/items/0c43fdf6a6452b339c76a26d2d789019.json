This could rise to 80% if recovery is delayed until December. <br>\n<br>\nDuring their trip, the Reopening Europe team noticed the direct impact of the lockdown on cities such as Strasbourg or Salzburg, which were practically devoid of the usual tourist crowds. <br>\n<br>\nIn this latest installment of our summer series on Reopening Europe's trip across Europe at a unique moment, Giuseppe is in conversation with Ivo Tarantino, Head of Public Affairs & Media Relations at Altroconsumo, the largest independent and non-party political consumers’ organisation in Italy.<br>\n<br>\nThey hear contributions from-<br>\n<br>\nLeone, a Gondolier in Venice; <br>\nNives Monda, restaurant owner in the historic centre of Naples; <br>\nEmilio Casalini, journalist and writer; <br>\nElvio De Monte, architect in Venice; <br>\nJeannette Neumann, Bloomberg correspondent in Madrid.</div>\n",
