  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, the New York Times piece on John Bolton’s new book changes nothing. There was no quid pro quo. There was no impeachable offense, all we have is a leaked manuscript of a book. No leak changes the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong!  Also, Senate Republicans, Susan Collins and Mitt Romney are calling for Bolton to testify. Now, it looks like Sen Pat Toomey wants to cut a deal with democrats for witnesses. These RINO Republicans are doing the bidding of the democrats. Then, MRC’s Brent Bozell calls in to discuss left wing NPR, where their money comes from and why they still exist? Later, like all of you, Mark was stunned when he found out Kobe Bryant and his daughter died. Our sympathy goes out to the families affected by this crash.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
