  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Recently, I was a guest on the podcast Not Your Average Runner with Jill Angie. (You can check out her website <u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"https://notyouraveragerunner.com/\">HERE</a></u>). Jill helps women of all sizes and fitness levels learn how to run.</p> <p>I sure wish I had a Jill back when I started running. She would've told me the size of my body doesn't define being an adult athlete, and my pace had nothing to do with my worthiness as a runner. And I know she would've helped me quit using exercise as a punishment for being overweight.</p> <p>She reached out to me and said, \"You should come up with the Four Basics of Exercise Fueling. Women need a simple way to approach eating and exercising that helps them fuel like a badass.\"</p> <p>She was right. And today on the podcast, I teach them to you.</p> <p>Listen to Episode 259: The Four Basics of Exercise Fueling with Jill Angie. Don't forget to screenshot this episode and share it on social media.
