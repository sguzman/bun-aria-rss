We catch up with URNY, the artists of the project. They were scheduled to be in studio as part of a big event, but with COVID-19 things change. Mike Baca (2ESAE) joins us from Puerto Rico and Fernando Romero (Ski) from New Jersey for the first half-hour as we smoke the cigar that was part of The Cigar Authority Prime.</p>\n<p>During the course of the show we discuss what cigar we wish we could put away and smoke 25 years later. We received a lot of feedback about last weeks cigar and one of the common questions is what cigars would you like to put away. Dave, Mr. J, Barry & Ed Sullivan share their thoughts as we smoke a Back 2 Back Nicaragua which was also part of the care package. We will have this and all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
