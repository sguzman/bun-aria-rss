  "description": "<p>In 2017, Frank Bruni suffered a stroke while sleeping in the middle of the night, an event that led to blindness in his right eye. His new memoir, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/books/review/the-beauty-of-dusk-frank-bruni.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Beauty of Dusk,”</a> examines not only his physical condition but the emotional and spiritual counsel he sought from others in order to deal with it. On this week’s podcast, he discusses the experience, including his initial reaction to it.</p><p>“I woke up one October morning and I felt like I had some sort of smear — some gunk or something — in my eye, because the right side of my field of vision had this dappled fog over it,” Bruni says. “I think like a lot of boomers, I had this sense of invincibility. When I was diagnosed, at one point, with mild gout, I took Allopurinol every day and that was solved. When my cholesterol was un-ideal, I took a statin, and that was solved. I kind of thought modern medicine solves everything and we boomers, with our gym workouts, et cetera, are indestructible. So for hours I thought, ‘This is just an oddity.’ I took a shower and washed my eye, but the fog didn’t go away. I thought, ‘Maybe I haven’t had enough coffee.’ I thought, ‘Maybe I had too much wine last night.’ It was a good 12 to 24 hours later before I accepted, something is really wrong here.”</p><p>Meghan O’Rourke visits the podcast to talk about her latest book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/books/review/invisible-kingdom-chronic-illness-meghan-orourke.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness,”</a> which is also about personal pain and the larger context around it. O’Rourke spent many years experiencing symptoms that were misdiagnosed or dismissed.</p><p>“I just kept getting sicker and sicker, but it took so long to realize, OK, something is quite wrong.” She attributes some of this delayed realization to the “problem of subjectivity,” especially when younger. “None of us know what others are experiencing, so I thought, ‘OK, maybe pain is normal. Maybe brain fog is normal. Maybe I just should never eat dessert. It really did take maturing into my 30s and getting <i>really</i> sick to cross that line where it became unignorable.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Elizabeth Harris has news from the publishing world, and Dwight Garner and Alexandra Jacobs talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by The Times’s critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/books/review-black-cloud-rising-david-wright-falade.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Black Cloud Rising”</a> by David Wright Faladé</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/books/review-founders-paypal-jimmy-soni.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Founders”</a> by Jimmy Soni</p><p><i>We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.
