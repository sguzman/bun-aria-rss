  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, We The People fear the concentration of power and the Democrats use the concentration of power to pursue their agenda. If the Democrats have their way, America as we know it will cease to exist. Will America survive as a republic, as a free-market economy, and as a free people? There is a two-front war going on, one with the Democrat party ideologues and one with Communist China. In retrospect, America has lost too many brave military men and women for the country to have as many radical leftists as it does. These leftists present a danger to maintaining the liberty that makes America great. Then, with upwards of 20% unemployment this is a depression, yet it doesn't look like a depression for all citizens. Not a single tenured professor has been fired, no government workers were furloughed, not a single member of Congress missed a paycheck. Yet the blue state governors will continue using the Wuhan Chinese to scare people into compliance with their executive orders. Later, the federal Bill of Rights is the law of the land and the President has the authority to enforce the federal constitution through the Dept. of Justice. The real question is: by what authority do these blue state governors enact these executive orders? Afterward, Mark reflects on the passing of his beloved dog Barney, reminiscing on the blessings that Barney brought to the entire family.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
