  "description": "<p>Whitby, Ontario is in southeastern Ontario and is what we would consider a suburb of Toronto. The name is Danish and means \"White Village.\" The original surveyor of the area chose the town names here from towns in northeastern England, so Whitby is named for the seaport in Yorkshire. Camp 30 was an urban explorers playground with several abandoned, crumbling buildings just waiting to be explored. This was a former school for delinquent boys and World War II prisoner-of-war camp that housed Nazis. While things were good for the prisoners, life at the school for the boys was horrible and several died. This has left behind some spiritual residue.The Whitby Psychiatric Hospital was run like many of the asylums in America. Abuses and deaths here seem to have led to hauntings. The Centennial Building is a former courthouse that now seems to be a haunted theater. The Trafalgar Castle School is built to look like a castle and just like so many castles, it seems to be home to some spirits. Join us and Karen Wickiam, host of the STAT podcast, as we look at several locations in Whitby, Ontario that have a reputation for being haunted! The Moment in Oddity features Hypha Tombicina makes mummies and This Month in History features Mary Jane Kelly killed by Jack the Ripper.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be seen here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/11/hgb-ep-231-haunted-whitby-ontario.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/11/hgb-ep-231-haunted-whitby-ontario.html</a></p> <p>Get the key to the gate for the HGB Losers Club: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p> </p>",
