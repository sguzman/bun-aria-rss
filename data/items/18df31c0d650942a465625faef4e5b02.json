  "description": "Our audiobook this week is LOVELY BAKER by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley!\n\nNarrated by Kit Swann and Matthew Maddux\n\nJenna has been running the bakery for a while now and she doesn’t need her grouchy boss telling her what to do. No matter how big his muscles are or how dark those eyes can be when he’s staring into her soul. Wait, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, she’s busy taking care of her little brother whom she’s raised since he was a baby and she doesn’t have time for men. No matter how sexy they are.\n\nReed has been playing the long game with Jenna because he knows she has a responsibility to her son. But from the first time he saw her, he’s been counting down the seconds until he can make her his. Her time of playing games is over, and a weekend away at a friend&#039;s wedding is just the opportunity he needs.\n\nWarning: He’s pressing his luck and she likes the way it feels against her. Hot and dirty at the speed of happily ever after. What more could you want? Epilogues?
