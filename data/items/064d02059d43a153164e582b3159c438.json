  "description": "<p>This is our one-year anniversary. When we started the podcast, it felt like quite a risk ... neither of us had any idea how to make a podcast and we had to figure it all out on the fly. Reflecting back on the last year sparked a discussion about courage inspired by the Brene Brown book \"Daring Greatly.\" &nbsp;The title for her book came from this Teddy Roosevelt quote: <em>\"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” &nbsp;</em>We discuss the role of vulnerability in connecting with our audiences, the importance of allowing ourselves to be imperfect, and the need to act <em>even when</em> you are terrified.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also respond to a question from Susan, who wrote: \"There is a hilarious song by Morrissey called 'We Hate it When Our Friends Become Successful' and I am wondering if you have lost any friends along the way. Do you notice some people just getting standoffish, angry or acting differently the more you succeed?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for </strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/art2life2020\"><strong>Free Art2Life workshop</strong></a></p>\n<p>Brene Brown TED talk: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjNtWRBdXws\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjNtWRBdXws</a></p>\n<p>Caroline Goyder ‘Find Your Voice’ book - available for pre-order: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Find-Your-Voice-Confidence-Situation/dp/1785042831\"><u>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Find-Your-Voice-Confidence-Situation/dp/1785042831</u></a></p>\n<p>Caroline in action with some tips for speaking with confidence: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0325A8-_A4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0325A8-_A4</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em><br>\n\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
