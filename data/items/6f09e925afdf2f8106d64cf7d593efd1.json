  "description": "Today, we talk about how we at Alice Lane Interior define luxury and ways to experience luxury in your everyday choices.  We start our discussion by talking about a conversation between Whitney Robinson (former editor in chief of Elle Decor) and Martyn Lawrence Bullard (star on Bravo’s Million Dollar Decorators and decorator for Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Tommy Hilfiger, Cher, Ellen Pompeo, and Eva Mendes), had on “what is luxury?” We discuss how luxury is not saving what you have “for best,” meaning that we should use and enjoy our finest possessions. We talk about a few products that we feel are luxurious.  For instance, we recommend Lunya’s, The Robe, found here (<a href=\"https://www.lunya.co/products/the-robe-1?variant=31349641019435\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.lunya.co/products/the-robe-1?variant=31349641019435</a>),  luxury sheets (<a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/collections/sheets/products/white-tencel-sheet-sets)\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/collections/sheets/products/white-tencel-sheet-sets)</a> and a counter spray called Rosewater Driftwood by Caldrea (<a href=\"https://www.caldrea.com/fragrance/homekeeping/rosewater-driftwood/)\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.caldrea.com/fragrance/homekeeping/rosewater-driftwood/)</a>.  We talk about bringing home fresh flowers or clippings from flowering trees, and decorating with art or family photos.
