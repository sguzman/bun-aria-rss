  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin, Rep. Matt Gaetz joins the show to discuss how he led Republican members into the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) room in the basement of the Capitol where the secret democrat hearings are going on. The Democrats are depriving the country and all citizens of the simple due process traditions that have always united us. This Star Chamber-styled impeachment inquiry conducted by Adam Schiff prevents GOP lawmakers from asking questions and they can only review the transcripts of these interviews after the democrats have prepared the transcripts, which is unethical! There is a reason why trials in our criminal justice system are held publically — it's so the government can't operate in obscurity and bamboozle 'We The People.' Yet the Democrats continue decrying a quid pro quo and in this case, there is no \"quo.\" This testimony, which in some cases, is fourth-hand hearsay. Literally cherry-picking gotcha moments that they can leak to the media. Then, many Presidents have used private citizens as special envoys on foreign policy issues. As a private representative of the President, Rudy Giuliani never hid that he was looking into issues with Ukraine. This practice of enlisting informal diplomats dates back more than two centuries to the founding of America. Later, Shaquille O’Neal stands up for American free speech\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
