  "description": "<p>24 year-old singer/songwriter Faye Webster stopped by Shangri-La earlier this month in between stops on her tour opening for Wilco to chat with Justin Richmond and play some songs off of her latest album, <em>I Know I’m Funny haha</em>. Faye started releasing music independently when she was just 16 years-old. In 2017 her second album was released through Awful Records—home to the Atlanta hip-hop collective. Faye was a bit of an outlier on the rap-heavy label but working with them gave her a different perspective on recording than she otherwise would’ve had.</p><p>On today’s episode Justin Richmond talks to Faye about how artists like The Ramones and Garth Brooks influenced her writing style. Faye also plays some more songs live, as well as an early demo version of “Cheers.”</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Faye Webster songs<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2AMyw1WLcPnuCNCisoVWIy?si=cccbc504b3904593\"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
