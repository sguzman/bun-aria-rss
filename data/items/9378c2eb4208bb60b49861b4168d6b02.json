  "description": "<p>In this first episode of our four-part series on leadership blind spots, John Maxwell, Mark Cole, and Richard Chancy define what a leadership blind spot is.</p> <p>Can leaders see their own blind spots? What indicators can leaders examine to identify and understand their own blind spots?</p> <p>Every leader has at least one blind spot, and the greater a leader’s influence, the greater the effect of that blind spot. For transformational leaders, one of the most profound assets for growth is an external perspective on one’s own leadership. Such a perspective allows us examine the areas in which we are not intuitive.</p> <p>But no leader can identify his/her blind spot alone. After all, it is called a blind spot. Identifying a blind spot requires consulting those around you for honest feedback. In this series, Mark asks a great question for those whom you lead and those who lead you: “What’s it like being on the other side of me?” </p> <p>Our BONUS resource for the “Blind Spot” series is a worksheet on blind spots which you can fill in as you listen to each episode.
