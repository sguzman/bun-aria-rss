Voicemails include: Touchy Feely, Statue of Lethargy, and more.\n\nWe have two awesome guests on the show today.\n\nFirst, Wells Adams joins the show. We discuss his background in radio before going on the Bachelorette. His experience on the Bachelorette and finding his role as the funny guy. We talk about how being the bartender on Bachelor in Paradise can get frustrating. He tells us the story of how his spot on the Bachelor shows got him in touch with his now fiancee, Sarah Hyland (of Modern Family). He tells us about their first date, which could legitimately be a movie, being THE Instagram couple, and what the likelihood of her joining him on Bachelor in Paradise would be. Finally, he tells us a story of how Tish Cyrus helped make Old Town Road what it is today.\n\nSecond up, we have Jake Lacy! We talk with Jake about his role as Pete on the final season of The Office. He tells us what his thoughts were on the show after Michael Scott left. We talk about what type of role he likes to play and the difference in playing a nice guy and a good guy. He sells us on BoJack Horseman. He tells us about his new series High Fidelity and how great it is to work alongside Zoe Kravitz. And much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
