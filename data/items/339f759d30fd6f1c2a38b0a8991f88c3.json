  "description": "It’s no secret that JJ is very close friends with Joel Embiid. They go back several years and have formed a very tight bond on and off the court. It’s also no secret that Joel Embiid is a monster on the court and is enjoying a spectacular season, which could lead to him taking home the MVP. But besides all of that, he’s also a fantastic interview, as he has gone head to head with JJ and Tommy multiple times before, always bringing his 'A' game to keep the fellas on their toes. Well, this time is no different… except that it is. Because not only do you get a great interview, but a new OM3 approach as well. In showing him handpicked video highlights, JJ has Joel breakdown four integral aspects of his game, forcing him to give his own inside scoop as to how these very important parts of his game come to life. All that and, of course, the occasional haymakers that Embiid and JJ toss back and forth at each other.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
