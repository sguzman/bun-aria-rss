The company also notified employees in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa about the cuts. The news revealed problems with what is widely thought to be a fast-growing clean energy economy. GE and competitors have grappled with rising costs and supply chain delays, despite the energy transition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/reutersbest/article/reuters-reveals-general-electric-lays-off-workers-at-onshore-wind-unit-as-part-of-turnaround-strategy/\">Reuters reveals General Electric lays off workers at onshore wind unit as part of turnaround strategy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.reutersagency.com/en/\">Reuters News Agency</a>.</p>\n"
