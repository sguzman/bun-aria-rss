All of this made operational in conjunction with Cash App.<br /><br />What this means for companies like a Starbucks whose sales are $24.6 B and over 43% in card payments could save the chain as much as $800 Million a year in fees. Multiply that by the 4 Trillion restaurant industry globally and you end up with an addressable market of approximately $9 Billion in savings.<br /><br />Block, formerly known as Square, is integrating the Lightning Network into its popular Cash App, a move first promised in 2019. The company said the feature should be available to all U.S. Cash App users, except those in New York State, in the coming weeks.<br /><br />The integration of the network will allow Cash app customers in the U.S. to send bitcoin for free within seconds to anybody in the world.<br /><br />The Lightning integration is made possible by the Lightning Development Kit created by Spiral, which is funded by Block.<br /><br />Cash App customers will also be able to send bitcoin to any compatible wallet that accepts Lightning Network payments, without being charged fees.<br /><br />Almost three years ago, Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who’s also an investor in Lightning Labs, said there were plans underway to integrate the scaling technology with Square’s Cash App.",
