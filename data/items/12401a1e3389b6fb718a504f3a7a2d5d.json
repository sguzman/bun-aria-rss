There is a hidden power within you, covered up and suppressed by our modern way of living and thinking. Through a disciplined practice of cold water therapy, breathing, and mind-body connection, you can awaken the lost powers of your DNA and enter into a place of healing not possible even through today’s modern medical practices. On this episode of Impact Theory, Tom Bilyeu is joined by Wim Hof, better known as ‘The Iceman,’ to discuss such matters and more as they explore how to unlock your brain, spirit, and body’s true potential by connecting to your ancestral DNA and uncovering the true depths of yourself. They discuss Wim’s early life and it’s influence on him towards finding his purpose, how to gain complete control over your body, why you should be seeking the light inside you, why respecting your ancestral history is important, how to enter into your own DNA and grasp your true purpose, how to think with intention, the power of seeking true freedom, why you have to learn to let go before all else, the scientific proof behind his methods, how his methods are leading to the curing of diseases and illnesses, and why there is a hidden healing power within you.   SHOW NOTES:   Mindset | Wim shares his personal story of his dramatic birth and entering the world.
