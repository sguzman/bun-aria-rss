  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 67: Featuring Mike Commodore",
  "description": "<p><p>The boys open this week's show with—what else?—the U.S. women's incredible gold medal-winning game vs. rival Canada. They also chat about the Flyers resurgence, a couple of trades, and more. Episode 67 also sees the return of crowd favorite Mike Commodore (once we wake him up). Commie got #InOne at the Vegas/Calgary game the night before recording but that didn't stop #TheInsiderr from chiming in on #PackYourShit, the Vegas game experience, trade chatter, and much more. Commie never disappoints so tune in and have a laugh. </p><p> </p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
