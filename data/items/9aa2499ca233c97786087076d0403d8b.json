  "description": "The spider’s web that stories create online are spun over and over as they get retold and spread. The lines blur fact and fiction and as you get closer to look, it’s already too late--you’re trapped. It’s dangerous to believe every scary story you read online because even the most ridiculous tales hold a frightening grain of truth. But we never know for sure since so few live to spread the word. Only scraps of digital footprints remain and even those grow cold as death. First, we search for Smile.dog, the iconic Creepypasta abridged. Next, beware what you say, it’s dying to come true. After that, a cyber threat befalls us in The Theater, a beloved Creepypasta. And finally, a couple’s retreat makes for some killer romance.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
