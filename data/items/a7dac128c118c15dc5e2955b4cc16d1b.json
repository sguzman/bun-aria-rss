  "description": "Arlene Stamper and Melissa Harris are the mother, daughter design team at Quilt Company. If you love applique like I do, then I know you have seen their darling patterns. Have you wondered how they come up with all the amazing project ideas? In this show we gain some insight into how they design and a lot more.\n-------\nMany of you know about the Wonderful Quilt show in Houston Texas held in late October or early November called Quilt Festival. Quilts Inc also hosts 2 trade show each year and over my 23 years in the industry I’ve meet quite a few of the staff. I wanted to focus on Learning so I invited the super talented Marcia Barker, the Director of Education, to give me a few highlights of what is at Quilt Festival for you to learn from.\n-------\nI’m excited to chat again with Karen Miller of Red Bird Quilt Company. It’s been awhile and Karen has been out teaching and creating some amazing programs I want you to know about. One is about thread education as we both love and do projects with Aurifil. So today you’ll learn more about thread weights and what they are for.\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
