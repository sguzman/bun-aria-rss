  "description": "For designing object-oriented software, five principles have emerged over the years. These principles are summarized by the acronym SOLID, which stands for:\n S: The single-responsibility principle O: The open-closed principle L: The Liskov substitution principle I: The interface segregation principle D The dependency inversion principle  In this post, I aim to give a succinct summary of the principles together with practical examples on how to apply them."
