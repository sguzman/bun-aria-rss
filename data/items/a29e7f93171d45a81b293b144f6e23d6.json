  "description": "Happy New Year Readheads! The first episode of the year is here and we're talking all about Layla by Colleen Hoover. We are answering all of your questions and talking about our favorite and least favorite moments from the book. As always we also share our casting picks for a movie adaptation of the novel and we are each sharing all of the books we read over the holiday break and highlighting the ones we highly recommend. The next book is Jackie's choice and she chose How To Fail at Flirting by Denise Williams. Later this month we have a very special episode of The Readheads Book Club with Claudia Oshry, author of Girl With No Job: The Crazy Beautiful Life of An Instagram Thirst Monster.
