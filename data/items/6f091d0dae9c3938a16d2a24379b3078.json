Taza is a \"bean-to-bar\" chocolate maker. That means starting with raw cocoa beans and going all the way through the process to turn those beans into a chocolate bar you can buy in a store. (Some chocolatiers get chocolate that's already mostly made and they just add stuff to it and shape it.)</p>\n\n<p>The tree that those cocoa beans come from is called the Theobroma cacao tree, which grows in warm tropical parts of the world--within 20 degrees of the equator. Taza Chocolate sources (buys) cocoa beans from farmers in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Belize and Bolivia.</p>\n\n<p>It takes about five years from when it's planted for a cacao tree to produce cocoa pods. \"Cocoa pods are a little bit funny to look at. They look like a gourd growing off of the tree, or like a lumpy tiny American football. The cocoa pods grow off of the branches of the tree like apples, but they also grow right off of the trunk of the tree,\" Ben-Chaim explains.</p>\n\n<p>\"The next step in the process is fermentation. Fermentation is so important in chocolate making. And this is one of the things that is so surprising about chocolate making.</p>\n\n<p>After the beans ferment, they spend a week drying in the sun on wooden planks. At this point they look like almonds. Next, they are packaged and shipped to wherever they'll be made into chocolate.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing the chocolate maker will do is roast the beans at 200 degrees for about an hour, which gives them a nice toasted flavor.</p>\n\n<p>\"We also start to separate the thin outer shell that surrounds the inner part of the cocoa bean. Our next step is to separate that shell from the inner part of the bean, called the nib. We do this by winnowing the cocoa beans, using a machine,\" says Ben-Chaim.</p>\n\n<p>\"At Taza Chocolates we use a traditional Mexican milling style using a <em>molino</em> - or mill - to grind the cocoa beans down,\" Ben-Chaim says, demonstrating. \"Over time, those cocoa nibs will be turned into a cocoa liquor, which is smooth and chocolaty. Imagine a chocolate waterfall. It looks beautiful, it smells chocolaty and delicious and yet it is not very tasty because we're missing a really important ingredient, and that is sugar.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sugar is added to the chocolate liquor, then the sweetened chocolate is ground again, and other ingredients are sometimes added, like spices or coffee or fruit.</p>\n\n<p>At this point some chocolate makers will conche the chocolate, which blends and mixes the chocolate at a high temperature over many hours, which makes it smooth and creamy. Taza doesn’t conche their chocolate. The next step is tempering. Tempering the chocolate makes it glossy and brittle. Then the chocolate is poured into molds and cooled. Then it's wrapped up and ready to take home.</p>\n\n<p>Also in this episode:  we visit <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj4xf-wjuLuAhXEFVkFHSx9CkYQFjAAegQIARAD&url=https%3A%2F%2F44northcoffee.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">44 North Coffee</a>  to learn more about the mysterious beverage that so many adults like to drink--coffee!</p>",
