  "description": "<p>How do you make older cars turn, stop, handle, or have good steering feel? Luckily we have Kyle Tucker of Detroit Speed to explain it all. He talks about his time working for GM, testing the C5 prototype fresh out of college, how he started his own company, what they did differently, and why their cars perform with the best. It was a great discussion about modifying, thinking, engineering, and testing. Detroit speed makes subframes, sway bars, control arms, axles, springs, and more. It's hard to put into words how good their cars are, so you'll just have to watch one of Matt's One Takes to get his word. </p><p>Recorded on Nov. 3, 2021 </p><p>https://www.detroitspeed.com/ </p><p>https://youtu.be/Pa-1_o44e68</p><p>Head to <a href=\"https://www.policygenius.com/SMOKINGTIRE\">Policygenius.com/SMOKINGTIRE</a> to get started right now. </p><p>For a limited time, my listeners get their first month free - AND, after you’ve been a member, CrowdHealth will include a Fitness Wearable.
