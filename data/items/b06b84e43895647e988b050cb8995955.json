  "description": "<p>Pretty please with sugar on top.</p> <p>Who could resist a request like that? Sugar does, indeed, make everything sweeter. Whether it’s a cake, a cup of coffee, or a deal brokered by a 5-year old, when sugar is added to the mix, things can become irresistible.</p> <p>I’ve loved sugar as far back as I can remember. It’s been a staple in our lives… even when we didn’t have much money or food, we had sugar on the shelf. I can think back on the times that my younger siblings and I made butter and sugar sandwiches when the refrigerator was next to empty. Sugar was there for us, making life sweeter even then. So, how did things go so terribly wrong?</p> <p>To say that I was addicted to sugar would be an understatement. I easily ate over 100 pounds of sugar each year through the foods and beverages I consumed. You might think that a number like that is outlandish, or even unusual, but today it’s actually the norm. Our society puts so much sugar into our metaphorical gas tanks each year that you’d be hard-pressed to figure out how any of us are still driving around. But, the truth is, our bodies/vehicles we're moving around in have made some drastic changes since sugar arrived on the scene. Rates of obesity and diseases related to sugar consumption are at an all-time high. And sugar, as sweet as it is, has poured its way into so many parts of our culture that you’d be hard-pressed to go anywhere and not find it. It’s always there, hidden in plain sight. But today you’re going to get your X-ray sugar glasses.</p> <p>We’re about to go on a journey back to where this all began. To understand where we are, it’s important to look back at the sweet trail that sugar has left us. Today we’re going to uncover sugar’s humble beginnings, and how, ultimately, it was able to rise to power. I hope you’ve got a sweet tooth for learning and fun, because where we’re going, no podcast has gone before.
