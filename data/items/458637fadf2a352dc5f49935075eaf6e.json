  "title": "Ep. 821 - The Left Turns Womanhood Into A Halloween Costume",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our culture has turned womanhood into a costume for men to wear. We’ll discuss the latest example. Also, Colin Powell died of COVID and the media are quick to point out that he had comorbidities. But why is this the one time that they want to talk about COVID comorbidities? And the Loudoun County prosecutor defends his decision to send a rapist student to another school, where he proceeded to rape again. His defense is not very convincing. Plus, outrage over Hooters. Did you know that they require their waitresses to wear skimpy outfits? Shocking stuff. In our daily cancellation, we deal with a feminist college professor who says men have an unfair advantage in the workplace because of all the bonding we guys do in the bathroom. There are a number of problems with this theory. We’ll discuss that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
