  "description": "<p>We interrupted our regularly scheduled programming for a special state of emergency episode. In episode 82 we covered a few topics relevant to the times that we are in. We discussed the business of police brutality, the economic play behind it that benefits investment firms and large banks, economic strategies and solutions that can be implemented to help solve this age-old problem. We also discussed socially conscious investing and ways to invest in funds that align with your social, religious, and political beliefs. We also went into private prison stocks and examined how you might be invested in prison companies without even knowing it. We talked about the dozen black-owned publicly-traded companies on the NYSE, and we covered companies marketing strategies to use social issues as advertising points. #Policebrutalitybonds #marketing --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
