  "description": "<p>Feel like everyone around you is moving forward, and you’re over here stuck walking in circles? You’re trying to keep it together, but just can't kick the feeling of being lost and directionless? Sister, you are certainly not alone. It’s difficult to make a step in the right direction when you don’t even know what that direction is. That is, until you grab some clarity and confidence. Listen in as Jordan walks through four steps of overcoming the feeling of shooting in the dark and stepping into moving forward with intention. You’ll learn small steps you can begin today to get out of the funk, the question to ask that is probably holding you back the most, and the importance of identifying what truly lights you up. It’s time to start small. Blast through the excuses. And walk in clarity to your next chapter.
