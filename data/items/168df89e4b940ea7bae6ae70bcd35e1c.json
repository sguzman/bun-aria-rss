  "description": "<p>Well, readers, it's our first post-op ep! After a successful surg for Matt, the girls are so happy to welcome the true healing spirit that is Clark Moore, actor and host of the incredible Soul Balm podcast, which is a genuine Las Cultch Pick! Take that, Oprah! We can pick things, too! This episode, dripping wet with water sign energy, features discussions and reviews of Thunder Force, the Netflix College Admissions Scandal documentary, and a full on Godzilla Vs. Kong discussion (with spoilers...skip 25:46-30:19 if you care and also...bless you, child). Also, why Clark had to finally drop reality TV. Discussion Point: in watching Real Housewives, are we complicit in the destruction of these women's lives? All this, and then the real meat and potatoes of the ep: THE SPICE GIRLS. Discussion point #2: was Ginger Spice the leader and is that why it all fell apart after she left? What ARE the best Spice Girls songs? Did you, like Clark, try and recreate the \"Naked\" tour performance at your SCHOOL with CHILDREN? The words \"nude illusion in the round\" are used discussing this very scenario. All this, Clark's surprising Jon Ossoff connections, BTS from Love Simon spilled exclusively for the readers, and the Las Cultch on-air debut of Katrina \"Damm Bird\" Rogers. You, and this episode? VERY \"2 Become 1\".</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
