And that had been a little controversial (as these things very often are in post-conflict societies). Some people felt it had gone too far. Other people felt that it hadn't gone far enough. It just made me think about how maybe art could be used to say things that are really unsayable in a place where people are obsessed with language and obsessed with identity and where languages are so problematic.”</p> <p>Louise Kennedy joins us on the show to talk about her US debut, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/trespasses-louise-kennedy/1140985467?ean=9780593540893\"><em>Trespasses</em></a>, a story about love, loss and identity that’s so unforgettable, it’s our newest Discover pick.
