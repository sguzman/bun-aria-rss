  "description": "<p>String diagrams are an increasingly popular algebraic language for the\nanalysis of graphical models of computations across different research fields.\nWhereas string diagrams have been thoroughly studied as semantic structures,\nmuch less attention has been given to their algorithmic properties, and\nefficient implementations of diagrammatic reasoning are almost an unexplored\nsubject.\n</p>\n<p>This work intends to be a contribution in such a direction. We introduce a\ndata structure representing string diagrams in terms of adjacency matrices.\nThis encoding has the key advantage of providing simple and efficient\nalgorithms for composition and tensor product of diagrams. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness by showing that the complexity of the two operations is linear in\nthe size of string diagrams. Also, as our approach is based on basic linear\nalgebraic operations, we can take advantage of heavily optimised\nimplementations, which we use to measure performances of string diagrammatic\noperations via several benchmarks.\n</p>",
