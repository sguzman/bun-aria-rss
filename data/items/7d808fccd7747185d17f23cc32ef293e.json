  "description": "<p>What's on your bucket list? Chances are, you haven't really thought about it for a while. But in this episode, you'll see how important it is to have a bucket list AND how to make all your dreams come true. Ben Nemtin is one of the most inspirational people I've met. After dealing with depression, he set out for a trip around the country with his friends to fulfill their bucket-list, just them and their small van. For every wish that they got to fulfill, they would fulfill someone elses. As people heard about their project, it grew and eventually became a show on MTV! In this interview, Ben shares with us how interconnected we all are: how our wishes are not so different from others.</p> <p>By helping one another, we all rise.
