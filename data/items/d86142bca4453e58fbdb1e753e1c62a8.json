  "description": "At some point, the U.S. is going to run out of people eager to get the vaccine, and we’ll need to work hard to convert those who are still hesitant or don’t know how to get it. It won’t be the first time we’ve done so. For months, community leaders have been working to overcome transportation challenges, language barriers, and digital divides. We speak to five of those leaders on this week's episode to hear how they convinced people to get the vaccine, and what that might mean for the months to come.",
