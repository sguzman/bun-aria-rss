Brady and host Will Brinson discuss Bucs-Cowboys (7:00), evaluating Tampa's chances to repeat and if Dallas is in fact the best team in the NFC East. They also tackle everything about Aaron Rodgers situation and if this will be his final season in Green Bay (19:30). Brady addresses concerns regarding his former colleague Urban Meyer and whether it's fair to already judge his tenure with the Jaguars (26:00). Meyer has the top-drafted rookie quarterback, but there are 4 other 1st-round QBs that could see the field this season. We break them down and pick which one has the best chance at success (34:00).
