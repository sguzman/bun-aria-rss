It’s Passion week — we’re talking about how Lisa Valdez shook up the traditional historical world in 2005 when she released this erotic historical featuring a widow and a dude who has an extremely large…you know. We talk about what it means for a romance to be erotic and about how this might also be inspirational. We also talk about this as a marker of a significant shift in the content of romance novels, and ask some questions about basic anatomy. Headphones on for this one, y’all!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read-along will be Kresley Cole’s <em>Munro</em>, Book 18 of the Immortals After Dark series.
