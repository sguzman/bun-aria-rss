  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/08/books/review/out-on-a-limb-andrew-sullivan.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Out on a Limb”</a> is a selection of Andrew Sullivan’s essays from the past 32 years of American history. On this week’s podcast, Sullivan talks about the book and his feelings about some of the very contentious public arguments in which he’s been involved.</p><p>“You’re never at a moment of finality in politics or intellectual life. You’re always just about to be proven wrong again,” Sullivan says. “I have developed a very thick skin. You have to. I was very controversial in the gay rights movement very early on. The case for marriage equality was bitterly opposed by some gay activists, and I was targeted and picketed by gay people sometimes, for my first book. So I’ve always accepted that that’s part of the price. I am a sensitive person and it does hurt my feelings, obviously, but I think my answer is that it doesn’t matter what they say about you as long as it isn’t true. And if it’s true, hear it, take it in, try and figure out what insight they have about you and change. If it isn’t, forget it.”</p><p>Leila Slimani’s new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/books/review/in-the-country-of-others-leila-slimani.html\" target=\"_blank\">“In the Country of Others,”</a> is the first installment of a planned trilogy loosely based on the lives of the author’s grandparents. On this episode of the podcast, Slimani talks about why she’s writing the autobiographical material as fiction.</p><p>“Imagination is a great power that we have,” she says. “Even if my family is interesting in certain ways, it’s not as interesting as I wanted. So I need to add other things, and I need to feel completely free. I don’t really want to tell about reality but about what fascinates me.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Lauren Christensen, Andrew Lavallee and John Williams talk about what they’ve been reading. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/books/review/intimacies-katie-kitamura.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Intimacies”</a> by Katie Kitamura</p><p><a href=\"https://groveatlantic.com/book/visitation-of-spirits/\" target=\"_blank\">“A Visitation of Spirits”</a> by Randall Kenan</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/books/review-loop-brenda-lozano.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Loop”</a> by Brenda Lozano</p>\n",
