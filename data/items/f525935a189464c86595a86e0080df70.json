  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and good lord this week it’s a good’un - yes, you are warmly welcomed to sit in on his chat with acting and comedy champ JACK WHITEHALL!</p><br><p>Jack Whitehall! Yes indeed. Brett’s been mates with Jack for a long while now, starting out in comedy circles around the same time and blazing the open mic circuit leaving a trail of smoke and ash behind them. This right here is the perfect chance to find out how Jack’s life has branched out ever since those younger, more innocent days and how he went from parka to poetry with consummate ease, his love of Disney and Robin Hood (and tights, by proxy), he and Brett sewing seeds of a future football film or series (that would be amazing and I hope they make good on that), his rise to full stardom through comedy and acting which led to his current high watermark of acting alongside The Rock, and some fine crying on plane talk. Crying on a plane while watching a film is known as “AALS” by the way, in case you’re pondering - or “altitude adjusted lachrymosity syndrome”. Whip that one out next time at yer pub quiz eh? So relax, throw on a pair of tights (it’s what Jack would have wanted yo to do), and enjoy these two getting their chat on about movies and all things besides.</p><br><p><strong>DON'T FORGET!!!
