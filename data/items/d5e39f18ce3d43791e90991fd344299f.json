  "description": "<p>We apply the physically more appealing MIT Bag boundary conditions to study\nthe Casimir effect on the lattice. Employing the formalism of <a href=\"/abs/2005.10758\">arXiv:2005.10758</a>\nto calculate the Casimir energy for free lattice fermions, we show that the\nresults for the naive, Wilson and overlap fermions match the continuum\nexpressions precisely in the zero lattice spacing limit, as expected from\nuniversality. In contrast to <a href=\"/abs/2005.10758\">arXiv:2005.10758</a> where the result for the naive\nfermions rapidly oscillates with the lattice size for both, the periodic (P)\nand anti-periodic (AP) boundary conditions, no oscillations are observed with\nthe lattice size. Furthermore, the apparent violation of the universality for\nnaive fermion in <a href=\"/abs/2005.10758\">arXiv:2005.10758</a> is shown to be cured by applying suitable\nseries extrapolation techniques, thus demonstrating that the Casimir energy for\nthe naive fermions with periodic/antiperiodic boundary conditions agrees with\nthe results for other free lattice fermions, and can as well be used to obtain\nthe results for the Dirac fermion in the zero limit of the lattice spacing.\n</p>",
