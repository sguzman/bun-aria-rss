  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO host Brian Mudd fills in. Senator Chuck Schumer's strategy to deliver sexual misconduct allegations to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the US Supreme Court isn’t working. Doing away with due process would have been disastrous. While the country didn't get screwed today, we're still only two votes away from getting screwed in the long run. It’s a reminder that we are riding on a fine line and we can't afford to rely on a false premises because there's two sides to every story but only one side to the facts. Senator Susan Collins delivered the most amazing speech today which put the wheels in motion to get the votes needed for Kavanaugh's confirmation. Also, here we are with a booming economy and while President Trump’s not as personally popular as Bill Clinton was, there’s also no indication most Americans want him impeached and there’s a growing indication that there will be a backlash to the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
