  "title": "Shelbi Wescott, “Virulent” (Arthur Press, 2013)",
  "description": "It wasn’t until Shelbi Wescott was deep into her career as a high school teacher that she published her first novel, Virulent: The Release (Arthur Press, 2013). The inspiration for the story came during a class for students who weren’t reading at grade level. “Part of my job in that class is to get students excited about literature,” she says. But one student remained disengaged despite her best efforts:\n\nI had to call him after class one day and say ‘You actually have to give some of these books a shot. You might like them.’ And he was like ‘I bet you could even write a better book’ than the one we were currently reading. And I said, ‘I’ll take that challenge. Sure. OK.’\n\nShe handed the student a piece of paper and asked him to write down 10 things he wanted to see in the book. And then she sat down and wrote it. “That happened when he was a freshman and Virulent was published his senior year. That was a pretty exciting graduation present for him.”\n\nIt’s a heart-warming anecdote, one that belies the apocalyptic nature of the novels it inspired. Virulent: The Release, which became the first installment of a trilogy, starts with a bioterrorism attack that kills almost everyone. The story focuses largely on a handful of survivors hiding, and subsequently trapped, in a high school that, as Ms. Wescott explains in the podcast, is remarkably similar to the one in Portland, Ore., where she teaches. The narrative also draws on her experiences as a parent, exploring to what lengths parents might go to save their own children, even if others–perhaps even billions of others–suffer as a result.\n\nOn her web site, Ms. Wescott describes herself as “author, mother, teacher” but she could add “publisher,” having published her books independently. In her interview, Ms. Wescott discusses her experiences as an “indie” author and the fast-evolving world of self-publishing.\n\nYou can learn more about Ms. Wescott at Shelbi Wescott and Rob Wolf at http://www.robwolf.net/.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
