  "description": "Things in the U.S. feel tense right now.

Maybe the closest parallel to what's happening today is  the so-called \"long hot summer\" of 1967, when more than 150 cities across the country experienced civil unrest. <br/><br/>That year, President Lyndon Johnson appointed a commission to diagnose the root causes of the problem and to suggest solutions. What the so-called \"Kerner Commission\" concluded — shocking to many Americans – was that the fires in America's cities could be traced back to inequality, white racism, and police brutality. This week, the Kerner Commission's report and its consequences, nearly six decades later.",
