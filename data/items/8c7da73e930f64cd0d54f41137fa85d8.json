Housing is easily the largest budget item that we have here in the US, and so we’re dedicating an entire episode to the seemingly endless line of expenses that accompany owning a home. There are costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and selling a home so we want to make sure you know what you’re getting into ahead of time. Many first-time homebuyers think that they are just swapping out a rent payment for a mortgage but it’s not that simple or straightforward. Owning a home will likely cost you more than you think so it’s important to start budgeting now, so you can purchase and maintain a home with a lot less stress later on.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Derby Juice by Anderby Brewing- thanks for donating this one to the show Aunt Sal-Sal.
