  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the first legal shot has been fired in Pennsylvania at the 2020 election. Mail-in voting catches steam in 10 states and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled that the state can count ballots for up to three days following the election and that mail-in ballots can’t be discarded over a signature. In effect delaying election night for all of America. There needs to be immediate action by the PA state legislature to stop this. Later, Joe Biden fails to support Israel's sovereignty and his democrat friends are politicizing a coronavirus vaccine. Despite the experts guaranteeing that they are not cutting corners on safety and would never release an unsafe vaccine. Afterward, Pastor Darrell Scott joins the show to discuss his new book, Nothing to Lose: Unlikely Allies in the Struggle for a Better Black America. Pastor Scott shared the President's achievements for Black Americans and the importance of school choice. Finally, Leo Valentin, the Congressional candidate for Florida's 7th District calls in to describe the district and the importance of winning the predominantly Latino district for Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
