  "description": "In today's podcast, Dark Web trading post AlphaBay looks buggy, and leaky. Some not-so-bad news on ransomware (and bravo to those Gateway City librarians). Risk Based Security's 2016 breach report says the USA is number one (but not in a good way). Sweden's armed forces recover from a cyberattack by unnamed parties. Saudi Arabia remains on high-alert for fresh infestations of Shamoon. Dan Larson from CrowdStrike weighs in on ransomware evolution. Markus Rauschecker from the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security highlights a Dept. of Commerce report on the IoT. And the Russian treason case may be closer to what would look like a corruption case under Western eyes.",
