  "description": "<p>We are so lucky to have comedian, actor and singer Cole Escola drop by the podcast this week. You may know Cole from their scene-stealing roles in \"Search Party,\" \"At Home With Amy Sedaris\" and \"Difficult People,\" but before all that they were learning about sophisticated, cosmopolitan female leads on nineties shows like \"Fired Up\" and \"Mad About You.\" We also get into how the calcium industry hijacked TV commercials in the nineties to the point where Cole ate so many Kraft single slices it made them puke, explore what will now be dubbed \"The Snackwell aesthetic\" and hear about the time Vanessa misunderstood what seems like a pretty straightforward reference from \"Troop Beverly Hills\" so deeply that it's still difficult to comprehend. The CEOs get a short-lived break this week as we bring back our \"Back To The Present\" segment where Jonah makes a compelling case for CD long boxes, Vanessa makes a plea to bring back WOW! chips (despite Olestra's uncomfortable side effects) and Cole would like to bring back Sunday night family movie programming, the latter of which should not cause intestinal bloating.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
