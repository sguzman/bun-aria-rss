  "description": "<p>Chad Read meets with his ex, Christina, for a court-ordered custody exchange. The exchange is anything but civil. The Reads get into an argument which spills over to include Kyle Carruth, Christina Read's boyfriend. It's all caught on video. During the extended shouting, Carruth goes inside a residence and returns with a rifle, telling Chad Read to leave. Seeing the weapon, Read appears to tell Carruth he'd better use the gun or Read will take it and use it on him. Bumping chests, the men continue to shout at each other then struggling over the weapon. When Read is a couple of feet away from Carruth, Kyle shoots Read, killing him. No charges are filed, with police determining self-defense.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>David Shestokas - Attorney, Former Assistant State's Attorney, Cook County, IL, Author: \"Constitutional Sound Bites\" and \"Creating the Declaration of Independence\" (Amazon/Kindle) Instagram/Twitter: @shestokas, shestokas.com</li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\"</li>\n<li>Lisa M.
