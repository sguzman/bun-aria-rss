  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! A very HAPPY NEW YEAR to you and yours! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by the prolific podcaster and DJ and all round nice guy STU WHIFFEN!</p><br><p>You may know him from his appearances on Pip’s Distraction Pieces podcast as part of the regular ‘DrunkCast’ episodes with Chris Glasson, or maybe from his own podcast with Chris called ‘Hardcore Listing’, or maybe even his very own podcast called ‘Off The Beat & Track’ - however you know him, here’s your chance to hear him on the other side of the table as Brett gives HIM the grilling this time! A lovely episode, whether you are familiar with Stu or not - and if not, this is a perfect intro and great jump-off to explore his podcast universe! Covering many bases from his problem with Kermit The Frog riding a bike (relatable and understandable, it has to be said), to having the best death yet, to boxing, crying in front of the family, old films and how problematic they can be in the modern climate, the power of musicals if you just go with them a little, and all kinds of fun film chat. Jump in and enjoy! And as always - be excellent to each other. If you are not already being excellent to each other, maybe that’s the new year’s resolution eh?</p><br><p>–––––&nbsp;–––––&nbsp;–––––</p><p><strong><em>LINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:</em></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuwhiffen\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>STU WHIFFEN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/hardcorelisting\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HARDCORE LISTING podcast!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/offthebeatandtrack\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>OFF THE BEAT & TRACK podcast!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/podbible\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PODBIBLE!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
