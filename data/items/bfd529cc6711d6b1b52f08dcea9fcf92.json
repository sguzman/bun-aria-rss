  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.jamesostrer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James Ostrer</a> has been known to dress himself in the flayed flesh of pigs and take self-portraits as a commentary on, what? How we're all encased in the suffering of other animals? How humans are both sacred and just meat? How \"art\" is both absurd and utterly serious? I don't know, but James's work is never boring or pretentious, always provocative and thoughtful.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is sponsored by</span> <a href=\"https://www.mudwtr.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mud/Wtr</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by</span> <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Basin and Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; “Water from the Sky,” by <a href=\"http://elenabwilliams.com/\">Elena B.
