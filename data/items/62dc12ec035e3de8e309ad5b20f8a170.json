Jackie talks about her musical influences, how she and Skinny met and fell in love, and why she’s perfect for the craziness that comes with life on tour. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"> Jackie has music in her blood and grew up immersed in the rock and roll scene. Her dad was a famous drummer who played with many legends such as Chuck Berry and Blue Oyster Cult. She was used to having music around her at all times, and it was no big deal to have future stars like Trent Reznor just hanging around her house. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie is the lead vocalist of Unsaid Fate and also lends guest vocals to her husband’s band, Mushroomhead. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though she is a total show stealer with her beauty and magnetism, Jackie always wants to give credit to the whole band. It’s a “we” instead of “me” operation, and she even outgrew the band featuring her own name to go with Unsaid Fate. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie has been playing bars since she was 10 years old, and was gigging and rocking out on stage while other kids her age were at birthday parties. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Unsaid Fate mixes hard rock, metal, active rock, and some pop in a way that resonates with fans of all ages. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Jackie’s fiance Skinny is the founder and leader of Mushroomhead.
