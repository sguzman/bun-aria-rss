Her credits include a whose-who of country music—Kacey Musgraves, Reba McEntire, Darius Rucker, Lean Rimes—and her albums have received overwhelming critical acclaim. And her debut record, 12 Stories, earned her a 2015 Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.\nWe spoke with Brandy about her new album Your Life Is A Record, which asks what if your life’s journey fit on one LP.
