  "description": "<p>“Don’t rent, you’re just throwing away money. Buy a house instead, it’s a great investment!” - says almost everyone who purchases a home. It’s often accepted as a gospel truth that purchasing a home as a primary residence is always a great investment. This is just not true. We promise you, unless you’re house hacking, chances are your house makes an awful investment. It could possibly be a good lifestyle choice, maybe a great decision for you and your family, or perhaps you're getting a great deal, but that doesn’t mean you should consider it to be a great investment. In this episode, we cover all the different reasons why your primary residence is an awful investment, and then we also give some tips to consider to make your home a ‘less bad’ investment.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we enjoyed a Rueuze (2015) by Bruery Terreux which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
