Cameras like the Canon R5 and Nikon Z9 have had expanded subject detection for a while, but Sony has now incorporated a dedicated processor. This processor acts as a neural engine for autofocus and subject recognition using AI.\n\n00:00 61 MP Sensor, BIONZ XR Processor and Neural Engine\n00:31 Body and Handling\n00:53 New Rear Screen\n01:15 Video Features\n01:59 Improvements over the Sony A7r IV\n02:53 AI Autofocus Explained\n03:15 Human Pose Estimation\n04:15 Sensitivity and ISO Performance\n04:58 Automatic White Balance Improvements\n05:18 Image Quality\n05:59 Is it worth upgrading from the A7r IV?\n07:05 EVF performance\n07:33 In Body Image Stabilization IBIS\n09:08 Complaint - Feature Creep in the Menu Design\n10:12 Complaint the new \"Main Menu\"\n11:06 Complaint - Feature Inconsistency Between Cameras\n12:25 Is the A7r V worth it?
