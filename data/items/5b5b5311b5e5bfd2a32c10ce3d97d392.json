  "description": "Pete Buttigieg was given the opportunity to come out against killing fully developed infants moments before birth, but declined. He is a coward and an extremist. Just like the rest of the Democratic field. Also, AOC says it's impossible to \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps.\" Interesting point coming from a bartender-turned-congresswoman. And David Hogg continues to be brainwashed by his college education. It's a fascinating process to watch.\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
