    "media:description": "This is a complete full game walkthrough for The Legend of Zelda on NES.  The Legend of Zelda was one of the first games I recall playing as a kid and always holds a special place in my heart.  The video goes through the whole game, including all dungeons, bosses and heart pieces.\n\nThis channel features instructional & highly edited video game guides, walkthroughs, speedruns and other uniquely transformative videos.  My own personal gameplay, extensive editing & creative input are clearly added into each video, ensuring that all videos adhere to YouTube's partner program guidelines.  My walkthoughs take tremendous amounts of work & editing so that all videos are straight to the point & can be used as professional video game guides.  I have spent thousands of hours practicing & mastering games before recording to ensure the highest quality gameplay possible.  All gameplay is my own & is recorded and edited solely by me.  Permission to upload each game was provided by the game publisher.",
