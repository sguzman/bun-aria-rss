Nikki is frustrated about going to a car dealership more so than almost dying on her last flight that had a new pilot.

In Top1 Bottom1 they talk about Friends the TV show and ones they had/have.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
