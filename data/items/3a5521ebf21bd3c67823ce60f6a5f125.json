As a founder it can feel like there's so much pressure on you to \"have it all figured out\" from day one. But the reality of most great company beginnings is nothing so grand: often it's just founders who have an inkling about something interesting and the combination of courage + right life circumstances to jump into the unknown and learn as they go.

Don't let early (or even just recent) success blind you if potential headwinds are on the horizon.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rec Room experienced \"explosive\" growth during the 2017 holiday season with the launch of Playstation VR. However this was a classic \"wiggle of false hope\" (in Paul Graham parlance), not real product-market fit. It would have been easy to ignore the very real warning signs (e.g., that VR adoption as a whole was slowing) and plow full steam ahead. Instead the team realized they probably needed to step back from the temporary momentum and diversify out of solely focusing on VR to find new avenues for growth.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Build your company into a robust organism.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Startups constantly face existential risks: what if the market shifts? What if we make wrong strategic decisions? How can you architect your business as a system so that \"you\" (either you personally or the company management as a whole) doesn't need to always be right in order to succeed? For Rec Room this has meant investing deeply into UGC and letting creators lead growth. Any room or piece of content might be no more likely to breakout than another — but in aggregate across now millions of creators, Rec Room is almost guaranteed a constant stream of \"hits\".</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. UGC is a flywheel that's difficult to start, but creates incredible business dynamics once spinning.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Like any flywheel, UGC requires a ton of effort to get moving in the beginning. (E.g., why should people bother to create? What tools do they need? How do you get the incentives right?) But once momentum takes over, it can become an incredible virtuous cycle where users' creativity inspires more users both to consume and create themselves, which compounds faster and faster over time.</li> <li>Furthermore, once a UGC flywheel is spinning, the underlying platform's unit economics get pretty fast: costs to produce content go down (or to zero), cost to acquire users go down (or to zero), and retention, engagement and monetization all spike up.
