  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Anthony Fauci deserves criticism for spending more time on television than at his desk studying infectious diseases. Fauci is only in charge of infectious diseases, not all science and public health, yet many might think he did. Now, Fauci is taking credit for the decision to develop the coronavirus vaccine. The fact is that he simply was not the decision-maker here, it was Donald Trump that made these decisions and for him to suggest that it was his choice is a bald-faced lie. Then, immigration continues to plague the southern border and President Biden remains ineffective while deflecting the blame on Trump. Sen. Ted Cruz was blocked from providing oversight at border facilities by a highly trained activist preventing any reporting or photography. Later, on March 26, 2020, a brave whistleblower called into this program and broke the story of what Gov. Andrew Cuomo was doing by executive order to the senior citizens in nursing homes in New York State. The deadly decision was a fatal failure for approximately 15,000 elderly patients, even though only 6,500 patient deaths were reported by the Cuomo administration. Afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson calls in to discuss how the left is comparing ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. Johnson remarked that the media plastered emotional messaging about 'kids in cages' during Trump's presidency but seem to give Biden a pass for doing much worse. Finally, Gov. Mike Dunleavy calls in to explain that Alaska is taking rightful ownership over navigable waters and other areas within Alaska that are currently federally controlled. He also announces that Alaska is considering becoming a sanctuary state because they will not help the federal government disarm Alaskans. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
