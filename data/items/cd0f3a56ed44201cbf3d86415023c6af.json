  "description": "<p>II: 1:24:00 III 3:02:03 On the Laws (Latin: De Legibus) by Cicero. Translated by Charles Duke Yonge. It is unknown how many books De Legibus originally contained but several complete books have been lost. Cicero's emphasis in the surviving work is on the nature and purpose of law as opposed to providing answers to specific legal questions. Photograph: Draped Model by Jean-Louis-Marie-Eugène Durieu possibly with Eugène Delacroix. LibriVox recording and cover design by Geoffrey Edwards are in the public domain.</p>",
