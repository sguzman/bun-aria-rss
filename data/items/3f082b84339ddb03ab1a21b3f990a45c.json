  "description": "With David Rothkopf away circling the globe this week on the Deep State Radio spy plane, Rosa Brooks and Kori Schake are joined by the Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe and the BBC’s Kim Ghattis. Joining in live from Beirut, Kim reveals that not everyone in the Lebanon is obsessed with US foreign policy, because most people are too busy snacking and getting ready for Christmas. Meanwhile, every single UN Security Council member state is snubbing the US over the Jerusalem resolution, and Iran is snickering on the sidelines. The Tiara of Optimism is temporarily lost.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
