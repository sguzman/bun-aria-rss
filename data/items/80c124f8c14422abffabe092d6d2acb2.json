  "description": "On May 2, 2020, Akamai blocked a large PPS-focused attack against one of our financial services customers in 0 seconds, utilizing a proactive mitigation posture. This was one of the largest PPS levels we have on record, and the biggest mitigated to date in 0 seconds. The attacker launched a bevy of minimally sized UDP packets in an attempt to overwhelm network gear in the customer's data center.",
