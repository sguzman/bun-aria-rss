  "description": "<p>MEDITATION WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. A lot of us are suffering, and we don’t even realize it. We’re always on the move. We’re always doing. We’re balancing so many responsibilities. We don’t take time to quiet our minds so that we can start to understand what’s going on up there. That’s why meditation is so powerful. It allows you to get to the root of your problems instead of constantly fixing the symptoms. It’s like flossing your brain. Meditation will get all “gunk” out. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I’ve combined interviews with experts on meditation: Jay Shetty, Preethaji, Krishnaji, Dan Harris, and Andy Puddacomb. Jay Shetty is a former monk who was named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2017 for being a game-changer and influencer in the world of Media. Jay’s daily show HuffPost Live #FollowTheReader, where he interviewed the likes of Russell Brand, Tim Ferriss and Deepak Chopra reached 1 million people daily. Jay aims to share knowledge at the pace we want entertainment, something he likes to call “making wisdom go viral.” He has created content for and partnered with Snapchat, Facebook, National Geographic, Nasdaq and HuffPost to name a few. Preethaji is a modern day Indian philosopher and sage who has co-founded along with her husband Krishnaji the O&O Academy (school to revolutionize and transform human thought), World Youth Change Makers (an elite community of youth redirecting the future of the world through a revolution in consciousness), and One Humanity Care (a Foundation working with the vision to uplift 10,000 villages in India). Dan Harris is correspondent for ABC News, an anchor for Nightline and co-anchor for the weekend edition of Good Morning America. Harris encourages the use of meditation, and his \"10% Happier\" podcasts are interviews with other meditators. Harris' book, 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Really Works – a True Story, was published in March 2014. Andy Puddicombe is a meditation and mindfulness expert. An accomplished presenter and writer, Andy is the voice of all things Headspace. In his early twenties, midway through a university degree in Sports Science, Andy made the unexpected decision to travel to The Himalayas to study meditation instead. These masters explain the importance of meditation, the common misconceptions, and the science behind it all. It’s a lot more straightforward than you might think. So get ready to learn all about meditation on Episode 812.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you learned from being a monk (5:45)<br />\nWhat’s the intention you set every morning? (10:45)<br />\nWhy do we focus so much on suffering when it only hurts us? (21:10)<br />\nWhat’s the importance of a spiritual vision? (22:35)<br />\nWhy is meditation so powerful?
