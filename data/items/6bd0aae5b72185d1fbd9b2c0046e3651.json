  "description": "<p>I like to think of Lewis Howes and Lisa Bilyeu as leaders in the self-awareness world, especially when it comes to relationships. Both Lewis and Lisa are incredibly successful: she went from housewife to cofounder of a billion-dollar business, he went from picked last for dodgeball to pro athlete, New York Times bestselling author and uber successful podcaster. But here’s the thing: success is empty if you don’t learn to like yourself, and both are intimately familiar with that truth.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On today’s Best Of episode, I’m pairing these two voices to bring you the most powerful advice on self-love and fulfilling relationships. We hear from Lisa, who tells the story of radically changing her role in her relationship, and Lewis, who tells the story of radically hustling for respect (and getting it) -- only to realize he needed to learn how to respect himself. In this show, you’ll learn how to ask your partner for exactly what you need, how to break the habit of “testing” partners, how to identify the masks you wear for the world, and why sex transforms after you’ve taken the time to understand who you are - and love yourself, no hustle required.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Find Lewis Howes here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://lewishowes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LewisHowes.com</a></p><p>Instagram&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lewishowes</a></p><p>Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewishowes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lewishowes</a></p><p>TikTok&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lewis?lang=en&utm_source=hoobe&utm_medium=page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lewishowes</a></p><br><p><strong>Find Lisa Bilyeu here:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://lisabilyeu.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lisabilyeu.com</a></p><p>Instagram&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisabilyeu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lisabilyeu</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
