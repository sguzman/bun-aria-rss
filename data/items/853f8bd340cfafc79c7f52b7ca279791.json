  "description": "<div>Patrick may be from Massachusetts (and has the Dunkin Donuts loyalty card to prove it), butÂ  he somehow missed out on Boston sports fever (feee-vah!). We have a lot of feelings about this one, but we're going to be SUPER careful because we don't want to get beat up at our Boston live show, kid! We all know what this one is about, so let's just dive in!<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://cart.2st.com/true-crime-obsessed/2267?_ga=2.9610037.1609385445.1582578353-216236744.1581368928\"><strong>YOU GUYS WE'RE GOING TO BROADWAY!!!</strong></a><strong> THAT'S RIGHT, TCO WILL BE THE FIRST PODCAST EVER TO PLAY THE GREAT WHITE WAY!</strong> This one-night only event is happening June 1st.
