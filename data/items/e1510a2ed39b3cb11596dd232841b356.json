  "description": "There is a principle in God’s Word that says, “Give, and it will be given to you” (Luke 6:38). “Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap” (Galatians 6:7). When you do something for someone else—take them to a doctor’s appointment, pick them up when their car is broken down, call them, cheer them up, do something that no one else can do for them—God’s going to do special things for you. When we go out and make someone else’s day, we’re saying, “God, thank You for making my day” because when you make someone else’s day, God will make your day. When God sees you blessing others, He blesses you, and there are no blessings to compare with the blessings of Almighty God. So make someone’s day, knowing that God is going to make your day.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
