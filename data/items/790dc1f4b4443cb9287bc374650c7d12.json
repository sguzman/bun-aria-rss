  "description": "Text me! +1 (917) 540-3402\nFor as long as there’s been consumer tech to talk about, we’ve framed it as a winner-takes-all battle between the U.S. and China. But is that really fair?\nMany argue it’s not. One of those many is Connie Chan, general partner at famed VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and this week’s guest on Business Casual. Chan is an expert in the relationship between China and Silicon Valley, and she’s spilling Sand Hill secrets.\nHer biggest bet is on the video-centric future of consumer tech and e-commerce. Because nothing sells goods and services or breeds engagement like watching good video. But who’s positioned to win in a social commerce economy?\nIn the episode, Chan answers that question and so many more, including what TikTok’s uncertain future might look like, plus…\n\nWhy super apps that can do it all (like WeChat in China) are becoming the rage\n\nWhat both social commerce and super apps mean for regulation, innovation, competition, and integration\n\nAnd when and how we choose convenience over perceived morals\n\nAs Chan sees it, whatever happens in consumer tech in China will make its way to the U.S. in about 3–5 years. The best way to be 3–5 years ahead of the curve? Listen to this episode.\n+ Keep in mind: In our next episode, we’re talking about the possible TikTok ban and what it means for creators.
