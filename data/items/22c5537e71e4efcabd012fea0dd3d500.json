  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, it's important that the American people know who Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg are. In truth, Sanders is a hard-core Marxist. He is the biggest liar running for president besides Joe Biden. Sanders has pandered to the communists for his entire career praising Fidel Castro and the Nicaraguan Sandinistas because of how impressed he was with them. Then, Mike Bloomberg is a multi-billionaire with private security and private jets and spends a ton of money attacking our second amendment rights. He fails to recognize that China's leader is a dictator. Bloomberg expanded his business from New York to China and has been there for over 25 years in which time he's become cozy with the communists in order to do business there. Afterward, Martha Raddatz from ABC News laments that Iranians are supporting America and taking umbrage against the Ayatollah for 'accidentally' killing innocents aboard a Ukrainian commercial flight.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
