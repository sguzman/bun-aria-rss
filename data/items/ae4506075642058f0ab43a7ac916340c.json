  "description": "Almost 40 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past 8 weeks. That is a quarter of the workforce. We have never faced a crisis like this one. How we choose to rebuild will be the decision that will define us all in history's eyes. Gene Sperling was the top White House economic advisor for both President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama. He has written a book that addresses the core question that must precede the rebuilding: What is our goal? How will we measure success? His answer is that we must place human dignity at the center of our policy decisions. His book is called \"On Economic Dignity\" and he discusses it with Ed Luce of the Financial Times and host David Rothkopf. It is discussion that gets to the very core of who we are as a country and who we aspire to be. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
