The leftists haven't given up on stopping ACB. Senator Mazie Hirono tries to set up ACB for a Kavanaughing. Dissention in the ranks with Biden and Pelosi, but why if Biden's a 99% winner? Go out and try to convert just one Biden voter. Charlie Cook repeats 10/13/2016 statement on 10/13/2020: \"This race is over.\" Trump gives boffo economic speech. Mnuchin announces little chance of stimulus deal because of Pelosi obstruction, tanking the market as she wants. I don’t know why Sen. Graham has a bug in his underwear about me, says he doesn't listen to the radio so hearings for ACB will go fine.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Poignant email: Rush, I miss my country. Super Bowls used to be the height of patriotism, as defined by Herb Alpert in 1988. Listeners fearful of riots and violence when Trump wins. Sen. Graham says he doesn’t listen to the radio, but what does he have against Rush? McConnell to move on stimulus vote before confirmation (what could go wrong?) Markets aren't seeing a Biden win. Why polls aren't reflecting the electorate. Turn off the media and keep calm in the face of this onslaught.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Do I have to stop paying IT to get my Mac updates to download? Smoking Gun! Oligarch paid Hunter to introduce him to VP Biden, who then bragged about threatening Ukraine to fire the prosecutor looking into Burisma.
