  "description": "<p>From monolayers composed of different atoms, we can build structures with\nspontaneous vertical polarization by conveniently stacking multiple layers. We\nhave studied, using first-principles methods and based on modern polarization\ntheory, a system composed of three layers of hexagonal Boron-Nitride(h-BN) in\nall possible stackings. We obtain for each of the configurations how charge\ntransfers between the layers and how it impacts on the polarization of the\nsystem. In addition, we studied a system of three layers, one of them rotated,\nand we found that not only did the magnitude of the polarization increase\ncomparing with the bilayer but also, depending on the initial stacking and the\nrotated layer, we can create a variety of mosaic-like polarization\narrangements, which are composed of regions with either triangular or hexagonal\nsymmetry.\n</p>",
