  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, Vladimir Putin is a thuggish, Klansman-like, KGB operative that destroys his opponents, and anti-Jewish American Marxist 'neo-con' critics are his lapdogs. President Biden has created a disaster in Afghanistan, a disaster at our southern border, and a disaster in Ukraine. There are many ignoramuses saying that this is not Russia's fault. Russia has begun the invasion of eastern Ukraine under the pretext that there are two independent Russian provinces along the border. The unrest and guerilla warfare already occurring in these provinces was initiated and funded by the Russians. What if Putin doesn't stop at Ukraine, and rolls straight through to conquer the Balkans or other areas of eastern Europe? Its clear that our enemies are watching this just as they watched Biden's failure in Afghanistan. If Putin is not stopped he will drag us all into World War III. Then, Canada continues to threaten protesters with criminal investigations and financial sanctions. The Canadian government is embracing totalitarianism and strengthening itself as a police state.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
