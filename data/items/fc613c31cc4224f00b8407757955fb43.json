  "description": "There has been a menace sleeping in Beowulf's homeland since he was born. It has lived for centuries, and it is strong and dangerous, while Beowulf has lived for only eighty years, and is weakening. Yet, their paths draw them inexorably toward one another in a battle that will live on in legend, but might destroy them both.  The creature this week is why you should keep a giant vat of moonshine in your backyard. ---------------- Career Day: Career Day on iTunes: http://itunes.careerdayshow.com Career Day everywhere else: http://www.careerdayshow.com ---------------- Sponsors:  http://www.stamps.com, and don't forget to use the code LEGENDS.
