  "description": "Anil Dash is obsessed with Prince. Since he’s the host of the tech podcast Function, he has a unique perspective on the Purple One’s complicated relationship with technology. Anil joins the show to break down the many ways that Prince predicted the sound and science of modern pop, from drum machines to online distribution to internet culture. We’ll discuss how Michael Jackson jacked Prince’s electronic experimentation for Thriller, why Prince liked to lurk in fan chat rooms, and how he found ways to change his sound without ever sacrificing his integrity. We’re only beginning to understand Prince’s legacy, but Anil takes us one step closer to fully appreciating the ahead-of-their-time talents of a once-in-a-century artist. \nSongs featured:\n\nPrince - 1999\n\nKraftwerk - The Robots\n\nTalking Heads - Once in a Lifetime\n\nGrandmaster Flash & The Furious Five - The Message\n\nThe Human League - Don’t You Want Me Baby\n\nPrince - Little Red Corvette\n\nMichael Jackson - Thriller\n\nSantana ft.
