  "description": "<p>The Morse Mill Hotel in Hillsboro, Missouri has it all for history and ghost enthusiasts alike. This location has not only served as a private residence, tavern and inn, but also as a hospital for the Confederate wounded during the Civil War. And during Prohibition, this building was both a speakeasy and a brothel. A female serial killer has been connected to the Morse Mill Hotel as well. This nearly two hundred year old structure is full of surprises and quite possibly, ghosts. The Moment in Oddity features the Carnac Stones and This Day in History features the Spanish Influenza Pandemic.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-33-morse-mill-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-33-morse-mill-hotel.html</a></p>",
