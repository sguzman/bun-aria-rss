The exposome is the term for the sum total of all the exposures in our lifetime, starting in utero. These exposures include everything from the food we eat, environmental toxin exposure, the air that we breath, the water we drink, heavy metal exposure, and even our thoughts and emotions.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Todd LePine to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to the exposome, and together they explore how they assess the way that patient exposomes may be contributing to their overall health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). Dr. LePine is the head of the Scientific Advisory Board for Designs for Health and a consultant for Diagnostic Solutions Laboratory. He enjoys skiing, kayaking, hiking, camping and golfing in the beautiful Berkshires, and is a fitness enthusiast.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Uqora.
