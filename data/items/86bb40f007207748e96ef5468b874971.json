    "media:description": "\"Helplessness Blues\" (Solstice Version) by @Fleet Foxes from the album 'A Very Lonely Solstice', available now\nStream & download: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/averylonelysolstice\n\nAvailable for the first time since 2020's Winter Solstice Recording at Brooklyn's St. Ann & The Holy Trinity Church. Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nI was raised up believing I was somehow unique\nLike a snowflake distinct among snowflakes\nUnique in each way you'd conceive\nAnd now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be\nA functioning cog in some great machinery\nServing something beyond me\nBut I don't, I don't know what that will be\nI'll get back to you someday soon, you will see\n\nWhat's my name, what's my station\nOh, just tell me what I should do\nI don't need to be kind to the armies of night\nThat would do such injustice to you\nOr bow down and be grateful and say\n\"Sure, take all that you see\"\nTo the men who move only in dimly lit halls and determine my future for me\nAnd I don't, I don't know who to believe\nI'll get back to you someday soon, you will see\n\nIf I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see\nOf the world outside is so inconceivable\nOften, I barely can speak\nYeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy\nAnd I can't keep it to myself\nWhat good is it to sing helplessness blues?\nWhy should I wait for anyone else?\nAnd I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf\nI'll come back to you someday soon myself\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
