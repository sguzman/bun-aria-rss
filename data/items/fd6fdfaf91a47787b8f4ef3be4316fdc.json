  "description": "<p>Dianne writes \"As it came closer it stopped right behind the wood line. I could see the massiveness of this creature. It had to be over 9' tall and shoulders 4' across. I could only see parts of it. It seemed to know it was obscured by the trees. I could see the torso area of shiny black hair. At that point I lost my nerve to keep looking and frankly if I would have seen it's face I probably would have had a heart attack. My body went into what I've coined LIQUID TERROR. My insides felt like jello. I decided to pretend everything was just ok and with shaking hands I started beading again. It actually helped me calm down but IT WOULDN'T LEAVE. I thought if I ignore it it will go away. No such luck.\"</p>",
