  "description": "The French President, Emmanuel Macron is taking on the country's powerful unions.

Do workers no longer regard unions as an effective way of representing their interests? Have unions failed to adapt to the changing way we work?  That's the Real Story this week with James Coomarasamy as he and his guests discuss the future of unions in the 21st Century.",
