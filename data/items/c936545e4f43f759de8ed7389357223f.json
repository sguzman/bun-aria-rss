  "description": "Helen tells Alan she’s heard the good news about the PCC being in favour of Peggy’s stained glass window.  Emma’s suggested that local schoolchildren create a design for it.  Alan reminds Helen that the window hasn’t been approved by the diocese yet; perhaps it’s best not to get the hopes of local children up.  Later Alan tells Jim he feels the entire village is against him about the window.  He wonders if he should just accept the inevitable.  Jim tells him he needs to stick up for his principles even if the whole process takes years.  Meanwhile Alan is exercised by another issue – pigeons fouling the church pews and there’s a wedding on Friday.\nWhen Lee talks to Mick about the hot tub, Mick explains Joy’s reaction to sell it was because Helen, Lee and the boys are like family to her and she can’t forgive herself for offending them.  When Lee says he and Helen feel terrible, Mick gets an idea. He tells Joy that Lee and Helen would love a go in the hot tub and were wondering if they could use it one evening when Mick and Joy are out.  Later Helen tells Lee she’s up for it, and reluctant Lee agrees.  Mick offers them the chance tonight, as he and Joy are out.  Later as Helen and Lee start to relax into the hot tub experience, Joy arrives home early in her swimming costume and gets in next to them.  They’re further alarmed when Mick appears, also in his swimwear, and lowers himself in.",
