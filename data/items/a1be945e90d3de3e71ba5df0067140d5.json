  "description": "<p>For 13 summers, Timothy Tredwell journeyed into the Alaskan wilderness to spend four months living among the grizzly bears. Though Treadwell believed that he and the bears had an understanding--he considered them his close friends--he and his girlfriend Amy Huguenard were eventually killed and devoured by one of the bears. For the five summers before his death, he took a video camera on his trips and shot over 100 hours of tape. \"Grizzly Man\", the brilliant documentary by master filmmaker Werner Herzog, tells the story of Treadwell's fascinating life and terrifying death--and uses much of treadwell's own footage to do so.  </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>WANT MORE TCO?</strong> Who cold blame you! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Get over 60 full bonus episodes</a>, including our episode-by-episode coverage of \"The Jinx,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" and \"Serial\" <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">via our patreon feed.</a> You get it all the second you sign up and it's all commercial free!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ticketcentral.com/online/default.asp?doWork%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle=Load&BOparam%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle%3A%3Aarticle_id=A74DEEBB-2C77-46E7-AF9E-71AAC002452B&BOparam%3A%3AWScontent%3A%3AloadArticle%3A%3Apromocode_access_code=TCOPRIDE\">COME SEE US LIVE!</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/get-our-promo-codes\"><strong>GET THOSE DISCOUNTS AND PROMO CODES!</strong></a></p>\n",
