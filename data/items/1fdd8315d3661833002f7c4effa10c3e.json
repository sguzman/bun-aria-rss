  "description": "Belcher Islands Massacre. 1941. A Christian bible, translated into the Inuit language, is being read by men in the Belcher Islands. One of these men decided that he was Jesus. He will then appoint the best hunter in the region God and together they spread the message that the hardships the Inuit were facing were nearly over. Soon their hunger would disappear. They would all be able to fly. Some, though, challenged the claims of divinity by the two men. They would pay with their lives. Violent retribution was followed by celebration as those who were opposed were labeled as Satan and then killed. Poor hunting, the onset of WWII, and a remote location meant that help was not coming soon enough for a people under the control of two men playing god.    \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
