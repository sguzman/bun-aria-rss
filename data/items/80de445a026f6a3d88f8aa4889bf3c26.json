  "description": "<p>This week we are talking about success and asking what that word means to you? In particular, we distinguish between external and internal yardsticks. External yardsticks are things like sales numbers, Instagram followers, or show acceptances, and we have both seen these measurements halt people in their tracks. These things are, to some extent, out of our control and they also continually shift and change because we will never be satisified. In this episode, we discuss our own experiences with external measures of success and we suggest an alternative approach - setting your own internal benchmarks. These internal measures of success can keep you focused, motivated and excited about your work, allowing you to stay in control of your emotional wellbeing. We'd love to hear what you think about this discussion - and how you measure success.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Authentic Obsessions Podcast <a href=\"\">https://www.authenticobsessions.com/</a></p>\n<p>Trayci Tompkins <a href=\"\">http://www.traycitompkins.co.za/</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
