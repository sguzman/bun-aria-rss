  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Pod, the guys do a deep dive into Nik Wallenda’s volcano walk and none of them are too happy about the results, so they give a couple of ideas to make his next stunt a lot more entertaining. The guys also chat more about the Coronavirus and try to decide whether or not they are in harm’s way and try to figure out what Coronavirus porn is. The boys also discuss the students at Princeton whining that Marshawn Lynch will speak at their graduation which spills into a conversation about how the TikTok generation is the worst. The guys also pay homage to the victims of the Boston Massacre, chat about Foxy, Zito, and Connor looking for a new place to live, give a few picks for Check It Aht, and they receive a call from a special guest. It’s a free flowing, feel good Friday of sorts. Enjoy.</p>\n",
