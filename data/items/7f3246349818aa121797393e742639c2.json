  "description": "<p>This paper presents a generic probabilistic framework for estimating the\nstatistical dependency and finding the anatomical correspondences among an\narbitrary number of medical images. The method builds on a novel formulation of\nthe $N$-dimensional joint intensity distribution by representing the common\nanatomy as latent variables and estimating the appearance model with\nnonparametric estimators. Through connection to maximum likelihood and the\nexpectation-maximization algorithm, an information\\hyp{}theoretic metric called\n$\\mathcal{X}$-metric and a co-registration algorithm named $\\mathcal{X}$-CoReg\nare induced, allowing groupwise registration of the $N$ observed images with\ncomputational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. Moreover, the method naturally\nextends for a weakly-supervised scenario where anatomical labels of certain\nimages are provided. This leads to a combined\\hyp{}computing framework\nimplemented with deep learning, which performs registration and segmentation\nsimultaneously and collaboratively in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of\nour model, including multimodal groupwise registration, motion correction for\ndynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images, and deep combined\ncomputing for multimodal medical images. Results show the superiority of our\nmethod in various applications in terms of both accuracy and efficiency,\nhighlighting the advantage of the proposed representation of the imaging\nprocess.\n</p>",
