  "description": "This week, the gals unleash some wild stories of furry and feathered witnesses. Topics include the real-life four-legged CSI team, a bloody crime scene with a single hair of evidence, and some very good reasons not to f*ck with parrots. Pop open a beautiful bottle of Winc's Folly of the Beast Pinot Noir, drop that lint roller, and tell Alexa to tune in for Crimes Solved by Animals.",
