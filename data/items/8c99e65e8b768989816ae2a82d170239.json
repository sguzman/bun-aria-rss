But, what I'm concerned about, is what's going to happen when the money dries up. If you're not in because it's your truth you're not going to be able to make it out when things get hard and that's what worries me. </div> </div> <p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5422441.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
