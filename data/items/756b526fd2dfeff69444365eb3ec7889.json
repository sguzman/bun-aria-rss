  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys chat a little bit more about Bird Box and the absurdity of 45,000,000+ accounts viewing it, Bill Murray being an incredible human being, whether or not actors and actresses read their terrible reviews, a Dutch astronaut accidentally calling 911 from the International Space Station, and discuss what people have been eating for the weight loss challenge. Todd wants to know if the guys could change the ending of any movie, what they would change and how. They also answer some listener questions including what guilty pleasures they would give up which sends the conversation off the rails a bit, and if they could play for any NFL team, which they would choose. As always, the guys each send in some Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. It's a wild one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @evanfoxy.</p>\n",
