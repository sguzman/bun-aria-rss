  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the January 6 committee leaked information to the media but there's only one problem, it's a lie. While Democrats claimed that there was a gap in President Trump's phone records but a review of records from the National Archives shows that there are no missing logs or phone calls as the whole story was fabricated by Pelosi's January 6th Committee to diminish any future campaigns for public office by Trump. Then, Democrats will go anywhere and do anything to get information. The Democrats were happy to meet Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, Bachir Asaad, and any other despots they could make friends with. Are the Democrats and the media embarrassed at their enabling of fake news? Will Chuck Todd resign so that NBC's first transgender minority host can take his place? Later, the border crisis continues and the Democrats hate America and hate you. Watch their actions; Biden's never proud of America or its people, he trashes you and he embraces the radicals. Afterward, Sen. Rick Scott calls in to discuss his 11 step plan to rescue the country. Scott added that simply running against Biden is not enough, Republicans need a cohesive agenda that promotes family and good governance and take action on it immediately.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
