  "description": "<p>In this episode, Middlekauff discusses the prolonged excellence of Dew Brees, where he would rank all-time with another Super Bowl, why he doesn't buy that the Seahawks and Packers are the top teams in the NFC despite currently being the top two seeds, the insurmountable curse of bad ownership, and the upcoming massive Eagles/Cowboys NFC East matchup.
