  "description": "<p>As the next-generation wireless networks thrive, full-duplex and relay\ntechniques are combined to improve the network performance. Random linear\nnetwork coding (RLNC) is another popular technique to enhance the efficiency\nand reliability of wireless communications. In this paper, in order to explore\nthe potential of RLNC in full-duplex relay networks, we investigate two\nfundamental perfect RLNC schemes and theoretically analyze their completion\ndelay performance. The first scheme is a straightforward application of\nconventional perfect RLNC studied in wireless broadcast, so it involves no\nadditional process at the relay. Its performance serves as an upper bound for\nall perfect RLNC schemes. The other scheme allows sufficiently large buffer and\nunconstrained linear coding at the relay. It attains the optimal performance\nand serves as a lower bound for all RLNC schemes. For both schemes, closed-form\nformulae to characterize the expected completion delay at a single receiver as\nwell as for the whole system are derived. Numerical results are also\ndemonstrated to validate the theoretical characterizations, and compare the two\nfundamental schemes with the existing one.\n</p>",
