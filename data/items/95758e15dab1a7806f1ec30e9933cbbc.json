  "title": "Bethenny Frankel and Questionable Celebrity Retreat with Josh Wolf.",
  "description": "Don't forget;) I am on tour! Get tickets at heathermcdonald.net\n\nJosh Wolf is here! We talk about the childhood traumas that made us who we are today, and I share my plan of how easy it would be to kidnap a child. Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen are getting divorced, and Josh and I debate which of the two would be a better catch and what age is the best to get divorced at. Could you be a serial killer according to your star sign? Does Josh think Ted Bundy is hot? The Try Guys scandal sucked me in, and I have some advice for Ned. Juicy Scoop assignment of the week is to watch a Friend Of The Family on Peacock. Chet Hanks has a life coaching program, and Merri from Sistewives is hosting a weekend retreat with no information but the price. Madonna is scaring children more than that masked daycare worker. Watch Josh’s new show on youtube!
