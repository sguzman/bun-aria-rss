  "title": "Tuesday Night Football Recap: Titans blast Bills, Jets release Le'Veon Bell (Football 10/14)",
  "description": "Well, Tuesday Night Football happened. And while it didn't necessarily live up to the hype, it still gave us some talking points for this rare recap episode in the middle of the week. The Titans seem to be for real, but how serious of a threat are they in the AFC? Were the primetime lights too bright for Josh Allen? Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech share their thoughts on the matchup before getting to the serious stuff as they discuss the most disrespectful stiff-arms of all-time after another epic one from Derrick Henry. By the way, download and subscribe to Qué Golazo. That plug will make more sense if you listen to the pod. Before we go, the Superfriends chat about the Jets release of Le'Veon Bell. Does he regret leaving the Steelers after a tumultuous season and a half in New York? Brinson, Wilson and Breech also discuss possible landing spots for the former All Pro. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
