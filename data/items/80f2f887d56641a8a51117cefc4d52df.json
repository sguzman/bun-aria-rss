  "description": "While multi-cloud brings significant benefits, it also poses serious security risks. And identity is the reason. Each cloud platform, such as Azure, Google, and AWS, uses proprietary identity systems, and the lack of interoperability makes it unruly to manage. These disparate systems can’t talk to each other resulting in a fragmented environment full of identity silos — the perfect way for an attacker to get in and cause destruction.\nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, the CyberWire's CSO, Chief Analyst, and Senior Fellow, Rick Howard, is joined in the first half by Hash Table member Rick Doten, the CISO for Healthcare Enterprises and Centene. In the second half of the show, CyberWire podcast host Dave Bittner talks with our episode sponsor Strata Identity's CEO and Co-founder Eric Olden. Both sets of discussions center around the challenges to identity management caused by the rapid shift to multi-cloud.",
