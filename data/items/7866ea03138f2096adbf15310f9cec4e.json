  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dishes pile up. The kids run circles around the house. The to-do list is a mile long. Motherhood is full, but too often, we fill our time hunching over our phones, giving our best self to social media instead of looking up at the work in front of us. When we don’t know where to begin, social media feels like a welcome distraction. But when our days are consumed by social media, we might miss the most important things. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss faithfulness in motherhood, examining the way it impacts our limited time and energy. When we give God first place in our hearts and steward the responsibilities before us, we can use social media as a tool rather than an escape.</span></p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of</span> <em><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bread of</span></em></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life: Savoring the All Satisfying Goodness of Jesus Through the Art of Breadmaking</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Abigail Dodds.
