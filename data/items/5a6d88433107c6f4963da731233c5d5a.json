  "description": "Thousands of National Guard members are in D.C. for the inauguration, and it’s a frightening sight. Gwyneth Paltrow is leaving acting behind, and Greta Thunberg will have her own stamp. Joe Biden’s proposed Cabinet is riddled with connections to Big Tech and financial giants, and Glenn shows how dedicated many of them are to the Great Reset and addressing climate change. Glenn shares his fears of what might occur next week and urges listeners to stay safe and aware. The oddly communist-looking poster that called for armed protests at all state capitols appears to be a rip-off of one for a liberal election watch party.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
