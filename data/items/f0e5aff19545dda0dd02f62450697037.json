  "description": "The gloves are off: Biden drops to the lowest ever in CNN poll. Late-night comics, including Jimmy Fallon and Trevor Noah, turn on Biden. Fallon, usually, Clay says, the least political late-night host, suggested in joke form that maybe Biden might want to follow Fauci into his announced retirement. The Democrats do not have a very deep bench for 2024. Clay and Buck discuss why Governor Newsom of California is going to be the front-runner -- even though the best choice would be Joe Manchin. Listen to why Clay says Mayor Pete would not work for the black male vote. If San Diego students do not want to wear a mask, administrators say they should \"just not return.\" Buck says, \"Zoom school is not school.\" The astonishing data that may prove masks DON'T work as covid cases in Singapore and New Zealand OVERTAKE Australia despite SUPER strict mandates. Twitter asks judge for speedy trial to force Musk to complete purchase. Buck says don't shame Musk for his \"dad\" beach body.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
