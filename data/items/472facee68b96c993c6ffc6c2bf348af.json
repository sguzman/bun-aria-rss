  "description": "<p>The season 3 finale of \"Below Deck\" ended with some good ol' fashioned slut shaming, thanks to Eddie the bosun.  First he denied that he'd slept with Rocky, then he made her seem like she was the crazy one, then he bragged about it, and then he accused her of being a predator.  Gross.  Ben Mandelker (bsideblog.com) and Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) dive into this season finale and tear it all apart.</p>\n<p>Then it's on to the series premiere of \"The Real Housewives of Cheshire.\"  They're tacky, funny, and strangely accented.  Hearing Ben and Ronnie attempt to imitate them is akin to a science experiment gone very, very wrong.</p>\n<p>And then, just for fun, there's talk of Patti Labelle's sweet potato pie.</p>\n<p>Remember to support us on http://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\nFollow us at http://facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\nVisit us at http://watchwhatcrappens.com<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
