But strangely enough, Mr. Darcy's manners are completely transformed. Might he actually be civil, and dare we say, pleasant? This is far too much for Elizabeth to take in. She is ready to rest after such an eventful day, and you will be too with tonight's relaxing story.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Jane Austen Bedtime Stories podcast! Each episode is a section of a classic Jane Austen novel, read in soothing tones and set to calming music to help you fall asleep.</p>\n<p>With everything that is going on in the world, we find comfort in the familiar. For so many of us, Jane Austen's works are like a warm hug. So snuggle up under the covers and let the comforting words of Jane Austen lull you into sleep.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Music [\"Reverie\"] by Scott Buckley – www.scottbuckley.com.au</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/jabedtimepod/support</a>",
