  "description": "The rage mobs strike again, and now we’re not allowed to say “INVASION.” We may be at the peak of a massively tribalistic “WE” generation, but social media could course-correct us faster than we expected. Journalist Elijah Schaffer joins the program with his FIRSTHAND look at last Saturday’s Proud Boys/Antifa protests in Portland. Long story short, instead of swinging back at oppression, we should learn from the peaceful protests in Hong Kong. And while Bill Maher HOPES for a recession, we should read the fine print and focus more on our growing debt. Corporations are also making some strange decisions: the NFL is teaming up with Jay-Z, and author Michael Rectenwald believes that Google is PUSHING for authoritarian-style constant surveillance. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
