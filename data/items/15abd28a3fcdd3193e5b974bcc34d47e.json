  "title": "Kirk Minihane Defends the Right to Be Naked at Home",
  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane welcomes Blind Mike back into the studio to cover the media uproar over Tom Brady's cameo in Paul Rudd's Netflix show, an interesting look at Howard Stern's past commentary on LGBTQ issues following his appearance on Ellen Degeneres' show, and new \"outrage\" over Halloween costumes. Commonwealth School headmaster Bill Wharton, a close friend of Bob Murchison, refuses to come on the show because he's worried that Minihane will take him out of context... Shirley Leung also declines an interview but only because reception is so bad on the T. The crew discovers a new radio bit --Cupcake Talk -- and checks a few states off of Minihane's birthday request list. Plus, Matt Fuller might come on the show. Maybe.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
