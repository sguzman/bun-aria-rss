Who is our favorite rookie RB (3:10)? And we'll take a quick detour to give you your news and notes (6:35) as Tee Higgins had shoulder surgery, there is a Darren Waller trade rumor and Alvin Kamara's hearing was pushed to August ... Evaluating the 2022 RB class (12:30), we talk about how it stacks up to last year's class, when we expect to see these guys get drafted and who could make an impact other than Breece Hall and Ken Walker ... Which veteran NFL players have the most to gain or lose? We discuss Javonte Williams (20:30), Juju Smith-Schuster (23:30), Elijah Moore (28:35) and Antonio Gibson (29:30) as potential losers while Aaron Rodgers (31:00), Kyle Pitts (33:15) and some young QBs (35:15) could be big winners if their teams get them some help.
