  "description": "<p>COMMUNICATE YOUR VISION. Being an effective leader is difficult. Some do it through fear. Some do it through understanding. And others lead with love. You could be super demanding and scary and get what you want. But is that the kind of life you want to lead? Probably not. Often, leading in a way where you understand other people’s concerns will be the most beneficial to you. There’s a lot you can learn from others. Ask yourself: how can you bring people together in a way that satisfies their needs as well as your own? For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with the legendary director Jon Chu where he shared how he communicates his vision on set. Jon Chu directed the films Crazy Rich Asians, Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D,  and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Jon graduated from the USC School of Cinema-Television where he won the Princess Grace Award, the Dore Schary Award presented by the Anti-Defamation League, the Jack Nicholson directing award, and was recognized as an honoree for the IFP/West program Project: Involve. Learn how to enlist others in your vision and lead with love on Episode 805.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nThe kind of leader Jon wants to be (1:00)<br />\nThe importance of synergy in creativity (1:30)<br />\nThe most important thing Jon has learned about communicating his vision (1:45)<br />\nHow to talk to people who have concerns about your vision (2:30)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode check out the show notes and more at http://lewishowes.com/810 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes.</p>\n",
