  "description": "You’ve got to take what the market gives you.  Genia Turanova, editor of Unlimited Income and Moneyflow Trader here at Curzio Research, breaks down the current market environment from a macro level—including why valuations could remain elevated for the foreseeable future, given the actions of the Fed. We discuss the role interest rates play in valuations… which sectors to watch as economic lockdowns are lifted… and how investors can generate yield in today’s tough environment. And, since we all know the market can turn on a dime, Genia also shares the proper way to hedge your portfolio. [27:55] Then, Daniel and I discuss the incredible results from Lowe’s… the housing market... rising interest yields... Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent Q&A… and of course, bitcoin.
