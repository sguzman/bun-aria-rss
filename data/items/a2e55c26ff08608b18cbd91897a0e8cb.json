The S&P 500 (SP500) was up 2.4%, with the Nasdaq (COMP) 3% higher even after a drop of 0.6% on Friday.\nCryptos rallied this week on the back of the intensifying NFT craze.

Cruise lines sold off, with Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) falling 8% for the week and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) giving up 4%. Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) shares dropped 3% and GE (NYSE:GE) declined 10% after a surprise reverse stock split proposal.
