  "description": "This month on Outward hosts Christina Cauterucci, Bryan Lowder, and New America’s Brandon Tensley find out what it means to be radical. October is Gay History month and so we’re honoring those radical queers who started to advocate for gay rights. First they’ve got a compilation of radicalization moments from important queer figures, those times the felt pulled into the fight. Thank you to the Making Gay History podcast for the use of their archival tape. Then they sit down with Angela Peoples formerly of No Justice No Pride, and Brandon Cuicchi of Reclaim Pride to discuss how Pride parades have become commercialized and what they’re doing to take them back. Finally, the gang plays the game ‘Radder Than Thou’ where they debate which of two topics are more radical.  \nPodcast production by Daniel Schroeder\nLearn more about your ad choices.
