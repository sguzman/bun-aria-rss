  "description": "<p>In this episode, Middlekauff explains why he agrees with the Packers and Eagles taking Jordan Love and Jalen Hurts as a backups for Aaron Rodgers and Carson Wentz, why the Cowboys should make Dak Prescott prove he can win with a stacked roster - now featuring CeeDee Lamb - this season before giving him a long-term extension, and why the Niners and Kyle Shanahan won big by waiting to replace Joe Staley with Trent Williams instead of using their first round pick. He also gives some draft winners and losers and answers questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
