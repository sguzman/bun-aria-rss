They also discuss the 'forgotten combover' that was Johnny Carson. Later they turn to the phones and speak to a caller with thoughts on President Biden's pledge to nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court. They also speak to a caller out of Seattle who recently had a mask confrontation that he wants to tell the guys about.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\n1800Flowers.com, code ADS\nOverland.com/ADS\nJustWorks.com\nGeico.com\nMagbreakthrough.com/ADAMDREW",
