  "description": "As I began my CSR Co-op position this year, I wanted to see up-close how a corporate foundation works. What I've found is that the work the Akamai Foundation does around the world is inspiring! Whether it's partnering with STEM educators, responding to the COVID-19 crisis, planning employee volunteerism efforts, or creating a hardship fund to support our community, what we do here has a positive impact across the globe. And, thanks to this co-op opportunity, I've been able to play a real part in driving this impact forward.",
