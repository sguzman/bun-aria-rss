  "description": "<p>This week, we’re are talking about one of the most crucial aspects of successful leadership––developing others. You see, John Maxwell says, “One is too small of a number to achieve greatness.” Everything that you will accomplish as a leader ultimately hinges on the people you have around you. And it’s your responsibility as a leader to engage and empower your people to be their best selves and do their best work. So today, John Maxwell is going to teach us about engaging and developing others.</p> <p>During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow discuss developing others from the very start––the hiring process. They also provide some application to help you apply this to your own leadership.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Engaging and Developing Others Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Engage and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Everyone-Communicates-Few-Connect-Hardcover_p_2783.html\"> <em>Everyone Communicates, Few Connect by John C.
