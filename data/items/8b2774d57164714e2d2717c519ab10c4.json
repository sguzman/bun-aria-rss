He was welcomed in by a family friend in Pittsburgh and soon realized that destructive behavior was not limited to a certain geographical location. However, due to his desire to question everything the circumstances had a different result. Through insight and self-reflection he transformed his entire life from being a self-identified dumb kid to being the Chief Love Officer of his own company.
