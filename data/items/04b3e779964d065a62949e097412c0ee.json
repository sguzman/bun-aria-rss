  "title": "Ep 90 Human African Trypanosomiasis: A lot to unpack",
  "description": "Here on the podcast, we’re no strangers to multi-host parasites with complicated life cycles, intricate ecologies and dense human histories. But human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) might require the most unpacking yet. In this episode, we do a deep dive into the tsetse fly-transmitted HAT, whose other name, sleeping sickness, doesn’t quite capture just how deadly this parasitic infection can be. First, we ask how these two trypanosomes cause the signs and symptoms they do, especially the strange sleep disruptions that gave this neglected tropical disease one of its names. Then, after a brief detour discussing the fascinating ability of tsetse flies to give live birth, we explore the many political and ecological factors that set the stage for the devastating HAT epidemics of the early 20th century. We wrap up the episode with a look at the current global status of HAT, and with new, effective, and easy-to-administer drugs on the scene along with a downward trend in cases, we’re certainly hopeful for the future elimination of this disease.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
