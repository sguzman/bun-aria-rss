We hear a cool shart, play Horrible or Hilarious, and Christy shares how nuts grow and a fun new game she plays with Chase O'Donnell at restaurants. We have a new FedSmoker clip where he meets a genuine fan, we check in on the reincarnation of FedSmoker getting kicked out of the gym, and talk about some of the most wild deep fakes we've seen. We also review some legal documents a mommy made for Tom to possibly sue Garth Brooks with for restricting his Instagram account. See you next week!</p>\n",
