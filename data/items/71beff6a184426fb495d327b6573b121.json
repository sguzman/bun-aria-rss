  "description": "<p>In Leicestershire, England the ruins of a religious settlement can be found that was once the Grace Dieu Priory.  Despite the fact that not much of the stone structure still stands today, people from all around the world come to visit the site for various reasons.  Some are tourists interested in the history.  Other visitors are interested in the esoteric and come to the ruins seeking the spiritual.  They believe the ruins lie on top of ley lines.  Still others come because of their interest in things unseen.  Reportedly, the stones of the priory are not the only vestiges still here.  The spirits of those who have come before seem to remain.  Grace Dieu Priory is haunted. Moment in Oddity features the Nazca Lines and This Day in History features the Cripple Creek's Miner Strike.</p> <p>Check out the official website here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Check out the show notes, links and pictures here:  <a href=\"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-26-grace-dieu-priory.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-podcast-26-grace-dieu-priory.html</a></p> <p> </p>",
