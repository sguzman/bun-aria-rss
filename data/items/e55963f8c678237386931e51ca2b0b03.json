  "description": "<p>On the one year anniversary of his start at Barstool Sports, one thing is clear: Kirk was right. He was right about Mayor Joe Curtatone, he was right about Benjamin Allbright, he was right about the Wilbur Theater, he was right about Entercom, he was right about Madawaska, he was right about Kmarko, he was right about... well, everything. The crew reflects on one wacky year in show business, dissects an awful segment of monologue radio on WEEI, and prepares for yet another controversial segment on Sirius XM - Power 85.
