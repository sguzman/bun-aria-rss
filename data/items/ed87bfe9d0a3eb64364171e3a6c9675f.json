  "description": "<p>We don’t know what the results will be yet, but Massachusetts voters will definitely elect a new governor on Nov. 8, with Republican Charlie Baker stepping aside after two terms. That is among the closely-watched state races in this midterm cycle. Nationally, Republicans are hoping to make inroads in key House and Senate races as they bid to regain control in Washington. For perspective, we speak with former two-term Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat who is now teaching at Harvard.</p>",
