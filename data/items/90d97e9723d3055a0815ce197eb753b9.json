But as he proudly states, all these are just steps toward a much greater calling: building a nationwide network to help others like him overcome addiction and have a second chance at life. Mike discusses his new book, “What Are the Odds: From Crack Addict to CEO,” and recounts his miraculous story of addiction, entrepreneurship, and hope for the nation.\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\nLosing your hair sucks!
