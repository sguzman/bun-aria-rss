  "description": "--Some exciting pre-show banter definitely not left unintentionally in the audio\n--Reminder that Ole Miss/Arkansas is on this week, and unless it involves converting a 4th and 25 on a backwards pass it probably can't top last year\n--A definitive discussion of who gets purpler: Alex Jones or Brian Kelly?\n--Also a diversion into the oldest software in use to discuss college football on the internet, aka ND NATION, and a look at just how bad the rest of the season could be for Notre Dame. Put on Stanford/Notre Dame on the screen on your fridge! Let it simmer there for a while, like a fine reduction.\n--This is not a short conversation, we mock Notre Dame for at least ten minutes\n--MICHIGAN WE KNOW YOU'RE SMART, YOU TELL YOURSELVES AND US THAT ALL THE TIME\n--\n--Who in the top ten is secretly assy, and about to display said assedness in the second half of the season? (Baaaaaadgers)\n--More desperate thrashing to create an argument against Alabama winning their game against Tennessee this week\n--Reader Kenny probably totally hates Ryan, but we let him stay at the party anyway and answer his question about Baylor probably hiring Sonny Dykes\n--This leads to noticing the Big 12 is pretty much loaded with gun-toting mascots, or those who need them immediately\n--Why Ohio State will play just fine this weekend against Wisconsin and still get dinged for it\n--Teams that don't have live mascots who need live mascots, like the Indiana Hoosiers, who just need a regular guy from Indiana to sit on the sidelines in a sweatshirt and cheap jeans\n--West Virginia's only played four games? Cool, on that throwback schedule\n--WAKE FOREST PLAYING FSU WITH A BETTER ACC RECORD ON THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 30-0 IN TALLY ALL IN LET'S GO DO IT FOR GHOST ARNOLD PALMER\n--Jim Harbaugh drinking milk, it's just gross, man\nLearn more about your ad choices.
