  "description": "Daniel’s back in the office and I rib him about taking a sick day… the day before his birthday! [0:30] Markets continue to be volatile around the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We discuss Russia’s latest “peacekeeping missions”... and why Biden’s sanctions will actually help the Kremlin. [2:45] I point out the huge difference in public perception between Russia and China… and why the U.S. (wrongly) takes a different approach in its dealings with these two countries. [7:50] Hopefully the Russia-Ukraine situation is a short-term problem for markets… and once it resolves, it could be the perfect time to buy oil stocks and other commodity-related plays. [11:45] Speaking of commodities, coal is surging—and the price will remain elevated for the foreseeable future. While “coal” is a swear-word in most investing circles… investors in this commodity stand to make a ton of money. [14:00] Another swear-word in the investing world: Uranium. We share why we’re shocked prices aren’t much higher. [19:55] Turning to inflation… markets continue to anticipate multiple interest rate hikes this year. JPMorgan thinks we’ll see nine in a row. Daniel and I debate whether the Fed will be aggressive enough… and Daniel explains why rising oil prices will give the Fed some wiggle room. [24:15] Virgin Galactic, a popular SPAC, is making headlines following its earnings report. I break down why SPACs are terrible for individual investors—for the most part… And whether there’s any value to Trump’s SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). [32:30] Enjoyed this episode?
