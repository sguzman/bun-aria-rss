  "description": "<p>Today we’re looking at a phenomenon that happens to all of us: losing our baby teeth and getting new ones! So how do our teeth grow in and what makes them fall out? Naturally, a group of wandering teeth helps us explain. We'll also find out why we have two sets of teeth in the first place. A chatty tooth travel agent will introduce us to all the different ways to send our baby teeth off in style and we'll play a game that will test your knowledge of animal teeth. Plus, the Moment of Um answers the question \"Why do bees make a buzzing sound?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can support Brains On at <a href=\"http://brainson.org/fans\" class=\"c-link\">brainson.org/fans</a> — there you can donate, join our free fan club, check out our merch or buy our book!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Bobby Wonder podcast (<a href=\"http://gokidgo.com/\" class=\"default\">gokidgo.com</a> or subscribe to Bobby Wonder on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts)</p>\n",
