  "description": "<p>Ohulloh! This is not your regular Ologies episode (which will come on Tuesday per usual.) It’s actually not an Ologies episode! This is a fun little bonus GUEST podcast we're dropping in our feed. Real Good is a show that started during the beginning of COVID to highlight different non-profits helping with the pandemic — but soon revealed that many problems that became so acute during quarantine had existed in people's lives for a long time prior. We care a lot about the issues they address (race, class, gender, mental health, affordable housing, etc.) so we were down to partner up with Real Good and share an episode of theirs with the always thoughtful, kind, and generous Ologies audience in our own feed.</p>\n<p>This is the second episode of their second season entitled \"Just Admitting It Isn't Enough with Lynda Negron.” Lynda served as program director of an anti-implicit bias training organization. If you dig the show you can subscribe to it wherever you get your podcasts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/real-good\">https://www.stitcher.com/show/real-good</a></p>\n<p>And this Tuesday, get ready for the usual Ologies fare, as we deep dive with the most boopable aquatic beasts.
