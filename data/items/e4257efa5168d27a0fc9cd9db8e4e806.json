  "description": "<p>We give a little shout out from the road! We talk about our first 5 days on the Carolina Road Trip, places we've visited and things we have done, especially the ghost tours! No experiences so far, but good stories. Ever heard of the Boo Hag? This is a very popular legend in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. We share that and a bit of the Gullah culture. We also met Mike Brown of Pleasing Terrors - one of the highlights so far. The top highlight has been the wild horses of Shackleford Banks!</p>",
