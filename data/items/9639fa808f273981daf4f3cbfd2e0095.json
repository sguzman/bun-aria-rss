  "description": "Hey everyone, we’re still out on maternity leave. (You like how I said “we”??) This week we’re bringing you a classic episode that’s been making the headlines recently. \nNational Geographic has reported that scientists using animation software from the movie Frozen have determined what really happens to the hikers of the Dyatlov pass incident. \nDid they finally prove that the KGB stalked the hikers and took them out? Or did they find evidence of a yeti? Aliens? Olaf?\nNot quite. They’re saying it was a simple explanation - the hikers perished in an avalanche. But listen on, because there is a mountain of evidence that points to a much more sinister explanation. \nAfter checking out this throwback episode, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, mixed bags, Wheel segments and Am I the Asshole questions - where Reddit users ask whether they're acting like assholes and we judge them!\nEnjoy the episode! Thanks so much and keep it creepy\nNine hikers go missing on a treacherous and difficult hike up, what some call, Dead Mountain. Russian Military, aliens, bigfoot - who or what is to blame for the Dyatlov Pass incident?\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
