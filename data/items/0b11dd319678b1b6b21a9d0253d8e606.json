  "title": "Janet Mock: The Path to Authenticity: Embracing the Otherness",
  "description": "<p>In a live appearance at UCLA’s Royce Hall, New York Times best-selling author and transgender advocate Janet Mock says she grew up “othered” and was taught that “normal” was the path to success and contentment. However, what she learned was something entirely different. Janet speaks about the deep space of lack in marginalized communities caused by a society that closes its eyes to the problems of people who are different. No matter where you are in life, Janet says, there's one question we all need to ask ourselves: “Who am I to me?” Janet believes that asking herself this question led to answers that emboldened her and built the foundation on which she stands today. With deeply personal stories and humorous memories, Janet shares what she calls her path to authenticity.</p>\n",
