Problem is you have about 1000 of them and it screws you up on your latest \"overhaul.\" Today is part one. There are so many stupid rules out there this topic needs two episodes! We cover: Should I eat fat? What exactly is a healthy fat? Do you eat real dressing or low fat? How much water do I need and why do I even need it? Count calories or not? Are macros important? Should I stop eating at certain time of day. It's a load of good information that will likely surprise you!</p> <p> </p>",
