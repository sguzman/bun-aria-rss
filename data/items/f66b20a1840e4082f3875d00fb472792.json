He tells Bloomberg's Caroline Hepker and Yuan Potts that Labour has not been nearly aggressive enough in highlighting the mess the government has made. He says the Tory leadership campaign has been 'incredibly dispiriting' and that Liz Truss has no sense of the scale of the issues that await her in Number 10, if she becomes the next leader. Also in the show, our reporters Philip Aldrick and Emily Ashton discuss the challenges facing the next Prime Minister.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
