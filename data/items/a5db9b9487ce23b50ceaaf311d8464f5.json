  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Listeners, your portfolio may be in danger. The chances of rate hikes are getting significantly stronger - but will this actually help our economy? Before my guest signs on, I'll be giving investors my thoughts on the next \"black swan\" event. You heard it here first. Then, for today's show, I'm joined by Jordan Trimble - President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources. Jordan and I talk about one sector that will soon face huge tailwinds now that Trump is president. Due to depressed prices, however, investors must be patient. Nobody (including industry leaders) can even make profits right now. But as Jordan explains, this sector is poised for a HUGE turnaround in 2017 - leaving investors with an extremely rare opportunity. Also, I just got back from the 2016 Silver & Gold Summit in San Francisco - where I spoke and met with some of the world’s top precious metals investors and entrepreneurs. For those that couldn't attend... I'm here to bring you everything you missed for this week's Educational Segment [50:20]. This includes a few companies that should be on everyone's radar. As well as a sector that flat-out has too much hype.",
