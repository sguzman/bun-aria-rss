    "media:description": "Medical Imaging | Waves | Physics | FuseSchool\n\nIf only we were all given a window so a doctor could look inside us when we were ill.Think of the operations that would save! Luckily there are now many ways we can see what is happening deep inside our bodies by using electromagnetic waves and sound waves.\n\nLetâ€™s look at example techniques used in medical imaging in this video!\n\nInfra red. X-Rays. Gamma rays. Radio waves. Ultrasound.\n\nCREDITS\nAnimation & Design: Waldi Apollis\nNarration: Dale Bennett\nScript: Alistair Haynes\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
