  "description": "<p>Get ready for one helluva tale. Today's story is so crazy. The promising beginning, insane planning, and tragic pre-life-in-prison final acts of Taylor Helzer are hard to wrap one's mind around. Taylor grew up as a devout Mormon, a no-drug, no-sex, no-profanity, law-abiding-citizen until shortly after returning home from his two-year Mormon mission at the age of 21. Then he got married, quickly grew dissatisfied with married life, then started coming up with a preposterously delusional plan to take over the Mormon church using Brazilian orphan-assassins and money he'd made with a weird escort business. If you like weird, WTF? stories - this one's for you. <br /><br /><strong>Vimeo link to new standup special</strong>: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dancumminsgetouttahere\">https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dancumminsgetouttahere</a><br />Only $0.99 to rent between 5PM and 9PM, April 28th.
