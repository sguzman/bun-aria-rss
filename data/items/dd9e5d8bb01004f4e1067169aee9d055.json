  "description": "In this episode, host Julie Gurner talks to a fascinating mentor-mentee pair who have become successful collaborators in the culinary world: Chef and Restaurateur Gavin Kaysen and Executive Chef Chris Nye. \nGavin Kaysen is a two-time James Beard Award-winning chef and owner of Soigné Hospitality Group.  When he was starting his career in New York City, Gavin worked under world-renowned chef Daniel Boulud who became his mentor. He went on to spend seven years as Boulud’s Executive Chef and Director of Culinary Operations. Gavin continued that tradition of mentorship with Chris Nye, who he met when Chris was working the line at Café Boulud. Today, Kaysen helps the next generation of young chefs as one of the founders of Ment’or, a leading nonprofit organization devoted to inspiring culinary excellence in young professionals. \nWhether you’re paired up through a program or your partnership forms organically, a mentor-mentee relationship can be an invaluable professional asset. A mentor can be the guide who jumpstarts your ambition, sharpens your focus, and nudges you to take a risk. Alternately, a mentee can inspire an industry veteran with fresh perspectives and surprising insights. And like any relationship, success requires work, communication, and dedication from both parties. \nDownload and subscribe to The Relentless on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Spotify, TuneIn, Overcast, or wherever you listen.\n\nThis paid podcast is produced by Slate Studios and Century 21 Real Estate.\n© 2020 Century 21 Real Estate LLC.
