  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the NHL being back on ESPN, the Penguins big win over the Tampa Bay Lightning last night, the Vegas Golden Knights beating the Seattle Kraken, whether or not Vegas is the toughest barn in the NHL, Criss Angel's halftime performance in last week's Raiders game, and why Vegas is slowly becoming one of the entertainment hot spot's in the sports world. They also cover the info coming out that now ties Adam Schefter to Bruce Allen and more fallout from that whole situation with the NFL going through 650,000+ emails. Joining the program for Coach Us Up Wednesday's is a man who has dedicated almost his entire life to coaching, the former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano. Pat, AJ, and Chuck chat about the Jon Gruden situation and when you know if you've lost the locker room, what it's like having to talk to a guy like Andrew Luck or Joe Burrow about not getting killed, when you know when you trust your field goal kicker, where the Raiders go from here, if MCDC has to cry every week if the Lions lose, and much more (33:35-57:38). Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, incredible golfer, and WR for the Minnesota Vikings, Adam Thielen, joins the show. Pat, Adam, and AJ chat about the atmosphere in the locker room right now, if Kirk Cousins and Mike Zimmer hate each other, how he adapts his route tree throughout the season, staying engaged in games when he isn't getting the ball, why all he wants to do is win, and much more (57:42-1:15:15).
