Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy and chairman of GoldMining, joins me today to talk uranium and  [13:41].  You may be aware that President Trump will make his decision on  by July 15. This is a major petition that could force utility companies to buy uranium from U.S.-based producers… And Amir gives his prediction on what Trump will do. Next… the yellow metal has been on a tear, breaking through the $1,400 level for the first time in six years. Amir breaks down the gold markets… where gold is going… and how he’s positioning GoldMining to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. On a final note… I recently flew back to Florida from New York and, well, it didn’t go as planned…   Get ready for a classic rant. -------------------------------- Editor’s note: With the crypto market on a tear, we’ve had a crazy amount of renewed interest in our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token. It gives accredited investors a stake in our fast-growing business… and it’s one of the few ways to gain exposure to the multibillion-dollar financial publishing industry.
