  "description": "Our first August rebroadcast was John and Pu's 2019 interview with SF superstar Cixin Liu (you may want to re-listen to that episode before this one!). Here, they reflect on the most significant things that Liu had said, and to ponder the political situation for contemporary Chinese writers who come to the West to discuss their work.\nThey consider whether our world is like a cabinet in a basement, and what kind of optimism or pessimism might be available to science fiction writers. They compare the interview to a recent profile of Liu in The New Yorker, and ponder the advantages and disadvantages of pressing writers to weigh in on the hot-button topics of the day.\nDiscussed in this episode:\n\nCixin Liu, The Three Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death’s End\n\n\nJiayang Fan, “Liu Cixin’s War of the Worlds” (New Yorker interview/profile)\n\nYuri Slezkine, The House of Government: A Saga of the Russian Revolution\n\n\nIsaac Asimov, The End of Eternity\n\n\nGeorge Melies (dir.), A Voyage to the Moon\n\n\nFritz Lang (dir.), Metropolis\n\n\nFrant Gwo (dir.), The Wandering Earth\n\n\nIvan Goncharov, Oblomov\n\n\n\nTranscript available here.\nElizabeth Ferry is Professor of Anthropology at Brandeis University.
