And all Aurate pieces come with a lifetime warranty because they know it lasts. Aurate sells direct to you without the middleman markup, so they can offer the same quality as traditional 5th Avenue brands, but at a fraction of the cost. Their jewelry is ethically made in New York City, and for every piece sold, a child in need receives a book to further their education.
