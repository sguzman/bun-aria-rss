  "description": "F is for friends who do stuff together U is for U and Me…\nWelcome back Slootiez. This week we’re keepin’ it short and sweet in preparation for doomsday next week…aka Valentines Day. ANYWAYS - we cover the most important news of the 21st century this week aka Rihanna being pregnant. While we are SO happy for our kween, we’re already manifesting ways to figure out how we can come back in our next lives as her second child. We also go into a serious but necessary Sloot University regarding friendship. Not just friendship by itself, but being a friend when it’s HARD to be a friend. Everyone speaks so openly about mental illness, but how much do you really show up for your friends who are suffering from it? Today we’re learning how to show up for others while still saving time for ourselves. If there’s one thing about Sloots is that we stick TOGETHER, even when the going gets tough. \nNational Suicide Hotline: 800-273-8255\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nOK Cupid: Download OK Cupid from the App Store or Google Play today!\nDipsea: http://dipsea.com/SOFIA for 30 days full access\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
