  "description": "On today’s show, we venture into the power of lost humanity. The tragedy of those on the precipice of turning into something more. What happens when you paint your face with enchantment? Or refuse to make your exit on the stage of life? Perhaps a book contains what’s left of you. Or would you give in to a full transformation? These are the invocations of the damned. First, a terrifying makeup tutorial transformation. Next, the girl in theater wants to haunt you. After that, poetic words seal a soul in a book. And finally, beware the power of the wolfpaw.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
