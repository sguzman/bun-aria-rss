  "description": "Daniel E. Dawes has written 150 Years of ObamaCare (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016). Dawes is the executive director of health policy and external affairs at Morehouse School of Medicine and a lecturer within Morehouse’s Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Department of Community Health and Preventive Medicine. In 150 Years of ObamaCare, Dawes tells the long and often forgotten history of the nearly two century fight for health care equity that culminated in the passage of the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare. He draws on his role as a leader in a large coalition of organizations that helped shape ObamaCare, revealing what went on behind the scenes. He illustrates this with copies of letters and e-mails written by those who worked to craft and pass the law. Ultimately, Dawes argues that ObamaCare is much more comprehensive in the historical context of previous reform efforts that go back to the Civil War.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
