  "description": "Breakup with your girlfriend, I’m bored\nAnd so are you, so it’s time. There is NOTHING worse than that grey area of KNOWING your relationship has ran its course, but being too much of a pussy to end it so you end up staying WAY too long…and it ultimately ends in disaster. No judgement though Sloots, because we’ve all been there before. That’s why this week Sofia is encouraging you and telling you exactly how to rip the bandaid off. Recording live from LA…still, Sofia recounts her past week in the city of Angels and why she will never be allowed back (that’s if she ever leaves to begin with). Finally, we have some new BJ tips for you all, because there’s never too many tricks to have up your sleeve! \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\n\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/\nEpisode promo codes:\nCalm: http://calm.com/SOFIA for 40% off a premium subscription\nNoom: http://noom.com/SOFIA\nTalkspace: htttp://talkspace.com promo code SOFIA for $100 off\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
