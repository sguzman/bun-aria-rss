  "description": "<p>#QOTD: What's your Instagram handle?</p>\n<p>Look, when VaynerMedia was in its earlier days, our website was garbage. It almost looked as if we were going out of business and I know that. That's on me. At that point in time I didn't think we needed to showcase the work we were doing, or the clients we working on, or any accolades we could have showed off. We just needed to focus. </p>\n<p>The point here is that everything I do, and everything that you do, needs to have strategy behind it. The strategy at the time for us was to stay low and be quiet, and focus on what we were doing internally and focus on the energy that we needed to create to build an incredible business. So that's what we did -- BUT, that doesn't mean that's what you need to do. It all boils down to strategy and the mission at hand, so that's what you should be focusing your energy on.</p>\n<p>Look, we were put in a peculiar position. I had my own personal brand and people knew me as this \"social media guy.\" To be honest, I had plenty of doubters who thought I was just going to snake my way into getting clients without have a substantial business to back it. Well -- THEY WERE WRONG. I've proved my worth through and through and a lot of that had to do with the strategy I employed, the team I built around me, and the ways we've executed our excellence in this space. </p>\n<p>The actions that you put out to the world need to replicate the mission you've set out to capitalize on. This isn't a one-size-fits-all game. You need to understand what you're looking to do and do whatever it takes to get that done. Period. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578165.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
