  "description": "Technology is changing the physical layout of cities, says Jim Garman, who runs real estate investing for Goldman Sachs' Merchant Banking Division in Europe. For instance, while e-commerce is driving down demand for brick-and-mortar storefronts, it's accelerating demand for warehouses and other logistical assets. \"Logistics has become a very in-favor asset class for investors,\" Garman says. \"Whereas retail has become a very out-of-favor asset class at the moment.\" Also in the episode, Garman discusses the change in office buildings, student housing, and more. \n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on March 6, 2019.\n\n\nThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
