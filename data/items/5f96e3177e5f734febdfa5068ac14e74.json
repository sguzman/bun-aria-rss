  "description": "<p>Overlay journals are characterised by their articles being published on open\naccess repositories, often already starting in their initial preprint form as a\nprerequisite for submission to the journal prior to initiating the peer-review\nprocess. In this study we aimed to identify currently active overlay journals\nand examine their characteristics. We utilised an explorative web search and\ncontacted key service providers for additional information. The final sample\nconsisted of 34 overlay journals. While the results show that new overlay\njournals have been actively established within recent years, the current\npresence of overlay journals remains diminutive compared to the overall number\nof open access journals. Most overlay journals publish articles in natural\nsciences, mathematics or computer sciences, and are commonly published by\ngroups of academics rather than formal organisations. They may also rank highly\nwithin the traditional journal citation metrics. None of the investigated\njournals required fees from authors, which is likely related to the\ncost-effective aspects of the overlay publishing model. Both the growth in\nadoption of open access preprint repositories and researchers' willingness to\npublish in overlay journals will determine the model's wider impact on\nscholarly publishing.\n</p>",
