  "title": "Amazing: Carbon Robotics Weeder - Deep Learning for Organic Weed Control!",
  "content": "<p>&nbsp;This is totally amazing:&nbsp;</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"BLOG_video_class\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSPhhw-2ShI\" width=\"320\" youtube-src-id=\"vSPhhw-2ShI\"></iframe></div>As someone who works on manufacturing automation with robotics and vision, I can say this is a very complicated task since the robot has to distinguish by a 2D image between the right crop and weeds. Also the laser shooting of the weeds is awesome!<p></p><div>After one minute of digging I found out I know <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkirsch/\">Nick Kirsch</a> who is a director at Carbon Robotics and was an executive intern in our startup Turi in 2016! This is a Seattle based company, I can't wait to talk to Nick and learn more.&nbsp;</div>",
