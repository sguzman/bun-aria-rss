  "description": "<p>Many studies have examined the shortcomings of word error rate (WER) as an\nevaluation metric for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, particularly\nwhen used for spoken language understanding tasks such as intent recognition\nand dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose Hybrid-SD\n($\\text{H}_{\\text{SD}}$), a new hybrid evaluation metric for ASR systems that\ntakes into account both semantic correctness and error rate. To generate\nsentence dissimilarity scores (SD), we built a fast and lightweight SNanoBERT\nmodel using distillation techniques. Our experiments show that the SNanoBERT\nmodel is 25.9x smaller and 38.8x faster than SRoBERTa while achieving\ncomparable results on well-known benchmarks. Hence, making it suitable for\ndeploying with ASR models on edge devices. We also show that\n$\\text{H}_{\\text{SD}}$ correlates more strongly with downstream tasks such as\nintent recognition and named-entity recognition (NER).\n</p>",
