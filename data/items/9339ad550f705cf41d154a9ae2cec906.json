Today we take a look at the Irish Vanishing Triangle, where at least 6 (but definitely more) young women have vanished seemingly into thin air within an 80 mile radius near Dublin. Is there a serial killer at work picking off young, attractive women without leaving even a stray hair behind?

We touch upon theories and set up Part 2 for even more weird vibes. <br>\n<br>\nFormer lead Investigator Alan Bailey's book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909718858?pf_rd_r=P08K1ZKDW98P1EFD3WPK&pf_rd_p=edaba0ee-c2fe-4124-9f5d-b31d6b1bfbee\" target=\"_blank\">Missing, Presumed</a><br>\nIt's a great resource for all of the information you could ever want on this case as well as theories and insider knowledge from someone who worked the case for years.
