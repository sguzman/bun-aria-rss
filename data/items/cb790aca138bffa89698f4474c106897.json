  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we talk to the Vice President of Worldwide Customer Experience at Electronic Arts (EA), Joel Knutson.  </p><p>EA is a US $5.5 billion video game company headquartered in California with operations all around the world.  Battlefield, Star Wars, The Sims and Medal of Honor are all EA games.  Best selling sports games FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live and NHL are also among its successful products.  </p><p>Joel started with EA in an entry level position and over the past 25 years has worked in a variety of roles before taking on his current executive position. And he’s learned a lot about leadership along the way.  </p><p>“People are by far the most important part of any business. A business wins or loses on people and that’s why it’s critical to have a strong team and to invest in developing their talent,” explains Joel. “I try to always create an environment where our people can be their best and can do their best work.”  </p><p>To that end, Joel’s team is using the Leadership Circle as part of a leadership development program.  </p><p>It’s a competency-based 360º review that opens constructive conversations to reveal a leader’s gifts and areas for development.  </p><p>“I like that it includes a detailed survey and provides information on multiple dimensions,” explains Joel. “It was a very different process from any I’d been involved in before, and I was impressed with the way the outputs are broken down between reactive and creative tendencies.”  </p><p>Trilogy Effect Partner Wendy Appel credits an open approach as being key to the success of EA’s leadership program. “Joel and his team spend time upfront to ensure people feel safe and secure. They make sure everyone understands the long-term commitment to the development journey of each leader and educate everyone about the program’s intentions and process. Joel is offering a wonderful gift to his people. They can take on as much or as little as they feel comfortable doing.”</p><p>Listen to the show to learn how and why leadership development continues to benefit Joel and his team.
