  "description": "<p>Turbulence is hard to control. A plethora of experimental methods have been\ndeveloped to generate this ephemeral state of matter, leading to fundamental\ninsights into its statistical and structural features as well as its onset at\never higher Reynolds numbers. In all cases however, the central role played by\nthe material boundaries of the apparatus poses a challenge on understanding\nwhat the turbulence has been fed, and how it would freely evolve. Here, we\nbuild and control a confined state of turbulence using only elemental building\nblocks: vortex rings. We create a stationary and isolated blob of turbulence\n($Re_\\lambda$=50-300) in a quiescent environment, initiated and sustained\nsolely by vortex rings. We assemble a full picture of its three-dimensional\nstructure, onset, energy budget and tunability. Crucially, the incoming vortex\nrings can be endowed with conserved quantities, such as helicity, which can\nthen be controllably transferred to the turbulent state. Our `one eddy at a\ntime' approach paves the way for sculpting turbulent flows much as a state of\nmatter, `printing' it at a targeted position, localizing it, and ultimately\nharnessing it. Our work paves the way to gaining a complete picture of this\nephemeral state of flow.\n</p>",
