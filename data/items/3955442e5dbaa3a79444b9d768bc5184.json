  "description": "By Christopher J. Neely in  Review. This article analyzes financial market reactions to the Russia-Ukraine war with a focus on the opening weeks. Markets did not completely anticipate the war, and asset price reactions strengthened from the first week&mdash;when there were hopes for a quick resolution&mdash;to the second week, when prices generally peaked and began to partially revert to prewar values.",
