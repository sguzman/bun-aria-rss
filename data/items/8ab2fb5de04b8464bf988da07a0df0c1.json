    "media:description": "Beautifully made with 2,300 crafted parts, the Facit mechanical calculator first entered the market in 1932. \n\nAnd for the next forty years it basically stayed the same. \n\nThe Swedish company that made it, Facit, employed thousands of people around the world to build and sell them. \n\nThen over the span of just two years, they went from millions of dollars in profit to annihilation. \n\nIn this video, we are going to talk about a faded Swedish icon. \n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- The Podcast: https://anchor.fm/asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
