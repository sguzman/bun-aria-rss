  "description": "<p>It's popular today to go around saying, \"I'm gonna be me. And I give zero f*cks what anyone thinks about it.\" While we should not be enslaved to other people's opinions, Andy Frisella says that what other people think about you matters.

Opportunity comes from other people--and how other people perceive you is huge. If you struggle with how to connect with people and build relationships that lead to opportunity, The MFCEO shares a tool in this episode that will help you!</p>",
