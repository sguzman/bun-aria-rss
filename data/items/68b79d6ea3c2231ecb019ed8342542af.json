  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, NRA TV Host Dan Bongino fills in for Mark. The Obama-gate spying scandal was a setup from day one! Liberals are in a panic because their story keeps changing on why team Obama weaponized our government to spy on team Trump. The FBI is running scared because they still don't have a viable genesis story as to why they spied on Trump's campaign. Also, Blackwater's Erik Prince was interviewed by Mueller's investigators for a meeting Prince and George Nader both attended in the Seychelles. Nader, who's been given immunity by Mueller, is represented by Obama's former White House Counsel. Later, today was a historic day in Israel. U.S finally recognized the legitimate capital of Israel and opened up the embassy in Jerusalem. That took guts from Trump. The media painted this as negative because of all the protests. There are not protests when they show up with bombs - those are attacks.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
