  "description": "<p>In this episode, John covers points six through ten in his lesson on consistent growth. Leaders who take responsibility for their own intentional growth don’t find themselves constantly playing catch-up in a changing world. And, it all start with growth on the inside. John points out that, while many leaders invest in growing in their weaknesses, those who invest in their strengths make the biggest strides in their personal growth.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark and Richard expand on the idea of perfectionism––one of a leader’s greatest obstacles in getting started. How can a leader overcome perfectionist tendencies, and how should a leader look back on past mistakes? </p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Consistent Growth Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
