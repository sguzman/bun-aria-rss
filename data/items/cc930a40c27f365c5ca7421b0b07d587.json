  "description": "<p>What do we mean when we call ourselves “allies”? For Dr. Nita Mosby Tyler, being an ally means being a person that uses their own resources and privileges to stand beside people that are marginalized. She explains why we need \"unlikely allies\" in the fight for justice, and why people who are experiencing inequality first hand must be willing to accept the help if we all want the world to be a fairer, more equitable place. Dr. Nita Mosby Tyler is the Chief Catalyst and Founder of The Equity Project -- a consulting firm supporting organizations and communities in building diversity, equity and inclusion strategies -- as well as The HR Shop, a human resources firm designed to support non-profits and small businesses. Dr. Mosby Tyler, a consultant accredited by the Georgetown University National Center for Cultural Competence and recipient of the Cornell University Diversity & Inclusion certification, is nationally recognized for her equity work with non-profit, community, government and corporate organizations. She has received many local and national awards for her service and leadership accomplishments including recognition from the U.S. Department of Health And Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture and Human Rights Campaign.
