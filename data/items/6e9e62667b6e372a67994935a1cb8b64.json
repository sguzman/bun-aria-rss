  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: The Barstool Sports Office is in a state of disarray. A gigantic mess left behind by Yankees fans has thrown PFC Bren onto the Battle Commander's radar (Erika Nardini) and that's not somewhere you want to be. What does Staff Sgt. Chaps have to say to him?</p><p>Round 2: The Army is working on a combat robot working dog. This is betrayal the likes have never been seen. </p><p>Round 3: MSG Mark Allen, 46, was shot in the head on 9 July 2009 while on a mission to search for Bowe Bergdahl. Unfortunately, he passed away last week. Seeing his pictures and what he went through after that mission was gutting. It's important to remember what Mark's mission was like. We talked to someone in Bowe's platoon to drive that point home. </p><p>Round 4: Fortnite went down on Sunday in the middle of a long weekend. Is the Army ESports team going to be okay? Yes, the Army has an Esports team!</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
