  "description": "In this episode, Chrissy Lawler of The Peaceful Sleeper, joins Sharon to hear the story of Matthew Lyon, one of Vermont’s most eclectic historical figures. Lyon, a “redemptioner” from Dublin, made a name for himself as a fierce Democratic-Republican when he got into not one–but two–scuffles with a congress member of the opposing party… during an active House session. His story gets more bizarre from there, as he became the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. Follow along as Sharon tells his larger-than-life tale of public service during some of the U.S.’s earliest years as a new nation.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
