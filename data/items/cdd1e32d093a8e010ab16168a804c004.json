Work ethic is developed and is something that can be improved upon over time. Strong work ethic not only gets the job done, it pulls a driven person through some of the most difficult situations that would deter the common person from even trying. In this episode, you’re going to hear how some of Hollywood's most successful people have decades long careers with monumental success. If you think their talent was enough, guess again. These actors and actresses work just as hard at their skills and their craft as Michal Jordan or Kobe Bryant before the big game.
