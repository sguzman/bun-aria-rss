  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Republican party, which is a soft progressive party, keeps embracing the Democrat agenda. It eats the crumbs that the Democrats provided. They fund Obamacare and won’t secure the border. We will have a new massive new entitlement called family leave. Then we’re going to have a trillion and a half more dollars on infrastructure. Boondoggle after boondoggle. Also, hundreds of years from now this will be viewed as our \"flat earth period\" when we believed that humans could change the climate. Despite the fact that it was much warmer during the Roman empire. It’s an idiotic argument to presume that humans are a contributing factor to climate change, there is nothing to legitimately support this; climate is not static, by its very nature it changes. Both the media and the GOP have lost their ability to skeptically analyze political manifesto disguised as scientific reports. Why doesn't the media bring on experts with dissenting opinions like Dr. Patrick Michaels, an expert in the atmosphere, environment, and climate? Then, the caravan that the media wrongly said wasn't an invasion attempted to breach the border and faced a retaliatory response from US border patrol.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
