  "description": "<p>Terra is exploding. Do Kwon and the Terra ecosystem are turning Bitcoin into their collateral asset of choice to backstop LUNA and the UST stablecoin. Over the last several weeks, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) have bought over 30,000 BTC... and they don't plan to stop there.</p> <p>As the LFG climbs the ranks of bitcoin holders, Do Kwon has started playing empire games—claiming victory over the Curve Wars with the 4pool (which contains UST, Frax, USDC, and USDT), calling for the end of DAI, and attempting to build out the Terra ecosystem as the ultimate power in the universe.</p> <p>Is Terra (UST) the future of crypto money? Or is it a ticking time bomb waiting to explode? Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle, so we're going to debate it. From the bull side is Delphi Digital's José Maria Macedo, and representing the skeptics is Selini Capital's Jordi Alexander.</p> <p>------<br /> CONSENSYS | M·A·C: NFT Collection for a Good Cause<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MAC\">https://bankless.cc/MAC</a> </p> <p>------<br /> SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  ️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>️ ARBITRUM | SCALED ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Across\">https://bankless.cc/Across</a> </p> <p>ALTO IRA | TAX-FREE CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA\">https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA</a> </p> <p>AAVE V3 | LEND & BORROW CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>️ MAKER DAO | THE DAI STABLECOIN<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO\">https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO</a> </p> <p>BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Timestamps:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 7:30 LUNA/UST Fundamental Properties<br /> 15:15 The Balance Between LUNA/ETH<br /> 20:00 Why Bullish/Bearish?<br /> 25:28 Why is UST a Successful Stable?<br /> 30:19 Are Algo-Stablecoins Unstable?<br /> 42:25 Anchor's Utility<br /> 48:02 Do Kwon $10B Purchase of LUNA<br /> 52:02 Is UST Becoming a Bank?<br /> 57:00 Risks of De-pegging<br /> 1:06:30 Has LUNA/UST Been Tested?<br /> 1:15:00 Do Kwon & Decentralization<br /> 1:27:50 Do Kwon's 4pool<br /> 1:39:05 Potential Nightmare Scenarios<br /> 1:48:04 Closing Arguments</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Jordi Alexander CIO of Selini Capital<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/gametheorizing\">https://twitter.com/gametheorizing</a> </p> <p>Jose Macedo Founding Partner, Delphi Digital<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/zemariamacedo\">https://twitter.com/zemariamacedo</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
