  "description": "<a href=\"https://dailyyonder.com/author/dee_davis/\">Dee Davis</a> remembers watching his grandmother float by in a canoe during the 1957 flood that hit Whitesburg, Ky. The water crested at nearly 15 feet back then--a record that stood for over half a century, until it was obliterated last week.<br/><br/>The water was more than six feet higher than the 1957 mark when floodwater destroyed the gauge.<br/><br/>The flooding took out bridges and knocked houses off their foundations. It had claimed at least 35 lives as of Monday afternoon.<br/><br/>And it was just the latest record-breaking flooding event to hit the U.S. this summer. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/384067907/rebecca-hersher\">Rebecca Hersher</a> explains that climate change is making extreme floods more frequent. A warming atmosphere can hold more moisture, which means, when it rains, it rains harder.<br/><br/>This episode also features reporting from NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/188396171/kirk-siegler\">Kirk Siegler</a>,  KJZZ's <a href=\"https://kjzz.org/staff/28\">Michel Marizco</a> and St. Louis Public Radio's <a href=\"https://news.stlpublicradio.org/people/sarah-fentem\">Sarah Fentem</a>.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.",
