Tim points out that there are six cycles that begin with Paul being arrested, then Paul is given a platform to speak, then the authority figure saying that Paul doesn't deserve death, but he is never released.</p>\n<p>Tim says Luke is portraying Paul as a model for how Christians should relate to the powers and cultural structures of the world.
