  "description": "Chance the Rapper tells Stephen how he learned about his family's deep spiritual roots in Ghana, just days before making his first visit there, in this Late Show Pod Show exclusive extended interview. He's also got a new Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream flavor, proceeds from which will go to further the work of Chance’s Chicago-based charity, SocialWorks. But first, Russia’s default on its foreign debt is evidence that global sanctions are squeezing the country’s economy, and texts between the former president’s son and his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reveal details of a pre-election plot to subvert the will of American voters. Then, Jon Batiste composed a new song for early spring, and the pandemic has been rough on everyone, so Stephen demonstrates how to let off some steam by throwing a couple quarters in the office swear jar. And Beanie Feldstein returns to The Late Show to share her excitement at playing Fanny Brice, a trailblazing entertainer who inspired the Broadway show, “Funny Girl.” \nLearn more about your ad choices.
