Hit head-on by a drunk driver at age 20, he actually died, his heart stopping for 6 minutes. When he woke from his coma he was told by doctors that he would never walk again.</p> <p>Hal did walk again and wrote the bestselling book <em>The Miracle Morning</em> and became one of the highest rated keynote speakers in America.</p> <p>Then he nearly died again in 2016. With his kidneys, lungs, and heart on the verge of failing, he was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive form of cancer.</p> <p>Defying the odds, he is now cancer free and has written a new book, <em>The Miracle Equation</em> which is now available for pre-order.
