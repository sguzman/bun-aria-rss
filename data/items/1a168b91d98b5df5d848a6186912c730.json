Plus, I take your questions! Ways to feel confident and sexual again after a breakup, how to have kinky sex with a partner who says they aren’t interested, how to decide if you should wait to develop a relationship with a super busy person or cut em’ loose, how to take sexy pictures with each other, and how to communicate your needs efficiently outside the bedroom so that you can reignate the spark when you’re back inside.</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.dynamiteclothing.com/us/p/lets-date-card-game/0700703.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Serena Kerrigan’s Let’s Fucking Date</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.estherperel.com/where-should-we-begin-the-game\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/come-as-you-are-revised-and-updated-the-surprising-new-science-that-will-transform-your-sex-life-9781982165314/9781982165314\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/guides/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Yes No Maybe List</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
