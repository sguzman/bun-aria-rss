  "title": "PMS 2.0 287 - TNF Football Preview, Darius Butler, Mike Tirico, Tom Pelissero, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys preview tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Packers and 49ers and give a couple of predictions for the game and also chat about Pat's appearance last night on WWE NXT and the hell he raised. Joining the show is 9 Year NFL Vet at Defensive Back, cohost of the Man-To-Man Pod, Everything DB, friend of the program, Darius Butler. Pat and Darius chat about tonight's game and he gives a couple of betting leans for Quarterback over/unders, teaches a couple of lessons in DB play, and chats about whether or not he thinks this is Jimmy G's last season in San Francisco (26:33-48:11). Next, former play-by-play announcer of Monday Night Football, and current Notre Dame play-by-play caller, host of the Olympics on NBC, and host of Football Night in America, Mike Tirico joins the show. Pat and Mike chat about his career arc and how he's gotten to where he is, if he thought he'd get to call more games when going to NBC, his thoughts on potentially being paired with Drew Brees in the booth, how special it is working on the Olympics, and much more (51:01-1:15:56). Later, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero joins Pat and AJ Hawk to give an update about all the different Covid situations going on in the NFL, if tonight's game was ever in jeopardy, and everything else going on in the NFL as we look ahead to week 9 (1:15:58-1:35:58). Make sure you subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow and listen every day on Mad Dog Radio, Sirius XM Channel 82. We appreciate you all for listening, come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
