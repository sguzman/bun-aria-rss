  "description": "<p>As you grow older, your musical taste changes and evolves and I for one, welcome it. You don't have to listen to aggressive music all day, every day. Of course, you don't need me to tell you that but the past few years I have gotten really into dreamy soundscapes and our guest this week creates those in spades. His name is Jamison Isaak and plays under the moniker <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2GE6MAdyGzeXpY9TwIYd3l?si=5eMbAaDpRIWYMNCR99GhRg\">Teen Daze</a>. I had a sneaking suspicion that he had a connection to punk/hardcore/DIY and boy, was I right. We get in deep with his life in rural Canada, the importance of Much Music, melodic hardcore and so much more. Trust me, you'll enjoy this convo even if you aren't familiar with his music.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
