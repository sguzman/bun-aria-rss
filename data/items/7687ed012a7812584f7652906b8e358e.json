Elliot first explains how and why we engage in self-justification to avoid facing our mistakes, and how this process is driven by the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance. We then discuss how once you make a decision in a certain direction, good or bad, you become more entrenched in your attitude about it and more likely to continue down that same path, and how this phenomenon represents what Elliot calls \"the pyramid of choice.\" We end our conversation with how we can learn to approach the mistakes of others with more generosity, and our own mistakes with more honesty.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/mistakes\">aom.is/mistakes</a>.</p>\n",
