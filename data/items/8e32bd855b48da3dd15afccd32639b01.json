  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Rep Adam Schiff is coordinating a leak and coup campaign in conjunction with the New York Times and other media sources. There was a hearing today about the whistleblower's complaint, yet the star witness — the whistleblower — was not even there. It seems that Schiff may be leaking or in touch with the whistleblower's lawyer judging by how the complaint is written. Both Schiff and the whistleblower, who we're told is a CIA operative, cite the same publicly-available media reports to make their case. A rogue element within the CIA is at work to overthrow President Donald Trump just as they have overthrown the governments of South Vietnam and Chile in the past. Moreover, the whistleblower was not present during the phone call with the Ukrainian President, he has no first-hand knowledge of the conversation beyond hearsay. What some might call a conspiracy could easily be proven as fact if Schiff, his staff, and the CIA Operative would release 90 days of their phone records. Then, former National Security Council staffer and CIA operative, Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy calls in to dissect today's hearings. Later, the New York Times takes a swipe at this program and claims that \"pro-Trump media\" is spinning the story in favor of Trump. Meanwhile, John Solomon's latest article further exposes the Biden Family's corruption. But the media hasn't interviewed him and the House committees haven't subpoenaed him or his records despite all of the controversy surrounding his actions. Afterward, Sean Davis of the Federalist joins the program to pick apart the memo and offer insight on why he thinks the whistleblower complaint was written for the purpose of being leaked to the media.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
