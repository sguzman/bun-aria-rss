Booth (1840-1916), a Liverpudlian shipping line owner, surveyed every household in  London to see if it was true, as claimed, that as many as a quarter lived in poverty. He found that it was closer to a third, and that many of these were either children with no means of support or older people no longer well enough to work.  He went on to campaign for an old age pension, and broadened the impact of his findings by publishing enhanced Ordnance Survey maps with the streets coloured according to the wealth of those who lived there.\n\nThe image above is of an organ grinder on a London street, circa 1893, with children dancing to the Pas de Quatre\n\nWith\n\nEmma Griffin\nProfessor of Modern British History at the University of East Anglia\n\nSarah Wise\nAdjunct Professor at the University of California\n\nAnd\n\nLawrence Goldman\nEmeritus Fellow in History at St Peter’s College, University of Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
