Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was arguably the most influential philosopher of the 20th century. The quintessential existentialist, Sartre encapsulates the very essence of existentialism through his various philosophical works and plays. Sartre still has much to teach us. Still, Sartre would argue too many people live in Bad faith. They ignore that they are \"condemned to be free\". Amongst other things, we'll be asking, Why did 50,000 people attend his funeral? Are we condemned to be free? And Are we living in bad faith? Part I. The Life of Sartre (03:35), Part II. \"Man is condemned to be free\" (18:15), Part III. Bad Faith (00:10 in Part II), Part IV. Further Analysis and Discussion (31:40 in Part II).
