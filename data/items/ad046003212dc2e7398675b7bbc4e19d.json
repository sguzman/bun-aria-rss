  "description": "<p>When you hear the phrase “self-care,” what comes to mind? Bubble baths? Booking a massage? Those things are all lovely (I’d argue essential), but I’ve got one more thing to add to your self-care routine, and I’m going to make a case for it: solo sex, AKA masturbation.&nbsp;</p><br><p>If you’re a regular listener to this show, you know how much of a solo sex advocate I am. But we’re going to go a little deeper into this topic, because there’s still a lot of shame associated with masturbation: fear of getting caught, embarrassment about our noises and facial expressions, confusion around toys and which ones are best. That’s why today’s show is your Solo Sex 101, where we create a solo sex routine that works for you, get into <em>all</em> the ways solo sex nourishes your mental health, and how to get into the right headspace for it. Plus, I take your questions! When masturbation feels depressing, how do you learn to love it? Or when you’re asked to masturbate in front of your partner, but feel self-conscious about it, what do you do? I tackle these questions and so many more, on our solo sextravaganza.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/shop/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Emily’s Shop Page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/sex-toys/p/GV15705/dame/fin-finger-vibrator-by-dame\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dame Fin&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodvibes.com/s/sex-toys/p/GVD436923/je-joue/je-joue-mimi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Je Joue Mimi</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.emdria.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">More on Information on EMDR</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
