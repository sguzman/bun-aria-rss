  "description": "Ryan Holiday makes Stoic philosophy sound like an everyday conversation. Through his books, The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy, Ryan shares his gift for discussing complex ideas about human nature in a practical way for anyone to use. The best-selling author, marketing tactician, and entrepreneur gives us a lot to think about on this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu. SHOW NOTES: Ryan describes what drives him throughout life and fatherhood. [3:35] Ryan shares his strategy on identifying and pursuing goals. [13:00] Ryan details the challenge of turning down money to follow his gut. [20:38] Ryan and Tom discuss encountering positive and negative feedback. [29:00] Ryan explores the role of emotions in decision making. [37:50] Ryan breaks down practical steps for achieving success. [44:00] Ryan reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [48:10]   QUOTES: “Being still is where really great insights come from. This is also where happiness comes from. You know, it's hard to be happy and appreciate and feel gratitude, when you're just moving all the time.” [7:40] “You're not trying to get to perfection right now. You're just trying to get a little bit better than you were yesterday or an hour ago.” [27:09]   Impact Theory is proudly sponsored by Audible.
