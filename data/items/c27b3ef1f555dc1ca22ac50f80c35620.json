  "title": "288 - Holding Space & Christian Nation-ism",
  "description": "Today, we spend a little time holding space for the victims of the shootings in Atlanta this past week. Tim’s wife, Shauna, joins to share some of the conversations they’ve had together and that she has had in her classroom about dehumanization. \n\nMike and Tim read and talk about perhaps the best email response they’ve ever received, pushing back on some of the conversation they had on the seven mountain mandate and the David French article, “How a Rising Religious Movement Rationalizes the Christian Grasp for Power.” Mike shares about a new book he's reading and the author’s ‘Top 10 Indicators You’re Seeing Christian Nationalism.’ Are there ties between Old Testament Israel and America? Is America central to God’s plan? Where has this ‘Us vs. Them’ mindset come from?\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
