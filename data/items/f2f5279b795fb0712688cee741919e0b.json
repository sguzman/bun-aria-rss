    "media:description": "Overcome your brain's limitations by learning statistics with Brilliant! https://www.brilliant.org/simonclark\n\nThe World Health Organisation says that 7 million people are killed every year by the air they breathe. Why, where, and what can we do about it? Turns out, there are a few reasons we should stop burning fossil fuels...\n\nReferences\n1. https://ourworldindata.org/data-review-air-pollution-deaths\n2. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer\n3. https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#share-exposed-to-air-pollution-above-who-limits\n4. https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#is-the-world-on-track-to-end-extreme-poverty-by-2030\n5. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-air-pollution\n6. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health\n7. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23853-y\n8. https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1819989116\n9. https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#outdoor-air-pollution-tends-to-rise-with-industrialization-before-falling\n10. https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf\n\nSo yeah, spoiler alert, air pollution kills 7 million people a year. And what causes the majority of dangerous air pollution? Humans burning stuff, specifically fossil fuels. Even without their immense impact on global climate, we should be phasing out the use of coal, oil, and natural gas because they are literally killing millions of people every single year. We have the technology to replace fossil fuel use in energy generation with renewables (and nuclear, though that's... complicated here), and wealthy economies need to support low and middle income economies in their efforts to decarbonise (and literally clean up) their energy supply.\n\nYou can support the channel by becoming a patron at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys\n\nCheck out my website! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/\n\n---------- II ----------\n\nMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphys\nMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimon\nMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphys\nMy goodreads - http://www.goodreads.com/simonoxfphys\n\n---------- II ----------\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com\nSome stock footage from Getty.\nBeautifully edited by Luke Negus.\n\nHuge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Conor Safbom, William Pettersson, Paul H and Linda L, InDefenseOfToucans, Savannah, Jimmy Lee, Simon Stelling, Gabriele Siino, Bjorn Bakker, Ieuan Williams, Candace H, Tom Malcolm, Marcus Bosshard, Shab Kumar, Brady Johnston, Liat Khitman, Jesper Norsted, Kent & Krista Halloran, Rapssack, Kevin O'Connor, Timo Kerremans, Thines Ganeshamoorthy, Ashley Wilkins, Michael Parmenter, Samuel Baumgartner, Dan Sherman, ST0RMW1NG 1, Adrian Sand, Morten Engsvang, Farsight101, K.L, poundedjam, fourthdwarf, Daan Sneep, Felix Freiberger, Chris Field, Robert Connell, ChemMentat, Kolbrandr, , Sebastain Graf, Dan Nelson, Shane O'Brien, Alex, Fujia Li, Will Tolley, Cody VanZandt, Jesper Koed, Jonathan Craske, Albrecht Striffler, Igor Francetic, Jack Troup, SexyCaveman , Sean Richards, Kedar , Omar Miranda, Alastair Fortune, bitreign33 , Mat Allen, Anne Smith, Rafaela Corrêa Pereira, Colin J.
