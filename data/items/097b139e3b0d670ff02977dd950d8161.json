  "description": "Mehrzad Boroujerdi and Kourosh Rahimkhani‘s new book, Postrevolutionary Iran: A Political Handbook (Syracuse University Press, 2017), traces the political events that mark almost four decades of revolutionary rule and includes biographies of the 2,300 most important political players in the Islamic republic. The book is certain to be a must-have reference for anyone researching post-revolutionary Iran. It provides the raw data for an understanding of political developments in Iran since the 1979 revolution and the drivers of Iranian domestic, foreign and defense policies. In doing so, the book fills a gaping hole in the literature and knowledge about post-revolutionary Iran that is crucial to any understanding of the Islamic republic.\n\n\n\nJames M.
