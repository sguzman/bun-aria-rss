  "description": "<p>We got a wild one today. Today's Suck is really three Sucks in one. There is the abduction of Steven Stayner, the backstory of a notorious pedophile, Kenneth Parnell, and the story of serial killer, Cary Stayner aka the Yosemite Killer. In late 1972, Steven was abducted on the way home from school, at the age of seven, and he wouldn't see his family for another seven years. And that entire seven years, he'd be assaulted by Parnell. And then, after escaping, he'd move back into the room he shared with his older brother, Cary. And years later, Cary Stayner would become a serial killer in Yosemite Park, where the Stayner kids often vacationed. A lot of moving parts in this story, and I think they all come together to form a compelling tale that also involves Bigfoot.
