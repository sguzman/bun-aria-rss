  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Biden goes into hiding as his Afghan withdrawal plan falls apart. I have quite a lot to say about this subject, and by the end, if I’ve done my job, I will probably have ticked off everyone on all sides of the issue. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics gaslights the critics of masking children, while the Surgeon General declares that you do not have the right to share opinions that he deems “misinformation.” Plus, Tim Tebow made his NFL debut, which is proof of racism, according to many people in sports media. In our Daily Cancellation, I’ll respond to my critics who say that I am a white supremacist conspiracy theorist because of something I said on my show on Friday.  \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
