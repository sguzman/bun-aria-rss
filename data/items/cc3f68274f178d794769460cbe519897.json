  "description": "The bar exam has been around in some form or another since the 1920s. However, it could be time for a change. The pandemic created challenges in administering the test. Some states allowed diploma privilege, others made significant changes. Many critics think it's time to change the bar exam permanently—or even do away with it altogether.\nOur sister podcast, [Un]Common Law, will release the first episode in a three-part series on the state of the bar exam for lawyers, where it is now, and where it could be heading in the future. The host of that series, Adam Allington, joins On The Merits this week to talk about this project and about the pros and cons of the different plans to remake the final barrier to becoming a practicing lawyer.\n\nHave feedback on this episode of On The Merits?
