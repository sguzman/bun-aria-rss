  "description": "Critical Race Theory was created in the 1970s by a Harvard Professor seeking to describe the way racism is baked into the legal system. Half a century later, CRT is now the weapon of choice for right-wing pundits looking to silence conversations about race. \n\nFrom an academic discipline to a conservative scare tactic, how did critical race theory become the dominant culture war in American politics? And what does CRT actually stand for?\n\nGuest: Adam Harris, staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
