  "title": "Pakistan flooding, UK power prices and Boris’s broadband claim",
  "description": "Devastating floods have wreaked havoc across Pakistan after the heaviest monsoon rains in at least a decade. But is a third of the country really under water, as has been claimed? Also why do electricity prices in the UK rise in line with gas prices when we get so much of our power from other sources like nuclear, wind and solar? As criminal barristers go on strike in England and Wales, we ask if those starting in the profession really earn £12,200 a year. And as Boris Johnson waves goodbye to Downing Street, we investigate his claim that 70% of the UK now has access to gigabit broadband.\n\nPresenter: Tim Harford\nSeries producer: Jon Bithrey\nReporters: Nathan Gower, Charlotte McDonald\nProduction Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson\nEditor: Richard Vadon",
