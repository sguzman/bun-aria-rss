  "description": "Later today, the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates yet again… but that’s hardly news at this point. The real news is what will happen after during the Q&A—and whether the Fed will start turning dovish… We cover why the Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to combating inflation—and you shouldn’t pin your hopes on a dovish Fed… Why we could see a higher inflation target by the end of the year… How the Senate and Congress are attempting to pressure Powell… Why there’s no hope of a soft landing at this point… And why the Fed can’t save the markets. Plus, I share how to multiply your money as the Fed’s mistakes crash the market.   In this episode   We could see a major change on inflation targets [2:30] The Fed’s hands are tied on rate hikes [4:20] How elected officials are pressuring Powell [13:25] The Fed can’t save the markets [16:30] Despite the bear market, equities still aren’t cheap [24:40]  How to profit from the Fed’s errors [26:25]   Enjoyed this episode?
