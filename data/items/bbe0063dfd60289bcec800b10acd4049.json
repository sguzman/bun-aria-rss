  "description": "<p>Matt and Bowen welcome the incredibly funny, talented, and, let's just say it, smoking hot Jay Jurden aka Our Bisexual King. The three queers chat this week's Verzuz: Patti and Gladys, how Andrew Gillum brought some take-the-good-with-the-bad bi representation to our this week, and getting naked. Also, Las Cultch continues to be a Mariah Carey stan podcast as Jay discusses the culture that made him say culture was for him: Mariah's \"Honey\" music video. The boys also discuss how Jay identified with the mutants of X-Men as a young, queer black kid from Mississippi, and he details his love for the 1992 animated X-Men series on FOX. All this and queerness in gaming, joke-writing, a continued conversation about the Monique Vs. Candiace of it all on <em>RHOP</em>, and, somehow, a discussion of the band The Fray. Catch Jay as one of the panelists on Grindr and Forever Dog's new podcast <em>The RearView</em> every Thursday, and please listen to his chart-toppin' comedy album <em>It's Jay Jurden Y'all!</em></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
