  "description": "What's up with Justin Timberlake? Two years ago he gifted us the ebullient family-friendly jam \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" now he's on the cusp of a deeply serious new record called \"Man of the Woods,\" whose first single, strangely, is a bit of electro-funk snarl expertly produced by long-time collaborators Timbaland and Danja. What's going on here—who is JT trying to be? We listen deep to his latest, \"Filthy,\" to try and understand its creator's conflicting musical worlds. \nFeaturing:\nJustin Timberlake - Filthy\nJustin Timberlake - Cry Me A River\nBernard Hermann - Psycho\nKen Nordine - My Baby\nLearn more about your ad choices.
