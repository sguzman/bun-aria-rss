  "description": "<p>USB is the most prevalent peripheral interface in modern computer systems and\nits inherent insecurities make it an appealing attack vector. A well-known\nlimitation of USB is that traffic is not encrypted. This allows on-path\nadversaries to trivially perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Off-path attacks\nthat compromise the confidentiality of communications have also been shown to\nbe possible. However, so far no off-path attacks that breach USB communications\nintegrity have been demonstrated.\n</p>\n<p>In this work we show that the integrity of USB communications is not\nguaranteed even against off-path attackers.Specifically, we design and build\nmalicious devices that, even when placed outside of the path between a victim\ndevice and the host, can inject data to that path. Using our developed\ninjectors we can falsify the provenance of data input as interpreted by a host\ncomputer system. By injecting on behalf of trusted victim devices we can\ncircumvent any software-based authorisation policy defences that computer\nsystems employ against common USB attacks. We demonstrate two concrete attacks.\nThe first injects keystrokes allowing an attacker to execute commands. The\nsecond demonstrates file-contents replacement including during system install\nfrom a USB disk. We test the attacks on 29 USB 2.0 and USB 3.x hubs and find 14\nof them to be vulnerable.\n</p>",
