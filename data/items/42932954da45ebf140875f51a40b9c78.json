  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, NBC's latest poll of registered voters, not likely voters, indicates that Joe Biden will defeat Donald Trump in a landslide. Does anyone really believe that? Republicans are outnumbering new voter registrants in key battleground states, yet these polls are indicating that Biden wins by 16 points, something that not even Barack Obama pulled off. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are taking cheap shots at the President for not agreeing with her blackmail scheme which would include Billions of bail-out dollars unrelated to the coronavirus relief bill. Pelosi wants to reward the cities and states that reward unions for political activity and this would have nothing to do with unemployment or business recovery or bankruptcy. This is a massive redistribution of wealth equivalent to the amount spent on the federal spending budget. Then, Kamala Harris has a stellar record on support for the Green New Deal which would eliminate our economic system as we know it. She supports the de-funding of police despite being a former prosecutor. Based on her voting record, she'd be the most radical politician to ever run for the presidency. Later, Jane Fonda says that COVID-19 is God's gift to the left. However, Anthony Fauci himself called Trump's immediate coordinated response to the virus was \"impressive\" adding that no one could have done more, way back in March at the height of the pandemic. Finally, Congressional candidate Mary Miller calls in with an update from Illinois' 15th district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
