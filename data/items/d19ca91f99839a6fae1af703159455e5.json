  "title": "Mailtime Moment: A Look At Jay-Z's Career",
  "description": "<p><p>Happy birthday Jay-Z! Great day for Jay-Z fans. Not only is his entire catalog now on Spotify, the Clancy brothers (two white suburban guys in their 30s who grew up listening to Hov) breakdown his entire discography. From 1996-2019, Reasonable Doubt to 4:44. The most underrated song, maybe of all-time: A Million And One Questions. Did you know Jay-Z stabbed someone and only got probation? Takeover vs Ether. Dropping an album on 9/11. Retiring multiple times. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED??</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
