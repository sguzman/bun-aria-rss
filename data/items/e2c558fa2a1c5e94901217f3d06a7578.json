  "description": "<p>Tonight, I will be speaking to Dave who has been hunting his whole life. He will be sharing some of his encounters, including one when he was inspecting a flooded farm in Oklahoma.</p> <p>Dave writes, “As I was walking over this small hill I came up on two creatures. One of the creatures appeared to be female and she was digging up and eating crawdads, the other creature just stood there swaying from side to side watching me as I watched it……” Dave goes on to say “I have traveled and worked in most states and I have seen their tracks, this was not the only time I have run into these things. I would be happy to talk about some of these things I have seen and heard while working in many different states.”</p>",
