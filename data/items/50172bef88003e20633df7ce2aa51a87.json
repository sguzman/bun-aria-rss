From Android Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack libraries and powerful Google &amp; Play Services, our goal is to make it faster and easier for you to build high quality apps across all Android devices. <br /><br />For building rich, beautiful UIs, we introduced <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack Compose</a> several years ago - this is our recommended UI framework for new Android applications. <br /><br />We’re introducing a Gradle Bill of Materials (BOM) specifying the stable version of each Compose library. The first BOM release, <b><a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/whats-new-in-jetpack-compose.html\" target=\"_blank\">Compose October 22</a></b>, contains Material Design 3 components, lazy staggered grids, variable fonts, pull to refresh, snapping in lazy lists, draw text in canvas, URL annotations in text, hyphenation, and LookAheadLayout.&nbsp;The team at Lyft has benefited from using Compose. They shared <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/lyft-reduced-their-code-for-ui-components-using-jetpack-compose.html\">“Over 90% of all new feature code is now developed in Compose.”</a></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">We want Compose to help you take advantage of the entire Android ecosystem of devices, Compose for Wear OS hit its 1.0 stable release several weeks ago making it the recommended way to build UI for Wear.  Today we announced that we’re growing the offering with the first alpha release of <b>Compose for Android TV</b>. Components like featured carousel and immersive list are already available, with more components coming soon. So if you're learning Android or starting a new app, Jetpack Compose is ready for you!<br /><br />Modern Android Development comes to life in <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\" target=\"_blank\">Android Studio</a>, our official IDE that provides powerful tools for building apps on every type of Android device. Today, we’re releasing a number of new features for you to test out, including updated templates that are Compose by default and feature Material 3, Live Edit on by default for Compose, Composition Tracing, Android SDK Upgrade Assistant, App Quality Insights Improvements and more. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview\" target=\"_blank\">Download the latest preview version</a> of <b>Android Studio Flamingo</b> to try out all the features and to give us feedback.</div><div><br /></div><div><br />\n    \n   <div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><img alt=\"Moving image of Android  and Jetpack updates with customer feedback\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1504\" data-original-width=\"720\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaoivtCuH2cns3X-ehjIMfEkT2p9DQPyGP09QyiGwXnkX_dmKTeonjBzGIxH7L3Og-wzjp2Yuctr4AnIgjtDBhjXi_pI4HVZ7bY44bY0RFPs4XhNqF3iY2p8sPzDU9ees_oND6cdYSZyjcN63PzeCDk0KdA5-JqhDqNaqXEIymiyHJ0NgTcxIWhFiO/s1600/image4.gif\" style=\"width: 100%;\" td=\"\" /></center></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n    \n    <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Wear OS: the time is now! </h2>A key device that users are turning to is the smallest and most personal — the watch.  We launched our joint platform – <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/wear\" target=\"_blank\">Wear OS</a> – with Samsung just last year, and this year, we have seen 3X as many device activations, with amazing new devices hitting the market, like Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and Google Pixel Watch. <b>Compose for Wear OS</b>, which makes it faster and easier to build Apps for Wear OS, <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/07/compose-for-wear-os-10-stable.html\" target=\"_blank\">went to 1.0 this summer</a>, and is our recommended approach for building user interfaces for Wear OS apps. More than 20 UI components specifically designed for Wearables, with built-in material theming and accessibility.<br /><br />Today, we’re sharing updated templates for Wear OS in Android Studio, as well as a stable Android R emulator system image for WearOS.<br /><br />With personalized data from a wearable, it’s important to keep the data completely private and safe, which is why we’ve been working on a solution to make this easier – <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Health Connect</b></a>. It’s an API that we built in close collaboration with Samsung for storing and sharing health data - all with a single place for users to easily manage permissions.<br /><br />Developers who invest in Wear OS are seeing big results: Todoist increased their install growth rate by 50% since rebuilding their app for Wear 3, and Outdooractive reduced development time by 30% using Compose for Wear OS. Now is the time to bring a unique, engaging experience to your users on Wear OS!</div><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-1e1f1e46-7fff-ee69-d350-a82517bfcdda\"><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"BLOG_video_class\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENeSNZ3s0Jw\" width=\"800\" youtube-src-id=\"ENeSNZ3s0Jw\"></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;\"><br /></p><br /></span>\n      \n      <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Making your app work great on tablets &amp; large screens</span></h2><span>As you heard earlier this year: Google is <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/large-screens/stories\" target=\"_blank\">all in on tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS</a>. With amazing new hardware–like Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4, Lenovo P12 Tab Pro, and Google’s upcoming Pixel Tablet, there has never been a better time to review your apps and get them ready for large screens. We’ve been hard at work, with updates to Android, improved Google apps and exciting <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/optimize-your-play-store-listing.html\" target=\"_blank\">changes to the Play store</a> making optimized Tablet apps more discoverable.<br /><br />We’ve made it easier than ever to test your app on the large screen in Android Studio Electric Eel, including <b>resizable and desktops emulators </b>and<b> visual linting</b> to help you adhere to best practices on any sized screen. <br /><br />We’ve also heard that we can help you by providing more design and layout guidance for these devices.  To help today, we added new <b>layout guidance</b> for apps by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/large-screens/gallery\" target=\"_blank\">vertical to developer.android.com</a>, as well as developer guidance for <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/large-screen-canonical-layouts\" target=\"_blank\">Canonical layouts with samples</a>. <br /><br />Apps that invest in large screen features are seeing that work pay off when it comes to engagement; take <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tophatch.concepts&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Concepts</a>, which enables amazing stylus interactions like drawing and shape guides for ChromeOS and stylus devices, and saw a 70% higher usage for tablets compared to phones! <br /><br />Be on the lookout for more updates on our improvements to Android Studio, Window Manager Jetpack, and more with the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit/technical-talks#form-factors\" target=\"_blank\">Form Factors track</a>, broadcast live on November 9. <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: #fcff01; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></b></span></p><br /></span>\n      \n      <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Making it easier to take advantage of platform features in Android 13</span></h2><span>At the heart of a successful platform is the operating system, and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Android 13</b></a>, released in August, brings developer enhancements too many facets of the platform, including personalization, privacy, security, connectivity, and media. <br /><br />For example <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/app-languages\" target=\"_blank\"><b>per-app language preferences</b></a>, improve the experience for multilingual users, allowing people to experience their device in different languages in different contexts. <br /><br />The new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Photo picker</b></a> is a permission free way to allow the user to browse and select photos and videos they explicitly want to share with your app, a great example of how Android is focused on privacy. <br /><br />To help you target new API levels, we're introducing the <b>Android SDK Upgrade Assistant</b> tool within the latest preview of Android Studio Flamingo, which gives you step-by-step documentation for the most important changes to look for when updating the target SDK of your app.<br /><br />These are just a few examples of how we're making it easier than ever to adapt your app to platform changes, while enabling you to take advantage of the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/08/android-13-is-in-aosp.html\" target=\"_blank\">latest features</a> Android has to offer.<br /><br /></span>\n      \n      <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Connecting with you around the world at Android Dev Summit</span></h2><span>This is just the first day of Android Dev Summit - where we kicked off with the keynote and dove into our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit/technical-talks#modern-android-development\" target=\"_blank\">first track on <b>Modern Android Development</b></a>, we’ve still got a lot more over the coming weeks.
