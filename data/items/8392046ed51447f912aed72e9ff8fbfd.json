  "description": "Welcome to The Academic Life. You are smart and capable, but you aren’t an island and neither are we, so we reached across our mentor network to bring you these podcasts. Wish we’d include a specific topic? DM suggestions on Twitter: The Academic Life @AcademicLifeNBN.\nIn this episode you’ll hear about: how Black women contributed to America’s first freedom war, reading against the grain, rival geographies, fugitivity as an act of resistance, why we must center Black women’s voices, and a discussion of the book Running from Bondage.\nOur guest is: Dr. Karen Cook Bell, who is Associate Professor of History. Her areas of specialization include slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, and women’s history. Her scholarship has appeared in the Journal of African American History; Georgia Historical Quarterly; Passport; U.S. West-Africa: Interaction and Relations; Before Obama: A Reappraisal of Black Reconstruction Era Politicians; Converging Identities: Blackness in the Contemporary Diaspora; and Slavery and Freedom in Savannah.

Dr. Cook Bell's contribution to the study of slave resistance explores the individual and collective lives of these women and girls, and details about what led them to escape. She demonstrates that there two wars waged during the Revolutionary Era: a political revolution for independence from Great Britain and a social revolution for emancipation and equality in which Black women played an active role. Running from Bondage emphasizes the chances taken by these Black founding mothers and the important contributions they made to the cause of liberty.\nOur host is: Dr. Christina Gessler, the co-producer of the Academic Life podcasts, and a historian of women and gender.\nListeners to this episode might be interested in:\n\n\nClaiming Freedom: Race, Kinship, and Land in Nineteenth Century Georgia, by Karen Cook Bell\n\n\nCloser to Freedom: Enslaved Women and Everyday Resistance in the Plantation South, by Stephanie Camp\n\n“What Can We Learn from a Digital Database of Runaway Slave Advertisements,” International Social Science Review vol 76 no.
