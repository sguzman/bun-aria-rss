Being vulnerable and showing up in our difficult emotions are actually super important steps, though, if we want to be emotionally agile. On this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I was excited to chat with Susan David about emotional agility and skills for dealing with the real world from an open and honest place, without running from the feelings that we don’t like.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Susan David, Ph.D. is one of the world’s leading management thinkers and an award-winning Harvard Medical School psychologist. Her new #1 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestselling book, <em>Emotional Agility, </em>describes the psychological skills critical to thriving in times of complexity and change. Susan’s TED Talk on the topic went viral with over 1 million views in its first week of release. She is a frequent contributor to the <em>Harvard Business Review, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal,</em> and guest on national radio and television.
