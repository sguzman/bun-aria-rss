  "description": "<p>18-year-old Naomi Irion was last seen on security footage, sitting in her vehicle while waiting for the shuttle she takes to work at Panasonic in the Reno-Sparks area. The footage also shows a man walking from the direction of a homeless camp and lurking among the parked vehicles. Naomi’s brother, Casey Valley, says that security footage seemed to show the suspect saying or doing something that made Naomi move from the driver’s seat to the passenger seat. Irion was in the passenger’s seat as the man drove away. Investigators found Naomi’s blue 1992 Mercury Sable on March 15 at the Fernley industrial park. They said evidence inside the car suggests that a crime was committed. Naomi is described as a white female who stands 5-feet-11-inches tall with green eyes (one eye is green and brown). She has dyed black hair, according to her family, who created a GoFundMe page to help with search costs. Anyone with information should call the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office at 775-463-6620 and reference case 22LY01068. You can also contact Secret Witness at 775-322-4900.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Diana Irion - Victim's Mother, Facebook: \"Naomi Irion-Missing/Abduction-Fernley, Nevada\"</li>\n<li>Tamara Cartwright - Victim's Sister</li>\n<li>Kirk Nurmi - Legal Commentator and Cast Member: \"Radical Body Transformation Season 3 on Amazon Prime\", Author: \"Trapped with Ms. Arias\" KirkNurmi.com @nurmiunchained,</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, (Atlanta GA) www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Greg Smith - Special Deputy Sheriff, Johnson County Sheriff's Office (Kansas), Executive Director of the Kelsey Smith Foundation, www.kelseysarmy.com </li>\n<li>Audrey Conklin - Reporter, Fox News Digital, Twitter: @audpants</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
