  "description": "<p>Countless Americans don’t have a plan for how much they will spend or who they will be buying for this holiday season. What results is we end up with that all too familiar spending hangover with folks paying off those “unforeseen” expenses well into the New Year. Instead, we can avoid that debt by beginning to think and save now (even starting to save now for next year!), and creating a spending plan that includes things like gift budgeting, making cuts to your list of who to include, and tracking your spending. And while you’re making these changes, it’s really important to communicate the reasons why you might be cutting back- you don’t want your friends thinking you hate them! Talking about it with those you care about is an important step and we dive into how to do that effectively.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Timely Surrender by Archetype Brewing- another big thanks to Brad and Corina up at Archetype for donating the beers to the show this week!
