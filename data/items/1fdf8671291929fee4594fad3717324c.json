  "description": "In August of 2006, a 23-year-old woman headed out to a nightclub as a “last hurrah” before returning to college in Eastern Texas. Her car was later found abandoned on the side of a highway and thought to have run out of gas, but she was nowhere to be found. As investigators began looking into her last known steps, they found some peculiar surveillance footage and even discovered that her cell phone was actively being used by an unknown man.
