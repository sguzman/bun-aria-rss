  "description": "As you know, it’s my mission to help teach you how to build the MINDSET and SKILLS that will help you live an extraordinary life - and over the last few months I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to help create a brand-new tool that will help you do that. It’s called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life. To learn more, join my Discord at <a href=\"http://impacttheory.com/discord\" rel=\"noopener\">http://impacttheory.com/discord</a><br /><br />Big goals require DISCIPLINE. By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com!<br /><br />On Today's Episode: <br /><br />Were you one of the 47 million Americans that voluntarily quit their job in 2021, a massive event now referred to as the Great Resignation? If you didn’t quit, maybe you came close to submitting your resignation and decided not to. The burning question is, what did people move towards after leaving their job? Was it a burn the ships at the shore kind of moment or a hasty emotional move caused by mounting stress in the moment?<br /><br />No matter where you are in your career or business, there is one critical question you should be asking yourself. How are you, really?<br /><br />Jenna Kutcher has pivoted her career and entrepreneurial moves more than a few times. She’s not a stranger to adversity, stress, disappointment or asking the hard questions. From wedding photography, to podcast host, to helping entrepreneurs grow their email list, Jenna shares her secret sauce to pivoting career moves successfully, and how to align with success in a way that is fulfilling and feels right to you.<br /><br />Stop falling into the hustle culture trap and start asking yourself questions that awaken you at your core. Hustle culture isn’t necessarily all-in, burn the ships, forget sleep, your sanity, your rest and recovery. There’s another path and another option to achieving the success you’re after. <br /><br />Check out Jenna Kutcher's new book, How Are You Really: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3O6QLdO\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3O6QLdO</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Jenna Kutcher<br />0:48 | Growing Your Self Awareness<br />6:30 | Rest.
