According to the lease terms, he doesn't have to continue paying rent on that apartment if he can find a replacement tenant. He does exactly that, but his landlord says that he has to keep paying rent because the landlord is going to give his apartment to somebody else. OP says, \"Nope! I don't think so!\" and slaps him with some malicious compliance contract law and doesn't pay an extra penny in rent.</p>\n",
