  "description": "<p>Yeah, we know there’s a global pandemic, but there’s no one better to take your mind off of things than Raanan Hershberg! He’s got a fantastic late night set on James Corden, a killer album out called Downhill Ever Since (that Caitlin designed the album artwork for), and an amazing story that involves horse racing and hand raising. We recorded this album before COVID-19 really changed the game, so thank goodness we got this hilarious story here to truly take your mind off things. Here are five words to describe this episode: don’t rip up the check.</p>",
