  "description": "<p>Let’s be honest: there are certain myths about sex that are SO common, they seem like truth. Things like: what it means to be wet, what it means to be hard, and what it means if you use a vibrator a lot. But guess what? A ton of the things you and I have both heard about sex aren’t based on science - they’ve just been repeated a lot. So on today’s show, I’m debunking the top sex myths I see and hear, and giving you the actual facts.</p><br><p><a href=\"http://sexwithemily.com/subscribe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here to Subscribe.</a></p><br><p>What does it mean about your sexual ability if you’ve had a lot of partners - or conversely, hardly any? We talk about it. How about if you’re not getting wet during sex. Does that mean you’re not turned on? We discuss! Let’s say you use a vibrator a lot - can you get addicted to it? Or my favorite: does having an orgasm mean the sex was good? I tackle both of these. And finally, we face the truth about anal sex, because spoiler alert...it’s not just for gay men.</p><br><p><strong><em>For more information about or to purchase the products mentioned in this podcast, click below:</em></strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dameproducts.com/pages/sex-with-emily-podcast?utm_source=sexwithemily&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=sexwithemily_podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dame: Practice Your Pleasure</a></p><p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Tih9p4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Promescent: Better In Bed</a></p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><p>Episode:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/lube-it-or-leave-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lube It Or Leave It</a></p><p>Episode:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/kink-casual-sex-w-justin-lehmiller/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kink & Casual Sex w/ Justin Lehmiller</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Episode:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/seducing-the-booty-w-alicia-sinclair/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seducing the Booty w/ Alicia Sinclair</a></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3FzhcFL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">B-Vibe: Anal Training Kit & Education Set</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
