They then turn to the phones and speak to a caller who has questions about his pregnant wife potentially getting a Covid booster shot and is looking for advice. They also speak to a caller who points out the candidate Charlie Crist accusing Ron DeSantis of shutting down Florida as a result of Covid. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2\nMindbloom.com/ADS",
