  "description": "In October thousands of delegates are expected to arrive in the Russian resort of Sochi for an extraordinary gathering. It will be the first ever conference between Russia and the countries of Africa. President Putin is due to hold meetings with African heads of state to discuss Russia's ties to the continent. Russia is rekindling links with Africa that existed during the Cold War and creating new partnerships with countries which, in the past, had closer ties to the West. Some have already accepted Moscow's military support while others have signed energy and mining deals with Russian companies. So what is Russia's Africa doctrine? Are these budding relationships more about business or diplomacy? What do African nations gain by moving closer to Russia? And, is Moscow trying to join a race that, in fact has already been won by Beijing? Julian Marshall and a panel of expert guests discuss Russia’s future in Africa.",
