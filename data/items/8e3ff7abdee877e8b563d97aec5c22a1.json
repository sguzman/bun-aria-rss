  "description": "When Kathy Matsui first published research on \"Womenomics,\" exploring the economic outcomes of women in the workforce, Japan had one of the lowest female participation rates in the developed world. Now, 20 years later, Japan's female participation rate is 71%, which tops the US and Europe. In this episode, Kathy Matsui joins us in the studio to discuss the progress that has been made over the next two decades and where challenges remain. \"I believe Womenomics is working in Japan's context,\" Matsui says, though she notes that it remains \"a work in progress\" with significant room to improve the nation's gender leadership and pay gap.\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on April 23, 2019.\n\n\nAll price references and market forecasts correspond to the date of this recording.
