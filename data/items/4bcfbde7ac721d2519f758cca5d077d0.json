  "description": "<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoor\nadversaries intend to maliciously control the predictions of attacked DNNs by\ninjecting hidden backdoors that can be activated by adversary-specified trigger\npatterns during the training process. One recent research revealed that most of\nthe existing attacks failed in the real physical world since the trigger\ncontained in the digitized test samples may be different from that of the one\nused for training. Accordingly, users can adopt spatial transformations as the\nimage pre-processing to deactivate hidden backdoors. In this paper, we explore\nthe previous findings from another side. We exploit classical spatial\ntransformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as\ntrigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor\nattack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the\nembedded backdoor of attacked DNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted,\nverifying the effectiveness of our attack under both digital and physical\nsettings and its resistance to existing backdoor defenses.\n</p>",
