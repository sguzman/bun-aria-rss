  "itunes:summary": "Staged as part of the NTU CCA Singapore’s recurring Free Jazz exhibition program, this iteration of Machine Listening focuses on the complex and evolving dialectic between improvisation and control, framed via a detour into the experimental computer music laboratories of the 1980s and 1990s where the term ‘machine listening’ first begins to circulate. Here we hear work from Jessica Feldman, Mattin, and Lee Gamble.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/machine-listening-improvisation-and-control\n\nMachine Listening\n13 March 2021\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZvK8atIlnA&ab_channel=LiquidArchitecture\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, NTU, UnSound, Melbourne University and ANU\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
