  "title": "97 - Spartacus: When Gladiators Attacked Rome Itself",
  "description": "<p>Spartacus was a Thracian gladiator who escaped his gladiatorial school in Capua with about 70 other gladiators and slaves and then led a slave rebellion against the armies of Rome in the 1st century BCE , commanding a fighting force that grew to an army of 90,000–120,000 strong. We explore his fight and the interesting history of Roman gladiatorial combat in today's Suck. Men (and women!) facing off against each other in arenas, forums, and coliseums in fights that often lasted until severe injury or the death. Insane emperors, trident-wielding warriors, spear-wielding elephants, and so much more in today's tale of Roman debauchery and the man who almost took down a Republic.</p>\n<p>My new<strong> free Behind the Bit Pandora station </strong>with Chad Daniels talking about our favorite bits! <strong><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/station/play/3978690913982414208?ag=17920720304261509\">https://www.pandora.com/station/play/3978690913982414208?ag=17920720304261509</a><a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/station/play/3978690913982414208?ag=17920720304261509\"></a></strong></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>The Great Courses Plus! </strong>Do yourself a HUGE favor and get SO MUCH amazing, interesting, and informative content for FREE: <a href=\"https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/timesuck\"><strong>https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/timesuck</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by <strong>HIMS! </strong>Get a trial month of everything you need to keep your hair - for just $5 today, right now while supplies last, by going to <a href=\"https://www.forhims.com/timesuck\"><strong>https://www.forhims.com/timesuck</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
