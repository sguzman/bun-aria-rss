  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, crazed LGBT activists at a Texas university go insane, shouting, screaming, stomping, and spitting because a campus speaker said that we shouldn’t castrate little boys. This is the state of the university system in our country. We’ll talk about it, and play some of the footage, today. Also, Ron DeSantis provoked widespread media condemnation because he told some kids that they don’t have to wear a mask. He’s right, of course, as usual. Plus a handful of Republicans refuse to sign a congressional resolution in support of Ukraine. We’ll look at their reasoning and you can decide if they were wrong or right. And Ukraine has found a way to deal with looters. It’s a strategy we should think of adopting. In our Daily Cancellation, a Hollywood icon is in trouble with the mob because he didn’t like Hollywood’s latest gay western. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
