You know the drill. Some recent episodes include a sleepy retelling of the myth of Atlantis, or a 6 part sci-fi sleep story about a search for a hypnotic space plant. It's cool. So, yeah, subscribe to <strong><a href=\"https://getsleepy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get Sleepy</a></strong> tonight and give it a listen. </p>\n\n<p>Actions you can take to speak out on behalf of Walter Wallace- <a href=\"https://www.workingeducators.org/statement_on_walter_wallace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.workingeducators.org/statement_on_walter_wallace</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong> I cannot create a safe place for everyone without stopping to pause and look at what changes I need to make to support that fact.
