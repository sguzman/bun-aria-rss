The answer is multifaceted, but a common theme of industrialized agriculture runs throughout. Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> I talk to Allen Williams about how we have strayed from beneficial regenerative farming practices to adopt destructive ones, and how to find our way back.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Allen is a founding partner of Understanding Ag, LLC and the Soil Health Academy, and is a partner in Joyce Farms, Inc. He has consulted with more than 4,000 farmers and ranchers in the US and other countries, on operations ranging from a few acres to over 1 million acres. Allen and his partners pioneered many of the early regenerative agriculture principles and practices and now teach those to farmers globally. He is a “recovering academic,” having served 15 years on the faculty at Louisiana Tech University and Mississippi State University teaching genetics and physiology. Allen has been featured in the Carbon Nation film series, <em>Soil Carbon Cowboys</em>, on the <em>Dr. Oz</em> show, ABC <em>Food Forecast News</em>, and in <em>Kiss The Ground, A Regenerative Secret, The Farmer’s Footprint</em> film series, and the <em>Sacred Cow</em> film series.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by BiOptimizers, Thrive Market, and Cozy Earth.</p><br><p>Right now, BiOptimizers is offering my community 10% off their CogniBiotics, a brain and mood-enhancing probiotic that contains specifically chosen strains with a high level of research supporting mental health and performance.
