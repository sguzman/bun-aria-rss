  "description": "<p>Barstool Sports has settled its case with the National Labor Relations Board stemming from complaints about Dave Portnoy's anti-union (alleged) tweets. Now we have to hang a sign in the studio for 60 days letting Blind Mike know he has the right to organize. Kirk Minihane learns of a troubling update with his studio accommodations down in Miami next week (00:12:26). Some guy in California has a hilarious vanity license plate (00:25:45). Curt Schilling narrowly misses the Hall of Fame thanks to idiot baseball writers and their hurt feelings (00:59:45). The show is genuinely concerned over the mental state Boston Public Radio host Margery Eagan displayed on yesterday's broadcast (1:03:25). Minihane addresses an ethical matter after yesterday's decision to remove a few lines of a parody song from the podcast (1:30:21). An old story from Greg A. Bedard raises some Cullenesque questions (1:44:32).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
