  "description": "<p>💬 Are you a @jayshetty fan? &nbsp;&nbsp;Confession, I never really knew who Jay was prior to reading his book. I had seen some clips but didn’t know much about his philosophy. So as soon as his book came out I was intrigued to read his thoughts on life and specifically on being a monk. 🤔 &nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the book didn’t provide that much value for me. However, it is full of wonderful insights. 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly enjoyed the section on detachment as I believe we could all be a lot more fulfilled if we detached from this world. Specifically he quotes Imam Ali which made me appreciate his research when writing this book. But this was also the reason why it didn’t provide much value for me. 🙏 &nbsp;&nbsp;When you have an existing religious and spiritual framework that encapsulates how to live properly, it’s difficult for anyone to write something that can add anything more onto it. That’s how I felt reading this book. The points were wonderful and clear, it was thought provoking and definitely can change many people’s lives. However, for anyone who has studied religion they will know most of these principles. 📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this book for? Well, I think it’s for those that are looking for a framework for how to live that don’t already have one. I am a big believer in religion and spiritually so this book could lead people down that path. For anyone who is already made that commitment this could be an interesting read, but I can’t see it providing too much additional value. ❤️ &nbsp;&nbsp;My assessment of @jayshetty is that I like the message he is presenting and commend him for the work he has done. But, it’s diffcult to encapsulate so much into one book while making it detailed. Nevertheless, it’s valuable for a certain demographic. 👍📚 &nbsp;&nbsp;💬 Comment below if you have read this book or if you’re planning to read it! &nbsp;Thank you for watching this video.
