  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep down, we want to know we’re doing motherhood right. That we’re not failing or heading down the wrong path in life. This is true for our everyday choices about meals, screens, activities, and the way we spend our time. But it’s also true for how we work through tough relationships, respond to our kid’s hard questions, and make life-changing decisions. How do we know God’s will? In today’s episode, Emily and Laura tackle this question, because it’s not as complicated as you might think! We often wonder if we’re on track, but God’s word doesn’t leave us in the dark. He reveals his design, giving us clear commands, wise principles for life, and a framework for living like Christ in each situation.</span> <p>____</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re so thankful for</span> <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten Words to Live By</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Jen Wilkin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this mini-series possible!</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">This book is a fresh, biblical look at the Ten Commandments and how they impact our lives today.
