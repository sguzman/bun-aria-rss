  "title": "Bad Bunny Has A Message For Your Mom",
  "description": "Latin Trap megastar Bad Bunny may be best known to American audiences for his feature on Cardi B’s #1 “I Like It’, but the Puerto Rican native is known to music-lovers worldwide for more than just those few bars. Bunny started off as a student in Universidad de Puerto Rico studying audio visual communications. He was bagging groceries at a supermarket in PR when he posted his song ‘Diles’ on SoundCloud. That moody, 808-fueled track turned into a record deal, as well as huge feature opportunities with bigger acts like Becky G, and of course--Cardi. His newest project, YHLQMDLG (an acronym that stands for the Spanish translation of “I do what I want”) is currently smothering the Hot Latin Billboard Chart. The albums opening track, \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" had us listening to the origins of Bossa nova, and investigate how elevator music-sounding samples and overused chord progressions add up to latin trap magic for El Conejito Malo. \nSpecial thanks to Bad Bunny super fan and listener Maita, for never giving up hope :)\n\nSongs discussed:\nBad Bunny - Diles\nBecky G ft. Bad Bunny - Mayores\nCardi B ft. Bad Bunny, J Balvin - I Like It\nBad Bunny ft. Drake - MIA \nBad Bunny - Si Veo a tu Mamá\nAntônio Carlos Jobim - The Girl From Ipanema\nBad Bunny - Soliá\nBad Bunny ft. Kendo Kaponi, Arcangel - P FKN R\nBad Bunny ft.
