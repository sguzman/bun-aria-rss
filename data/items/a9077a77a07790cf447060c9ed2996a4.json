  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! It's only January, but if you've followed me for the past few weeks, you've come to realize how important this month really is. I covered one key conference (CES2017) a couple weeks ago. And on today's episode, I have two more coming for you. It's a lot of information in only just a few weeks but bare with me... Each of these conferences come with game-changing announcements. To start, let’s go over what a difference a year makes... Donald Trump is now in office, and the bull market continues to get stronger. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit over 20,000 for the first time this week! This “Trump rally” has been strong for investors in every sector… except for one - Biotech. That’s why I invited Marc… Marc is Chief Income Strategist at the Oxford Club, Editor of the Oxford Income Letter and host of the Oxford Club Radio podcast. He just got back from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. For those not familiar, the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference its like the Superbowl for healthcare, biotech, and pharmaceuticals. To start off the interview, Marc gives us his takeaways from the event. As Marc explains, the biotech sector has recently been facing a ton of headwinds. The sector currently faces a slew of new regulations as new administration takes the reigns. And in return, the biotech sector got a bit more complex. Although times are rough today, Marc breaks down his opportunistic outlook for the sector going forward. Investors must be patient as we are still in the \"early innings\" of biotech treatment Marc says. However, he adds that the demand for this sector will explode relatively soon. Together, we then break down the trends and stocks that are going to have the highest impact on the sector. These trends include big data and DNA sequencing. Also, before Marc signs off, he shares with us his favorite growth & income stock outside of the biotech sector. Then, for today's Educational Segment [39:31], I break down my visit to the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - the largest junior mining conference in the world. The host and close friend, Marin Katusa, invited me to speak at the event. This is where it gets interesting… Out of the 5,000 people at this conference, not one person seemed to be bearish on the resource sector. What does that mean? ...It means I'm nervous. Let's not forget... Only 1 in 3,000 projects go from early stage development to actual production. To make matters worse, some of these stocks are already up 100%-300% from their lows yet people are still doubling their positions! But it's not all bad news. Although about 90% of these companies are terrible long-term investments, a few CEO's I met with were far from bluffing. Tune in as I introduce listeners to the few stocks that caught my attention. One is a stock that could potentially be the next Northern Dynasty!",
