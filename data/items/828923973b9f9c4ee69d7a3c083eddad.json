  "description": "In Heirloom Houses : the Architecture of Wade Weissmann (Gibbs Smith, 2018), Steven Stolman explains how the houses designed by Wade Weissmann and his firm tell the stories of the homeowners. Like beautiful music, a Wade Weissmann house is composed of notes and expressions, rhythm and syncopation, moving forward in time and space toward a resolution that separates ordinary from extraordinary architecture: harmony. Known for their shingle-style homes, they also design ranch houses and equestrian estates, romantic cottages, contemporary penthouses, and lake homes.\nThere is nothing ordinary about a WWA house; custom wood work, architectural details, and the finest materials set these residences apart from all others. Also featured are a couple of striking commercial designs.\nSteven Stolman is a writer and designer with an observant eye on high society. He has a keen sense of the history of design in fashion, architecture and interiors. He is a brand consultant and sought-after speaker. He has authored four previous books, among them Scalamandre: Haute Décor.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
