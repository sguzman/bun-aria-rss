  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a month and a half ago, Zach decided he wanted to host an Alpha Underdog Empowerment event.  Most people would plan these events for 6 months to a year in advance, but Zach wasn’t going to wait. Pulling it together in just 45 days, the first annual event brought in over 80 attendees. The key was deciding to go all in, to pull the trigger, jump off the cliff, and grow wings on the way down. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life threw many curveballs at Zach during those 45 days, but he overcame each one, always keeping his eye on the prize. Now he’s planning for next year's event. With 8x more time for planning, he plans to get 5,000+ underdogs in a room. Being on a larger scale, next year's event will cost more, but if you act now you can get tickets at a heavily discounted price. Head over to www.underdogempowerment.com/aue before this Friday to take advantage of the early bird special.</span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How Zach pulled off a live event 45 days out.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How doing inner work has allowed him to enjoy his successes.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What the vision for next year's event is.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to get in on the early bird sale for next year.</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When your backs against the wall, there ain’t nowhere to go but forward.” -</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Zach Babcock</span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple</span></a> Podcasts – leave<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a review and let us know what you thought!
