  "description": "<p> </p> <p>Dolls are one of the oldest and original toys. Dolls have been used for more than just play though. Sometimes they are used in religious rites, for magic or education. The main characteristic of dolls is the fact that they are made to resemble human beings. Could some dolls carry more than just a resemblance to humans? Could some of them contain a soul or spirit? Join us as we explore a brief history of dolls and then share the tales of many dolls that seem to do more than just sit idly and stare blankly into space. The Moment in Oddity features the St. Louis Ghost Train and This Day in History features the first American political cartoon: Join or Die.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-45-history-and-haunting.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-45-history-and-haunting.html</a></p>",
