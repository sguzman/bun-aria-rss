  "description": "<p>Friday 9/22- Today on the show we had female rapper Rapsody in the building where she spoke about female MC's, who her inspiration was and more. We also had Christian rapper Lecrae come by where he spoke about saving a transgender's life, new music and more. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a man that tried to rob a gas station by taking food, alcohol, and cigarettes, but got caught because he ran out of gas when he was just at a gas station! Some Donkey's of the Day's just sell themselves.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
