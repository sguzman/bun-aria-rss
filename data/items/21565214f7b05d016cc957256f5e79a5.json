Ladies and gentlemen, we give you “Evil Genius.”<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>In 2003 in Erie, Pennsylvania, a robbery gone wrong and a terrifying public murder capture the nation's attention, and a bizarre collection of Midwestern hoarders, outcasts, and lawbreakers play cat-and-mouse with the FBI. Eventually, a middle-aged mastermind named Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong -- once a town beauty, now a woman grappling with mental illness -- is arrested. But 15 years later, this documentary proves there’s more to the conspiracy and murders than was ever thought.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Looking for more TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered \"Serial\" episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an interview with Rabia Chaudry--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig.
