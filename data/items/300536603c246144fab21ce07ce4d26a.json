  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Gregg Rosenthal recap a WILD Sunday of football, starting with the thriller between the Cardinals and Raiders (2:36). The heroes talk through four other games with insane endings: the Dolphins erasing a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit in Baltimore (10:25), the Jets' extremely improbable victory in Cleveland (17:31), the Cowboys' last-second win over the Bengals (26:13), and the Rams holding on to beat the Falcons (32:13). Next, the heroes cover Tom Brady's first regular season victory over the Saints since moving to Tampa Bay (40:25) before welcoming in Nick Shook for help recapping Giants-Panthers (48:16) and Broncos-Texans (54:26). After the break, we get into Trey Lance's injury as the 49ers defeated the Seahawks (1:00:32), the Lions first win of the season over the Commanders (1:08:07), the Patriots taking down the Steelers (1:12:54), and the Jaguars throttling of the Colts (1:16:30). Finally, we finish things off with the Packers-Bears Sunday Night Football match (1:23:58). </p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
