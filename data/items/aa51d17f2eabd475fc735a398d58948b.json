  "description": "<p>Actor and storyteller Yin Chang and restaurateur Moonlynn Tsai met over a meal, fell in love at Burning Man (yes, they share that story), and put their personal lives on hold to care for elders in New York’s Chinatown with nutritious, culturally appropriate meals. At the start of the pandemic, the two realized the elder community needed help, so they stepped forward, bringing their friends and colleagues along in support of the cause and creating Heart of Dinner in the process. The violence directed toward the AAPI community over the past few years has only intensified their desire to make a difference. Yin and Moonlyn stopped by Radio Cherry Bombe to share their story with host Kerry Diamond. Learn about the work Heart of Dinner is doing today and what you can do to help.
