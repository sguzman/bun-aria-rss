The day after the disastrous Democrat debate the media resurrects the Russia hoax.\n \nWhy did this Mueller team offer a sweetheart deal to this George Soros’ business rival?\n \nTrump’s economy is the economy Obama always wanted. \n \nElizabeth Warren, who said she would take any support from super PACs, is now taking support from super PACs. \n \nCalifornia’s anti-Uber law is blowing up in the lawmaker’s faces. \n \nCopyright Dan Bongino All Rights Reserved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
