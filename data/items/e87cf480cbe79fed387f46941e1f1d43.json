    "media:description": "This October I’m taking a look at some of the newest horror films that are streaming, rather than just looking at old stuff. Today we’re talking about a YouTuber in a haunted house who’s doing a livestream, except it turns into a Deadstream! It just came out on Shudder, here’s what I thought about it.\n\nStarring Joseph Winter, who also wrote and directed the film along with his wife Vanessa Winter.\n\nFollow James:\nhttps://twitter.com/cinemassacre\n\nFor everything else Cinemassacre:\nhttps://cinemassacre.com/\n\n#Deadstream #Shudder #MonsterMadness #JamesRolfe",
