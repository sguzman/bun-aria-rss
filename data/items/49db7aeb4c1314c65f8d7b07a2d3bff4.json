  "description": "<p>Cooper Turley is all in, all the time. He’s been that way since he was a kid. In the crypto space, it truly seems like he’s everywhere at once. He knows everyone and has his hands in nearly every relevant project.</p> <p>However, none of this happened by chance. Cooper is a champion of the grinder mindset, and it echoes through everything he touches. His approach to his career, relationships, and self-improvement buzzes with a productive energy to build and bring value to all that he does. We all have something to learn from Cooper Turley.</p> <p>As crypto continues to mature, it’s clear that big things are lined up for Cooper. We can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ONJUNO | Crypto from your Checking Account!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:39 Cooper Turley & Runescpe<br /> 9:22 Grinding & Sports</p> <p>13:18 Video Starts</p> <p>15:19 College & Music<br /> 18:36 Mindfulness & Schedule<br /> 25:38 Crypto in 2017<br /> 33:26 Bear Market Building<br /> 40:59 Working on Everything<br /> 45:31 🔥_🔥<br /> 51:08 Hollywood Cooper IRL<br /> 57:48 Bull Market Behavior<br /> 1:00:49 Intersecting Crypto & Culture<br /> 1:05:14 A Horizontal Approach<br /> 1:12:01 On the Road<br /> 1:16:21 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Cooper on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?s=20</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
