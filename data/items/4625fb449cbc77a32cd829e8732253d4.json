  "description": "<p>This week I share some big news and get super deep after suffering a cold in bed (inferior immune system = weakness) and watch so many great TV shows. The wisdom of Korean Soap Operas and \"This is Us\". Why is it that the more we want something, the more it eludes us? Also, how to get over your own story and start living in the present! I answer some emails  - a wife is sick and tired of making her husband's sandwiches and wonders if she's being his mom. A young man wonders if he should give up on his dream. A guy writes in with a fetish he's really ashamed of. Should he be? All this and more! Let's get our lives and get super deep, bros. </p> <p> </p>\n",
