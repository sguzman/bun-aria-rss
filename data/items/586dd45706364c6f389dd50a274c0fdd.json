  "description": "As many of you know, Frank is in Las Vegas this week attending the 2022 Consumer Electronic Show (CES 2022). In the meantime, I (Daniel) am taking over the mic.  A recent report highlighted why Americans are “unhappy” with the handling of the COVID pandemic. But it does indicate a positive shift for the economy—and the markets. [2:17] I’ve been critical of Jim Cramer in the past… but credit where it’s due. Cramer recently made a strong argument about the risks we face from China. I explain why I’d steer clear of China as a long-term investment… but it might make a good trade in the short term. [10:15] With inflation set to ramp up this year, I highlight several “boring” stocks that are set to benefit from an inflationary environment. [17:35] Finally, I share a few updates from Frank on the most dominant tech trends showcasing at CES 2022… including one that’s “adults only.” [21:46] For CES updates, including interviews with tech leaders and potential stock ideas, you can follow Frank on , , and on Curzio's .
