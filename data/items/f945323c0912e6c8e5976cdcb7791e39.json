  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\nHope you are having a wonderful day so far. Today I wanted to talk about Sante and Kenny Kimes who were, busy, VERRRYYYY busy. Would love to hear your thoughts about Kenny and his sentencing. ALSO, I cut out SO MUCH more to this story but again, things were getting SO confusing with all these names being thrown around, I just decided to keep it straight to the point and not get too confusing. Thank you for your time.Â  But other than that Please be safe out there, I love and appreciate you guys so much and I will be seeing you very soon! <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nP.S.
