  "description": "<p>A fire can be super useful or cozy or even magical. But it can also be dangerous -- and in the case of wildfires, if they burn long and hot enough, they can destroy ecosystems and send lots of harmful smoke into the air. </p>\n<p>In this episode, we're going to find out why wildfires are getting bigger and why wildfire season is lasting longer now. We'll learn how the tribes who've lived in what is now called Northern California managed the forests and kept fire in check for thousands of years, and how those practices are being used today. </p>\n<p>We'll hear from a friendly house about how to stay safe from smoke inside and find out how firefighters work to contain fires once they've started. </p>\n<p>Plus, our Moment of Um answers the question: Is the name of a letter considered a word?<br><br>This episode is sponsored by Bobby Wonder, a podcast from GoKidGo.
