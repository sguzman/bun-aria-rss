  "description": "NEW YEAR, NEW SEASON and we missed you!! If there’s ever been a time where we need people to grab us by the shoulders and tell us what is true and what is real, it is right now. We don’t need big fancy words to get us through our days, we need to go back to the simple and pure things God has given us to stay close to Him and love people well. There is a way out of the chaos in our minds, the fear, the confusion and lack of vision - it’s in clinging to our Bibles and knowing what to do next because of it. Let’s spend 10 weeks going back to the basics every single one of us needs to know… things like how to pray, what to do with sin, how to read your Bible, and why we all need to have fun sometimes. These 10 weeks will give you practical steps you can take right now and challenge you to follow God and go deeper with Him.",
