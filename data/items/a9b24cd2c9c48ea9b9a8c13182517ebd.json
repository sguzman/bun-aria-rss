  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole OP is a teenage girl who's attending an event with her parent's friends. She also has much darker skin than her siblings. When she goes to clean the dishes, one of the party guests starts talking to OP and just assumes that OP is the maid, apparently because of her dark skin. OP, being a teenager, pranks the guest by going along with their assumption and calling her siblings \"young master.\" When the truth gets revealed, the guest is so embarrassed she has to leave. Who's the butthole here: OP or the guest?</p>\n",
