If you like it, you can keep going from there and listen to the whole of Season 1, reading along with us as we discuss this gorgeous series we love so much. In it, we will answer questions like: What the heck is IAD? Who the heck is Rune? Why on earth are the two of you always talking about MacRieve brain? and Is a hero bringing a heroine a bag of her enemies’ heads really a good grand gesture? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you already know all these answers, have a listen to the new intro, and enjoy a fun trip down memory lane.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read-along will be <em>Munro</em>, Book 18 of the Immortals After Dark series.
