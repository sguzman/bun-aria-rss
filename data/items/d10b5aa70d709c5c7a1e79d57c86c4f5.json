  "description": "<p>Very recently, the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array collaborations reported\nstrong evidence for a correlation between the highest energy cosmic rays and\nnearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of\n$4.6\\sigma$. It is well known that the collective effect of supernovae and\nwinds from massive stars in the central region of these galaxies drives a\ngalactic-scale superwind that can shock heat and accelerate ambient\ninterstellar or circumgalactic gas. In previous work we showed that, for\nreasonable source parameters, starburst-driven superwinds can be the carriers\nof ultra-high-energy cosmic ray acceleration. In this paper we assess the\nextent to which one can approach the archaeological ``inverse'' problem of\ndeciphering properties of superwind evolution from present-day IR emission of\ntheir host galaxies. We show that the Outer Limits galaxy NGC 891 could provide\n``smoking gun evidence'' for the starburst-driven superwind model of\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays.\n</p>",
