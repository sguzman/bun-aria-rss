  "description": "Our guest for this interview combines his academic expertise in American military history with his professional experience as an employee of the National Park Service. Marc Blackburn is the author of Interpreting American Military History at Museums and Historical Sites (Rowman and Littlefield, 2016). An expert in the interpretation and presentation of historical narratives and themes through material artifacts, archives, and exhibit space, Marc offers both a fresh perspective blending public and academic history in his book. Offering a series of observations on the state of public history in the United States, he also provides a short yet comprehensive chronological narrative of the nation’s military past. Like myself, a former student of Russell F. Weigley, Marc provides a refreshing conversation about the current and future states of the craft. One disclaimer: the thoughts that Marc Blackburn expresses in this interview and in his book are his own, and in no way reflect the policies or opinions of the National Park Service.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
