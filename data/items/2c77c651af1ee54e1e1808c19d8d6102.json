However, today's episode is different. We have over 40 episodes published. I am so grateful to each of you who have listened to and supported our show. As we approach a brand new year, it would be a good time to step back and reflect on some of my favorite moments on this show this last year, all through the lens of a new year and a new you. I hope you walk away from today's episode, seeing yourself in a new way, valuing yourself in a new way, and overall excited about a fresh start to a new year.</span></p>",
