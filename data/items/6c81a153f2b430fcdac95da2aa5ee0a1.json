  "description": "<p>Excuse the click-baity title. Caren Beilin had a copper IUD implanted, and was overwhelmed with health issues almost immediately. Six days later, the IUD was removed, but the damage, including the sparking of an autoimmune disorder, was done. Many women report similar serious problems, yet this information is very hard to come by in the consultation room. Beilin joins Jessa to talk about medicine's women problem, but also medicine's general sickness problem, and why disorders that affect certain populations -- like women, or black people -- are understudied and disbelieved.</p> <p>Support this podcast: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/publicintellectual\">http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</a></p> <p>http://jessacrispin.com</p>",
