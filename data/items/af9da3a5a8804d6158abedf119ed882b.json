  "itunes:summary": "The biggest wins in my creative journey never fit squarely into the whole “just follow your passion and everything will work out” philosophy, but they were never pure pragmatism either. For this reason, even after nearly 8 years of making a podcast that tries to strike the balance between the magic of creativity and the realism of building a career, I still felt pulled between these two extremes, with no real resolve.\n\nBut I recently stumbled upon a new perspective that synthesizes these two seemingly oppositional takes in such a powerful way that it instantly gave me clarity and action steps.\n\nIf you’re consistently stuck in the analysis paralysis between following your head or going with your heart, this episode will give you tools to strike the balance in a surprising and useful way.",
