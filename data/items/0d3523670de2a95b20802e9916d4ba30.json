  "title": "170 - Nazi Search for the Holy Grail",
  "description": "<p>The Nazi’s Search for the Holy Grail. We look at this today and also into so, so many other strange beliefs held by Heinrich Himmler, Hitler, and other occult-minded Nazis. Today we’re going real wackadoodle, talking about ice giants, the hollow earth, the lost island of Atlantis, and so much more. We’re looking into the origins of the myth of Aryan supremacy and Himmler’s quest for anything that might have given the Nazis the ability to conquer the world. <br /><br />Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
