He wrote his first novel over a period of five weeks, mostly while in a lab. That book, <em>Real Life, </em>was released in 2020<em> </em>to much critical acclaim<em>. </em>He published his second book this year, a short story collection called <em>Filthy Animals</em>. <br/><br/>Taylor talks to Sam about his focus on the tensions of everyday relationships, writing from a Black and queer perspective and his intended audience of just a couple close friends. <br/><br/>This conversation is part of a collaboration between NPR and the Library of Congress National Book Festival.
