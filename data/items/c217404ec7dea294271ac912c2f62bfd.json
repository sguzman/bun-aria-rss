  "description": "The only time you'll ever see the sun's outer atmosphere is during a full solar eclipse, when sun itself is completely covered. That hazy ring is called the corona, from the Latin word for \"crown\" -- just like the little crown on a bottle of Corona beer. Plus, the phrase \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" contains a vivid image of accidentally tossing something -- and so does the phrase \"to fly off the handle.\" But where did we get the expression \"to hell in a handbasket\"? The origin of this phrase is murky, although it may have to do with the fact that handbaskets are easily carried. Also: Biscuit Belt vs. Pine Belt, how to pronounce via, streely, pizza, tuckered out, FOOSH, and Sorry, Charlie!\n Read full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
