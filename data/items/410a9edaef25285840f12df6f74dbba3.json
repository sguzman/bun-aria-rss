We look at moments from around the world when workers took industrial action in pursuit of better conditions from geisha in Japan to tortured wig factory workers in South Korea. This programme contains descriptions of torture.\n\nDisney cartoonists went on strike for nine weeks in 1941. They were led by Art Babbitt, Disney’s top animator who created Goofy. The picket line was remarkable for its colourful artwork and support from Hollywood actors.\n\nAnousha Sakoui, an entertainment industry writer for the Los Angeles Times discusses the impact of the Disney strikes and significant moments when Hollywood workers fought for their rights. \n\n(Photo: Art Babbitt leads Disney animators holding placards with cartoon characters at a film premiere.
