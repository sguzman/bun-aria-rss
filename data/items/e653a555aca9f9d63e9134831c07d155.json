  "description": "<p>In constituency parsing, span-based decoding is an important direction.\nHowever, for Chinese sentences, because of their linguistic characteristics, it\nis necessary to utilize other models to perform word segmentation first, which\nintroduces a series of uncertainties and generally leads to errors in the\ncomputation of the constituency tree afterward. This work proposes a method for\njoint Chinese word segmentation and Span-based Constituency Parsing by adding\nextra labels to individual Chinese characters on the parse trees. Through\nexperiments, the proposed algorithm outperforms the recent models for joint\nsegmentation and constituency parsing on CTB 5.1.\n</p>",
