  "description": "This past weekend, I went to Saratoga to watch the races with some lifelong friends. My dad was a huge horse racing fan… and I share some of my favorite memories from our trips to the track.   Places like Saratoga can tell us a lot about the economy. I highlight what I saw—including the crowd sizes and prices—and whether it lines up with investors’ fears about a recession.  Speaking of boots-on-the-ground research, I’ll be at the Crypto Connect & NFT Expo in Palm Beach, Florida this weekend. If you’re interested in free VIP tickets, .  Turning to the market, I highlight what stood out in Walmart’s latest earnings results… and why the company deserves credit for handling the biggest risk to retailers. The talking heads on Wall Street have been dead wrong about inflation since January. Now that stocks are rising, they’re saying it’s nothing more than a bear market rally. I break down why they’re wrong (again)...  2022 has been rough for investors. But the Fed’s plan to bring down inflation is working. I cover some of the other risks… and highlight the one thing that would make me want to sell stocks and move to the sidelines. Finally, I share my thoughts on a biotech… sector that could soon soar.
