  "description": "<p>Let’s talk sexual tension and seduction, people. Maybe you’re single, and trying to brush up on your flirting skills. Or perhaps you’re in a long-term relationship, and frustrated that you don’t entice each other like you used to. Either way, I’m going to teach you how to build (or rebuild) sexual tension.</p><br><p>At its core, seduction <em>itself</em> is about creating sexual tension, and to pull that off, we need a few things at our disposal, like confidence and radical presence. It’s a sexy sort of restraint, where your behavior is suggestive (not explicit), and your vibe is patient (not desperate). So today’s episode is all about sharpening our skills in the sexy and suggestive department. Plus, I take your questions, like how to make the first move, how to turn sexual banter into actual sex, and much, much more.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/chemistry-attraction-connection-w-matthew-hussey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chemistry, Attraction & Connection w/ Matthew Hussey</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/how-to-be-a-master-dater-w-matthew-hussey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Be a Master Dater w/ Matthew Hussey</a></li></ul><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
