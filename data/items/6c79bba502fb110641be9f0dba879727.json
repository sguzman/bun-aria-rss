  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys recap the week from the box truck studio as they break down all the chaos and hilarity surrounding the week and how everything for the radio show and live stream was still being worked on down to the last second. Also included is a conversation with friend of the show, Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 2x NFL MVP, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. They battle tech issues at the start of the call and cover his relationship with Head Coach Matt LaFleur, how his relationship with Brett Favre has evolved over the years, his thoughts on the Packers week 1 performance against the Bears, and Aaron looks ahead to this weekend's matchup again the Vikings (8:48-38:40). Next, Pat's boothmate for Thursday Night College Football on ESPN and friend of the show, Matt Hasselbeck, stopped by the radio show to discuss the Aaron Rodgers/Brett Favre relationship, what it's like to be in a competitive QB room, &nbsp;the best places to hang out in an NFL facility, and the hardest hit he took in his NFL career (39:29-59:34). Later, one of Pat's bosses, the Cerebral Assassin, The Game, Triple H, joins the show. They discuss WWE becoming a massive global brand, his competition in the sports entertainment world and whether or not he thinks WWE will get in a Wednesday night war with AEW, and how he maintains his work/life balance (1:02:58-1:20:35). To close out the show, Digz gives a couple of NFL gambling locks, and Nick gives a few bangers to help send you into the weekend. It's a good one. Come laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
