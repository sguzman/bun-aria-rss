  "description": "<p>Since this is episode 404, we’re talking all about the money lessons that we can learn from our city Atlanta (which is sometimes referred to as the 404). You can learn lessons in unintended places- there are things to be learned all around us, if only we’re keeping an eye out for them. For instance, one of the impacts of the Covid lockdowns last year was that we couldn’t go anywhere and our calendars were pretty much wiped clean. And the unintended lesson that many Americans learned was that we probably had way too many events on the calendar to begin with. We quickly learned that less activities and more family time was a good thing. And so when it comes to Atlanta, there are a ton of different personal finance lessons that we can learn- from specific things like terrible traffic, the cultural diversity we find in the city, tax breaks being offered to the film industry, our sports teams, and plenty more! So be sure to listen in order to learn some valuable ATLien money lessons.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed BBA Siberius Maximus 10th Anniversary Cuvee RIS by Wrecking Bar Brewpub!
