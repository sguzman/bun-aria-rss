  "description": "<p>Adjunct professor in global digital economy Winston Ma, design and blockchain expert Marjorie Hernandez de Vogelsteller, and fashion tech lawyer Gina Bibby join founder of Retail Prophet, Doug Stephens, to assess the evolving payment space and behaviour.</p> <p>This episode tackles how consumers will shop, deep diving into the transaction processes themselves and how methods of payment are changing, from biometric payment to the Replenishment Economy, as well as innovative paths-to-purchase and how brands and retailers are engaging with them, including the gamification of sales and products.</p> <p>In 2020, Epic Games reported over $1 billion in microtransaction sales from the mobile version of the Fortnite game alone, across in-game upgrades, costumes and player capabilities. Seeing the potential in this space, brands across the value spectrum have embraced the world of gaming, from Nikeland on Roblox to Balenciaga’s Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow to showcase the brand’s Autumn Winter 2021 collection.</p> <p>“Both gaming and livestreaming are part of a broader move toward [...] ambient retail — a state where retail is everywhere, woven into every social or entertainment experience. [It is] an evolution that may spell the end of the centralised and search-driven web shopping convention we’ve lived with for the past 30 years,” says podcast host and founder of Retail Prophet, Doug Stephens.</p> <p>The conversation also considers the evolution of currency, from crypto and blockchain to Bitcoin and Ethereum, detailing their distinct qualities, entrance into the mainstream payment space and popularity among next-gen consumers. Indeed, more than half of Millennial millionaires have at least 50 percent of their wealth in crypto, while nearly 60 percent of Gen-Z believe wealth is achievable through investments in cryptocurrency, according to Business Insider.</p> <p>To deep dive into how the next-gen consumer will buy products and experiences in the future, BoF gathers three global authorities to share insights with host Doug Stephens.</p> <p><em><a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/retail-reborn-from-the-business-of-fashion/id1531328827\"> Follow</a> the series</em> <em>to ensure you never miss an episode and discover actionable insights into the opportunities and challenges the consumer of tomorrow will bring, and how retail’s transformation will impact your business.</em></p> <p><em>Brookfield Properties is building marketplaces of the future that meet the needs of the modern shopper. <a href= \"https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/brookfield-properties\"> Discover more.</a></em></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
