  "description": "In Episode #231, I sit down with Dr Alan Flanagan and Danny Lennon to examine cholesterol, statins, the ketogenic diet, and longevity. Dr Alan Flanagan and Danny Lennon address whether cholesterol matters if you’re metabolically healthy, why our veins don’t get atherosclerosis, and why our body makes cholesterol if it’s “bad for us”. They also offer advice on dietary adjustments you can make regardless of your dietary pattern, claims by social media “health gurus”, and much more.\nLDL cholesterol has been making waves on social media in recent years. With some diet camps making bold claims about its relevance and the apparently open-ended nature of the evidence, many folks are no doubt left unsure of how important cholesterol levels really are. In this episode, I’m joined by Danny Lennon and Dr Alan Flanagan to consider the role and importance of LDL cholesterol as we recap what the literature says.\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBasics of Cardiovascular Health (4:29)\n\nApoB for Predicting Disease (12:18)\n\nHeart Disease: Where things go wrong (23:23)\n\nWhat Causes Artery Damage? (38:47)\n\nPaul Saladino Claims (50:36)\n\nIs low cholesterol a problem? (1:04:07)\n\nFuture of Gene Editing (1:27:12)\n\nVeins vs Arteries (1:32:28)\n\nDiet Claims (1:41:08)\n\nHealthy Keto Diet (1:54:08)\n\nMCT Oil (2:00:02)\n\nHealthy Fats (2:03:28)\n\nFinal Thoughts (2:09:54)\n\nOutro (2:19:05)\n\n\nYou can find Dr Alan Flanagan on Instagram, and learn more about Alinea Nutrition at https://www.alineanutrition.com/.
