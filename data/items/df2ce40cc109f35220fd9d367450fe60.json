  "description": "<p>Operation Greenup was a covert OSS operation carried out by a special group of men many have called the<em> “real life Inglorious Basterds,</em>” a reference to the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film in which a group of US Jewish soldiers plot to assassinate high-up Nazi leaders. Two Jewish refugees living in Brooklyn - Frederick Mayer and Hans Wynberg, and Franz Weber, a <em>Wehrmacht</em> lieutenant and Allied POW who has belatedly come to his senses about the tyrannical, antisemitic, sociopathic nature of Adolf Hitler - parachute behind enemy lines to, amongst other intel objectives, gather intelligence regarding a mythical alpine fortress the Nazis may have built to extend WW2 by six months. Today's story reads like a movie - but all this bravery and espionage really happened.
