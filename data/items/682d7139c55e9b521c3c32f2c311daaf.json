  "description": "<p>Guided Reflection: Awakening through Conflict (from a talk given on 2014-04-23) - (13 min)</p>\n<p>“We live in a field where our emotions are an open loop – we affect each other. When we’re with someone who’s blaming, we tighten. Anger makes us tighten. When we’re with someone who’s open and caring, we become more open. It’s very, very powerful what’s possible when we put down the blame and we connect with our own being.”</p>\n<p>A guided reflection: If we learn to release blame and deepen attention to our embodied experience, conflict can become a portal for more loving, alive relationships and awakening into the fullness of our being.</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donate.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p>\n<p>With thanks and love, Tara</p>",
