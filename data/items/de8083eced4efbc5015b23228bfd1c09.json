I break down 4 tips that will help you stay as much of a beginner as long as possible.</p><p>Tip 1: Do the Opposite</p><p>Go against what you’ve been told to try something new. Use a wide angle lens and get close to your subject or use a telephoto lens and get really far away so your subject is small in the frame.</p><p>Tip 2: Do what others won’t, to take photos like others can’t.</p><p>Last year I interviewed Shane Balkowitch photographers using an almost 200-year-old method to capture images. He doesn’t do it because it’s easy and because so few shoot wet plates he has quickly made quite a name for himself.</p><p>Tip 3: Change Your Rythm</p><p>When you start to feel bored of your photos like you’re taking the same photo over and over again producing the same images, change up your style and allow yourself complete creative freedom in your editing.
