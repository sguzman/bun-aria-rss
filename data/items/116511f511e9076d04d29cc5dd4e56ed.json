  "description": "<p>Continuity across the shock wave of two regions in the metric during the\nformation of a black hole can be relaxed in order to achieve information\npreservation. A Planck scale sized spacetime discontinuity leads to unitarity\n(a constant asymptotic entanglement entropy) by restricting the origin of\ncoordinates (moving mirror) to be timelike. Moreover, thermal equilibration\noccurs and total evaporation energy emitted is finite.\n</p>",
