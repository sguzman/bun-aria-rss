  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Derek Jeter’s digital publishing platform, The Players’ Tribune, seeking a buyer. The digital media company is working with a financial adviser and could be sold in the coming weeks. It isn’t clear how much the platform is worth. Growth-starved digital media companies have been merging in the hopes of sparking a turnaround. Jeter is now part owner and CEO of the Miami Marlins. Also discussed is World Series ratings, which while down from previous years still wins the night for Fox. The Astros lead the best-of-seven series 3-2 with games returning to Houston. Also talked about is DAZN, the sports streaming service owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik and led by former ESPN President John Skipper, seeking to raise at least $500 million. DAZN has spent lavishly to acquire sports broadcast rights, including a $1 billion partnership with Matchroom Boxing.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
