  "description": "On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing two breakaway republics in Eastern Ukraine and sent troops to the region. On Tuesday, President Biden called the move \"the beginning of a Russian invasion\" and announced a new set of sanctions. <br/><br/>While Russia's actions reverberate throughout the world, no area has more at stake than Eastern Ukraine. That's where NPR correspondent Eleanor Beardsley has been reporting. <br/><br/>And despite the escalation this week, U.S. diplomats are hoping to keep Russia at the bargaining table. But as Yale history professor Timothy Snyder explains, a sarcastic tone from Russian officials makes talks difficult. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
