  "description": "<p>This week, in Washington, North Carolina, a very strange scene unfolds, when a man who doesn't seem to have much going for him, except a vampire name, has many women at his disposal, including a wife, and a pair of identical twins. While he lives in a trailer with his wife, and a school bus, with his twins, this odd arrangement doesn't end up working for everyone, and it sends him into a rage. But who will be on who's side? And how does any of this result in bound, gagged people, and \"skull plates\" resting nearby. A twisted story, leading to a bloody mess, and an odd game of death penalty chicken!</p><p><br></p><p>Along the way, we find out that breakfast is an important meal in the south, that having a vampire name doesn't make you an actual vampire, and when a pair of twins want blood, no one is stopping them!!</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo and Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p><br></p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com and use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on...</p><p><br></p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p><br></p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
