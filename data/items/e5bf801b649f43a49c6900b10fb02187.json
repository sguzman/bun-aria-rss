  "description": "<p>Kerith Overstreet is a triple threat: <a href= \"https://www.bruliamwines.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Bruliam Wines</a> co-founder and winemaker, medical doctor, and mom to three teens.  After retiring from general surgery to pursue pathology and then medicine to raise a family, she tried her hand at winemaking with one barrel. She quickly found she had the chops for it and her fourth baby, Bruliam Wines was established in 2008.</p> <p>Since then, Kerith has completed her enology courses at U.C. Davis and she is a one-woman show. She does EVERYTHING herself and the lovely single vineyard Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, and chardonnay benefit from it. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"http://www.undergroundwineevents.com\">www.undergroundwineevents.com</a> for tickets!</p> <p>Here are some of the things we cover in the show:</p> <ul> <li>Kerith takes us on her journey from growing up in San Diego, to East Coast college and med school student, to single vineyard, terroir-driven winemaker</li> <li>Kerith discusses the interplay between wine and medicine and how it affects her today</li> <li>We talk all about site, growers and why this kind of thing is the obsession of small winemakers</li> <li>We discuss Pinot Noir and why it's such a fascinating grape</li> <li>On a personal note, we discuss family, doing it as a one-woman show, and strange things people have said to Kerith in her time in wine</li> </ul> <p> You can get her wines at <a href= \"https://www.bruliamwines.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.bruliamwines.com</a></p> <p> </p> <p><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/ZG4A1483.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"137\" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Thanks to our sponsors this week: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/width_100_patreon_icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></a></strong></p> <p><strong>YOU! </strong>The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make the podcast possible and who we give goodies<br /> in return for their help!
