  "description": "<p>John&nbsp;Caglione, Jr. is an Academy Award and Emmy Award-Winning Makeup Artist. Obsessed with monster movies as a kid, he began studying makeup and special effects. A not-so-chance meeting with makeup legend, Dick Smith, turned him from a fan into a devotee of the craft. Graduating high-school, Smith then recommended John to the NBC Makeup Program where he ended up working with the original cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" for six years, before going out on his own. Having now built a decades-long career in film and TV, John's work includes \"Quest For Fire\", \"Zelig\", \"Cotton Club\", \"Heat\", \"Dick Tracy\" (for which he won the Oscar and British Academy Award). John also designed and applied Heath Ledger's 'Joker' character makeup in \"The Dark Knight,\" and he's been Personal Makeup Artist to Al Pacino for 30 years. John's most current work with Al Pacino was \"The Irishman\" and \"Hunters\".</p><p>You can find John&nbsp;Caglione, Jr. at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.johncaglionejr.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>: https://www.johncaglionejr.net/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnny_cags/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>: https://www.instagram.com/johnny_cags/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
