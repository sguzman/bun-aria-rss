  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://mariancall.com/\">Marian Call</a> is an Alaskan chanteuse who found an audience after winning a <em>Firefly</em>-related song contest in 2007. She has run her music career as an independent grassroots effort ever since. She connects with her fans constantly and directly, both through social media and crowdfunding, and sleeping on their floors during tours and house concerts. She spends a lot of time on the road, and we talked in person (appropriately enough, in my living room) right after <a href=\"http://www.geekgirlcon.com/\">GeekGirlCon 2013</a> in Seattle in October. She lives on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariancall\">@mariancall</a> and is currently on tour in Europe.</p>",
