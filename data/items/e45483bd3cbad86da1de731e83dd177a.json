  "description": "<p>Tim Beiko runs the core protocol meetings for Ethereum. His path into crypto began in 2017, buying the top. But he stayed in the space, initially working for Consensys and their Besu Ethereum Client before trailblazing with EIP-1559's implementation.</p> <p>This conversation covers his story into working with Ethereum core developers, the role and landscape of Ethereum clients, and coordinating the maintenance and upgrades to the Ethereum protocol.</p> <p>With the merge on the horizon and barbarians at the gates, humans like Tim Beiko work to keep Ethereum as credibly neutral, efficient, and open as possible. Can Vitalik impose his will on Ethereum? Is it centralized?
