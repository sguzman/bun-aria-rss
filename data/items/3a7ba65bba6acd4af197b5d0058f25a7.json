  "description": "A new supergroup featuring Carrie Brownstein (of Sleater-Kinney and NPR's Monitor Mix blog), Janet Weiss (of Sleater-Kinney and Quasi, among others), Mary Timony (of Helium) and Rebecca Cole (of The Minders), WILD FLAG hasn't even released its first single yet. Which means that virtually no one attending NPR Music's SXSW day party at The Parish in Austin, Texas, had heard a note of its rollicking, adventurous pop-rock before walking in the door. Hear the band perform live at NPR Music's SXSW day party from The Parish in Austin, Texas, on March 17, 2011.",
