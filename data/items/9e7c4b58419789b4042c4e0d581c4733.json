  "description": "Our political system has built into it a kind of immune system to protect it from abuse and abusers. But just as how in life, bacteria develop that are resistant to drugs, so too in our system we have seen the emergence of a kind of threat that resists oversight, checks and balances and processes designed to keep us safe from corruption and tyranny. Donald Trump is just such a threat and recent revelations regarding how Trump's team sought to kill an investigation into suspect conversations he had with foreign leaders and further illustrations of Trumpworld's efforts to place the president above the law prove it. We discuss with the Washington Post's Greg Sargent, Amb. Ivo Daalder of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of \"Just Security\" and a professor at NYU Law School. It is an essential conversation. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
