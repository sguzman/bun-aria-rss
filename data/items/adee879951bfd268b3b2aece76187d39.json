  "description": "<p>As a society, we are navigating a strange and uncharted time in human history. While local governments are enforcing shelter in place orders and placing restrictions on outdoor activities, many folks are finding their health declining as a result. Isolation can result in a change in lifestyle and nutritional habits for many people, not to mention the mental and domestic issues that can arise.</p> <p>Today I want to continue the conversation around how collectively, we can proactively move the needle in a positive direction. You’re going to hear some fascinating data regarding the impact of this social and economic shutdown. We’re diving into new studies regarding the effects quarantine has on human diet, exercise, and overall well-being.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Being your best self is not only a culmination of your diet and exercise habits, but it’s also the way you think, act, and treat those around you. This episode contains tips regarding changing your mindset and biases, and the importance of staying active, positive, and kind amidst a crisis. As always, we’re diving into the studies, and I hope something in this episode resonates with you.
