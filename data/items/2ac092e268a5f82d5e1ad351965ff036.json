  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historians won’t record that we prayed with ours kids before school, dropped off meals to neighbors, or hosted Bible study. But God’s greater story uses the everyday work of women to spread the gospel around the world. In this episode, Emily and Laura interview Dr. Michael Kruger about women in the second century church. Michael is the president of Reformed Theological Seminary (Charlotte) and professor of New Testament and Early Christianity; and an author, husband, and father. Church history teaches us that God is faithful to his Church through his people. From the second century to now, God uses ordinary women serving in sacrificial ways to change the world with the gospel of Christ.</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-129-how-ordinary-women-spread-the-gospel-story-an-interview-with-dr-michael-kruger-transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></span></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/how-ordinary-women-spread-the-gospel-story-an-interview-with-dr-michael-kruger\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> <img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/75993/Copy_of_Regular_format-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p>",
