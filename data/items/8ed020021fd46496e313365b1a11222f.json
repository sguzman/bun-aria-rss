And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss an article on the African American History Museum’s website which says that objectivity, politeness, and science are hallmarks of white culture. Sounds pretty white supremacist to me.\n\nBen's new book \"How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps\" is coming out July 21st.
