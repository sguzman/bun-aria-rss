  "title": "David Rapp, “Tinker to Evers to Chance: The Chicago Cubs and the Dream of Modern America” (U Chicago Press, 2018)",
  "description": "Today we are joined by David Rapp, author of the book Tinker to Evers to Chance: The Chicago Cubs and the Dawn of Modern America (University of Chicago Press, 2018). Rapp spent 30 years as a journalist in the Washington. D.C., area and was the former editor of Congressional Quarterly, where he oversaw that publications transition from print to digital publishing. Rapp blows the dust off the legends of the Chicago Cubs’ iconic double play combination of the early 20th century: shortstop Joe Tinker, second baseman Johnny “The Crab” Evers, and first baseman Frank “The Peerless Leader” Chance. They formed the foundation of a National League juggernaut that won four pennants, two World Series and a major-league record for victories in a season. Rapp humanizes all three men, showing how they survived during a rough-and-tumble era of baseball that was undergoing a transition—just like the United States was at the turn of the century. Each man brought a distinctive local culture with him to Chicago: Tinker was an urbanite from Kansas City; Evers hailed from the heavily Irish-American city of Troy, New York; and Chance traveled east from the laid-back Central Valley of California. All three men were intense—Tinker and Evers had several fights and never spoke to one another off the field—but they proved that teammates with a common goal do not have to like one another.\n\n\n\nBob D’Angelo is working on his master’s degree in history at Southern New Hampshire University. He earned his bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Florida and spent more than three decades as a sportswriter and sports copy editor, including 28 years on the sports copy desk at The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune. He can be reached at bdangelo57@gmail.com. For more information, visit Bob DAngelo’s Books and Blogs.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
