  "description": "Delegates are gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the COP27 UN climate change conference beginning on Sunday 6 November. But a lot has changed in the 12 months since attendees of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow promised bold action to tackle global warming. Russia invaded Ukraine sparking global inflation and rising energy prices. Relations between the United States and China have continued to sour. And extreme weather events have caused thousands of deaths across the planet. Last week a UN report concluded there’s no longer any \"credible pathway\" to keeping the rise in global temperatures below the key threshold of 1.5C and that the world will warm by around 2.8C this century if current policies remain in place. So, what’s on the agenda at COP27? Can the conference come up with solutions to the growing number of challenges posed by climate change? And how can we judge whether the meeting will be a success or a failure?\n\nRitula Shah is joined by a panel of expert guests.\n\nMohamed Nasheed - Former President of the Maldives, now an ambassador for the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF).\n\nDr Jessica Omukuti - Research Fellow on net zero emissions, climate finance and climate justice at the University of Oxford.\n\nNick Robins - Professor in Practice for Sustainable Finance at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE).\n\nAlso featuring ...\n\nDr Michael E.
