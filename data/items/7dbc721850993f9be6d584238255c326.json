Are you ready to revolutionize the way you think about money, inflation and the impending recession?<br /><br />Chief Executive Money Nerd at Minority Mindset Companies from Punjab, India, Jaspreet Singh has been putting in the work to spread financial education and opportunity on YouTube for years. The goal of this episode is to get you to understand what money really is and give you the knowledge you need to change how you’re using it in your day to day life.<br /><br />The majority of people will unfortunately continue to become poor and the harsh reality for many is that they won’t even see what’s happening in time if at all. We are dedicated to pulling people out of the matrix and helping them see that human potential is nearly limitless. That includes getting people to see the objective truth about the government's role in the financial system, who the Feds are, and how wealthy, financially educated people think and use money differently from poor, financially uneducated people.<br /><br />Tom openly shares his example of how  you can be a good entrepreneur and bad investor from not asking the right questions. You can start turning the tables and making better decisions to not just prepare for a potential recession, but to also start building real wealth. It’s all mindset, it’s a growth mindset and a minority mindset when you’re willing to learn and understand who your teachers are. <br /><br />Check out Jaspreet’s Newsletter, Market Briefs: <a href=\"https://marketbriefs.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://marketbriefs.com/</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Jaspreet Singh<br />0:35 | Why the Poor Stay Poor<br />17:03 | Thinking Differently About Money<br />30:45 | Save & Invest Money Smarter<br />44:14 | Building Wealth As A Minority<br />57:21 | 5 Places to Invest Money<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“The interesting thing about the Federal Reserve Bank is it’s called the Federal Reserve Bank, however it’s not federal, it says so on their website.
