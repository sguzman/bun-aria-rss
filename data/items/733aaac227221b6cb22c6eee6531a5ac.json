  "title": "S2: MF DOOM, Part 10 - Did I Ever Tell You The One About... MF Grimm",
  "description": "In this season we have learned a great deal about the support system that DOOM had around him. After talking with members of the C.M. Fam it became clearer to us that the person who was a truly important part of DOOM’s story early on did not really get a chance to enjoy that period of time. His name was Grimm Reaper, later known as MF Grimm. Grimm was a significant part of DOOM’s career early on, even sharing the “MF” moniker. Grimm’s story of how DOOM got to where he is and what Grimm experienced during that time is not just a cautionary tale for those who hug the block and try to make music. It is a testament to the love and drive that can push friends beyond what they can see as success for themselves and their families. \n\n\n\nWe felt it was only right to give Grimm his own episode to thank him for the friendship and love he had for DOOM. He was the support system when DOOM needed it, and was a catalyst to creativity that would allow DOOM and Grimm to create the music that people love to this day.
