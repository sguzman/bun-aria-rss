  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of Texas has provoked extreme outrage from the Left by declaring that all so-called “gender affirming medical care” of minors in the state now qualifies and will be prosecuted as child abuse. He’s facing backlash and mutiny over this, but he is obviously completely correct. Also, the latest on the crisis in Ukraine, and the incompetent response from the Biden Administration. Speaking of which, John Kerry has come out to explain that global war is bad, mainly because of all the carbon emissions. Plus, Biden announces his Supreme Court pick. And in our Daily Cancellation, the celebs are chiming in on the Ukraine situation, and their contributions to the conversation have so far been far worse than you can imagine. I’ll play something for you today that is so cringy and embarrassing that it probably needs some kind of surgeon general warning attached to it.\nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
