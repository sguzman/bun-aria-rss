In this episode the team discusses how we live with flu and the measures we’ll need to take to prevent wave upon wave of covid-19 infections and deaths. There’s been a massive <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2304822-volcano-eruption-in-tonga-was-a-once-in-a-millennium-event/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">volcanic eruption in Tonga</a> that’s caused widespread damage, and the team examines the impact it's having on the island nation. There’s more news in the race to build the world’s best quantum computer - the team finds out about a unique way of building these machines <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2305044-first-fully-programmable-quantum-computer-based-on-neutral-atoms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">using neutral atoms</a>.
