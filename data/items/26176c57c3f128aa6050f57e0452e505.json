  "description": "<p>Let $K$ be a number field and $S$ a finite set of places of $K$ containing\nall archimedean places. In this paper, we show that the second moment of the\nnumber of $S$-integral points on elliptic curves over $K$ is bounded. In\nparticular, we prove that, for any positive real number $r\\leq \\log_2 5 =\n2.3219 \\ldots$, the $r$-th moment of the number of $S$-integral points is\nbounded for the family of all integral short Weierstrass curves ordered by\nheight, or for any positive density subfamily thereof. For certain other\nfamilies of elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, such as those with one or two\nmarked points, we prove that the average of the number of integral points is\nbounded; in fact, for the family with one marked point, the $r$-th moment is\nalso bounded for all positive $r\\leq \\log_2 3$.\n</p>\n<p>The essential new ingredient in our proof is an upper bound on the number of\n$S$-integral points on an affine integral Weierstrass model $\\mathcal{E}$ of an\nelliptic curve $E$ over $K$ depending on the rank of the curve, the class group\nand degree of $K$, and the number of primes of $K$ whose square divides the\ndiscriminant of $\\mathcal{E}$. For example, over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the bound for\nintegral points on $\\mathcal{E}$ is $2^{\\mathrm{rank}{E(\\mathbb{Q})}} O(1)^s$,\nwhere $s$ is the number of prime squares dividing the discriminant of\n$\\mathcal{E}$.\n</p>\n<p>The theorems on moments then follow from averaging this new upper bound;\ncrucially, we can bound the average of the $2^{\\mathrm{rank}}$ term by using\nresults on the average sizes of Selmer groups in the families. In order to\nprove the bounds for the $r$-th moment when $r= \\log_2 5$ (and the analogous\nequality cases for the other families), we introduce a method to count orbits\nof coregular representations with possibly unbounded weights.\n</p>",
