Feeling stuck, unhappy in a situation, and having uncertainty and fear around how to navigate through it or remain in it is something nearly everyone can identify with. <br /><br />Knowing how to get yourself out of the situations that make you feel small is challenging. The mindset that keeps you from succeeding in a life you only dream of is something that can be changed, but where do you begin?<br /><br />Lisa Bilyeu, President of Impact Theory, creator and host of Women of Impact is with hubby, Tom Bilyeu, sharing exactly how she took herself from a stay-at-home super supportive wife to ultra-successful serial entrepreneur. In her new book, Radical Confidence, Lisa shares her struggles with life’s plans taking a wrong turn, struggling with confidence, and going after a life that truly mattered to her.<br /><br />For Lisa, being backed against the wall in these do or die circumstances forced her to have the difficult but honest conversations with herself about what she wanted, who she wanted to become, and how she was going to get there. The alternative was not an outcome Lisa was willing to accept. She’s built a heck of a toolkit along the way to becoming courageous and confident as f*ck in her bad b*ch boots. There are major gems here for anyone no matter where you are in your journey.<br /><br />Lisa reminds us to embrace the beauty of you, be compassionate, and be sensitive, but never to the detriment of losing yourself.<br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Lisa Bilyeu<br />1:08 | Fear Just Needs a Plan<br />4:23 | Good Plans Take a Wrong Turn<br />11:15 | Getting Unstuck <br />18:39 | How Lisa Developed Tools of Success<br />25:33 | Courage to Dream Your Own Dream<br />32:02 | Make Your Mission Possible<br />42:28 | Activate Your Bad B*tch Boots<br />49:39 | No Pressure, But Toughen The F*ck Up <br />58:19 | Validate Yourself & Your Own Success<br />1:04:20 | Messages For Lisa Bilyeu<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“You can freaking convince yourself of why you’re doing something every single day, and that’s the problem.” [6:34]<br /><br />“We talk a lot about gratitude, [...] The problem is, it kept me there because I kept using gratitude as a thing to go to every time I felt sad...” [8:27]<br /><br />“The messiness of thinking about the negative voice in my head that’s always mean to me.
