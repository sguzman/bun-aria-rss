  "description": "Pew, pew, pew. If you're familiar with the Pick Six podcast, you know those are the horns for the Brady Quinn Football Show. If you're new here, well, you're in for a treat. On this episode, host Will Brinson and the namesake of Wednesday's show Brady Quinn, link up to get you caught up on the latest news and prepare you for the start of football season. DeAndre Hopkins is the latest in the long line of mega-extensions dished out this summer (10:00). Should there be any concern of Nuk dipping in production in the latter half of this deal? The guys also analyze the extensions awarded to Keenan Allen, Tre'Davious White, Cam Heyward and Kareem Hunt (18:00). Jadeveon Clowney finally has a new home (27:30). Are the Titans the best spot he could have landed? Next, Will and Brady tackle the Week 1 games they are the most excited for. Seeing Cam Newton in New England has to be near the top of the list, but what else intrigues these two from the opening slate of games (35:00)? \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @Brady_Quinn, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
