  "description": "<p>The Darwin Awards! Meatsacks removing themselves from being able to procreate or from the planet entirely in the most easily avoidable ways. Natural selection at work! We make light of a lot of death today, and also use this topic as an excuse to look into evolution theory and the man who put it on the map - Charles Darwin. Is evolution more than just \"a theory\"? Can we prove it worked? Did we really evolve from monkeys? Did a guy in Australia really try to kill a tiger with his bare hands after some karate lessons? Did a guy accidentally kill himself by pounding two bottles of sherry via his \"mouth butt\"?
