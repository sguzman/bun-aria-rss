  "description": "<p>We ended our myxoma virus episode on a bit of a cliffhanger, briefly alluding to the emergence of another deadly rabbit virus on the global scene. In this follow-up bonus episode, we take a closer look at this recent arrival, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), and what its rapid spread around the world has meant for both invasive European rabbits in Australia as well as native rabbit species around the world. Dr. Robyn Hall (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/virologica\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@Virologica</a>), veterinary virologist, epidemiologist, and Team Leader of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/rhdv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rabbit Biocontrol Team</a>&nbsp;at CSIRO in Australia, walks us through how this virus earned the nickname “bunny Ebola”, where it seems to be having the most impact, and what the sudden appearance of a new type of RHDV has taught us about viral evolution and ecological cascades. Then, once we fill up on RHDV facts, we talk favorite viruses, life as a veterinary virologist, and so much more! Tune in wherever you get your podcasts.
