  "title": "Working at the White House: Washington Post's Bureau Chief Juliet Eilperin",
  "description": "This week we took a step back from the administration itself to talk to the Washington Post's White House Bureau Chief, Juliet Eilperin. A former environmental reporter for the Post, Eilperin made the jump to her current beat back in 2013, and she's been covering the Obama administration ever since. She talked to us about everything from the challenges of covering a story in an environment where security is the rule, to the strangeness of having the President mispronounce your name when he calls on you during a press conference. We also chatted with her about what she tries to capture in her articles and about some of the stories she's proudest of.  \nIn a Slate Plus Extra, Eilperin, who wrote an entire book about sharks, tells us some of her favorite details of those ancient predators of the deep.
