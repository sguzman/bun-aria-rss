  "description": "If you've ever wondered about giving that strange old man a piggy-back ride in the woods, the philosophical nuances of way too much grave robbing, or how many people are necessary to take down a four-story-tall baby bird, well, then this is the episode for you. Sinbad finishes up his epic tale of epicness and we see what led to him falling back on his plan \"B\" of living a life of leisure on his near-infinite wealth. The creature this time is the reason you should take a giant bat with you everywhere you go. Sponsors: Casper Mattresses. They are really comfortable mattresses that you will miss when you are away from home and want to letters to telling them such but that would be for naught because mattresses don't possess thumbs or sentience. If you want to give this whole \"amazingly comfortable mattress\" thing a try, you can for 100 days risk free at home. Check out casper.com/legends (code LEGENDS) to get $50 off a mattress purchase. Dollar Shave Club. You can get razors for only a few dollars a month. They are super-smooth, close shaves and you don't even need to leave your house to get them. Well, the razors, that is. You generally don't leave your house to shave. Unless you're stately, plump Buck Mulligan shaving on the roof. Don't be Buck Mulligan, though. That guy was a jerk. If you're interested in really great razors and not hassling tortured artists, check out dollarshaveclub.com/myths. You can get a $15 value for only $5.
