And though we still have a lot to learn about the novel coronavirus, there are also a lot of ways we can keep ourselves, our families, and our communities strong and healthy.</p><br><p>I recently hosted a webinar, along with the doctors at <a href=\"https://ultrawellnesscenter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The UltraWellness Center</a>, to answer some of the most important questions about COVID-19.&nbsp;If you missed it, I am sharing it here as a special episode of my podcast, <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA.
