Bianca also challenges Carly to name her nemeses. We all talk and disagree A LOT about <em>Mare of Easttown</em>, and we take more of your questions. After which, Bianca chats with Hannah Mary McKinnon, bestselling author of <em>You Will Remember Me</em>, about plotting, outlining and structuring your novel; skeleton drafts; the 16 beat structure; layering your novel during edits; and choosing POV. </p><p><br/></p>",
