Justin is an actor, writer, artist, and performer, known most notably for his shirtless airplane flights and pre-made smoothie recipes. He’s also written lil’ things like Tropic Thunder and Iron Man 2, and is starring in The Mosquito Coast. But sometimes we just love him for how he stirs the gravy.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
