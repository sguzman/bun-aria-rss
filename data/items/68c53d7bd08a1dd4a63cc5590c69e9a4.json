  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to obedience, we’re all prone to errors. Maybe we say “freedom in Christ!” to justify our actions instead of doing what we know is right, or maybe we live with a constant stream of condemning thoughts instead of resting in the righteousness of Christ. Some of us put off obedience until tomorrow, and some of us are locked in a cycle of despair when we can’t obey perfectly today. In this episode, Laura and Emily talk through the common ditches we find ourselves in as moms, and give practical strategies for getting out of them. So whether you’re procrastinating and trying to avoid the sink full of dishes or you’re grumpy and muscling through to “get the job done,” we hope you’ll find encouragement to walk the true path of obedience. </span> <p>____</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re so thankful for</span> <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten Words to Live By</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Jen Wilkin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this mini-series possible!</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">This book is a fresh, biblical look at the Ten Commandments and how they impact our lives today.
