  "description": "I'm so excited about today's guest. Self Esteem has been providing me with my preferred soundtrack for life, the universe and just about everything since the release of her BRILLIANT second album, Prioritise Pleasure, last year. I'm not the only one who's obsessed - it was the Guardian's album of the year and earned her a Brit Award nomination. If you haven't yet listened to her soaringly beautiful anthem, I Do This All The Time, then do that right after you've heard this. Promise? Ok, then.<br /><br />Rebecca Lucy Taylor, was born and raised in Rotherham,  before becoming one half of indie folk duo Slow Club. When the band broke up, Taylor reinvented herself as a solo artist. Her name? Self Esteem. She joins me to talk about her failure to get into drama school, her failure to 'make it' in music, and her failure at 'happy ever after' in relationships. We also discuss body image, toxic partners and what success really means. It's a goodie. Enjoy.<br /><br />---<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted by Elizabeth Day, produced by Naomi Mantin and Chris Sharp.
