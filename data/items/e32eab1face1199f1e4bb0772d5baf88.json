  "description": "On a trajectory to be one of the biggest pop stars for this generation, seventeen year old Billie Eilish is not, however, your typical pop star. Her music speaks to the real anxieties of young people without any veneer. She sings from the perspective of monsters and villains. Her hushed voice, baggy style, and direct demeanor subvert the norms of the pop princess. And her music is dark, but still catchy. Billie co-writes and produces her sound with her older brother Finneas O’Connell. Together this family duo have crafted the second biggest selling album of 2019, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” On this episode, we examine how Billie and Finneas crafted a cultural phenomenon, why their message speaks to this generation, and we speak with Finneas about the creation of their hit song “Bad Guy.”\n\nMORE\n\nWatch Billie and Finneas break down “Bury A Friend” on The New York TimesBillie Eilish – Ocean Eyes\n\nBillie Eilish – Bored\n\nBillie Eilish – You Should See Me In A Crown\n\nBillie Eilish – Bad Guy\n\nBillie Eilish – Bury A Friend\n\nMarilyn Manson – The Beautiful People\n\nThe Doors – People Are Strange\n\nNine Inch Nails – Closer\n\nBillie Eilish – ilomilo\n\nBillie Eilish – All Good Girls Go To Hell\n\nBillie Eilish – Xanny\n\nFrank Sinatra – Dream A Dream\n\nBillie Eilish – I love you\n\nJohn Carpenter – Halloween Theme\n\nBillie Eilish – Bellyache\n\n\nMORE\nBillie Eilish explained on Vox.com\nWatch Billie and Finneas break down “Bury A Friend” on The New York Times\nLearn more about your ad choices.
