  "description": "<p>At the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay sits the home of the United State Naval Academy, the city of Annapolis, which claims to have more original structures dating back to the 18th century than any other city in America. One of those structures is The Brice House. A house that exudes a malevolent energy that might be carrying over from the corrupt family that once inhabited the residence. Tales of skeletons in walls and other legends have lead to claims that the mansion is haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Brice House. Moment in Oddity features the Ozark Spooklight and This Day in History features the Battle of Ezra Church by Richard Schaffer. This location was suggested by listener Amanda Prouty who also joins us to share her thoughts and stories.
