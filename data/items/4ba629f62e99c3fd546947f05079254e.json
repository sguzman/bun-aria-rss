We’ll dig into the deep, human relationship to the underground, and why we understand it from an instinctive point of view — but not so much from a physical one. (Hint: we’re afraid of the dark.) National Geographic photographer, Tamara Merino, will take us subterranean in Utah, Australia, and Spain where modern-day cave dwellers teach us how to escape the heat.  \n\nFor more information on this episode, visit natgeo.com/overheard \n\nWant more?\nGo belowground with National Geographic Explorer Tamara Merino to see how these communities have been living—quite comfortably—for a very long time. \n\nIn Vietnam photojournalist and National Geographic Explorer Martin Edström created 360 images of the world’s largest cave, Son Doong. It’s so big that a forest grows inside of it.\n\nEver zip-line to a remote island? Cartographers did, 30 miles west of San Francisco. What did they see when they mapped the hard-to-reach landform known as the Farallon Islands? Caves.\n\nChina is home to some of the most intricate cave systems on the planet.
