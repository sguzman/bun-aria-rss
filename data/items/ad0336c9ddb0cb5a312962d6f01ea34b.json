  "description": "<p>We introduce the class of vector-spread monomial ideals. This notion\ngeneralizes that of $t$-spread ideals introduced by Ene, Herzog and Qureshi. In\nparticular, we focus on vector-spread strongly stable ideals, we compute their\nKoszul cycles and describe their minimal free resolution. As a consequence the\ngraded Betti numbers and the Poincar\\'e series are determined. Finally, we\nconsider a generalization of algebraic shifting theory for such a class of\nideals.\n</p>",
