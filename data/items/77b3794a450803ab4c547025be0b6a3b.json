  "title": "PMS 2.0 168 - No CoronaVirus Yet. General Manager Of The Los Angeles Chargers, Tom Telesco, Stops By... AND LEGEND, NICK MANGOLD Joins Us. Let's Go.",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat sits down with Los Angeles Charges General Manager, Tom Telesco. Tom tells Pat the story of how he watched Pat at his bowl game Senior year and went back and told Bill Polian that he thought he had just found the Colts new punter. Tom also explains what it’s like being a General Manager during combine week, including all the things the Chargers are looking for, what the process is like, and whether he’s a best available, or biggest need guy. Pat also grills Tom about Tom Brady potentially landing in Los Angeles with the Chargers and if they’re in the market for a veteran Quarterback after the departure of Phillip Rivers. It’s a great interview into the mind of one of the 32 decision makers during the NFL Combine (2:58-21:46). Also joining the show is 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets and friend of the show, Nick Mangold. Nick and Pat discuss the new reports coming out about the CBA and Nick gives his stance on where he stands, and what he thinks certain players are rejecting, why the process took so long the other night, and what things may be holding it up from being passed. Nick and Pat also chat about his love for barbecue, and getting into the barbecue sauce game (39:04-55:06). Pat and Digs also discuss Pat winning the Heisman Trophy of radio, dive a little bit deeper into the CBA negotiations as certain things are now starting to be reported and some big name players still have massive issues with the deal, and they do a deep dive into Zion Williamson and LeBron’s first matchup, and why it is impossible not to be impressed with what Zion has done in his first handful of games in the NBA and why LeBron is still so tough. Don’t forget to use the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for your chance to win some free march. Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
