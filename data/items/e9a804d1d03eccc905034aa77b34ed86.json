  "description": "<p>Austin Channing Brown is a writer, speaker and media producer providing inspired leadership on racial justice. She is the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X8qyEc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>I’m Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness</em></a> (https://amzn.to/2X8qyEc) and the Executive Producer of <a href=\"https://www.tnqshow.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Next Question</a>: A Web Series Imagining How Expansive Racial Justice Can Be (https://www.tnqshow.com/).&nbsp;Austin started her career in the nonprofit world, focusing on homelessness and housing, youth engagement, and church operations before blazing her own path in speaking, consulting, media and writing. As a leader, educator, and producer, Channing Brown creates programming that centers the experiences of Black women, dismantling the foundations of white supremacy, while interweaving a way forward for all who will listen. Her nationally-celebrated first season of The Next Question included a slate of incredible contributors. Alongside her co- creators, Chi Chi Okwu and Jenny Booth Potter, the hosts examine complex topics affecting social justice while simultaneously celebrating the stories, personalities, and humanity of their guests.</p><p>An added note before we dive into this powerful conversation. Our podcast episodes are often recorded weeks or months in advance, as was the case with this conversation. In the intervening time, we’ve all been horrified and devastated by the deaths of Ahmuad Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Because of the gap between recording and air-dates, they are conspicuously absent from our conversation in a way that, I’m sure, would have different and been a part of the discourse had this conversation occurred at a later date. As I’ve shared elsewhere, silence and complacency are not options. Everything we explore in this conversation is as important and relevant as it’s ever been.
