  "description": "<p>Rita Soledad Fernandez Paulino and Beatriz Acevedo on how they work to inspire others in the Latinx community to improve their financial literacy. On this episode, we’re tackling the wealth gap from the perspective of two Latina founders who are flipping the script around finance in their communities. We hear from Rita Soledad Fernandez Paulino, the financial literacy influencer behind Wealth Para Todos, an online community that was born of Soledad’s own journey to become debt free. Then, host Carla Harris sits down with media entrepreneur Beatriz Acevedo, a former television host who found her voice in advocating for financial literacy in diverse communities after her own money troubles. She now leads SUMA Wealth, an online platform she co-founded to create financial education content that speaks to Latinx youth.
