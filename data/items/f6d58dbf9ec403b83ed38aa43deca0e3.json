Phil has noticed that love for your fellow man has fallen far from what it once was in the past, even among some of the churches in America. Jase explains why he refuses to be paid for doing ministry work, and Al reflects on a time when he was a paid preacher himself and the effects it had on his life. Al tells about when Phil stepped in on his behalf during a difficult time, and Jase advises people to plant your seeds wherever there is an ear to listen, rather than traveling far and wide to do God's work.\n\nWatch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed\n\nGet Uncanceled by Phil Robertson, available now: https://www.amazon.com/Uncanceled-Finding-Meaning-Accusations-Condemnation/dp/1400230179\n\nVisit https://Keeps.com/Door and get 50% off your first order of hair loss treatment\n\nVisit https://40DaysForLifeGear.com to get 20% off all books & gear with code: DUCK\n\nVisit https://OmegaXL.com/PHIL and buy one bottle and get a second bottle free\nLearn more about your ad choices.
