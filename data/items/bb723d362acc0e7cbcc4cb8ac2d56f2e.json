  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we are told that the shutdowns are worth it because they are allegedly saving lives. In fact, we are told that even if “just one life is saved” that would be enough to justify the destruction of the economy. Well on that note, I know of one type of business we could shut down and save a million lives a year. Also, Five Headlines, including the governor of New Jersey admitting that he “didn’t think about the Bill of Rights” when crafting his stay at home order. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll examine the idea that only white people can be racist. Events in China would seem to contradict that claim.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
