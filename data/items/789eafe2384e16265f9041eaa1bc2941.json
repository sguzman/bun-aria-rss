  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the same media that once referred to COVID19 as the Wuhan Coronavirus are now saying it’s racist to call it a Chinese virus. It was China’s communist party that misreported the spread of the virus in their country. The Chinese regime is hiding their mishandling of the virus, and is falsely hinting that the U.S planted the virus in China as a biological weapon. Meanwhile, buffoons like Joe Biden support these lies from the campaign trail. Then, sportscaster Stephen A. Smith calls in to discuss the postponement of professional sports across the country due to Coronavirus fears. Later, Dr. Marc Siegel, author of False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear, calls in and insists that a more measured approach would benefit the country as opposed to the peddling of hysteria that we’re currently seeing. Finally, Sen Tom Cotton joins the program and explains that China’s choice for president is Joe Biden.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
