  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, a new poll shows the majority of Democrats do not believe that America is the greatest country, while 69% of Republicans did say that America is the greatest country. Democrats in the survey also favored socialism over capitalism. Then, Reagan Biographer Craig Shirley calls in to discuss faulty polling and similarities between Ronald Reagan's landslide victory and current polls. Shirley also noted the weakness of Washington's Republican leadership imploring them to go on permanent offense in order to win. Later, rhetoric can affect people. Political debates that become murders are ignored by Democrats who turn a blind eye to violence. When conservatives are the ones being hunted down and killed, the media is silent, and no one criticizes Biden, Liz Cheney, or any other Democrat. Afterward, discrimination against Jewish students at a Jewish University continues and Justices Sotomayor and Alito face off in the dissent. Even progressive Democrat New York City Councilman Ritchie Torres sees the rise in antisemitic hate crimes and New York City's failure to protect Jews against such hate crimes and called for the DOJ to help. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
