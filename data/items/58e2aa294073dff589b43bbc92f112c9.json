  "title": "121 - The DB Cooper Hijack Mystery",
  "description": "<p>November 24th, 1971. The day before Thanksgiving. Dan Cooper, also known as DB Cooper, shows up at the Portland, Oregon airport looking like your average business traveler. Over the next few hours, he pulled off the most mysterious airplane hijacking in US aviation history. He took $200,000 in ransom money from the FBI, jumped out of a plane and disappeared into the thick forests of the Pacific Northwest. He was never found, caught, or even positively identified. We explore this mystery and look into the epidemic of air piracy that plagued the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s, today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the <strong>The Great Courses Plus! </strong> Start your free trial now only at <a href=\"http://TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>Click HERE!</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on Youtube: </strong>https://youtu.be/l1LgmqmTaXM</p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
