  "description": "<p><p>The mysterious sounds of early morning worship coming from our studio neighbors has not lessened Kirk Minihane's desire for war. His new target: The Maine Red Claws. The affiliate of the Boston Celtics has been playing coy on social media and entertaining the possibility of honoring him at half time of a basketball game. But once Minihane learns that the Celtics will have veto power over the ceremony, things go down hill. Minihane explains the origins of his blood feud with the Celtics (0:19:00). The KMS interns responded to yesterday's demand that they do their own YouTube show; the results were spectacular (0:36:30). Steve Robinson did a deep dive into the seemingly inexplicable hatred Dave Portnoy has for Blind Mike and discovered, perhaps, an media moment that might explain everything (1:18:20). Barstool's Chief had a run in with a \"free lance writer\" at a pot dispensary who later refused to come on the show and blocked everyone (1:37:30). The crew makes their predictions for how the Patriots fare this weekend (1:45:00). Robinson provides an update on planning for the Kirk Minihane Show Ice Fishing Expedition.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
