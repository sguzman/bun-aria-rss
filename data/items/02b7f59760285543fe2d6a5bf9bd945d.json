  "description": "This episode is the first in a mini-series that Scott is doing with fellow history podcaster Stephen Guerra (History of the Papacy, Beyond the Big Screen) about some of the most historically inaccurate movies that have ever appear. We kick off this series with Ridley Scott's 2005 Crusader epic Kingdom of Heaven. Scott really did not like this movie. He considers it the worst example of screenwriter wish fulfillment to go back in time and teach horribly intolerant historical figures how to live by 21st-century values, even though they make  no sense in context. The movie is so anachronistic that Orlando Bloom's knight character might as well wear a \"Coexist\" T-shirt during the entire film. <br /><br />(originally broadcasted on Beyond the Big Screen)",
