The <code>cv_results_</code> attribute, on the other hand, is a dictionary of 1D arrays, in which each array represents a single metric (such as <code>mean_test_score</code>) across all sets of parameters. The structure was changed so that the results can easily be converted into a pandas DataFrame, which is especially useful since <code>cv_results_</code> provides significantly more information about the search results than <code>grid_scores_</code> did.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> You should convert <code>cv_results_</code> to a DataFrame (as shown below) before exploring the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># view the mean and standard deviation of the test scores for each set of parameters\ngrid.grid_scores_\n\n# examine the results of the first set of parameters\ngrid.grid_scores_[0].parameters\ngrid.grid_scores_[0].mean_validation_score\n\n# list all of the mean test scores\n[result.mean_validation_score for result in grid.grid_scores_]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># convert the search results into a pandas DataFrame\nimport pandas as pd\nresults = pd.DataFrame(grid.cv_results_)\n\n# view the mean and standard deviation of the test scores for each set of parameters\nresults[['mean_test_score', 'std_test_score', 'params']]\n\n# examine the results of the first set of parameters\nresults['params'][0]\nresults['mean_test_score'][0]\n\n# list all of the mean test scores\nresults['mean_test_score']\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>best_estimator_</code>, <code>best_score_</code>, and <code>best_params_</code> attributes are still available and did not change.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new.html#model-selection-enhancements-and-api-changes\">Model Selection Enhancements and API Changes</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related notebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/08_grid_search.ipynb\">Efficiently searching for optimal tuning parameters</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"gridsearchandrandomizedsearchcanreturntrainingscores\">Grid search and randomized search can return training scores</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in scikit-learn 0.18, grid search and randomized search can optionally calculate the training scores for each cross-validation split by setting <code>return_train_score=True</code>. Starting in scikit-learn 0.19.1, the default value of <code>return_train_score</code> was changed from <code>True</code> to <code>'warn'</code> to alert users that calculating training scores may slow down the search significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Calculating the training scores is not required in order to select the best set of parameters, and is only useful for gaining insights on how different parameter settings affect the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> You should explicitly set <code>return_train_score=False</code> unless you specifically need to calculate the training scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">grid = GridSearchCV(knn, param_grid, cv=10, scoring='accuracy')\nrand = RandomizedSearchCV(knn, param_dist, cv=10, scoring='accuracy', n_iter=20)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">grid = GridSearchCV(knn, param_grid, cv=10, scoring='accuracy', return_train_score=False)\nrand = RandomizedSearchCV(knn, param_dist, cv=10, scoring='accuracy', n_iter=20, return_train_score=False)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new.html#version-0-19-1\">scikit-learn 0.19.1 release notes</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related notebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/08_grid_search.ipynb\">Efficiently searching for optimal tuning parameters</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"scoringparametersforlossfunctionshavebeenrenamed\">Scoring parameters for loss functions have been renamed</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in scikit-learn 0.18, the names of scoring parameters for which \"lower is better\" are now prefixed by <code>'neg_'</code>, such as <code>'neg_mean_squared_error'</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Some model evaluation metrics (known as \"reward functions\") have the property that higher values are better than lower values, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Other metrics (known as \"loss functions\") have the property that lower values are better, such as log loss, mean absolute error, and mean squared error. Because optimization tools such as <code>GridSearchCV</code> are built to maximize the evaluation metric (meaning they always treat higher values as better than lower values), scikit-learn automatically negates the scores any time a loss function is selected as the scoring parameter. The negation of scores still takes places in scikit-learn 0.18 (and beyond), but the affected scoring parameters have been renamed in order to reduce confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> Any time you are using a loss function as a scoring parameter, you need to add the <code>'neg_'</code> prefix to the parameter name. Currently, this includes: <code>'neg_log_loss'</code>, <code>'neg_mean_absolute_error'</code>, <code>'neg_mean_squared_error'</code>, <code>'neg_mean_squared_log_error'</code>, and <code>'neg_median_absolute_error'</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">cross_val_score(linreg, X, y, cv=10, scoring='mean_squared_error')\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">cross_val_score(linreg, X, y, cv=10, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This change only affects classes with a <code>scoring</code> parameter, such as <code>cross_val_score</code> and <code>GridSearchCV</code>. The functions in the <code>metrics</code> module, such as <code>metrics.mean_squared_error</code>, have not been renamed because they continue to output positive scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#the-scoring-parameter-defining-model-evaluation-rules\">The <code>scoring</code> parameter: defining model evaluation rules</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related notebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/07_cross_validation.ipynb\">Cross-validation for parameter tuning, model selection, and feature selection</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"only2ddataarrayscanbepassedtomodels\">Only 2D data arrays can be passed to models</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in scikit-learn 0.17, only 2D data arrays can be passed to models as input. 1D data arrays are no longer accepted.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When you pass input data to a model (to fit or predict, for example), the data must now be explicitly shaped <code>(n_samples, n_features)</code>. In other words, each row of the array should represent a sample, and each column should represent a feature. Previous to scikit-learn 0.17, you could pass a 1D data array to a model, and it would infer how that array should be interpreted. That is no longer allowed because it can cause confusion about whether the array elements should be interpreted as samples or features.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> If you try to pass a list such as <code>[3, 5, 4, 2]</code> to a model, it will be interpreted as a 1D array of shape <code>(4,)</code> and won't be accepted. If you meant for it to be interpreted as 1 sample with 4 features, then its shape needs to be changed to <code>(1, 4)</code>. (Three options are shown below for how to accomplish this.) If you meant for it to be interpreted as 4 samples with 1 feature, then its shape needs to be changed to <code>(4, 1)</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">knn.predict([3, 5, 4, 2])\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># option 1: pass the data as a nested list, which will be interpreted as having shape (1, 4)\nknn.predict([[3, 5, 4, 2]])\n\n# option 2: explicitly change the shape to be (1, 4)\nimport numpy as np\nknn.predict(np.reshape([3, 5, 4, 2], (1, 4)))\n\n# option 3: explicitly change the first dimension to be 1, let NumPy infer that the second dimension should be 4\nknn.predict(np.reshape([3, 5, 4, 2], (1, -1)))\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Related notebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/04_model_training.ipynb\">Training a machine learning model with scikit-learn</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"part2pythonchanges\">Part 2: Python changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"printisnolongerastatement\">Print is no longer a statement</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in Python 3, <code>print</code> is a function rather than a statement.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> You need to convert your <code>print</code> statements to functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print X.shape\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(X.shape)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html\">What's New In Python 3.0</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"manypython3functionsoutputiteratorsinsteadoflists\">Many Python 3 functions output iterators instead of lists</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in Python 3, the <code>range</code> and <code>zip</code> functions (among others) return iterators instead of lists.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> If you need to output a list, you can explicitly convert the output of <code>range</code> and <code>zip</code> using the <code>list</code> function.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">k_range = range(1, 26)\nprint(zip(feature_cols, linreg.coef_))\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">k_range = list(range(1, 26))\nprint(list(zip(feature_cols, linreg.coef_)))\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"http://treyhunner.com/2018/02/python-3-s-range-better-than-python-2-s-xrange/\">Python 3's range is more powerful than Python 2's xrange</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"part3otherchanges\">Part 3: Other changes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"ipythonnotebookisnowcalledjupyternotebook\">IPython Notebook is now called Jupyter Notebook</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> Starting in late 2015, the official name of the \"IPython Notebook\" was changed to \"Jupyter Notebook\".</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Originally, IPython was an interactive Python shell, and the IPython Notebook was a browser-based interactive environment that used IPython as its \"kernel\" (execution environment). Over time, the IPython Notebook gained support for other kernels (such as Julia and R) and thus became language agnostic. The name was changed from \"IPython Notebook\" to \"Jupyter Notebook\" to avoid implying that it only supported the Python programming language, though IPython is still the default kernel for the Notebook.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> Assuming you have the Jupyter Notebook installed, you should type <code>jupyter notebook</code> at the command line (instead of <code>ipython notebook</code>) to open the Notebook dashboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7\">The Big Split</a></p>\n<p><strong>Related notebook:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/02_machine_learning_setup.ipynb\">Setting up Python for machine learning: scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebook</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"externaldatasetshavebeenmovedtothegithubrepository\">External datasets have been moved to the GitHub repository</h2>\n<p><strong>What changed:</strong> The code from the video series relied on two external datasets, which have now been moved to the GitHub repository.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In the video series, I used two external datasets as examples, and read the files into pandas via URL. One of those files has since been taken offline, and the other file has since been modified, which broke my code. To protect against these problems occurring again, I located the original files, moved them to the GitHub repository, and now refer to them in the code using relative paths.</p>\n<p><strong>How to update your code:</strong> When reading in the files, refer to them using relative paths (as shown below).
