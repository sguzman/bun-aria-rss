  "description": "<p>A North Carolina mother accused of killing her then 4-year-old daughter, forced the toddler’s teen sister to help her bury the girl after she died, according to police reports. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County police found the body of Majelic Young in May, but the little girl died months earlier. Majelic’s mother, 31-year-0ld Malikah Dianne Bennett, has been charged with first-degree murder, child abuse, inflicting physical injury, and concealing a death. </p><p>According to a warrant filed in the case, Majelic’s 13-year-old sister told investigators that the toddler was forced to stand in the laundry room as punishment in August 2020. The girl was not allowed to sit or leave the room for three days — until she was so weak she fell out the back door and her head slammed onto the ground. The sister said Majelic’s breathing was erratic after that, and she died on that day.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Lucille Puckett - Civil Rights Activist, NAACP Charlotte Member, Spoke with Victim's Father,</li>\n<li>Wendy Patrick - California prosecutor, Author: “Red Flags” www.wendypatrickphd.com 'Today with Dr. Wendy' on KCBQ in San Diego</li>\n<li>Dr. Jorey Krawczyn - Police Psychologist, Adjunct Faculty with Saint Leo University; Research Consultant with Blue Wall Institute, Author: Operation S.O.S. - Practical Recommendations to Help “Stop Officer Suicide” (July 2021) bw-institute.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Michelle Dupre - Forensic Pathologist and former Medical Examiner, Author: “Homicide Investigation Field Guide” & \"Investigating Child Abuse Field Guide\", Former Police Detective Lexington County Sheriff’s Department</li>\n<li>Karen L.
