  "description": "\"I Feel it Coming\" might be the slowest burning jam to hit the charts in ages, in which the Weeknd enlists the robotic hum of Daft Punk to help craft a perfectly calibrated climate of desire. Brilliant, sexy songs don't just appear out of thin air, though, so we reveal how this song's perpetual excitement is hard-won through references to past stars of sultriness like Michael and Marvin while employing its own bag of tricks to turn up the heat. \nFeaturing:\n•The Weeknd + Daft Punk - I Feel it Coming\n•Marvin Gaye - Let's Get it On\n•Michael Jackson - Rock With You\n•Chic - Good Times\n•Ike and Tina Turner - Doin' It\nFor an excellent playlist of listener-submitted sexy songs, direct your dirty self here:\nhttp://spoti.fi/2ieEeul\nLearn more about your ad choices.
