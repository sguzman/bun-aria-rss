  "description": "<p>Skidmore Owings and Merrill, which sounds like a law firm your uncle Mitch might work at, created international airports, stunningly tall skyscrapers, universities, flagship museums, and landmark corporate headquarters since the 1930’s. In its heyday it was the Amazon of design firms, one of the largest in the world, with projects such as the 1973 Sears/Willis Tower in Chicago, the 2010 Burj Khalifa in Dubai, international airport terminals in Chicago and Kansas City, Lever House, the 2013 World Trade Center, the new Penn Station, the Waldorf Astoria restoration, the first net-zero-energy school in New York City, and even the design of Moon Village, a concept for the first permanent lunar settlement. It's a global architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm, founded in Chicago by architects <strong>Louis Skidmore</strong> and <strong>Nathaniel Owings</strong> and engineer <strong>John O. Merrill</strong>.  </p> <p>Today we talk about SOM with <strong>Nick Adams</strong>, author of Gordon Bunshaft and SOM: Building Corporate Modernism and architect, preservationist, and design writer <strong>Kate Reggev</strong>.  Later on, George and Tom welcome returning special musical guest, jazz singer <strong>Valerie Wood. </strong></p>",
