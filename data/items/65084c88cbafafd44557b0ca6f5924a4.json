It's a tutorial on the underappreciated Brazilian Cerrado. It's a look at the hows and whys behind his new company, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/barukasrrp\" target=\"_blank\">Barùkas.</a> And it's an advanced placement course on the importance of breath, brain states and finding life purpose.</p><p>An inspiration to me personally, Darin is a guy who walks his talk.
