  "description": "In the late summer of 2006, numerous calls came in to the fire department regarding a house in the beautiful mountains of Pinyon Pines, California that was engulfed in flames. After the fire was put out, multiple bodies from a beloved family in the community were found inside- and the manner of death was homicide. After years of suspicion, speculation, and a need for answers, an arrest was finally made. But did police get it right? This is the story of the Pinyon Pines Murders, and the deaths of Jon Hayward and Vickie and Becky Friedli. *BONUS EPISODES* patreon.com/goingwestpodcast *CASE SOURCES* https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/pinyon-pines-triple-murder-timeline-haunting-photos/27/ https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2014/03/13/family-friends-men-in-pinyon-pines-case-wrongly-accused/6360779/ https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21577365/rebecca-annaleigh-friedli https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/90211731/jon-m.-hayward https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21577328/vicki-lee-friedli https://www.cbsnews.com/news/48-hours-triple-murder-in-pinyon-pines/ https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/93r88m/pinyon_pines_murders_did_the_jury_get_it_right/ https://www.cbsnews.com/news/48-hours-triple-murder-in-pinyon-pines/ http://www.pinyonpinesmurders.com/wp/ https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2018/08/10/pinyon-pines-murder-trial-ended-and-two-men-sentenced-today/918497002/ Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
