    "media:description": "Compared to a game like Super Smash Bros Melee, Multiversus is the new kid on the block. But in a genre where character archetypes tend to homogenise, Multiversus manages to stand apart.\n\nAre platform fighters all the same?\n\nFor over 20 years, the platform fighter genre has been dominated by a single game: Super Smash Bros. The Nintendo IP, the love and care that has gone into each game, and the fact that Smash literally pioneered the genre has made it difficult for any other platform fighters to compete with the perennial giant. Despite countless games made by AAA and indie developers alike, Smash has explored so designs and mechanics and character archetypes that it is truly difficult for anyone to break new ground. Many have tried, but most just end up feeling like Smash clones.\n\nMultiversus is the exception.\n\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://patreon.com/akshonesports\nSubscribe to our channel! https://goo.gl/OvCljl\n\nJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/ZHeCNJQUpY\n\nBecome a Member to support us: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dI8msF1_I9HuDSvMtk_nQ/join\n\nFollow us to stay up to date with our releases! \n\nWebsite: https://www.akshonmedia.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/akshonesports/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/akshonesports/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/akshonesports\n\n#multiversus #gaming #fightinggames",
