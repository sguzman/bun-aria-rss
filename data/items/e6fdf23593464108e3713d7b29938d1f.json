  "description": "In this episode we’re gonna be talking about outdoor living spaces. Some people have decks, some have really nice patios and it doesn’t necessarily mean you have to have a pool, but it’s just a really nice gathering spot. We’re going to focus a lot on the firepit because this can just provide such a great place where everyone can be together next to the warm cosy fire, under the night sky and get into deeper conversations, building lasting memories. We discuss putting the fireplace next to your pool and creating a nice spot outside of shade for those times when you want to be outside watching the kids, but not in the hot sun. <br /><br />A project we worked on 3:52<br />Different firepits and s’mores 7:28<br />Shading 11:23<br />A fun place to have the fireplace 13:44<br />Dealing with bees 20:36<br />Altitude and quality metals 24:53<br /><br />“Last Summer was quarantine, right? And so we were like, ‘We have to get out of the house. We have to have some sort of outside experience.’ and so that’s what we did. We bought a firepit, it was a propane one, dug the–you know what I mean? We made it look as best as we could and it was awesome, and we loved it. So we were like, ‘ever Summer this is what we’re doing. Covid, no Covid. Firepit.’” 2:04<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
