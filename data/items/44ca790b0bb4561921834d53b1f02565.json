  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio presents Astrotheology and the Bible with Micah Dank! </p>\n\n<p>We all have had lessons in the Bible, can recite passages from the Bible, and take things from the Bible in the literal sense.  But Author/Researcher Micah T. Dank joins the show to tell us that we shouldn't take the bible literally, that there are hidden codes there, and he walks us through them in today's program! </p>\n\n<p>Get Micah's Books here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qfH2bB\">https://amzn.to/3qfH2bB</a></p>\n",
