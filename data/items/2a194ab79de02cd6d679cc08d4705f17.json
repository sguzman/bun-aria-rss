  "description": "<p>In episode 20 Fernando Hernandez detailed how he went from having nothing to owning 200 housing units and 24 land lots in Paterson, NJ. He’s currently on DJ Envy and @flipping_nj national real estate tour and his portfolio is valued at $25 million. Fernando started with no money, no connections and no knowledge, and in less than 7 years he’s been able to amass a real estate empire. He broke down his untraditional way of real estate investing, he explained his investment strategy (which is very similar to Monopoly, but he’s playing with real cash) and gave the details of his playbook to us for free.
