  "description": "<p>In this paper, we study a discrete-time dynamical system generated by the\nevolution operator of a wild mosquito population with specific rates of birth\nand emergence from larvae to adults. The death rates of larvae and adults are\nassumed to be constant. We find fixed points and under some conditions, on\nparameters, we show the global attractiveness of a fixed point.\n</p>",
