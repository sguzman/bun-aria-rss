  "description": "Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 is the sound of spongy pop music hitting a brick wall. Playfully weird and fuzzy, this group of pop deviants has annoyed and delighted since 1986. Even though the band hasn't released any new music in ten years, Thinking Fellers fit right in at Asbury Lanes (yes, a bowling alley) on opening day of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, inciting the weekend's rowdiest crowd. Recorded on Friday, September 30, 2011.",
