  "description": "<p>Franklin, Tennessee is a warm small town that just oozes history. The Civil War's Battle of Franklin took place in this town in 1864. This was one of the Confederate Army's worst battles. In fact, the assault has been dubbed \"The Pickett's Charge of the West.\" The Carter House, the Lotz House and Carnton Mansion sit where the battle took place. As is the case with so many battlefields around the world, this one is reputed to be haunted as are the nearby homes. Join us as we explore this fascinating town, the horrific battle and the history and hauntings of the Franklin Battlefield. Moment in Oddity features Portugal's Stone House as suggested by Jorge Almeyda and This Day in History features US acquisition of the Panama Canal researched by Jessica Bell. This location was suggested by listener Thomas Cartwright.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-107-franklin-battlefield.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/02/hgb-podcast-ep-107-franklin-battlefield.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and help us bring you more shows: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
