  "description": "<p>Today we’re talking about something that every leader has experienced, is currently experiencing, and will experience throughout their life. We’re talking about <em>resistance</em>. One fundamental law of physics says that movement creates friction. So, if you’re a growing leader, a leader who is creating powerful, positive change, then you will experience resistance as well. But, as Jon Kabat-Zinn says, “You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.” The same goes for resistance––it’s inevitable. But are you the kind of leader who will succumb to it, or will you work through it?</p> <p>In this series, John Maxwell teaches thirteen ways to handle resistance. Then Mark Cole and Becky Bursell dig into some of the ways resistance has shaped their leadership and has taught them to be better leaders.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “How to Handle Resistance Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Resistance and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9KEt7aIU4y8\">Watch this episode on YouTube</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://maxwellpodcast.com/21laws\">Enroll in the new 21 Laws of Leadership Online Course!</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://growth.maxwellleadership.com/\">Sign up for the Maxwell Leadership Growth Plan</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://store.maxwellleadership.com/\">Shop the Maxwell Leadership Online Store</a></p>",
