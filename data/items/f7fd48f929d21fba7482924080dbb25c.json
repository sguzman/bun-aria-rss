  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Guys. Holy crap guys. This week, the show is simply bursting with content. First, Chris and Matt discuss the much-anticipated Dune: Part 1, the passion project of First Run favorite Denis Villeneuve. Is it gorgeous? Is it exciting? Is it as weird as its source material? Only one way to find out. Well, two if you count watching yourselves. The guys then give you not one, but two, bonus discussions on Ridley Scott's latest sword and shield historical epic, The Last Duel, and an Icelandic horror fairy tale thing with Lamb. Then the Body Horror Marathon continues with The Incredible Melting Man, one of the only films reviewed for the podcast that is also the subject of an MST3K episode. So there's that. As always, we give our Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week, Chris runs down the physical media releases because you'll pry his 4k disks from his cold, dead hands and wrap it up with a spooky season edition of Call It!
