  "description": "In this episode, Sharon sits down to speak with Michael Tubbs, who was the youngest mayor to serve in an American city at age 26. Tubbs served as the mayor of his hometown of Stockton, CA. On a fast-track from Stanford University to the White House, Tubbs decided instead to return home, walking from door-to-door to campaign for a seat on city council and, ultimately, mayor. Sharon and Michael talk about what learning outside the box looks like, and how local politics is an ideal vehicle for change. Change can often happen faster at the local level, but making strides at the requires an across the aisle collaboration and willingness to innovate.
