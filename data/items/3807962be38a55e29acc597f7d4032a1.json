  "description": "<p>In this paper, we prove sharp blow-up and global existence results for a time\nfractional diffusion-wave equation with a nonlinear memory term in a bounded\ndomain, where the fractional derivative in time is taken in the sense of Caputo\ntype. Moreover, we also give a result for nonexistence of global solutions to a\nwave equation with a nonlinear memory term in a bounded domain. The proof of\nblow-up results is based on the eigenfunction method and the asymptotic\nproperties of solutions for an ordinary fractional differential inequality.\n</p>",
