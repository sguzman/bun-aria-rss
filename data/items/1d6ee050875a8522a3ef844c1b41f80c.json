  "description": "You would think that Deep State Radio would have a special celebration for our 50th podcast.  You probably imagined a giant blow out in silo somewhere with confetti and an interpretative reading of the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo.  Well...that happened.  But you were invited.  You don't have the clearance.  Invitations were extended purely on a need-to-party-basis.  But if you need a consolation prize...listen to this; With Kori Schake of Stanford (calling in from Rome) and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Ed Luce of the Financial Times in our studio in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark...discussing the good old days when Nazis were considered the bad guys.
