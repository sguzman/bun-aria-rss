  "description": "<p>We consider the classical vacua of the Weinberg-Salam (WS) model of\nelectroweak forces. These are no-particle, static solutions to the WS equations\nminimizing the WS energy locally. We study the WS vacuum solutions exhibiting a\nnon-vanishing average magnetic field, $\\vec b$, and prove that (i) there is a\nmagnetic field threshold $b_*$ such that for $|\\vec b|&lt;b_*$, the vacua are\ntranslationally invariant (and the magnetic field is constant), while, for\n$|\\vec b|&gt;b_*$, they are not, (ii) for $|\\vec b|&gt;b_*$, there are\nnon-translationally invariant solutions with lower energy per unit volume and\nwith the discrete translational symmetry of a 2D lattice in the plane\ntransversal to $\\vec b$, and (iii) the lattice minimizing the energy per unit\nvolume approaches the hexagonal one as the magnetic field strength approaches\nthe threshold $b_*$.\n</p>\n<p>In the absence of particles, the Weinberg-Salam model reduces to the\nYang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) equations for the gauge group $U(2)$. Thus our results\ncan be rephrased as the corresponding statements about the $U(2)$-YMH equations\n</p>",
