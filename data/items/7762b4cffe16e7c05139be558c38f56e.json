  "description": "How can we think together multiplicity and agency? How can we resist oppression and build transformative political coalitions while attending to the ambivalences and incommensurabilities born of the collective conditions for action, meaning making, and self-understanding? In Nos/Otras: Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Multiplicitous Agency, and Resistance (SUNY Press, 2021), Andrea J. Pitts engages the work of Gloria Anzaldúa and her many readers to give us a framework for consistently returning to these questions as central to struggle for collective flourishing. As part of asking these questions, Pitts delves into critiques arising from disability, critical trans, and Indigenous studies and activism. Pitts provokes us to think ever anew about what is possible between us.\n Sarah Tyson is an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, Denver.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
