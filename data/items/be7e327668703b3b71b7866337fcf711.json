  "description": "Kristin got the opportunity to use a Twitter joke out in public this week and it didn’t disappoint.\nKristin was at the grocery picking up some medicine. There weren’t many cashiers available, so Kristin found herself in a long line. A guy in the store gets frustrated with the long lines and lack of service and begins yelling in the store making others uncomfortable.\nWhile Kristin is leaving, she sees that same guy getting into his Tesla.\nKristin recently came across a Twitter joke instructing people to say the silliest thing to Tesla owners to make them upset.\nThis was the perfect opportunity for Kristin. She felt that since the guy was being an a*hole to the store employees, she’d do the same and push his buttons a little. You’d never guess what she said to him!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
