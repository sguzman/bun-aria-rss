  "description": "<p>This week’s topic was inspired by a question from Sharon Mayfield who wrote “can you discuss imitation and originality. Is there any such thing as ‘original’ work these days? Is it ‘wrong’ to reflect styles of work or techniques we’ve seen used by other artists?”</p>\n<p>This week, we discuss the difference between ‘stealing like an artist’ and copying. Of course we are all influenced by those who have gone before - it could not be otherwise. So how do we distinguish between taking an idea or technique and using it to inspire our own unique work, and simply copying what someone else has done? What does it mean to be influenced? How can you tell that's what's happening and when do you know you've crossed a line? And what does Austin Kleon mean by his idea of 'stealing like an artist'? We also share some information on copyright laws in the UK and US - but be warned that we are not experts! It does, in the end, all come down to common sense. And usually, if you are taking from someone else, you know when we have gone too far.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Mentioned</strong></u></p>\n<p>Steal Like an Artist : Austin Kleon &nbsp;<a href=\"//\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Steal-Like-Artist-Austin-Kleon/dp/0761169253</a></p>\n<p>Ted Hughes - Poetry in the making <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Poetry-Making-Handbook-Writing-Teaching/dp/0571233805\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Poetry-Making-Handbook-Writing-Teaching/dp/0571233805</a></p>\n<p>US copyright:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.artbusinessinfo.com/copyright-and-fair-use-for-artists.html\"><u>https://www.artbusinessinfo.com/copyright-and-fair-use-for-artists.html</u></a></p>\n<p>UK copyright digital images and the internet: <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/481194/c-notice-201401.pdf\"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/481194/c-notice-201401.pdf</u></a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
