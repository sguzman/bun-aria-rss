  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The almighty scale is a tool that many folks use to track their health and fitness, but it’s just one tool. There are many other measurements of health that can determine how healthy you truly are, including things like sleep quality, metabolic health, body fat percentage, and energy levels. Your weight is just one benchmark, and it in no way illustrates the full out-picturing of your health or your value as a human. <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On this episode, Noelle Tarr of Coconuts and Kettlebells is back on The Model Health Show to discuss why focusing exclusively on the scale can actually diminish your health. She’s going to share which biomarkers you should concentrate on instead, and how to focus on true health instead of just the number on the scale. We’re also going to talk about the benefits of exercise, the truth about cellulite, and how women can train in accordance with their cycles.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">If you’ve ever unhealthily obsessed over the number on the scale, Noelle’s message will resonate with you. She is truly one of my favorite people, and I hope this episode is empowering and supportive of your goals.
