  "description": "There is no bourbon in this episode. But coffee founder Sahra Nguyen, 35, teaches Fred how to taste coffee like a pro and discusses the state of the coffee business and how she is bringing back Vietnamese coffee beans.\n\nNguyen is successfully transforming coffee culture with a focus on diversity, inclusion and sustainability.  She launched Nguyen Coffee Supply in 2018 in Brooklyn, NY. It's the first specialty coffee company in the U.S to celebrate, champion and import beans directly from family-owned coffee farmers in Vietnam—the second largest coffee producer in the world—roasting 'single-origin' clean and organic beans prized by coffee connoisseurs. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees, this 35 year old coffee pioneer is helping to bridge communities by promoting cultural awareness and sharing stories of the underrepresented.  Nguyen's accomplishments have been widely recognized by her industry and the media; this summer she graced the cover of Food & Wine magazine as one of \"25 Game Changers.\" \n\nFood & Wine writes that \"Vietnamese coffee culture is having its own moment here in America, in large part due to Nguyen.\" \n\nLearn More About Nguyen Coffee\nhttps://nguyencoffeesupply.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nguyencoffeesupply\n\nMerch, including official The Fred Minnick Show Glencairn: https://shop.podcastone.com/collections/the-fred-minnick-show\n\nBecome a YouTube Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg/join\n\nSome products tasted on this show may have been provided to Fred Minnick at no cost to him.
