  "description": "<p>When the former community organizer Reem Assil opened Reem’s California in Oakland, she knew she wanted to do things differently. But she never could have imagined what was to come. There were protests and death threats, but also industry accolades; a heavy mix for anyone, but especially a new mom and new restaurateur. Reem joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about the early days of Reem’s, her time with La Cocina’s incubator program, and how social justice continues to permeate everything she does. They also discuss Reem’s debut cookbook, <i>Arabiyya: Recipes from the Life of an Arab in Diaspora</i>, a tribute to the food at Reem’s and the Arab hospitality she grew up with and champions today.</p><p><br />This episode is supported by Talea Beer Co.
