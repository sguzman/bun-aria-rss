  "description": "Hey HBs! https://alexisdaria.com/ (Alexis Daria) is here to tell us all about her new release, A Lot Like Adios! It's the second in her Primas of Power series and IT'S DELICIOUS! Second chance romance, family redemption, fan fiction, and super steamy!!! It's everything we wanted and more. We get to cackle about Miss Congeniality and, even though it was *obviously* made 20 years ago, it holds up! Basically, ~we think it's goooorgeous, we want to kiiiiiss it, we want to smooooch it, we want to marrrryyyyyy it!~\n Bonus Content: *Bing Boong Bong* FBI Times with Erin, federal manicurists, the magic of William Shatner's announcer voice, and the generation of young women who learned the SING method of self defense from this movie! \n Lady Loves: \n Alexis: Fable Bands. Headbands based on books! \n Erin: Get your eyes checked (or whatever you're putting off). Do it! \n Melody: Embrace whoever you need to be in this moment. Need to spend 3 days and emailing and calling school administrators and the entire school board to get a COVID safety plan published? Pull your hair back and get to it. You'll only find yourself *slightly* unrecognizable. \n Make sure to follow Alexis Daria! Instagram | https://twitter.com/alexisdaria?s=20 (Twitter)\n Check out Mel's new podcast BONKERS ROMANCE!!
