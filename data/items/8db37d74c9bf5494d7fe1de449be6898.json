  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Professor Steven Calabresi explains his opinion that the appointment of Robert Mueller by Rod Rosenstein is unconstitutional because it violates the Appointments Clause. Mueller is more like a principal officer than an inferior one since he's not nominated by the President and confirmed by the senate. Additionally, four attorneys reporting to Mueller claimed to have \"Special Assistant US Attorney\" status which confirms that Mueller has \"Special US Attorney\" status confirming that he is acting as principal officer without nomination by the President or the advice and consent of the US Senate as the Constitution requires. Later, former New Orleans mayor, Mitch Landrieu, was presented with the JFK award for removing Confederate statues. We are now destroying our own history and giving awards for it. These statues help us remember history, good or bad. Finally, a good friend of the show Clint Walker passed away at 90 years old. He was a former merchant seaman who became an actor; he was best known for his role in Cheyenne and the Dirty Dozen. He was a solid conservative and very supportive of President Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
