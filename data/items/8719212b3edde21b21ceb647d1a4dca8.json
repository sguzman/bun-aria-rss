  "description": "In this episode Julia talks with Doug Hubbard, author of How to Measure Anything, about why people so often believe things are impossible to quantify like \"innovation\" or \"quality of life.\" For example, because people often have a deep misunderstanding of the meaning of probability. Or because they're reluctant to violate \"sacred taboos\" by putting a number on something like the value of human life. Or because it feels vulgar to \"reduce\" important things to a number. Doug explains how he responds to these objections and others.",
