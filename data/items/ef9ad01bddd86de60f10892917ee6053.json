  "description": "In our last conversation with Michael Twitty, the chef and culinary historian told us all about his “Southern Discomfort Tour.” The tour, which he wrote about in his book, “The Cooking Gene,” involved travelling the south and cooking on plantations using the same methods that his enslaved ancestors would have used. (He even did it dressed as they would have dressed.) Since our conversation, Michael has won two James Beard awards  — the Oscar’s of the food world! — for his book and food writing. In a follow-up to our original episode, Brittany calls Michael to hear all about what it was like to win the food world’s highest honor, his recent travels all over Africa, and his unfiltered opinions on collard greens.\nThis episode is part of our summer podcast club series.
