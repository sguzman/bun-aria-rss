  "description": "Everyone’s skipping over the BIGGEST news story of the week to rant about Trudeau’s blackface and Trump’s creditless whistleblower “scandal.” The banks and the Fed are running out of money, but a second Great Depression will make Elizabeth Warren look like a DREAM candidate! Glenn brags to Bill O’Reilly about his “invitation” to have breakfast with Trump. Corey Lewandowski’s mockery, the student climate protests, and Beto’s failing gun stance all prove how LITTLE we trust the press and government. As Facebook pranksters descend on Area 51, what kind of “alien” weapons should the military use against them? How about “barf guns?” The “totally real” 12th imam returns to discuss how woke he’s become.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
