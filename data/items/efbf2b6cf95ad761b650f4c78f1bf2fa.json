But Nair went on to join Hindustan Unilever, becoming the first female manager to work on a factory floor, the first woman to serve on the management committee, and the youngest-ever executive director. As Unilever's Chief Human Resource Officer, she oversaw the company's 170,000-plus global workforce during the COVID-19 crisis - which Nair says was the greatest challenge of her career. From factory floor to the Global Chief Executive Officer of Chanel, becoming a \"serial glass ceiling breaker.\"",
