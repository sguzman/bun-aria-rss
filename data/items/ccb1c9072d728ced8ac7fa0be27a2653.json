  "description": "Hello! My name is Pierre-Benoit and I'd like to welcome you to One Minute French from the Radio Lingua Network. In this podcast I'm going to be teaching you the basics of French. The great thing about this language course is that you'll be learning all you need to know in just 60 seconds - or thereabouts! Each one minute language lesson will equip you with just enough French to help you get by in lots of situations, either on holiday, or on a business trip to a French-speaking country, or just to impress your French-speaking friends or colleagues. Our course will be starting very soon. In the meantime, visit our website on http://www.oneminutelanguages.com",
