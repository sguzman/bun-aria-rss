  "description": "<p>In this fifth BonusCast from History Goes Bump, you will hear a bit about the phenomenon that is the podcast Lore, which is currently taking iTunes by storm, and you will also hear a clip from Diane's co-hosting adventure on The 9th Story Podcast - you know the clip where the haunted music box makes an appearance or rather doesn't, but Diane and Dan are freaked, so something happened! Also, there are some more outtakes from the show, particularly featuring Denise's non-existent giggling - uh huh - and our guest co-host Freya even makes it into the outtakes with both some tongue tied issues and a little behind the scenes peek - or listen - to the pre-show talk. Enjoy!</p> <p>To get the full 9th Story Podcast episode on the dark side of fairytales:  <a href= \"http://www.9thstory.com/316/\">http://www.9thstory.com/316/</a></p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p>",
