  "title": "Bradley Cooper Takes The Colbert Questionert, Corey Stoll | The More You Knomicron",
  "description": "Stephen brings you another edition of “Disinformation Station” in an attempt to debunk some of the latest crazy covid cures, and that pillow guy has employed some very fuzzy math in his latest attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. Meanwhile… A baseball team mascot recently learned a valuable lesson in how to crop photos for social media. Next, if you don’t know his favorite smell, or the most-used app on his phone, do you really know “Nightmare Alley” and “Licorice Pizza” star Bradley Cooper? Then Corey Stoll talks Shakespeare with Stephen, and confesses that he has no interest in joining the 1% despite portraying one of them in “Billions” on Showtime. And every night before the show, Stephen answers a few questions from his live studio audience. This time, he fields hard-hitting inquiries about South Carolina barbecue, what he misses most about his home state, the perfect pizza, his facial hair, and no conversation with Stephen Colbert is complete without a \"Lord of The Rings\" deep dive.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
