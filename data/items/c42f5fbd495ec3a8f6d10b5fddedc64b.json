  "description": "We've captured lightning in a bottle this week. We somehow managed to record The Vergecast in the brief moments between the Arizonan llamas and the white-gold-blue-black dress debate. It was a moment of clarity, a calm we didn't know we should have savored. Journey back with us to that simpler time, and hear Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Chris Ziegler, and Sam Sheffer weigh in on the FCC's net neutrality ruling, the price of an Apple Watch, the upcoming Galaxy S 6, and the classic 1992 romantic thriller, The Bodyguard.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
