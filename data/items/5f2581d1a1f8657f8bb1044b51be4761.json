  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving! Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. On today’s episode I’m joined by good friend, Andrew Horowitz – Founder and CEO of Horowitz and Company. The anticipation of new policies are causing massive market swings – but how long will this trend last? To start off the episode, Andrew highlights several grossly, over-anticipated sectors. As the market is coming off record highs, Andrew explains why our portfolios are at even greater risk. Recent trends are far from the truth. Tune in as Andrew and I discuss what an inevitable high interest rate environment means for certain sectors going forward. Andrew then shows listeners how to take advantage of the crazy market jumps we are witnessing today. These are aggressive, short-term trading positions that could potentially move 100% to 200% within the next few weeks. And finally, let the holiday shopping begin! As online-shopping trends continue to grow, Andrew breaks down which big-box retailers to avoid this season.",
