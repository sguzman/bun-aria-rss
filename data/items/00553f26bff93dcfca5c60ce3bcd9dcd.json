  "description": "Pat and Stu set the record straight on the often misinterpreted issue of “separation of church and state.” Fifty immigrants tragically died while being transported in the back of a semi-truck. Pat goes through the worst-run cities in America, and they all have a common theme: Democrats run them. Places like New York are offering vaccines for monkeypox, but only for people with specific sexual preferences. Stu and Pat discuss how the fight to end abortion is far from over. Justice Clarence Thomas is getting most of the heat for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, putting the Left’s racism on full display. The corporate media is exaggerating the abortion issue to shift the focus from how awful everything else is due to Democratic policies.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
