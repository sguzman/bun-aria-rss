    "media:description": "Excavators at the La Brea Tar Pits & Museum work to dig up fossils of mammoths, dire wolves, giant sloths and more out of the ground. They clean and piece together the bones, and prepare them for research and museum collections. With 4 million specimens already in scientists' hands, why keep excavating after more than 100 years?\n\nThe La Brea Tar Pits is one of the only paleontological sites on Earth that has preserved an entire ecosystem over time, from plants to camels to bugs. And every new fossil not only helps tell the story of the Los Angeles Basin over 50,000 years but also gives us clues about how current species, including humans, could weather climate change in the future. \n\nWe went to the La Brea Tar Pits to see how specimens are discovered, cleaned, and pieced together to build a record of the last 50,000 years.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:41 - Acquisition\n3:58 - Cleaning and Preparation\n6:17 - Research and Collections\n\nMORE SCIENCE INSIDER VIDEOS: \nDermatologists Debunk 8 Body-Odor Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/bJ-CmpYifB4\nNeurologists Debunk 11 Brain Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/eDQquPtqMZs\nEye Doctors Debunk 13 More Vision Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/0ZFtHzZqYDY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Fossil #ColossalCollection #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsi...\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_ins...\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\nHow 4 Million Fossils Are Extracted From Tar At La Brea Tar Pits | Colossal Collections",
