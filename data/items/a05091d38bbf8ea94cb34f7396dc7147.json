  "description": "<p>Who's guest hosting episode 253? Well, let's just say, it's very high and he doesn't like ladders... it's Uncle Xandy! We have the sorry fool who shares blood with America's Hircine Shifter here to tell us a true crime tale from his family's German hometown. But first Em brings us part one in a series on a personal urban legend from their own hometown: The Bunnyman Bridge of Virginia. Then Xandy covers serial killer Jürgen Bartsch and talks way more about castration than he planned. And thankfully we can confirm that Christine hangs curtains better than the Bunnyman... and that's why we drink!</p>\n",
