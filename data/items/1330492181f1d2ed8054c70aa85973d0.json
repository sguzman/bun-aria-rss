But when Hrag starts making changes, Henry flips out. If they want the business – and their new-found relationship – to be successful, they’ll need to learn how to work together.</p><p>In our second story: Holly and her dad, Bo, had never been particularly close. With eight siblings to compete with, one-on-one time with her parents was hard to come by. But when Bo is diagnosed with dementia, Holly realizes she has to capture as many of his memories as she can before they’re taken from him. So the two of them embark on a road trip to the landmarks of Bo’s youth – and learn a lot about each other along the way.<br /><br />To learn more about this podcast, visit: <a href=\"https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/podcast\" target=\"_blank\">www.rocketmortgage.com/homemade.</a></p>\n",
