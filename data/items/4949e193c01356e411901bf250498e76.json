  "description": "Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged. Today, everyone is talking about the 10-year Treasury yield—namely, how it just broke 3% for the first time in years. Here’s the truth: this isn’t a big deal—no matter what the media say. This number is still well below historical norms… However, it does present us with a buying opportunity… which I’ll tell you about in today’s show. But before I get to that, I welcome as my guest this week Danielle DiMartino Booth. Danielle is a former adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and editor of the Money Strong newsletter. Today, she breaks down the impact higher yields will have on individual investors… the fundamental landscape of today’s housing market… and why millennials will be a huge drag on the economy much quicker than most economists are forecasting. I also give you a play-by-play of how I find my best stock ideas. This simple strategy will help you invest in the best stocks before Wall Street finds out about them… and before they’re mentioned in the media.",
