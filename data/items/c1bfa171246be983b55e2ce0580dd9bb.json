  "title": "How To Write Your Book Without A Fuss by Lucy McCarraher and Joe Gregory",
  "description": "Writing a book can be daunting whether it is your first or your tenth. The steps are unclear without proper guidance from professionals. This is where this book fills that role. It gives prospective writers the knowledge necessary to plan, prepare, write and publish their book. Using the A.U.T.H.O.R and W.R.I.T.E.R model, prospective authors have the framework to write a book that delivers the maximum amount of value to the reader. As someone who predominantly reads, it is nice to find out about the process behind creating a book that fits a specific purpose. The steps laid out in this book are specific to individuals wanting to create business or self-help books, but it seems the process would be similar for fiction with a few changes. Reading a book like this gives anyone the confidence to know that they have the tools necessary for writing a book. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
