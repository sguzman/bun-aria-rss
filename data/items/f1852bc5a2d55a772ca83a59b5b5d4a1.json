  "description": "<div>Today on a haunting episode of Real Ghost Stories Online that was the inspiration for the hit 1992 family comedy, Home Alone Two, Lost In New York. Unfortunately, Hollywood edited out all the parts where Kevin finds himself possessed by a demonic spirit, goes on a murderous rampage, kills the woman who has the pigeons and finds himself laying in a dumpster, surrounded by heroin needles, crack pipes and is seen drinking the blood of a live pigeon. Damn, that would have been such a better movie!<br>\n<br>\nWhen a man enters a new home in a very crime-ridden area of his city, the last thing on his mind is the idea of “ghost”.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, he soon finds out from friends, family and eventually through a first hand experience, that something demonic may be lingering behind the doors of his home. <br>\n<br>\nThat story, and much more, today On Real Ghost Stories Online. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
