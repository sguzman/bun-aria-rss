While the identity of the attackers remains unconfirmed, there is some evidence to suggest a link to the Iranian Seedworm (aka MuddyWater) group. The targeting and tactics are consistent with Iranian-sponsored actors.\nThe research can be found here:\nEspionage Campaign Targets Telecoms Organizations across Middle East and Asia",
