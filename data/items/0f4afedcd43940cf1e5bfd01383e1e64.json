  "description": "<p>No other actress has ever had the notoriety and fame or stirred the emotions quite like Marilyn Monroe. She was a legend in her own time and that legend has only grown since her untimely death. Not only was her rise to fame epic, but her personal life was a tale fit for the silver screen filled with torrid love affairs that included a president, drugs, scandal, tragedy, conspiracy and a mysterious death. Such a tumultuous life is hard to completely snuff out and perhaps Marilyn Monroe's spirit continues to live on in the afterlife.  Not just in our memories, but as a spirit still walking among us. Moment in Oddity features the Tarim Mummies and This Day in History features the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-35-life-and-afterlife-of.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-35-life-and-afterlife-of.html</a></p>",
