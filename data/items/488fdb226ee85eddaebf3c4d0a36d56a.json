    "media:description": "A speedrun by me of the Duolingo Swedish course. The speedrun begins the moment I click \"Swedish\" and ends the moment I hit the trophy at the end of the Swedish course. This is a bad run: I just thought it was a fun video idea and I haven't seen many of them before. Please go ahead and beat this very mediocre record.\n\nI will be uploading a normal video soon, I promise.\n\n#duolingo #speedrun #duolingospeedrun",
