  "description": "<p>Writing a book is amazing AND extremely confronting and challenging. In this episode, I sit with one of my besties to talk about it ALL– the excitement, the nervousness, the fears. We get REAL over the behind-the-scenes of writing and launching a book that every author I know has experienced but people really don’t talk about online. We share the lessons we’ve both learned, the challenge in sharing your story when other people are involved and getting over the shame of revealing parts of your past that don’t represent you today. I share about what it was like to write about my story with my family in Discover Your Dharma. Rosie speaks about n the brink of launching her first book, You Are Radically Loved, and the full spectrum of emotions that comes up right before you’re launching your book into the world- quite similar to having a baby!
