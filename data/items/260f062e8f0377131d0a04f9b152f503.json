  "description": "On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Monster Jam driver Cynthia Gauthier drops in from Canada to join Fred in some lively banter and whiskey sipping. Along the way, they talk ice fishing, driving in traffic without the benefit of a Monster Truck, the intentional craziness of the motor sport, Titan Games, healing from the sport and more. Fred, of course, loves to enjoy Monster Jam with his sons, so having Gauthier on the show was a can't-miss proposition.\n\nWhiskys tasted:\nShelter Point Lot 40 (14:11)\nForty Creek Barrel Select (17:28)\nStock and Barrel Rye (20:03)\nShelter Point Smoke Point (27:27)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and Cynthia talk about a number of topics, such as:\nFred extols the virtues of Canadian whisky and discusses the difference between it and American whiskey.\nCynthia reveals she took a bartending class when she was younger and that she likes to enjoy many different types of spirits - focusing on whiskey when she isn't feeling well.\nShe does clarify, however, she doesn't really drink while on the road with Monster Jam, choosing to focus on her health.\nGauthier notes that part of not drinking when touring with the sport is because, obviously, drinking and driving don't mix. To which Fred quips, \"You said in your profession it's hard to drink a lot; in my profession, it's hard to drive a lot.\"\nIn addition to ice fishing, Cynthia likes plenty of other outdoor activities, including paddle boarding and longboarding.\nThe two make their way through Canadian whiskeys and when they hit the 92-proof Stock and Barrel Rye, Cynthia says, \"This will take paint off your wall.\" (It's fair to note the interview and tasting happened at 10 a.m., so perhaps her palate was still waking up.)\nA self-described adrenaline junkie, Cynthia admits how much she appreciates being able to compete in Monster Jam along with a number of other women in the sport.\nShe says her passion for motor sports originates with her dad, who is a mechanic.\nWhile she studied to be a CPA, she actually became a welder and started her own welding business.\nCynthia ultimately picks Shelter Point Lot 40 as her favorite of the flight.\n\nQUOTABLES\n\nCynthia Gauthier compares Monster Jam to a UFC fight - it's about the action. \"It's the only sport that we're actually crashing on purpose. Other sports, they always want to finish first, but we want the wild moments and so we actually sometimes go out of control to get that, that special moment where you get on one wheel and then come back on four. It's a special sport.\"\n\nRESOURCES\n\nFOLLOW CYNTHIA\n\nhttps://www.cynthiagauthier.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cynthiagauthier/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cynthiagauthier\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cynthiagauthier11/\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nManscaped (discount code: SmoothFred, 20% off and free shipping) https://www.manscaped.com/\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/\n\n \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
