  "description": "Each one teach one. Jimmy and Larry are back holding court behind the paywall with the one and only mayor of the Lower East Side, Dro Greindstein, and knowledge darts are still being thrown at an alarming rate. The boys and their life coach still have a lot of ground to cover: dealing with budding fame, the Throwing Fits 100 day plan, how the streets are holding up, information vs. fear, a plan for the future, animal instincts, celebrating the barbershop, the best sandwich in NYC, the most crucial and opulent quarantine plugs, finding your zen, having Andre 3000 on speed dial, making as much money as you want, the side piece economy, general wizardry and much more on this last call amongst men.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.\n",
