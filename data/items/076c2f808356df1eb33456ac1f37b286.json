  "description": "Deep State Radio's own Kori Schake wrote an important piece about the current threat to the international order posed by the Trump Administration.  In this episode we discuss the article and just exactly how grievous the threat is and how we ought to characterize it.  This takes us from John Locke to John Winthrop to Stephen Miller...(and we hope that's the last time you ever see those three names in a sentence together.)  Join Kori, Rosa Brooks, Evelyn Farkas and David Rothkopf for the discussion.  But bring an adult beverage.
