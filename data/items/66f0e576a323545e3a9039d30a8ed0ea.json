  "description": "<p>What drove music icon Kurt Cobain to take his own life on April 8th, 1994. Is it possible that he didn't? Could he have been murdered? After all, the gun had been wiped of finger prints and there are a LOT of questions about the legitimacy of the suicide note. And if he was murdered, did his wife, Courtney Love, have something to do with it? The 1998 Nick Broomfield documentary looks into all of this.\n We also meet Kurt's....colorful?....Seattle friends, become obsessed with his Aunt Mary, have an awkward encounter at the Washington State Lottery, and ride along with a pimp to the home of a weirdo named El Duce! Ahhhhh, the 90s.Â </p>\n",
