  "title": "#144 It's Even Worse Than That (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 144th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>This week, we discuss the prestigious scientific journal Nature, and its promotion of an anti-scientific perspective on sex and gender. We also discuss the not-so-prestigious journal Transgender Studies Quarterly, and its take on species concepts, and also on the “Trans*-Ness of Blackness.” We discuss the new research that finds that covid vaccines do affect women’s menstrual cycles, and also the shortcomings both in that research, and in the Washington Post’s reporting on it. Bret offers pro bono marketing help to Pfizer. And we talk about Great Britain’s medical regulatory agency (MHRA) moving from its role as “watchdog” of outside entities, to that of “enabler.”</p><p>Our store:  https://www.darkhorsestore.org</p><p>Our book: A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-Gatherers-Guide-21st-Century-Challenges/dp/0593086880/).
