  "description": "<p>Some in the U.S. wine industry say cannabis legalization will create a war between wine& weed for limited resources & consumer interest. But George Christie, from the <a href= \"http://wineindustrynetwork.com/aboutus.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Wine Industry Network</a> (the leading business resource for the wine industry), thinks collaboration could lead to great things for both parties. After you hear his ideas, you may just agree.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <div> <p>1. We discuss how George acquired expertise on this topic, through a hugely successful \"Wine and Weed Symposium\" (<a href= \"http://wine-weed.com\">http://wine-weed.com</a>) that brought wine producers and cannabis professionals together in a room in the North Coast of California.   </p> </div> <div> </div> <div> <p>2.

We talk about the overlap between the wine and weed industries -- the differences, and why wine and weed are being linked rather than beer and weed or cigarettes and weed.
