Also Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Chanel West Coast because she she tried convincing a producer on the show \"Love and Hip Hop\" to work with her by stating that she is up there with the biggest rappers when it comes to hip-hop because Charlamagne dissed her on the show \"Ridiculousness\". Speaking of Hip-Hop and the great MC's, VH1 had the Hip Hop Honors last night, so we opened up the phone lines to hear what our listeners thought of the performances. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
