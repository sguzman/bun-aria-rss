  "description": "<p>We’re excited to bring you a great interview today as for the first time we get to learn a little bit more about the sport of luge by talking with two-time Olympian Hannah Campbell-Pegg. Hannah talks us through her journey in getting into the sport, from starting off as a bobsleigh athlete to what brought about the transition into luge. She also takes us through her two Olympic experiences, detailing what it is like for an athlete from a country with no luge history to compete on the world stage as well as going over the experience in Vancouver after the tragic death of her friend Nodar Kumaritashvili. We also learn more about what is in store for the sport in Australia moving forward, and just why her parents weren’t exactly too happy with her after her first time competing in the sport. It’s one great and informative interview that you won’t want to miss!</p>",
