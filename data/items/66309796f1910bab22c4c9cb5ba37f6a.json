  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, despite bad decisions in New York, New Jersey, and other states the death rate for the Wuhan virus is two-tenths of one percent, or simply put the success or recovery rate is 99.8%. However, the media would have you think otherwise despite the facts. This is done to hurt President Trump's reelection and its aided and abetted by the media. This new media of young kamikaze activists have abandoned their profession in favor of collectivism and trashing Trump. Then, the country has moved from the spying of candidate Trump to impeachment, to coronavirus, to riots, looting, and the toppling of statues. Trump held a Bible in front of a church and the media chastised him. The same media that is parading around a Black Lives Matter leader calling for activists to 'burn down the system' and New York City's own Curtis Sliwa joins the show to give us the play-by-play from the streets. Later, in 1975 Joe Biden argued for segregation saying that bussing, or integration more implicitly, was a \"rejection of the whole movement of Black pride individuality.\" Biden's own words weren't an argument against bussing, but a shocking argument for keeping Blacks out of White neighborhoods as Sen. Kamala Harris once pointed at a debate. Biden should be ashamed of these comments. Afterward, Sen, Tom Cotton calls in to explain why the founders wanted the nation’s Capital to be a federal territory - the federal City of Washington District of Columbia - not a state.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
