  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Everyone seems to be talking about justice—including Christians, but how we define “justice” in our society is hotly debated. Pastor and author Tim Keller has outlined 4 competing definitions of justice, and what sets Biblical justice apart from the rest. The Holy Post crew reviews Keller’s article and its implications. Liberty University has put Jerry Falwell Jr. on “indefinite leave.” Was it Falwell’s race-baiting, financial shenanigans, authoritarian leadership, or abuse of power that motivated Liberty’s board to act? Nope—it was a sexually-suggestive photo with Falwell holding alcohol. What does it say about what triggers evangelicals (and what doesn’t)? Also this week, friend of the show and host of the Vox Podcast, Mike Erre, talks with Skye about why Christians are drawn to conspiracy theories, and what motivated Skye to write his new book, “What If Jesus Was Serious?” Plus, Phil explains why he wants to live in a world where wild boar stroll into public areas with their piglets to steal things—and where naked Germans chase them.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/german-nudist-chases-wild-boar-that-stole-laptop-berlin-teufelssee\"> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/german-nudist-chases-wild-boar-that-stole-laptop-berlin-teufelssee</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://quarterly.gospelinlife.com/a-biblical-critique-of-secular-justice-and-critical-theory/\"> https://quarterly.gospelinlife.com/a-biblical-critique-of-secular-justice-and-critical-theory/</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://thewayofimprovement.com/2020/08/07/why-did-the-liberty-university-board-of-trustees-put-jerry-falwell-jr-on-indefinite-leave/\"> https://thewayofimprovement.com/2020/08/07/why-did-the-liberty-university-board-of-trustees-put-jerry-falwell-jr-on-indefinite-leave/</a></p>",
