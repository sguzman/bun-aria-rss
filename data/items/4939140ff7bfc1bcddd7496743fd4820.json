  "description": "<p>Stock markets sold off again this week on renewed concerns over bond yields and the Fed’s unwillingness to engage in any kind of yield curve control, or YCC. A late rally on Friday stopped a lot of the bleeding, but for the week all but the Dow Industrials index were lower.\nFed chair Jerome Powell dodged questions over YCC in a Q&A session on Thursday and reiterated the Fed’s dovish stance on rates, causing most of the week’s selling. Stocks rebounded after non-farm payrolls beat estimates Friday morning before retreating anew, and then rebounding again in the afternoon. After all was said and done the Dow eked out a 0.2% gain for the week, while S&P 500 gave up 0.7%.

Brent crude rose more than 7% this week and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) gained 3.5%. Several oil stocks set 52-week highs, including Exxon (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Hess Corp (NYSE:HES), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and Total SE (NYSE:TOT). Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) shares added 18% for the week, also setting a 52-week high. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) rallied by 12% and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) was up 11%.\nThe ‘reopening trade’ had some stocks in the winners’ column as well. Trip Advisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) rallied 19%.
