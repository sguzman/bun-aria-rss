  "description": "<p><em><strong>How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth</strong></em>. This episode is a conversation we've been looking froward to for a long time. Dr. Beth Allison Barr stops by the podcast to discuss her book \"The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth.\" Dr. Barr talks to us about her upbringing and how she came to challenge the traditional understanding of women's roles in the Bible and in the modern church. How has culture influenced translations? What does the Bible, Jesus and even Paul actually say about male headship and the role of women? What can we see when we dive into the history of it all? If the teachings and translations on this topic are inaccurate, how do we have them and why? It's a long and messy topic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Barr can be found here: <a href=\"https://bethallisonbarr.com/\">bethallisonbarr.com</a> and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bethallisonbarr\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p>Her book can be purchased here: <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781587434709\">www.indiebound.org/book/9781587434709</a></p>\n<p>Sign up for our newsletter to take the survey here:<a href=\"https://voxologypodcast.com/\"> voxologypodcast.com</a></p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
