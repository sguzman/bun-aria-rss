  "description": "<p>On today's show, the boys keep an eye on the clock as a few of them try to obtain a Playstation 5, which is next to impossible. Plus the guys dive into a loaded Pod FOD that includes an introduction (if you've been living under a rock) to Vietnamese singing/counting legend, Soytiet, and how the tables may already be turning on him within the office. The guys also answer questions regarding whether or not they prefer real or fake Christmas trees, cruise ships already dealing with covid outbreaks, what some of their cold weather pet peeves are, Connor potentially buying a big dog, small dog, and big cat, Nick shares a bone chilling story about some neighbor kids somehow knowing his name, and the boys chat about a gator in Florida that is potentially 6 feet tall, and 50+ feet long, plus Nick picks a few more Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. As always, send your submissions for the Pod FOD into @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram, and make sure to subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow. We appreciate you for listening, enjoy.</p>\n",
