  "description": "Biz's Union Square show was like a homecoming party for Kane.  He had made it like all his Albee Square friends that were in attendance knew he would.  Kane knew early on what it took to become successful.  He witnessed it first hand living across the street from Divine Sounds.  He saw them go from a neighborhood DJ sound system to a recording act with a hit single, \"What People Do For Money\".  He befriended them and was there to witness their success and at some points help out along the way.  But meeting Marley Marl and sitting in his studio where so many other hits were made was the fuel he needed to make his own hits.
