From credit card bills to student loans to car payments; debt comes in many shapes and sizes and paying it off is a lofty and noble goal, but requires hard work and laser focus. In this episode Jen talks about what it's like to lift your head up from accomplishing this singular goal, and the difficulties in finding a new rhythm while identifying and naming new (and often diverse) financial goals.
