  "description": "<p>Local general depth ($LGD$) functions are used for describing the local\ngeometric features and mode(s) in multivariate distributions. In this paper, we\nundertake a rigorous systematic study of $LGD$ and establish several analytical\nand statistical properties. First, we show that, when the underlying\nprobability distribution is absolutely continuous with density $f(\\cdot)$, the\nscaled version of $LGD$ (referred to as $\\tau$-approximation) converges,\nuniformly and in $L^d(\\mathbb{R}^p)$ to $f(\\cdot)$ when $\\tau$ converges to\nzero. Second, we establish that, as the sample size diverges to infinity the\ncentered and scaled sample $LGD$ converge in distribution to a centered\nGaussian process uniformly in the space of bounded functions on\n$\\mathcal{H}_G$, a class of functions yielding $LGD$. Third, using the sample\nversion of the $\\tau$-approximation ($S \\tau A$) and the gradient system\nanalysis, we develop a new clustering algorithm. The validity of this algorithm\nrequires several results concerning the uniform finite difference approximation\nof the gradient system associated with $S \\tau A$. For this reason, we\nestablish \\emph{Bernstein}-type inequality for deviations between the centered\nand scaled sample $LGD$, which is also of independent interest. Finally,\ninvoking the above results, we establish consistency of the clustering\nalgorithm. Applications of the proposed methods to mode estimation and upper\nlevel set estimation are also provided. Finite sample performance of the\nmethodology are evaluated using numerical experiments and data analysis.\n</p>",
