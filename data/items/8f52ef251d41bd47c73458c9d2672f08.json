  "description": "<p>On this special episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie sits down with former Republican strategist Steve Schmidt. While Schmidt might not be a household name, his reputation looms large in the GOP universe -- he’s helped run campaigns for everyone from President George W. Bush to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and he was the senior campaign strategist and advisor to Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid. But then, in June 2018, he walked away from the Republican party, citing it as “fully the party of Trump” and “a danger to our democracy and our values.” Now he’s channeling.all of his energy into defeating President Trump in November as co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by current and former Republicans. In this urgent and timely conversation, Schmidt shares with Katie what led him to renounce the party he had pledged loyalty to for 30 years, what to expect during this final sprint to election day, and how he thinks Trumpism will impact our political system for many years to come.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
