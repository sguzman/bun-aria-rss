  "description": "<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by John Gonzalez of The Ringer! The duo starts out joking about Shek not kicking out John's boss, Bill Simmons, out of their fantasy football league (4:50). Since John is from Philly they then get into the Eagles moving on from Nick Foles and the pressure Carson Wentz may have on him (9:56). Next, John breaks down the big Anthony Davis to the Lakers trade and who else potentially may join Davis in LA (29:25). They also get into why the Toronto Raptors championship is an outlier in the age of super teams (45:07). Finally, they round out the show talking about the great success of John's wife, Colleen Wolfe (1:11:13). </p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
