  "description": "An interview with novelist Grant Ginder. In his latest dramady of familial disfunction, Let’s Not Do That Again﻿ (Henry Holt, 2022), Grant starts with political intrigue that bridges New York and Paris, mixes it with a wealthy and connected family in freefall, and ties it together with a transnational criminal coverup. The result is one of the most engrossing novels of the year. Grant’s work reminds us why the novel form can be both beautiful and ribald, literary and popular. I had such a wonderful time talking to Grant about how families inevitably disappoint, and how great writers can show how they manage to love each other despite themselves.\nGrant Recommends:\n\nEmma Straub, This Time Tomorrow\n\n\nRumaan Alam, Leave the World Behind\n\n\nJennifer Close, Marrying the Ketchups\n\n\nAntoine Wilson, Mouth to Mouth\n\n\n﻿\n﻿Chris Holmes is Chair of Literatures in English and Associate Professor at Ithaca College. He writes criticism on contemporary global literatures. His book, Kazuo Ishiguro as World Literature, is under contract with Bloomsbury Publishing. He is the co-director of The New Voices Festival, a celebration of work in poetry, prose, and playwriting by up-and-coming young writers.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
