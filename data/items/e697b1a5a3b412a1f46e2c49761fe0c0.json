  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we have a real treat for you! In our final episode in the Obedience series we’re bringing you a talk from Elisabeth Elliot—a message to challenge and encourage all of us. She asks questions like “whose agenda are you following?” and “how do I respond when I feel like God isn’t supplying my needs?” If you wonder if God has forgotten you, withheld good things from you, or you want to trust his promises more, this talk is for you. Elisabeth lived through many difficulties, unanswered prayers, life on the mission field as a single mom, and she even outlived two husbands. Her words are a kind reminder that you can never drift beyond God’s love and care.</span> ____ <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re so thankful for</span> <a href=\"http://www.crossway.org/risenmotherhood\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ESV Single Column Journaling Bible®, Artist Series</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this mini-series possible!</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">This collection of journaling Bibles celebrates the treasure of God’s word through the artistic talents of his people.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each artist offers a visual entry point focused on a biblical theme or passage, all designed to help readers engage with the Bible.</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Head to</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/articles/special-offers-for-risen-motherhood-listeners/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their website</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to view the beautiful covers and order your copy.
