  "description": "<p>Whenever John Maxwell is asked who his mentors are, his dad, Melvin is at the top of the list. Melvin’s leadership in John’s life set the example and helped shaped John into the man he is today. As some of you may know, Melvin Maxwell passed away on July 4th, 2020 at the age of ninety-eight.</p> <p>So, to honor Melvin, John Maxwell is sharing a 4-part series on the lessons that he learned from his dad throughout his life. Melvin’s legacy lives on through those he’s impacted both directly and indirectly. As a podcast listener, you certainly have been impacted by Melvin through John’s leadership.
