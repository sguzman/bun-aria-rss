  "description": "<p>On May 3, 2017, 22-year-old Akia Eggleston was seen in Baltimore, Maryland on surveillance video withdrawing money from her bank account. She was 8 months pregnant with her second child and was unable to drive or even walk more than a short distance because her pregnancy was considered high-risk. After this bank transaction, Akia was never seen again. She was preparing to move to a new apartment and was planning her baby shower where she would share the gender of her baby with those she loved. Akia had two-year-old daughter, a son on the way, and her whole life in front of her. What happened to Akia after this bank transaction on May 3?</p><p>If you have any information about Akia’s disappearance, you can call the Baltimore Police Department&nbsp;at 443-984-7385 or 410-396-2100. You can leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at 866-756-2587. Alternatively, you can contact the FBI at 410-265-8080.</p><p>UPDATE: In February of 2022, the father of Akia's unborn child, Michael Robertson, was arrested for the murder of Akia and her unborn son. This story is still developing, and we hope to bring you an update in the future.</p><p>You can follow Akia’s story on social media at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1661944483845934/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Missing Akia Eggleston</a></p><p>Special thanks to Claudia Rivero and Rosemary Rade.
