  "title": "Episode 252: Charles Schmid \"The Pied Piper of Tucson\"",
  "description": "For our second episode this week, Ash brings us the case of Charles Schmid aka the Pied Piper of Tucson. This case, dare we say, may be one of the wildest rides we’ve brought you along for in quite some time. Charles was really a vibe in the 60’s, at least according to the youths of the day. He would change his appearance quite drastically when he turned 18 and it was at that moment he became a hot commodity. However, he was one of the most evil, callous assholes on the planet. He was responsible for the deaths of three young girls, one being his girlfriend at the time, and some say there’s a fourth victim.
