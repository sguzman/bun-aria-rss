Everywhere where there are statistics on same-sex divorce it is the same sex doing the bulk of the divorcing. Tim Harford discusses why this may be with Marina Ashdade, economist at Canada’s Vancouver School of Economics and author of “Dirty Money”, a book which applies economic ideas to the study of sex and love. \n\nProducer: Ruth Alexander \n\nImage: Same-sex wedding cake toppers Credit: Lucas Schifres/Getty Images",
