    "media:description": "Topos Institute Colloquium, 27th of October 2022.\n———\nMathematical information is essential for technical work, but its creation, interpretation, and search are challenging. In the hopes of helping users locate mathematical information more easily, multimodal retrieval models and search interfaces that support both formulas and text have been developed.\n\nIn this talk we will start by discussing some differences between the information needs and search behaviors of mathematical experts vs. non-experts. We will then examine techniques used for retrieving math formulas, and math-aware search engines that support queries containing both formulas and text. Finally, we will consider future research directions for math-aware search, including tasks involving Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mathematical texts.",
