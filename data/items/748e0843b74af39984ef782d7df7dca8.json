  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our lords and masters in the CDC and the White House have given us new COVID guidelines. In their benevolence, they are now allowing us to walk outside and even have picnics without masks, if we’re vaccinated. Also Five Headlines, including outrage over a bill in Idaho that bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and outrage over a video of Wayne LaPierre killing an elephant. There seems to be an interesting contrast between these two stories. Plus, Justin Bieber is accused of cultural appropriation for wearing dreadlocks. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the claims that there is systemic racism against black NFL players. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
