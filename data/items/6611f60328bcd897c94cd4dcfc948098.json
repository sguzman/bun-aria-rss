  "description": "Jean Hopman’s book Surviving Emotional Work for Teachers: Improving Wellbeing and Professional Learning Through Reflexive Practice (Routledge, 2020), is a guide to improving teachers' wellbeing and practice through support of their emotional workload. The book argues that teachers should be given a formal opportunity to debrief on challenging events, allowing them to reflect on and reframe these experiences in a way that informs future practice to prevent the emotional fatigue that can lead teachers to leave the field altogether.\nEach chapter opens with a teacher's story, acknowledging the emotional layers present in the scenario and what learnings can be drawn from it. This is valuable reading for teachers at all stages of their career, whether preparing for the complex work ahead or making sense of past and current experiences. This book offers a reflexive process that teachers and schools can implement to facilitate the useful exploration of their emotion, a process vital for the overall wellbeing of any school.\nDr Jean Hopman works in Initial Teacher Education at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia. Her doctoral work explored the emotional aspects of teaching by exploring the underlying layers of a teacher's role. She initially completed a Bachelor of Primary and Secondary Education and a Graduate Diploma in Child Psychotherapy Studies. Since 2000 she has taught and counselled in diverse educational settings, including government schools, private schools, international schools, alternative education settings and universities.\nDiscount for listeners: Save 30% on Surviving Emotional Work for Teachers when you purchase here by entering PBC30at the checkout.
