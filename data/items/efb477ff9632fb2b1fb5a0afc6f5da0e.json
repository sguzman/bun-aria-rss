  "description": "<p>In this episode Doug announces the iTunes review contest winners (yes, a little late) and Sal & Justin console Adam after he reads a very personal (and not so glowing) review. They also take on your questions and explain why some body parts grow more quickly and why others seem growth-resistant, how the man of few words (Justin) became a super-star salesman, what to do when a client has body image issues and solutions (maybe) for a PumpHead who visits the refrigerator while he is asleep. If you were announced as a winner of the iTunes review contest send us a message on Instagram @mindpump with your address and shirt size and we will send you out a Mind Pump shirt! (We have S, M, L, XL only). Also, please subscribe, rate and review the show if you haven't already. This helps Mind Pump stay up in the rankings on iTunes which allows other people to discover Raw Fitness Truth.</p>",
