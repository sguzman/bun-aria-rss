It’s a simple fact, yet so many of us don’t think twice about how the ingredients in our favorite skin care products, such as shampoo, sunscreen, lotion, and insect repellent, affect our health. Even small amounts of toxic ingredients in skin products can add up and contribute to endocrine disorders, heart disease, cancer, and a range of other illnesses.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman talks to Dr. Cindy Geyer about why it’s important to take a good look at what we put on our skin. They discuss the dangers of ingredients such as parabens and phthalates, which can disrupt hormones, as well as how Dr. Hyman detoxes his body, where to find out how safe your favorite products are, and much more.</p><br><p>Dr. Cindy Geyer received her Bachelor of Science and her Doctor of Medicine degrees, with honors, from the Ohio State University. She completed residency in internal medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. and is triple board certified in internal medicine, integrative medicine, and lifestyle medicine. She joined The Ultrawellness Center in 2021 after practicing and serving as the medical director at Canyon Ranch for 23 years. She has served on the Board of Directors for the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and is a recently elected fellow of ACLM. Dr. Geyer has been a core faculty member at The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) for 20 years, teaching physicians and other healthcare professionals how to use food and lifestyle to address health concerns in their own lives and those of their patients. A clinician, educator, and avid hiker, she is passionate about collaborative approaches to health and wellness: from the integrative team model in working with individual patients, to community partnerships that together can affect healthy changes in the places people live and work.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Rupa Health and HigherDOSE.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
