  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is not ready to let the HBO hit piece on Barstool Sports go. He returns for day two with extensive research on Bryant Gumbel's reported history of sexually harassing female co-workers -- and even dangling dead mice in their faces. Minihane sympathizes with Portnoy's disappointment in the NYC crew's attire at the Barstool Awards. After the hilarious stand-up comedy performance Blind Mike delivered on Wednesday, Minihane forces him to prepare his own original routine for tomorrow. Hilarity will ensue. Maybe. Minihane reacts to the first Democratic presidential debate. He was not impressed -- but then again, he can't remember the last time he was. Minihane talks about Bob Kraft's alleged handy plus new faux outrage in Boston media. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
