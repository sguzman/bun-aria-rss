  "description": "<p>This has to be one of my favorite conversations date because we really WENT THERE. What it *actually* means to integrate your divine feminine, the full spectrum of your pleasure, rage, passion, grief, all of it. We talk about the path of descension, rather than ascension, and tuning into sensations where there was once numbness. We bring it back to what really matters- creating a world we all want to be part of, where all beings are free, expressed and honored, and manifesting beyond the material. We speak about massive choices we are faced with today and how to tune back into your body’s wisdom for the answer. We also dive into living in community, reconnecting with the land, and mobilizing the people for a collective evolution. This is a POWERFUL conversation that the world deeply needs right now and beyond excited to share it with you.</p> <p>Join my FREE 5-Day Rose Gold Goddess Challenge August 16-20 to embody your Divine Feminine Radiance at www.rosegoldgoddesses.com</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at:<br /> Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose<br /> Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books: www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
