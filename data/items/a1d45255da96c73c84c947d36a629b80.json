  "description": "<p>Today is the day, folks! Our very own Erin Keif (professionally known as Sharon Beef) is turning the big 3-0! And how are we celebrating her? Well, it's a riddle podcast so we'll probably be doing that. Is it a great birthday? No. But this is the real world. It's filthy and it's awful and every day is riddles (which we love) and that's just how it is. Oh, and we've got a lost cause who just might pull through, a quest to find the right words, a corpse with some unfinished business and the greatest prank in the history of the show!
