  "description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who trained at Stanford University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to “back-cast” their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk. Dr. Attia details various supplementation, nutrition, exercise and prescription approaches useful to people in every decade of life to improve vitality, reduce their risk of disease and increase the number of years sustaining peak cognitive and physical health. \nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Assessing Health Status & Improving Vitality \n(00:02:51) Momentous Supplements \n(00:03:46) Thesis, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep \n(00:07:29) Lifespan: Bloodwork & Biomarkers Testing, The “4 Horseman of Disease” \n(00:11:51) Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States \n(00:13:59) Blood Testing: Best Frequency \n(00:16:01) DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis \n(00:22:33) Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training, Corticosteroids \n(00:29:24) Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training\n(00:31:03) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:32:16) Back-casting: Defining Your “Marginal Decade” \n(00:38:31) All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max \n(00:44:43) Attia’s Rule of Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals\n(00:49:24) Importance of Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours \n(00:55:23) Nicotine & Cognitive Focus\n(01:03:12) Menstruation, PMS & Menopause \n(01:10:10) Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk\n(01:22:06) Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies in Women\n(01:26:35) Hormone Replacement Therapy in Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin\n(01:37:23) Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG\n(01:47:46) Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin \n(01:52:06) Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility \n(01:59:26) Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone\n(02:02:51) Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B\n(02:17:42) Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Other Cholesterol Prescriptions \n(02:25:15) Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk \n(02:28:53) Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury Rehabilitation \n(02:37:40) Metabolomics & Exercise \n(02:40:44) GLP-1 & Weight Loss \n(02:47:06) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
