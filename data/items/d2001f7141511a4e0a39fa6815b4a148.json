  "description": "Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks discuss the San Francisco 49ers and its strategy with the 3rd overall draft pick. They look into whether or not 49ers general manager John Lynch should take Alabama quarterback Mac Jones or another available quarterback such as North Dakota State University's Trey Lance or Ohio State's Justin Fields. The duo debate what would work best in head coach Kyle Shanahan’s offense (0:42). Next, DJ and Bucky discuss the Atlanta Falcons and their plan with the pick 4th overall pick. The two debate over whether the team should select a quarterback to succeed Matt Ryan or if general manager Terry Fontenot and company should take University of Florida tight end Kyle Pitts to maximize head coach Arthur Smith's new offense. The duo also discusses if Kyle Pitts is worthy of a top five pick (13:43). After that, the two debate drafting a top tier lineman or wide receiver in round one and which position will be more widely available on day two. Next, the duo discuss whether the Cincinnati Bengals should take Oregon tackle Penei Sewell or reunite quarterback Joe Burrow with former LSU teammate Ja'Marr Chase (22:50). The two also talk draft week rumors and DJ’s final big board (33:32). To end the show, the duo discuss DJ’s beloved San Diego Padres and their recent play against the division rival Los Angeles Dodgers (38:00).
