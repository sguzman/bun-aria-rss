  "content": "<p>RSiteCatalyst version 1.4.2 is now available on CRAN. This update was primarily bug fixes with one additional feature added.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Fixed QueueRanked function to allow multiple SAINT classifications to be specified. This allows for breaking down a SAINT classification with another SAINT classification, such as breaking down tracking codes by marketing channel and by campaign</li>\n  <li>Fixed bug in internal function, to allow for using the same element multiple times in a QueueRanked function call. This was a necessary fix for allowing multiple SAINT classifications in #1</li>\n  <li>Exported previous internal function <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">SubmitJsonQueueReport</code> to allow for submitting JSON requests directly to the Adobe Analytics API without all of the R function scaffolding. This approximates the same functionality as the <a href=\"https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/get-started/api-explorer\">Adobe API Explorer</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For the most part, this isn’t a release that most people will notice any differences from version 1.4.1. That said, special thanks go out to Jason Morgan (<a href=\"https://github.com/framingeinstein\">@framingeinstein</a>) for identifying the two bugs that were fixed AND submitting fixes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"feature-requestsbugs\">Feature Requests/Bugs</h2>\n\n<p>As always, if you come across bugs or have feature requests, please continue to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues\">RSiteCatalyst GitHub Issues</a> page to submit issues. Don’t worry about cluttering up the page with tickets, please fill out a new issue for anything you encounter (with code you’ve already tried and is failing), unless you are SURE that it is the same problem someone else is facing.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, like I end every blog post about RSiteCatalyst, please note that <strong>I’m</strong> <strong>not an Adobe employee</strong>. Please don’t send me your API credentials, expect immediate replies (especially for you e-commerce folks sweating the holiday season!) or ask to set up phone calls to troubleshoot your problems. This is open-source software…Willem Paling and I did the hard part writing it, you’re expected to support yourself as best as possible unless you believe you’re encountering a bug. Then use GitHub.</p>"
