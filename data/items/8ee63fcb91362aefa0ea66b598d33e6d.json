  "description": "Today we’ve got Adam, Jess’s husband on the podcast who will be interviewing her, which we have been wanting to do for a while, but haven’t been able to until now because Sue just had a baby and will be away for a bit. Adam has a very good understanding of construction and the quality of how and why things are made a certain way, and Jess has a great eye for design, so blending them together is always entertaining and some of the secret sauce to everything. <br /><br />What it was like when they started 5:21<br />Some of the roles played when starting 9:26<br />Do you recommend working with your spouse? 16:13<br />The first market they went to 19:00<br />Who Jess likes to surround herself with 23:51 <br />How the vision has changed 31:09<br />The hardest part of running this business over the years 36:15<br />Getting Jess to be the face 38:38<br />Quick questions 42:18<br />How has this business affected our family? 48:02<br /><br />“Something that you really, really latch onto, and maybe the question is ‘where did this come from?’ but it’s your communication skills. Like when you’re working with a client, when you’re with a friend, or whatever, I’m always so impressed by how it goes beyond the surface and you really want to understand their needs and their wants, and how this piece is going to function within their home and not that it just looks pretty. I think a lot of people can build off a lot of pretty things, but will it last over time? And will it continue to be pretty and functional, and serve people’s needs.” 27:52<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
