  "description": "The U.S. government has charged seven men in relation to hundreds of cyber attacks against organizations in the U.S. and multiple other countries in Asia and Europe. Two of the men, who were based in Malaysia, were arrested and their extradition to the U.S. has been requested. The other five are based in China and remain at large.\nThe attacks were attributed to a China-linked organization dubbed APT41 and involved a combination of intellectual property theft and financially motivated cyber crime. While some of our peers monitor APT41 as a single operation, Symantec regards it as two distinct actors: Grayfly and Blackfly.\nJoining us in this week's Research Saturday to discuss the research from Symantec's Threat Hunter Team is Jon DiMaggio.\nThe research can be found here: \nAPT41: Indictments Put Chinese Espionage Group in the Spotlight",
