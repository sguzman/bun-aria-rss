  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys are on OBJ Watch as Odell Beckham Jr. makes his decision on which team he'll sign with after being reported that the Packers, Chiefs, Saints, and Patriots are all contenders, what all the latest speculation with that is, where OBJ would fit best, and everything else going on in the NFL as we approach week 10 of the season. Joining the program for his weekly segment, Coach Us Up Chuck, is the former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano. Pat, Chuck, and AJ chat about how teams are looking into OBJ right now, and what adding a player like that can do to a locker room both positively and negatively if it isn't the right situation, how difficult it is to win in the NFL week in and week out and if you can tell during the week that a team is potentially going to lay an egg, what it's like interacting with an owner on Monday in the building after a loss and how many coaches have to deal with a large amount of input from the owner, and what he thinks of the taunting situation with Cassius Marsh (35:18-1:12:44). Later, cohost of the weekly DanZues Power Rankings on NFL Network, cohost of the Petros & Money Show, Play-By-Play Commentator for the Los Angeles Chargers, Matt \"Money\" Smith joins the show to chat about what it's like being a part of the battle for supremacy in LA right now, his thoughts on Justin Herbert, how much flack Dan Hanzus takes for his weekly power rankings, doing a livestream for the NFL with Pat during the combine a couple of years ago, and everything else going on in the NFL right now (1:12:46-1:33:39).
