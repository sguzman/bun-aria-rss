  "title": "Ep 562 | Jase Has Multiple Birthdays Because the Internet Lies & Phil Hates the Rising Crime",
  "description": "Jase says the truth is a difficult thing to know, especially for famous people. Just take the fact that, according to the internet, he has one birthday, but it's different from his ACTUAL birthday. So every year, he has birthday messages on both days. Jase tells Al he should just cut off his injured finger — and what a great sermon illustration that would be, right?  \nPhil is sure he's never seen this much crime, not just in the country, but in the world — and Jase says this is because the population is the highest it's ever been. Al says the unforgivable sin is to deny that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one. You can't separate Jesus from good. You can't separate Satan from evil. Jase cautions against anyone calling something that is obviously sinful behavior \"justified\" and \"good\" — that's a dangerous place to be! \n\nSign up to watch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed\n\nVisit https://www.40daysforlife.com/ to get the free quarterly magazine, podcast, and updates from 40 Days for Life. \n\nhttps://coveyes.com/phil to try Covenant Eyes FREE for 30 days when you use promo code PHIL. \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
