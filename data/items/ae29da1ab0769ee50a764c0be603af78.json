Jolene declines even though she craves a creative project.  Lynda apologises to Lilian about her insensitivity when she discovered the message in the bottle was from Tony.  Lilian admits it was hard reading that Tony wished their parents would stop arguing.  It reminded her how unsafe she felt at home as a child.  When Lynda points out that she and her siblings have all made a success of their lives, Lilian agrees.  But she can’t remember if Tony ever got his wish of a guitar for Christmas.  She’ll investigate and if there’s a chance of granting Tony’s wish, then she wants to try.\nLeonard visits Ben to offer support but Ben says he finished with Beth, so he doesn’t deserve to be heartbroken.  Leonard decides the best thing is to take Ben to the Bull for a meal.   Vince appears and spying Ben, tells him he’s a coward and a cheat.  Ben seduced Chelsea, got her pregnant and packed her off for an abortion and then threw Beth on the street.  Jolene intervenes and asks Vince to leave. Afterwards Jolene apologises to Tracy for believing the rumours that Tracy was pregnant when all the time it was Chelsea. When Tracy worries about word getting around the village, Jolene is reassuring saying she thinks it was just her and Leonard who were close enough to hear.  Tracy hopes Jolene is right.",
