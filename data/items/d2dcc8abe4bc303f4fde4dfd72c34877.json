  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Jesus told us to “not judge,” but what does that really mean? In a special segment called “Christian Asks...” normally only available to Holy Post’s Patreon supporters, Skye and Christian discuss what it means to live with discernment but not judgment in a pluralistic culture. While talking about capital punishment, gay marriage, and immigration, they unpack why fundamentalism on both the right and left is so appealing, and why we must avoid both. Also this week—a new parody movie called “Faith-Based” has the crew asking what makes something “faith-based”? And does overlooking Trump’s immorality while condemning Bill Clinton’s make white evangelicals hypocritical Christians or faithful Republicans?</p>",
