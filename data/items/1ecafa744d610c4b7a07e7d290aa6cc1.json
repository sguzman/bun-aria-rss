  "description": "<p>How do you understand and organize information in a way that makes it memorable and accessible?</p> <p>The goal here at Kwik Brain isn’t simply to get you reading, remembering, and learning faster. It’s to help you increase your productivity by understanding what you’re learning. But what does it mean to understand something? And how do you know whether you truly understand it or not?</p> <p>In today’s episode, I’m going to go deeper into this topic by reading from Richard Saul Wurman’s new book, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Understanding Understanding</em>. Richard has written over 90 books on everything from information to architecture, but he’s most well-known for creating the TED conference, so he knows a lot about ideas, understanding, and how to share them.</p> <p>Listen in as I read an excerpt that’s going to set up the framework for what it means to understand something. From there, I’m going to give you five tips on how to organize information for better focus, retention, and understanding.</p> <p>*** If you’re inspired, I want to invite you to join me in my brand NEW 7-day course, specifically designed to boost your confidence. I know it sounds too good to be true, but I give you step-by-step guides using the accelerated learning model to make you unstoppable in a short time.
