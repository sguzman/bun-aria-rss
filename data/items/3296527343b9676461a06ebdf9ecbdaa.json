  "description": "<p>This episode I sneak off to record as my in-laws visit. How do we know if we are upset about something that happened today vs something that happened ages ago? Something tells me staying up all night obsessing over it is an indicator...We saw a lady with enormous hangers at dinner. Should she wear a bra????? Am I a sexist pig for demanding it? I answer emails - how do you know you've found the right therapist? How does one deal with anxiety? Should I send my kid to Catholic School even though I'm not Catholic? All this and more, GET YOUR LIFE!</p>\n",
