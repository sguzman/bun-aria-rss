Instead, emphasize the agency and solutions of working-class women. </strong>Community leaders shared how often when a source is quoted in a story, they’re not described in the way they see themselves: as a worker with power and a plan for how to upend inequitable systems. By sharing the demands of workers and their analysis of issues, reporters can shift the narrative and honor the joy and dignity people find in their work. </li><li><strong>Invest in relationships by taking care with sources before and after the story.</strong> There is <a href=\"https://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu/why-should-i-tell-you-a-guide-to-less-extractive-reporting/\">a duty of care to sources</a>, especially those from marginalized communities. Ongoing relationship building like reporters do with politicians and CEOs should be extended to workers and community leaders as well.</li><li><strong>Build transparency into your reporting process—it builds trust with readers and sources. </strong>Without transparency, sources don’t understand why certain quotes are chosen or how it’s possible to talk for an hour or maybe not get a quote in a piece at all. Being clear about the limitations you face as a reporter, and how you see the purpose of the story, can help set clear expectations with sources.</li><li><strong>Rethink who you consider an expert and value the expertise that comes from lived experience. </strong>Who gets listed as a potential expert, who gets media training, who is a part of institutions of power, these are all influenced by underlying systems of oppression and gatekeepers. But who knows better about the needs of working-class women than those women themselves? Treat that personal experience as an expertise as valuable as a credential or title. Prepare to speak with those workers the same way as with a CEO, think tank analyst, or academic—doing homework on the relevant landscape, asking what <em>they</em> think the problems and solutions are. Simply: treat workers as the protagonists of their own stories.</li><li><strong>Connect the dots between working women’s lived experiences and the structural causes of those experiences,</strong>” as one community leader suggested. Reporting that situates the experiences of individual workers within larger systems helps readers better understand the factors facing working women and breaks out of an oversimplified hero and villain narrative. </li></ol>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"evolving-your-journalistic-practice\"><strong>Evolving your journalistic practice</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>The depth and detail of these discussions generated so many ideas to immediately put into practice in reporting. Here’s recordings if you would like to dive into the full conversations!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/e5RFhTrOMBg\"><strong>Feedback Loop</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Get feedback from community leaders in the field on how news portrays working-class women. Learn what news coverage authentically represents this community and what coverage is exhaustive and extractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Making News Coverage of Working Class Women More Community Centered (Panel 1: Feedback Loop)\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5RFhTrOMBg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a few months, we’re going to follow up with journalist participants to see how or whether these conversations did influence their practice.
