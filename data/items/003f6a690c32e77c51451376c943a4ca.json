  "description": "<p>Rick returns for part two as we deep dive into Sasquatch, UFO’s and the Paranormal. Timothy Renner from Strange Familiars Podcast joins the discussion. Are there correlations or coincidences?</p> <p>Rick writes “I’m a regular listener to your podcast and find it very informative. On one of your recent shows, I believe you mentioned getting a Ufologist, Paranormal Researcher, and Cryptid Investigator together in order to compare notes on the potential similarities/ connections within all three fields.</p> <p>During my tenure with MUFON, I investigated many sightings to include the abduction phenomenon. I found that many of those cases had elements of the paranormal associated with them, which intrigued me. I then began investigating the paranormal with the Center for Paranormal Research and Investigation (CPRI), also in Virginia. I’ve investigated many cases. Some involved negative entities or the “demonic”. One of these cases was featured on an episode of “A Haunting” entitled “Mark of Evil”. That was a rather serious/ horrific case that changed my life dramatically.</p> <p>I’m still with that organization. However, my wife and I also started the Virginia chapter of the North American Dogman Project (NADP). We’ve been investigating Dogman/ cryptid cases for the past five years. During my research, I’ve seen some cases that have “crossover elements” to them.”</p>",
