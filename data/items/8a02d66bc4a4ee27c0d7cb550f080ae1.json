  "title": "Ep 110 | The Trans Activism That Will End Your Parental Rights | Abigail Shrier | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "There’s a new “reality” spreading, and the mere act of questioning it is incredibly dangerous. Just ask Wall Street Journal investigative journalist Abigail Shrier. Her book, “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” exposes the radical gender activism that — just like critical race theory — has overtaken our children’s schools and culture. But even worse, Shrier argues it could end your parental rights for good. She is by no means “anti-trans,” but simply speaking up against the extremes of this new “reality” has made her enemy number one to the activists. Recently, the American Booksellers Association even called sending her book to others “a serious, violent incident.” Abigail joins Glenn to lay out just how slippery this slope has proven to be and what we — conservatives and liberals — must do to protect our children.\n\nSponsor:\n\nBuilt Bar - Staying healthy is tough, especially if you have a sweet tooth. Fortunately, there are Built Bars! They’re made with real chocolate, high in protein, low in calories and carbs, and taste exactly like a candy bar.
