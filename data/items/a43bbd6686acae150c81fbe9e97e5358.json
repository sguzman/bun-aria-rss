  "description": "<p>Listen to electronic music from as far back as the 1970’s, along with brand new music from Tyondai Braxton for this New Sounds. Tyondai Braxton is an American composer and multi-instrumentalist who has recorded for both Warp Records and Nonesuch. (He's also the former guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist of the band Battles, which he co-founded.) On his latest album \"HIVE1,\" which was originally a multimedia sound installation, combinations of electronic skitterings, distorted casino/pachinko parlor-esque bleepings and cartoony sproings are at times anchored by percussive pulses, and at others interrupted and accented with a wide battery of percussive elements. The record takes modern electronic dance music into the laboratory for some late night experiments with (or on) animated characters, and we’ll hear its jubilant closing track, “Scout 1.”</p>\n<p>There’s also music by electronic music pioneer Laurie Spiegel. Back in the 1970’s, she figured out how to meld Americana roots music into the electronic realm. Listen to her banjo-inspired music for electronics, a three-part work “Appalachian Grove,” from a collection of her early works, called “the Expanding Universe.” Plus, hear electronic music from film composer Thomas Newman (WALL-E, Shawshank Redemption, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) and Los Angeles-based composer and multi-instrumentalist Rick Cox from their collaboration, “35 Whirlpools Below Sound.” And more. </p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3737– Electronic Music Survey (First aired on 06/10/2015)             </p>\n<table width=\"95%\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>ARTIST(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>RECORDING</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CUT(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SOURCE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thomas Newman; Rick Cox</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>35 Whirlpools Below Sound</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ashland Schine, excerpt [1:00]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cold Blue / Cold Blue Music - #40<br><a href=\"http://www.coldbluemusic.com/pages/CB0040.html\" target=\"_blank\">coldbluemusic.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Laurie Spiegel</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Expanding Universe</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Appalachian Grove I [5:23]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Unseen Worlds UW 09<br><a href=\"http://www.unseenworlds.net/\">unseenworlds.net</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tyondai Braxton</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hive1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Scout 1 [9:27]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nonesuch 547466</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/hive1\" target=\"_blank\">nonesuch.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Laurie Spiegel</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Expanding Universe</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Appalachian Grove II [7:56]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Unseen Worlds UW 09<br><a href=\"http://www.unseenworlds.net/\">unseenworlds.net</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thomas Newman; Rick Cox</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>35 Whirlpools Below Sound</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ashland Schine [7:18]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cold Blue / Cold Blue Music - #40<br><a href=\"http://www.coldbluemusic.com/pages/CB0040.html\" target=\"_blank\">coldbluemusic.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Alain Thibault (Montreal Saxophone Quartet)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Volt</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>ELVIS (electro-lux vertige illimite synthetique) [13:57 ]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imedia 9003<br><a href=\"http://www.electrocd.com/en/cat/imed_9003/\">www.electrocd.com</a> has all details.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Laurie Spiegel</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Expanding Universe</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Appalachian Grove III, excerpt  [3:00]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Unseen Worlds UW 09<br><a href=\"http://www.unseenworlds.net/\">unseenworlds.net</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>",
