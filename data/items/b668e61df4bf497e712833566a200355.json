  "description": "<p>We interview John about <em>Seeing Things As They Are</em> (2015). What is perception? Searle says that it's not a matter of seeing a representation, which is then related to things in the real world. We see the actual objects, with no mediation. But then how can there be illusions? Well, it's complicated, but not too complicated, just some funny terminology that this episode will teach you.</p> <p>Searle lays out his theory for us and amusingly dismisses much of the history of philosophy in the first half, and then Mark, Wes, and Dylan continue the discussion to make sure we understood what was just said and chase down some threads of the conversation.</p> <p>End song: \"Flesh and Blood\" from The MayTricks' <a href= \"http://marklint.com/HappySongsAlbum.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><em>Happy Songs Will Bring You Down</em></a> (1994).</p> <p>We interview John about <em>Seeing Things As They Are</em> (2015).
