  "description": "<p><em><strong>Can We Have Unity Amidst Opposing Ideologies?</strong></em> Dr. Gombis drops in to revisit a conversation on unity in the Church. We're one year removed from the events of January 6th at the Capital. As people within the Church continue to polarize, can we find unity with folks who have ideologies we radically disagree with? Are there two sides? What are we to do with doctrine or beliefs that have been made hollow? Where is the point to break communion? How are we to conduct ourselves within a polarized community? Are we to call out racism, misogyny and nationalism that uses the Lord's name in vain? It's a difficult topic.</p>\n<p>First, Mike and Tim respond to a few more emails of listeners experiences with Christmas being demonized.</p>\n<p>The Michael Heiser podcast episode on Christmas that was referenced is perhaps <a href=\"https://nakedbiblepodcast.com/podcast/naked-bible-195-is-christmas-a-pagan-holiday/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>‘Shoutin’ in the Fire,’ by Danté Stewart, the book referenced by Gombis, can be found <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672938/shoutin-in-the-fire-by-dante-stewart/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
