  "description": "On The Best of Mark Levin, the Biden administration response has been awful, telling Putin everything they will or won't do with Iran while withholding information from Congress. This is very serious and President Biden will not open the spigot to our oil in Alaska or sanction Russian oil. This is why Biden will not open America's economy or industrial might. He is selling out to the Russians, Iranians, and using the Russians as the middlemen to negotiate a deal with Iran. That's what's taking place, and they're worried about what Lindsey Graham says about Putin. Biden has made the world extremely dangerous through his ideologies and incompetent buffoons he surrounds himself with. There are Putin apologists or American Fascists among us that support the pulverization of Ukraine by Russia. No one wants to send your kids off to war; we have an all-volunteer military and no one has been drafted to serve. It's obvious that the Ukrainians want to fight but don't have the weapons to do it. Will Putin stop his onslaught on Ukraine? Russia has sent hit squads like the Wagner Group and mercenaries from Chechnya to take out Zelensky. President Biden's weakness got us here and \"peace through strength\" will get us out. The U.S is now considering offering Poland a swap of F-29 fighter jets so they can donate some of their Mig fighter planes to the Ukrainians. The U.S can't afford to ignore Putin's aggression. President Biden should have taken the lead early on, yet he continues to wait and just keeps announcing new sanctions that should have been in place already. The United States can crush Russia's economy if Biden would actually take action on serious sanctions and arm the Ukrainian people.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
