  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Before the 2020 election, many self-identified “prophets” within the charismatic movement decalred God had revealed to them that Donald Trump would win. Millions of followers believed them. How are they now reconciling their divine revelations with reality? The Holy Post crew looks at another failed prophecy in the 1840s that changed American Christianity. Also this week, Phil deputizes Mike Erre as his pastor to determine whether his sarcastic response to a Twitter critic violated Jesus’ command against judging others. And sociologist Joshua Packard talks with Skye about a comprehensive new study on the faith of Generation Z, and why few churches are prepared to engage them.
