  "description": "Approximately 23 million families in the US got a pet during the pandemic, many of them puppies. At their best, dogs truly are “man’s best friend,” providing real comfort and companionship. But it can be tough when your new dog isn’t adapting as well as you’d hoped. Whether it’s excessive barking, aggression towards strangers or just not getting along with family members—a difficult dog can rock your confidence and make you feel resentful. On this episode of How To!, the first in a two-part series on difficult dogs, we meet famous inventor and YouTuber, Simone Giertz, and her yap-happy pup, Scraps. Simone shares her triumphs and failures with renowned dog trainer Denise Fenzi and they commiserate on the best way to teach a dog some much-needed new tricks. \nIf you liked this episode, check out: “How To Get Your Dog to Stop Eating Your Daughters’ Underwear With Jenny Slate.” \nDo you have a question with no easy answers?
