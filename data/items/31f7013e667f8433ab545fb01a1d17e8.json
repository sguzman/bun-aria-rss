This was absolutely insane.\nPatreon (Plugin): https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Text Me - 407-214-5333\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nWe haven't decided on a name for this, but if this video gets 2 million likes we will consider doing a rematch! This video is a different rendition of our normal challenges, where there are two hunters trying to kill me while we have random items.\n\nWe can break blocks, but they don't drop items. There is a 1000x1000 border. Every two minutes we each get a completely random item. We can't pick up each others items.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to survive, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a battle, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftRandomItemChallenge",
