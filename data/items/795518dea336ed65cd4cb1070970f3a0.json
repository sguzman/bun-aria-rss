  "description": "<p>Henry Ford was more than just an inventor. He was a collector and by the 1920s, he had amassed one of the largest collections of Americana in the world. He decided to display his collection at a museum in Dearborn, Michigan and the plan he laid out featured two separate facilities, one indoor and one outdoor. The indoor facility would tell the story of man's innovation and the outdoor museum would be a village about history. Today, we know this location as the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. On this episode, we are joined by our listener Bridget Schlack who worked at the museum for a number of years. She will share with us the types of items that are a part of the collection and she will also share some things that are unique in this collection. Some items seem to have attachments to them and this has led to stories of haunting experiences, some of which Bridget has experienced herself. The Moment in Oddity features 1000 Japanese soldiers decimated by crocodiles and This Month in History features SCOTUS striking down laws against interracial marriage. Our location was suggested by listeners Bridget Schlack and Emily Ridener.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pics can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/06/hgb-ep-207-henry-ford-museum-and.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/06/hgb-ep-207-henry-ford-museum-and.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and get bonus content and gear: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:<br /> <br /> Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)<br /> <br /> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>",
