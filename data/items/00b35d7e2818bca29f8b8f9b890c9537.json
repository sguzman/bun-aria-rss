  "description": "<p>Chet Holmgren is out for the year (00:02:37-00:07:41). We start the show as our last remote show of the summer. Mt Rushmore of things that are cooler in slow motion back in studio almost tears the whole show apart (00:22:14-00:41:20) . Mark Wahlberg joins the show to talk about his new movie Me Time, working out, football and more (00:43:08-01:10:40). We finish the show with Fyre Fest of the week(01:10:38-01:24:02).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
