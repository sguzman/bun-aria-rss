  "description": "Alistair briefs Paul before taking him to Berrow to observe routine checks and talk to the staff. He forewarns Paul that Martyn Gibson needs careful handling; Paul’s chat might need to be more measured. All seems to be going well until Alistair notices some unpleasant asides from Martyn, who declares he’d prefer Alistair to check the pigs. It would be best all round if Paul doesn’t work with Berrow. Alistair challenges Martyn on his attitude, asking if Paul’s flamboyant behaviour makes him uneasy. Martyn responds that it’s unnecessary, and that he’s allowed to express his opinions. Just as Paul was doing, counters Alistair. Martyn later dismisses his earlier comments as light hearted, and apologises for any offence. Paul guesses Alistair put Martyn up to this, and is appreciative. Not everyone would do that. They share a good-natured exchange, this time Alistair genuinely enjoying Paul’s chat.\n\nChelsea shows Brad some childhood playing cards their mum used give them to help them make their minds up on things. She’s used them to make her decision about the baby – she’s keeping it. Brad’s not convinced about this method. Later Chelsea tells her mum she’s changed her mind. Saying it out loud has made her realise she’s definitely not ready for a baby – one day maybe, but not now. Her decision has to be based on facts and advice, not random cards. Tracy gives her a big hug. As she makes Chelsea’s favourite mushrooms on toast, Chelsea gets Brad to bin the cards. Her mind’s made up, once and for all.",
