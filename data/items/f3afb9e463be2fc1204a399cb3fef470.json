  "description": "Stuart Gerson, former Assistant Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush White House, and Acting Attorney General under Bill Clinton, has been watching the January 6th hearings. He has concluded that the DOJ must prosecute Trump. We ask him how he came to his conclusion. Plus, it’s Steve Bannon’s turn in the barrel, as he’s convicted of slipping out on a subpoena. And in the Spiel, Donald Trump may not be able to say “yesterday,” but the spoken word is not his only means of expression.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
