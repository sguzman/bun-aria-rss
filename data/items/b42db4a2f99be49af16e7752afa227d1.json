  "description": "<p>At the corner of 4th and Main in Point Pleasant, West Virginia stands the historic Lowe Hotel. This hotel dates back to the early 1900s when it was built by two brothers. The hotel was needed to serve the heavy traffic and trade from the nearby Ohio and Kanawha rivers. Across the street from this grand structure is a peculiar statue. Rather ugly. It features a creature known as the Mothman. Point Pleasant is home to the legend of the Mothman. There are legends about the hotel as well, including many rumored hauntings, one of which might be a member of the Hatfield Family who was involved in the Battle of Matewan. Join us and our listener Katie Dunlap as we explore the history and hauntings of the Lowe Hotel and explore the legend of the Mothman! The Moment in Oddity features urine turned into beer and This Day in History features the birth of Edgar Rice Burroughs.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-146-lowe-hotel-and-mothman.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-146-lowe-hotel-and-mothman.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
