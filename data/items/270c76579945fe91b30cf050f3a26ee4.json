  "description": "<p>Imagine what it’s like to have a loved one who means that world to you… someone you’ve spent years building memories with. And suddenly, they no longer remember who you are.</p> <p>Imagine how heartbroken you’d be if a parent, friend, or the love of your life no longer recognizes your face. Sometimes memory loss take other shapes too. Maybe, they remember you, but no longer remember the time you spend with them right now. Their short-term memories simply get washed away every so often, and the person you know is no longer there.</p> <p>This is a scary situation, and I only bring it up because I truly feel there is something we can do about this. I also feel that the vast majority of people have no idea just how pervasive these situations I’ve described above are in our world today. You’ll be shocked to discover just how rapidly conditions like Alzheimer’s, dementia, and memory loss are skyrocketing to the very top of life-threatening disabilities today.</p> <p>Alzheimer’s disease isn’t just a set of heartbreaking symptoms, it’s also a sequence of physical abnormalities in the brain that takes the lives of millions of people, and those numbers are sharply on the rise.</p> <p>There’s no better person in the world to clue us all in to the current state of Alzheimer’s and other brain abnormalities than our guest today, Dr. Steven Masley. More importantly, there’s no better person who’s compiled clinically proven solutions to help end the epidemic of these brain diseases and usher in a greater world for all of us.</p> <p>Today you’re going to discover The Better Brain Solution, and how to protect yourself and your loved ones from brain diseases and cognitive decline. This is an important step in the process, and we’ve got a long way to go.
