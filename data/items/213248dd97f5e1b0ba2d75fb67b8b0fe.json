Not everyone will understand or appreciate your story.\n\n31:50 - Focus mode. Remain focused, and don't let anything make you lose track of your purpose. Distractions are just that. Side-step them and keep moving forward.\n\n35:02 - The quality of the company you keep is important. Just because you have a shared background with someone is no reason to hang around people that aren't getting the job done.

Being in the right place at the right time and in the right spirit is an invaluable experience.
