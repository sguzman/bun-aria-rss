  "description": "<p>Today we get esoteric on the things that matter most—ego, family, friendship, love, work, death, and the soul. The value of living an examined life.

His latest&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling flex,&nbsp;Like Streams To The Ocean,&nbsp;is a touching and immersive deconstruction of the things that make us who we are and the decisions that shape our one and only life.&nbsp;</p><p>His best work to date, it’s a masterclass on leveraging the specifics of one’s experience as a vehicle to better connect with the universal the resides within us all.</p><p>So here we are again.
