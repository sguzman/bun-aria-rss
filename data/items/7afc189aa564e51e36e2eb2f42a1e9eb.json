We want to work towards not only growing our wealth but growing and strengthening our relationships as well. During this episode we cover some of the common patterns of arguments we often hear about and what to do about those arguments. We also offer some tips that we believe will allow you to keep simple disagreements from escalating into knock-down-drag-out money fights.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an HDHC CananDANKua by Other Half Brewing- a big thanks to Jason for sending this one our way to enjoy!
