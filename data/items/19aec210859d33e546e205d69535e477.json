  "title": "Sharing Deep Learning Research Models with Lightning Part 1: Building A Super Resolution App",
  "description": "In this post, we will build a Lightning App. Why? Because it is 2022, and it is time to explore a more modern take on interacting with, presenting, and sharing our deep learning models. We are going to tackle this in three parts. In this first part, we will learn what a Lightning App is and how we build a Super Resolution GAN demo.",
