  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 5/20/22",
  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, a Federal judge in Louisiana has blocked the Biden administration’s effort to take out Title 42, which would have resulted in 18,000 illegal immigrants entering the U.S. each day. No country can handle that much immigration at once, and at the same time we're told the great replacement theory is just a white supremacist myth. This is a racist policy pushed by a racist president helped by a racist media. The United States of the Democrat party has resulted in shortages, inflation, and impoverishment. Also, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich joins the show to discuss his election victory and pushing back against the policies of Biden administration. Then, Robby Mook testified that Hillary Clinton personally signed off on sharing false information to sabotage Trump as an October Surprise. It wasn't just Hillary that knew about this all along, but Barack Obama and Joe Biden knew as well. They used the instrumentalities of law enforcement to play the dirtiest of dirty tricks. Hillary Clinton was behind Russia Collusion, and she should be punished. She triggered investigations and 3 years of sleaze by her media pals, all to sabotage the election and presidency of Donald Trump. Later, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to protect Supreme Court Justices, and Nancy Pelosi won’t bring the bill to vote on the House floor. She doesn't mind that Justices are being threatened and is using rhetoric that can result in violence. This is the same attitude Pelosi took to not protect the Capitol building ahead of January 6th despite warnings. Finally, Stephen Miller calls in to explain that Biden is trying to bypass the Senate treaty process in order to bow our nation in submission to the WHO and surrender sovereignty and healthcare freedom.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
