  "description": "<p>We talk with Marcello Lunelli, chief winemaker for Ferrari, producer of high end, Metodo Classico sparkling wine in Trentino, Italy. It's great wine. We discuss:</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Trentino -- its unique location and how the terroir, the Dolomite Mountains, and the soil make the area so special and different from other parts of northeast Italy.</p> <p>2. The economic situation of Trentino and how Pinot Grigio has been a curse and a blessing for the area.  </p> <p>3. Marcello's background: his education, his experiences abroad, and his philosophies on how to make superb sparkling wine, including the importance of organic viticulture to Ferrari and the difference it makes. </p> <p>4. How sparkling is making headway in Italy and how Ferrari is at the forefront of the movement. </p> <p>5. The difference between Trentino metodo classico and Franciacorta in Lombardy.</p> <p>6. The long history of Ferrari -- they've been around since 1902 -- and how the Lunelli family learned high quality winemaking from the master, Giulio Ferrari.</p> <p>7. The challenge of making high quality sparkling at scale: How to make a large volume of wine while maintaining quality of a small winery.  </p> <p>Marcello's passion comes through in the wine. It's excellent -- a MUST try and a great value for what's in the bottle! </p> <p>http://www.ferraritrento.it/EN</p> <p> </p>",
