  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Todd Herman guest hosts for Rush on Wednesday. D.C. Trump rally joined in progress. Weak Republicans. Give ‘em a couple of bucks! The propaganda of silence. Those who control the least, care the most. The scam of D.C. being the center of the universe. Do nonvoters realize the radical left agenda at stake? I’m excited that it’s our turn.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Did your local Republicans step up or bow down? The press hat trick turn with COVID restrictions. Time to become activists. Ted Cruz objects in writing to Arizona’s electoral votes. Caller’s story about suspicious polling. This may be the time actual conservatives help us. Nick Searcy gives us an on-the-ground report of D.C. rally. Build the Republican Party back up honestly. We care more and tire less easily than those doing this as a gig.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Everything wrong with the Turtle’s generic statement. How Trump gained voters. People like Ron DeSantis are what we want. We’re going to take back our party, Mitch. Cut cable to defund the media. Be squared away in defending freedom of speech. The bread and circus trick won’t work again. Demand for transparency is not going away. Do you want to be a part of the peaceful solution or not? Keep it peaceful. Media’s protest hypocrisy. You created a monster you can’t control. This program does not stand with violence.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
