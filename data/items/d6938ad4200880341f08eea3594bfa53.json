  "description": "<p>Retreat Meditation and Instruction: Vipassana - Path of Practice (2018-10-07) - Vipassana, also known as insight meditation, is training in bringing a clear mindful attention to our moment to moment experience. We begin by relaxing through the body and then resting attention with the breath – or some other sensory anchor – and allowing the mind to settle. Then we open to whatever is predominant or calling our attention – sensations, emotions, sounds – meeting each arising experience with a clear, kind attention. The gift of this process is discovering balance in the midst of the changing flow, and gaining deep insight into the nature of reality.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation:<br /> \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\"<br /> when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
