  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, we’re seeing our fellow Americans having to flee because their lives and property are threatened by Hurricane Florence and MSNBC and CNN and the Democrats are already blaming President Trump. We have these political ambulance chasers and these media ambulance chasers who are already positioning themselves to attack the president. It is impossible for the federal government to be everywhere with the kind of personnel and resources that are necessary to address these natural disasters. Also, there's no doubt that Former Secretary of State John Kerry colluded with Iran behind the back of the Trump Administration. There's little to no doubt that the Obama Administration interfered in the Israeli election to try and topple Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the Trump campaign for president. Shouldn’t John Kerry and the Obama administration be investigated for these things?

Does that sound like a President colluding with a foreign government?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
