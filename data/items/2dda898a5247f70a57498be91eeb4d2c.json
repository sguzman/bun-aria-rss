  "description": "This is what God spoke through the prophet Isaiah: “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland” (Isaiah 43:18-19). God is asking us, “Do you recognize the new thing I’m doing in your life?” He is saying, “Don’t wait to have faith when the situation takes care of itself because I’m doing some new things right now. Look for it! Watch and see what I will do. It is a new thing!”Don’t focus so much on an area of your life that needs to change or on something you want to happen. Don’t make your plans around an unanswered prayer. God has new things springing up even now. They are springing up for you to have today.
