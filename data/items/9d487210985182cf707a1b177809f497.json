That said, given the statements made by the game's director, combined with the game's obsessive dedication to every aspect of the car ownership experience, there is a throughline to be drawn to where the game currently is now. To be clear, this is not a defence of this exceedingly stupid, broken economy, but to say the situation emerged from sheer money-grabbing malice might not be telling the whole story. \n\nReview copy of Gran Turismo 7 provided for PS5 by PlayStation.\n\n---\n\nThumbnail by hotcyder - http://twitter.com/hotcyder\nhttp://youtube.com/hotcyder\n\nIntro text animation by Isaac Holland - http://twitter.com/drazgames",
