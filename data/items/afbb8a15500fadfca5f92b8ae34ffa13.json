  "title": "The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday",
  "description": "Under the ancient philosophical teachings of stoicism, obstacles are the foundation to all eventual success. Holiday aims to describe why the Stoics believed obstacles are so necessary for us all the achieve our best. Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus all wrote about the importance of embracing failure and obstacles in the pursuit of what is right. In this book, Holiday clearly articulates the teachings of some of the greatest stoic thinkers, while describing it's application in today's world. I have been fascinated by the Stoic philosophy, and I believe no better author can clearly articulate its teachings than Holiday. The reasons for getting this book are twofold: one, to understand more clearly the instructions of stoicism and two to understand the application of these principles so you can benefit from them. If you fall into that category, then I recommend you get this book. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
