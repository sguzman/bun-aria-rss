  "description": "<p>As an architect of contemporary architectural design and now working as an artist, my focus is to engage people in a shared experience; capturing an authentic sense of place, context and narrative. I view the integration of Fine Art & Architectural Elements offered through my newest venture, <strong>Studio Vlock</strong>, as a natural evolution of that vision; one that enables me to design pieces that inspire memorable experiences and create unique environments for social gathering, quiet reflection, and visual delight.</p>",
