  "description": "<p> We cover the tricky but important topic of Section 230 <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\" target=\"_blank\">of the</a> Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law has been in the headlines a lot recently, in the context of Twitter, the president’s tweets, and an executive order <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\">put out</a> by the White House on “preventing online censorship”. All of this is playing out against the broader, more profound cultural context and events around the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and beyond, and ongoing old-new debates around content moderation on social media. [Please note this episode was first published  May 31.] </p><p>To make sense of only the technology and policy aspects of Section 230 specifically — and where the First Amendment, content moderation, and more come in — a16z host Sonal Chokshi brings on our first-ever outside guest for 16 Minutes, <strong>Mike Masnick</strong>, founder of the digital-native policy think tank <a href=\"https://copia.is/\" target=\"_blank\">Copia Institute</a> and editor of the longtime news & analysis site <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Techdirt.com</a> (which also features <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/blog/greenhouse/\" target=\"_blank\">an online symposium</a> for experts discussing difficult policy topics).

What are the nuances and exceptions, and how do we tease apart the most common (yet incorrect) rhetorical arguments such as “platform vs. publisher”, “like a utility/ phone company”, “public forum/square” and so on? Finally: how does and doesn’t Section 230 connect to the First Amendment when it comes to companies vs. governments; what does “good faith” really mean and what are possible paths and ways forward among the divisive debates around content moderation?
