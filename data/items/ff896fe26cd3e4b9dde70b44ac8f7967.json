  "description": "<p>On this episode, we are joined by Tony Merkel from The Confessionals podcast, who will be our Sasquatch Chronicles guest host, while Wes hosts an episode of The Confessionals for Tony as part of this special swapcast! Tony brings guest Michael to the show, who shares with us all about a life riddled with unusual experiences pointing to him possibly be an alien abductee at the age of three. Michael was visited by entities at that time, and later came to understand that they were Grey extraterrestrials. He lays out a series of events which followed as he grew older that sometimes left him feeling so terrified he was afraid to go to sleep at night. The feeling of ice cold hands grabbing him eventually became a tell that alerted him he was being attacked. Once while he was sleeping he found himself in a type of sleep paralysis state from which he could not awaken, and all the while he felt like something was peeling the skin off of his feet. When he finally came out of it, hediscovered he really was missing chunks of skin! Michael also describes another instance when he felt the ice cold hands grabbing his ankles and pulling him off his bed, only to drag him down the hall. What happened as he was being dragged is hard for himto describe or understand because it seemed like he was being taken into a whole other realm. Michael shares as many bits and pieces of these abduction events as he can remember on this week’s swapcast episode, ‘They Took My Flesh.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you want o hear me on The Confessionals, come listen to at <a href= \"https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/theconfessionals/307-billy-the-kid-the-man-who-died-twice\"> https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/theconfessionals/307-billy-the-kid-the-man-who-died-twice</a></p> <p> </p>",
