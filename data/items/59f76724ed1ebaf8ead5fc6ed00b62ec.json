  "description": "The chief executive officer of blockchain technology company Blockstream, Adam Back, says that the leading crypto asset Bitcoin could see a 5x increase in price by the end of the year hitting $100K per BTC.\n\n“Everyone has their pet macro-views. My guess: stock market + US election season, moral hazard kicks up, quantitative easing ramps up again, rates drop again, money printer goes into overdrive. So the interest rate overhang falls off, and BTC decorrelates somewhere along the way once DeFi (decentralized finance) flushed.\n\nMy permabull case for BTC/USD [is] $100,000 this year. Plus a US physical Bitcoin ETF chaser (GBTC upgrade + other) would create a nice whipsaw and probably trigger a big uncoupling and positive reflexivity into a blow off top next year.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
