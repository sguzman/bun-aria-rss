  "content:encoded": "\n<p>Venom is an improved and compact fork of the popular Exodus Kodi add-on. This add-on has become the go-to option for many media content enthusiasts because of its many high-quality features, including Trakt.tv support, library integration, Youtube section, Debrid cloud manager, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>General Description + Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most outstanding features of the Venom add-on is the auto-play feature. Instead of manually clicking on a link to play a video when you add a movie or TV show title, this feature selects the link with the highest quality and automatically plays it from the link&#8217;s source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Venom to work correctly, you will need a premium Real Debrid, All Debrid, or Premiumize account. Using any of these premium accounts lets you access high-quality content from various servers and cached-torrents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cached torrent support ensures that your Real-Debrid or Premiumize account stores media content from torrent files in a primary location, allowing you access anytime. Real-debrid integration also helps you download content better and faster while avoiding buffering issues when streaming content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of the add-on&#8217;s menu options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discover TV Shows</li><li>My Movies</li><li>My TV Shows</li><li>YouTube Videos</li><li>Search</li><li>Tools</li><li>Premium Services</li><li>News and Info</li><li>Change Log</li><li>Music TV and Videos</li><li>Fringe TV</li><li>Recommended section</li><li>Real Debrid integration</li><li>Trakt.TV integration</li><li>Live TV Channels</li><li>Up next function</li><li>Kids TV</li><li>Library integration</li><li>Debrid cloud manager</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advantages of Venom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the reasons you&#8217;ll love the Venom add-on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Simple interface that helps users load and search content quickly.</li><li>Easy-to-navigate menu </li><li>Kodi 19 Matrix and Kodi 18 Leia compatible</li><li>Add-ons&#8217; latest update removes its redundant features, reducing bloat and improving functionality.</li><li>Access to Open Scrapers, a scraper that sources and plays high-quality links.</li><li>Supports cached torrents.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How Not To F*ck Up Your Kodi Experience:</strong> Streaming movies and TV shows on any of the 3rd party Kodi-addons may be illegal in your country due to copyright issues. \n\nConsider using a VPN if you truly care about protecting your online privacy.\n\n<strong>Here are the key benefits of hiding your IP (using VPN):</strong>\n\n1) Encrypts your internet traffic.\n2) You can access Geo-restricted content.\n3) You can avoid ISP throttling.\n4) You can avoid unwanted surveillance by government agencies and ISPs.\n5) You can protect yourself from hackers.\n\nConnect VPN on all of your streaming devices (iOS, Windows, Android, Amazon Fire TV, etc.) and enjoy worry-free & high-speed movie experience 24/7.\n\n<strong>The Most Popular VPN Providers Among Kodi Users Are:</strong>\n\n1) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/cyberghostvpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get CyberGhost</strong></a> - 45-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n2) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/expressvpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get ExpressVPN</strong></a> - 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n3) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/recommends/privatevpn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Get</strong> <strong>PrivateVPN</strong></a> - 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Venom is compatible with all major operating systems, including Android, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and iOS; for this reason, you can stream and view your favorite content effortlessly across all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This add-on&#8217;s recent update also makes it fully compatible with Kodi 19 Matrix and Kodi 18 Leia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installation Prerequisites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As earlier noted, Venom is compatible with all major platforms, which makes installation easy and convenient. Unfortunately, like other third-party add-ons, Venom is unavailable in the official Kodi repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You, therefore, need to set your device to <strong>allow installation from unknown sources</strong> to complete Venom installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, here are the steps to follow to install venom:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Enable unknown sources.</li><li>Add media source.</li><li>Install Venom add-on from the repository.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin the installation, ensure you have the latest versions of both the add-on and Kodi to avoid installation failures and errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, here&#8217;s the location and repository info you need for this process to work:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Name of the Add-on: Venom</li><li>Repository Name: Venom Repo</li><li>Category: Media sources</li><li>Media source naming: Venom</li><li>Latest working source URL: <a href=\"https://123venom.github.io/\">https://123venom.github.io/</a></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installation Guide</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>First Things First – Enable Installation From Unknown Sources</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to Home Screen, click on the gear icon, click on system, select “add-ons” on the left side menu, allow installation from “Unknown Sources”, click “yes” when the warning popup appears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Installing Venom Repository</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to Home Screen, click on Gear Icon, click on File Manager;</li><li>Click Add Source, Click None, Type in the URL <strong>“<strong>http://123venom.github.io</strong>”</strong> and click Done;</li><li>Pick a name for the repository (i.e. Venom) and enter it in the bottom box and click OK;</li><li>Click back until you are in the Main Menu, select Addons on the left side; </li><li>Click on the Box Symbol (top left corner), Choose Install From ZIP file, click Yes when a warning appears;</li><li>Open “<strong>Venom</strong>” Source and choose this file: <strong>“<strong>repository.venom-x.x.zip</strong>”</strong></li><li>A notification saying “Installed Successfully” will appear.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Installing Venom Kodi Addon</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to Home Screen, find Add-ons on the left side, select the box symbol (top left corner) to get to the Addon Browser;</li><li>Click on Install From Repository, choose <strong>Venom Repository</strong>, click on Video Addons in the category section;</li><li>Click on Venom and hit install, select OK to confirm the installation of dependencies (don’t appear in Kodi 19 Matrix);</li><li>A notification saying “Installed Successfully” will appear;</li><li>You have now downloaded Venom to Kodi.

Below are some of the best alternatives to choose from:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Crew </strong>add-on only became compatible with Kodi 19 matrix recently. It has various content categories, including movies, TV shows, Sports, IPTV, Kids, 1-Clicks, CC-Collections, Radio, Standup Comedy, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seren 2.0 </strong>is an excellent Venom alternative. Seren is popular for its innovative features like the back-to-back episode playing option, its smooth interface, and cached torrent support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asgard</strong> is one of the most popular Kodi add-ons out there. It has a great user interface and also features a variety of content for a better streaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Common Issues With Venom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you may face several challenges while installing or using add-ons like Venom. Here are some of the problems you may encounter with Venom and their most effective solutions:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Venom &#8216;Failed to Install Dependency Error&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason for this error is internet failure or shutting down of the repository. If the repository you are using to install Venom is not working, the add-on will still appear on the list of add-ons on your device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you proceed to install it, an &#8216;Installation Failed&#8217; error message will appear on the screen. Here are some of the best ways to fix this problem:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Check Your Internet Connection</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A good internet connection is required to install any add-ons that have online hosts. So before you begin installing Venom, ensure you set up Kodi network settings correctly. Also, check the speed and stability of the device&#8217;s internet connection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Enable Unknown Sources on the Device</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For security reasons, many streaming devices automatically default to blocking app installation from third-party sources. Therefore, to properly install the Venom add-on on Kodi, other than enabling unknown sources, you need to enable the unknown sources feature on your streaming device, too; otherwise, the installation will fail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find this option in your device&#8217;s Settings menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Use the Official Repository</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While Venom is available on many repositories, only a few of these will work correctly. Most will bring up the &#8216;Failed To Install Dependency&#8217; error when you try to install.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other unofficial repositories have add-ons with viruses that you may accidentally install. As a result, it&#8217;s advisable to install Venom from the official repository, which is safe, to avoid these unnecessary risks and installation failure errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Install the Latest Version of Venom Add-On</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Kodi can&#8217;t install an outdated version of Venom. To fix this problem, install the add-on&#8217;s latest working version available from the official repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Venom Error Check Log</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Check Log&#8217; error is another major problem you may encounter when trying to install Venom. This error mainly appears when the repository you are using to install the add-on has missing files. However, having a full cache can also cause an Error Check Log.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few quick fixes for this problem:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clear Kodi Cache</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As earlier mentioned, a cache is a temporary spot that saves data you frequently use for easy access in the future. However, all add-ons, including Venom, only require a certain amount of data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Updating the URL Resolver</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceeding this set amount usually will prompt the &#8216;Error Check Log&#8217; message and also cause buffering. But clearing the Kodi cache frees up necessary space, eventually fixing the error. It also allows Venom to have room for a video playback buffer, giving you an excellent streaming performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>URL Resolver is one of Kodi&#8217;s fundamental content streaming tools. Almost all add-ons, including Venom, function with the help of URL resolvers. A URL resolver is a tool that scrapes links from different sources on the internet and decodes file hosts when you click on a streaming link to play a video. Therefore, an outdated URL resolver may lead to a &#8216;Check Log&#8217; Error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>URL resolver currently has torrent and magnet link support for Premiumize and Real Debrid, meaning you automatically receive the latest version when installing the Venom add-on. But if you still see the &#8216;Check The Log For More Information&#8217; error even with the latest Venom add-on version, manually updating the URL resolver may be necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Use a VPN</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still receive the error after clearing cache and updating your URL Resolver, it may be because you are trying to access geo-restricted or copyrighted content. This error may also appear when your Internet Service Provider blocks a source for copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting to a VPN lets you bypass any geo-restrictions and ISP blocks. This way, you can stream content anonymously and securely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Venom &#8216;No Stream Available Error&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also notice a &#8216;No Streams Available&#8217; error when you launch Venom, search for a movie or TV show. This error mainly occurs when the stream you&#8217;re looking for is new, thus unavailable or when it&#8217;s too old for your web scrapers to grab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other times, Venom may fail to play content from the provider because of your network connectivity, firewall, or cache. Here are some of the best solutions to this problem:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Clear Cache</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As earlier noted, clearing cache regularly is essential for the Venom add-on to function correctly. It&#8217;s also another way to keep your add-on running smoothly and removes any unnecessary clutter slowing down your device and add-on, leading to the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fix Any Network Problems</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Network interference can sometimes cause a &#8216;No Streams Available&#8217; error. The good news is that network problems are generally easy to fix. First, unplug your router from its power source, and wait for a few minutes then plug it back in. This usually solves any connection issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the problem persists, increase your internet timeout from Kodi settings. Timeout adjustment is an excellent solution to the &#8216;No Stream Available&#8217; error, especially when your internet speed is decent but your device isn&#8217;t streaming or downloading fast enough. Still, it&#8217;s essential to test your internet speed before adjusting the timeout just in case speed is the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I Need a Real-Debrid Account To Use Venom?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, because Venom&#8217;s recent updates lock out free sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I Need a VPN To Use Venom?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While using a VPN secures your data and maintains your privacy, a VPN is not always necessary when using the Venom add-on. Premium accounts like Real-Debrid encrypt your internet traffic in HTTPS, ensuring privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is It Safe To Use Cached Torrents With the Venom Add-On?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, accessing cached files with this add-on is safe. Premium account integration means that you download and store files on your debrid service provider&#8217;s server using the HTTPS encryption protocol.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Venom Add-On Legal?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, using the Venom add-on itself is safe and legal. Using Venom to stream copyrighted content that is otherwise not freely available is, however, illegal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Venom is an excellent entertainment add-on with a simple yet beautiful user interface. Besides, its Real-Debrid integration makes it a top choice for any media content enthusiast keen on variety and high-quality streaming.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com/venom-kodi-addon/\">Venom Kodi Addon | Install &#038; Use</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com\">ProoFFreader</a>.</p>\n"
