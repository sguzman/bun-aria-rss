  "description": "In New York City, in the 20th century, tens of thousands of women and transmasculine people were incarcerated at the so-called \"House of D.\" Author Hugh Ryan says that in many cases, the prisoners were charged with crimes related to gender non-conforming behavior. \"Drunkenness, waywardism, disobedience to their parents, being out at night by themselves, wearing pants, accepting a date from a man, accepting a ride from a man,\" Ryan says. \"All of these things could have gotten you arrested if you were perceived as the 'wrong kind of woman.'\" In his new book, <em>The Women's House of Detention</em>, Ryan writes about the prison, and about the role it played in the gay rights movement of the '60s, including the Stonewall Uprising of 1969.",
