  "description": "<p>The parable of the prodigal son shows us, among many things, how the gospel creates a new and different kind of community. The parable shows us a family that is unraveling and falling apart—it is experiencing assaults on its integrity and cohesion.</p>\n<p>In this sermon, we will see that the story of the prodigal son gives us a picture of an assault on community, because of idolatry which is only overcome by agony.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 5, 2008. Series: The Fellowship of Grace. Scripture: Luke 15:11-14.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
