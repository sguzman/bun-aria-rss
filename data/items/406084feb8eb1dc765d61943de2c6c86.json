What would you strive to do or dream of if you could extend your life to even 150 years? Until recently the idea of longevity felt more like reaching your 90s and possibly 100 at best, and if you manage to accomplish that goal, a high quality of life would be best and expected. But what if you could extend your lifespan by even 10 years? Making sure that those years are exciting and meaningful would be a priority. Dr.David Sinclair, world renowned geneticist, is joining Tom in this episode to break down exactly why it is that we age on a cellular level, and what is now becoming possible in terms of slowing down our biological clock and even possibly reversing our biological age. If you want to know what you can do to start improving the quality of your aging life and stay younger longer this episode is for you, and you’ll want to check out Dr. David Sinclair’s newest podcast, Lifespan (link below).<br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to David Sinclair<br />0:28 | Why We Age<br />9:40 | What Goes Wrong With Aging<br />23:44  How to Reverse Aging<br />37:35 | Face Adversity<br />45:37 | How Metformin Works<br />55:02 | Lifestyle for Longevity<br /><br />“We could have reversed aging just by making all cells a stem cell, we have the technology to do that.” [23:43]<br /><br />“So we're reversing the aging of the eye, that's not hard at all, but we can reverse the age of the liver, the skin, other labs are doing the spleen, thymus, through this method.” [31:13]<br /><br />“Humanity lucked out that we can actually do this and that there's a backup copy of youth in each of our cells that can be tapped into.” [32:03]<br /><br />“We don't think about what it's like at the end, it is not fun.
