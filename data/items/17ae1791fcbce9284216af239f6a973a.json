  "description": "There is not much out there more heartbreaking than a child with no parents because their parents have passed away. Except for perhaps, children who still have living parents and yet end up in an orphanage. In the state of Montana, many of these orphaned and abandoned children ended up in an orphanage located in the city of Twin Bridges. This was the Montana State Orphan's Asylum that was also known as Twin Bridges Orphanage and later, the Montana Children's Center. It opened in 1894 and housed children for 81 years. Today, it is closed and privately owned and is reputedly one of the more haunted locations in the state. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Twin Bridges Orphanage! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jenny Lynne Raines and features beetles as clothing decoration and This Month in History features the beginning of the Black Hawk War. <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br />  <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2022/04/hgb-ep-431-twin-bridges-orphanage.html <br />    <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode: </p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Row Your Boat to Hell by ALIBI Music<br /> Row Row Row Your Boat by Cue Source Music</p> <p>And https://www.purple-planet.com/</p>",
