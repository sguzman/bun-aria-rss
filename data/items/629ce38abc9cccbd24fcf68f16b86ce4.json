  "description": "<p>“It's a great question. And no one has ever asked me that question. I think it's taught me about how to construct the arc of a narrative.” We’ve learned so much from Debbie Millman and her fabulous interviews on her long-running podcast <em>Design Matters</em>. Since 2005, Debbie’s introduced us to incredible thinkers from a variety of disciplines, and now 55 of the more than 500 interviews she’s done are collected in a beautiful (and provocative) new book, <em>Why Design Matters</em>. Debbie joins us on the show to talk about what design has taught her about interviewing, how she never really planned to be a designer (and what changed), her research process, the stories we tell ourselves about images, what’s next for her, and much more.</p> <p> </p> <p>Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang. Follow us here for new episodes on Tuesdays and Thursdays (with occasional bonus episodes on Saturdays).</p> <p> </p> <p>Featured Book: <em>Why Design Matters</em> by Debbie Millman</p>",
