  "description": "We can debate the policy and personal successes and failures of George H.W. Bush but there is no question that his example stands in stark contrast to that of America's current president and many in the generation of political leaders around him.  The question is: Was Bush the last of a breed?  Did something change a quarter century ago when he left the presidency?  Did it change even earlier?  And are those changes--many that have produced today's disfunction--permanent or can our system reverse them?  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, attorney and former prosecutor Katie Phang and former CIA operative Emily Brandwin discuss.
