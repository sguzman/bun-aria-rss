  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the late Sen. Bob Dole was a generous man, a patriot, and a complex politician that was a World War II hero. He was a wonderful man that loved this country. Then, corporate media's systemic corruption is much worse than anything Chris Cuomo did. The media has been complicit in covering up the crimes Marxists have exacted on the public for over a century. Later, the Democrats sell out our allies and blame Donald Trump. In 1994 the Budapest Memorandum was reached with Ukraine so they'd give up their nuclear weapons at the fall of the Soviet Union so long as the United States, Russia, and Great Britain assured the continued security of Ukraine. Tensions escalate between Taiwan and Beijing and the Israelis and the Iranians. Will the U.S back its allies? Afterward, combat veteran Rep. Mike Waltz calls in and said that America needs a wake-up call. He added that President Xi has openly called for the U.S and its currency to be replaced as the global standard. China aims to militarize their space stations so that they can wage war on the US from space and they're doing it with the money Americans spend on Chinese products. Waltz also called for the U.S to not participate in any Olympic Games that are held in China.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
