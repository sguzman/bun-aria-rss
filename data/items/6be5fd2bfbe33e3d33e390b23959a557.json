  "description": "<p>I first met Amanda Feilding in the late 1990s, when she was launching the Beckley Foundation to conduct and support research on psychedelics. I must admit that I failed to anticipate how successful and influential she would become, with Amanda described in the media as &ldquo;the queen of consciousness&rdquo; and her Beckley Foundation playing a leading role in psychedelics research and advocacy not just in Britain but globally. We talked about her life and loves, her theories about the power of psychedelics to enhance creativity, why she favors LSD above all others, the importance of mystical experience and ego dissolution, and the many important research studies she has instigated and sponsored.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
