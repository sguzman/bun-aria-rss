Encouraging and community oriented, it’s devoid of the negativity and toxicity that plagues most sharing networks. There’s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience – the highs and the lows — makes all of us better.</p><p>So just how did Strava become the only fitness app that matters?</p><p>To get the story behind the story, today I sit down with Mark Gainey and Michael Horvath — the dynamic duo co-founders&nbsp;who gave birth to Strava and continue to guide it's ongoing growth and evolution.</p><br><p>Currently Strava’s interim CFO, Michael Horvath&nbsp;previously served as Chief Executive Officer from 2010-2013 and President from 2014-2017.&nbsp;Holding a Ph.D. in economics from Northwestern University and an A.B. in economics from Harvard (where he was men’s lightweight crew team captain), Michael is a former Stanford economics professor and entrepreneurship professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Prior to Strava, Michael co-founded enterprise software firm Kana Communications and was the CFO and VP of Operations at GlycoFi, a biotech company.</p><p>Mark Gainey&nbsp;currently serves as the co-founder and chairman of Strava.
