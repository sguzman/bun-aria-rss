  "description": "Based on early estimates, as many as 10,600 large sequoias were killed in last year's Castle Fire — up to 14% of the entire population. The world's largest trees are one of the most fire-adapted to wildfires on the planet. But climate change is making these fires more extreme than sequoias can handle. It's also worsening drought that is killing other conifer trees that then become a tinder box surrounding the sequoias, reports climate correspondent Lauren Sommer. Scientists warn that giant sequoias are running out of time and they're racing to save them. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/17/1037914390/giant-sequoia-national-park-wildfire-climate-change\">Read more</a> of Lauren's reporting on sequoias: <a href=\"https://n.pr/39IX84M\">https://n.pr/39IX84M</a><br/>",
