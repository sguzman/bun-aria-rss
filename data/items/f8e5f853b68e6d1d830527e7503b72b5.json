  "description": "<p>Fade in on an empty building. Four walls, some windows, not much else. How does that empty space become a bustling neighborhood grocery store? It’s a good story, and one that involves a whole bunch of hard-working, super talented people. In Part One, we’ll talk to the folks who find the perfect location and the folks who get stuff built. We also get to chat with some Crew Members getting the store ready to welcome their neighbors. It’s a lot of work, and these folks are having a great time doing it. Have a listen, and look out for Part Two, coming next week to a podcast app near you.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode52-Transcript.pdf\"> Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
