  "description": "Teachers across Alabama are set to get a big raise. Will it fix the teacher shortage and will it be sustainable? A proposed California bill would change the definition of a workweek from 40 hours to 32 hours. So are we taking off Friday or Monday? We recap the CMT Awards, or the CMAs, or maybe it's the ACMs... we can't tell the difference. And lastly, Greg tells a story about going to a carnival as a kid and seeing the world's smallest man. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
