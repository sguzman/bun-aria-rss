  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We named Alexis Daria’s <em>You Had Me At Hola</em> one of the best romances of 2020, and for good reason. This week, we’re talking about how great romances can be handbooks for great relationships, about why taking risks in romance writing can pay off big time, about what it’s like to be bilingual in America, about why intimacy coordinators are amazing, and about normalizing lube. Enjoy!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we’re back with an interstitial, and in two weeks, we’re reading…honestly, we don’t know. Stay tuned! Thank you, as always, for listening!

But if nothing else,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1376992888622567439?s=20\">portal astrology</a>&nbsp;shows just how desperate people are to make meaning out of the tiniest of clues.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://telenovelastudies.wordpress.com/what-is-a-telenovela/\">Telenovelas</a>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera\">soap operas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-perfect-bilingualism-attainable_b_5797778de4b0e002a3141246\">The bilingual spectrum--from receptive to equilingual</a>--and the ways that this is a particularly American issue. Jasmine in YHMAH is a dominant bilingual (so is Sarah).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-politics-of-italics/\">The ways in which writers put languages on the page</a>&nbsp;has changed a lot in the past decade. Watch this video of author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/24gCI3Ur7FM\">Daniel Jose Older explaining why he doesn’t put Spanish in italics</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the movie Selena, there’s a scene where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qh1fHnHX7wI\">her father worries about her Spanish skills as she is about to meet Mexican reporters</a>. Although this scene may not be accurate,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/selena-the-series-learn-spanish-phonetically-sing-tejano-songs/\">Selena learned the phonetic Spanish for all her songs since she wasn’t fluent</a>.
