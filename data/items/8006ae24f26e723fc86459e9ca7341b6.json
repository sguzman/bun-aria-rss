LAZY.\n-- nope nope nothing happened at Alabama nope don't look no biggie nope\n-- \"Stand Up! With George Wallace\", aka the most popular podcast in Birmingham\n-- Reader questions, including a discussion of what the worst possible expanded universe would be, aka WHY THE GILMORE GIRLS IS THE MOST TEDIOUS SHOW EVER MADE\nLearn more about your ad choices.
