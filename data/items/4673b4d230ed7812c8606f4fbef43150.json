  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part Nine: Works - with Dr. Timothy Gombis. </strong></em>Gombis joins us again to offer his wisdom on the topic of ‘works,’ as we close out the Image series. What is the difference between works and deeds? How does that play out in day to day actions? How does ‘works’ play into ‘faith,’ ‘grace’ and ‘saved?’ We’re continuing our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: \"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</p>\n<p>Mike and Tim also spend some time responding to a few listener emails: What are we saying when we speak of having grace for ourselves? Is that an accurate use of that word? Should Christians avoid public office or do we need to have “godly” people in government? What does a posture of learning look like when you’re an older parent and have held one posture of understanding for decades?</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
