  "description": "Working moms are burnt out. And it’s not our fault. After two years of juggling Zoom calls, homeschooling, childcare, household chores, and chronic stress, it’s never been more clear that our system just wasn’t built to support caregivers. Reshma Saujani is ready to change that. This week, Reshma—mom of two, CEO and founder of GirlsWhoCode, activist, and author—joins Dr. Becky to talk about what recovery from a pandemic really looks like for families and why it’s on employers to “pay up.” The two not only get vulnerable about their own struggles as working moms, but also discuss practical calls-to-action for companies. Their conversation is an ultimate two-things-are-true moment: You can have a family and a career. Let’s fight for a system that makes room for both parts of us.\n<p/>\nFor more, check out Reshma’s latest book, “Pay Up: The Future of Women and Work (and Why It's Different Than You Think)”.\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
