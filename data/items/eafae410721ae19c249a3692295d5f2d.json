  "description": "<p>Embodied Presence: Portal to the Sacred - Part 1 (2019-03-13) - This two part series explores how we regularly leave our body and skim life’s surface in a mental trance, and the ways we can train our attention to come home again. We look at working with physical and emotional pain, and the gifts of love, wisdom, creativity and aliveness that arise as we learn to fully inhabit these living forms and all our senses with awareness. </p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
