This episode was originally released in November, just after oral arguments in the case. Bloomberg Law's Kimberly Robinson and Jordan Rubin explain what it's all about and why it is a \"landmark decision.\"\nAnd, for the latest on this case and the Supreme Court go to news.bloomberglaw.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
