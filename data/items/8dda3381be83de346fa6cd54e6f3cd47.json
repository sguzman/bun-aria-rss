While I’m still in my infancy in learning R, I feel like once I found these additional tools, my ability to use R to get work done improved significantly.</p>\n\n<p>In this first post of three, I’ll discuss <a title=\"R Studio main site\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a>, a more friendly access point to the default installation of R.  My second post will discuss <a title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rcmdr</a>, a GUI developed for students taking a basic college-level course in Statistics.  The third post will cover <a title=\"rattle download CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rattle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">rattle</a>, a GUI specifically designed for data mining (as opposed to more general statistics like <a title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rcmdr</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rstudio\">RStudio</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/r-studio.png\" alt=\"r-studio\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\nR Studio is an IDE that dramatically improves the R experience\n</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"R Studio download\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a> is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a more consistent user experience to R.  There are many great features of <a title=\"R Studio download\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a> over “basic” R, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Consistent windowing between sessions (customizable by the user)</li>\n  <li>Point-and-click exploration of data frames and other data objects</li>\n  <li>Importing data files through dialog box functionality</li>\n  <li>Customizable code syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and Help menu access from the code editor</li>\n  <li>Ability to see all installed packages, turn on packages using a checkbox, and download libraries (and their dependencies) without having to write any code</li>\n  <li>Version Control using GitHub</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While <a title=\"R Studio download\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a> doesn’t provide a GUI that will help you run a regression model or build a graph, it provides a more “friendly” environment to work in as compared to the command-line interface of a default installation of R.  I find that by having elements like the currently active data objects and available/active packages with links to the Help files “exposed” at all times, <a href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" title=\"R Studio download\">RStudio</a> reminds me of where my analysis has been and gives me a quick way to think about “What Else?” to pursue if I hit a roadblock.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"installation-of-rstudio\">Installation of RStudio</h2>\n\n<p><a title=\"R Studio download\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a> installs like any other program for Windows or Mac OSX.  As far as I can tell, there are no advantages to using <a title=\"R Studio download\" href=\"http://rstudio.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">RStudio</a> in either environment, both the Windows and OSX versions seem to work equally well.  The most important consideration is that RStudio is just an “add-on” so-to-speak, it does not include R itself.  So be sure to go to one of the <a title=\"CRAN downloads for R\" href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) sites</a> to download R first.</p>"
