  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, Christine Ford is looking less credible as time goes on. We have to stop trying to rationalize and reason with the Democrats. They don’t get to call the shots, they’re in the minority. It’s time to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. If Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote no on Kavanaugh we will campaign against them. Also, Ford’s ex-boyfriend says she flew a lot and she coached a friend to get through a polygraph exam in order to her job as a federal investigator. None of this would be possible if it weren't for the outstanding job done by Prosecutor Mitchell at the Ford hearing. Interestingly, the Democrats don't demand that the FBI interview the ex-boyfriend or that she go and press criminal charges at the local police department so that this allegation is actually on the record. Then, we're not more divided than the Civil war but we're certainly very divided and most of this balkanization happened on President Obama's watch. But overall the Democrats have always been this way, they're the party of slavery, segregation, and abortion. The old Democrats are gone and the new mindset is focused on destroying individuals and the very groups they tribalize, for example old white men. They use the massive administrative state and the judiciary that they've hijacked to subvert the will of the electorate. Finally, then State Senator Barack Obama admits to drinking a six-pack of beer in an hour and consuming illegal substances. I guess this was OK to become President?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
