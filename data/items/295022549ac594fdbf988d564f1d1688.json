  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about LeBron facing elimination against the Suns tonight and whether or not we know if Anthony Davis is going to play tonight, plus the hit in the Canadiens/Jets game that everyone is talking about, and everything else that is going on in the sports world. Later, NY Radio cohost of Ebro in the Morning and The Michael Kay Show, and WWE contributor, Peter Rosenberg joins Pat and AJ to chat about the new album that he has coming out tonight at midnight, the rap concert that he's going to be apart of in New York, the fan climate around the Knicks, Nets, and the Yankees in New York City, and whether or not he'd consider himself a true New Yorker (51:10-1:07:56). Next, living legend, radio host on SportsGrid on SiriusXM and Canadian hero, Gabe Morency (@sportsrage) joins the show to breakdown how he got to the position he's in, who he likes in the NHL playoffs, who he likes tonight in the NBA playoffs, and his philosophy when it comes to betting (1:10:07-1:30:18).
