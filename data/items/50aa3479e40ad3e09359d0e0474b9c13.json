  "description": "While the ministries of John Wesley and George Whitefield have been thoroughly examined by historians and theologians, too little attention has been given to the nuanced doctrine that is most associated with these two evangelists: conversion. In Born Again: The Evangelical Theology of Conversion in John Wesley and George Whitefield (Lexham Press, 2020), Sean McGever fills the gap and provides a much needed topography of this pivotal turn in historical theology. This is a carefully researched and detailed exploration into the teleology of conversion, and suggests that perhaps the differences between these two Methodist founders has perhaps been overstated. The understanding and expectations of the experience of conversion was largely shared, and possibly more similar with each other than with many later developments in the evangelical movement they founded. You can find Sean McGever on Twitter (@seanmcgever).\nRyan David Shelton (@ryoldfashioned) is a social historian of British and American Protestantism and a PhD researcher at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
