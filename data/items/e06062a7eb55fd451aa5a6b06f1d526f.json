  "description": "<p>In Episode 5 we discuss Snapchat’s rocky road. We look at some of the choices the company has made and we question if they will be able to survive all of the issues they currently face or if they will fall victim to the wrath of Facebook the same way Vine did. We also examined an ex NBA player who managed to turn $350,000 into $400 million with fast food franchises. And we stepped into the political world and examined the idea of bridging the racial wealth gap with baby bonds.
