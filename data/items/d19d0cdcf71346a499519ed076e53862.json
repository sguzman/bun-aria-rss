  "description": "Sex, drugs, and rock and roll was Mastin Kipp’s 21-year-old lifestyle until it got him fired. When he was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving, with an eight ball of cocaine sitting under his driver seat, he promised himself that if he avoided getting caught he would get clean. Not only did he discover sobriety, he found himself becoming one of the most sought after transformation artists on the planet reaching over 2 million people in over 100 countries through his writing, online courses, seminars, and retreats. He's created a whole new approach to life intervention that he calls Functional Life Coaching, a scientific approach to helping people work through trauma and find their real purpose in life.
