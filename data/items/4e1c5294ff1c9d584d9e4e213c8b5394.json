  "description": "In \"Black Lawyers Speak: Stories of the Past, Hopes for the Future,\" we have looked at how the current focus on diversity and inclusion in Big Law is playing out. We have heard from key players at law firms and in corporations about how they are doing the hard work of culture change, and how, through their work, they are underscoring the argument that diversity is good business.\nIn episode four, we turn our attention to the unique experiences of African American women law partners, a segment that comprises less than 1% of all partners in the legal profession. We speak with veteran lawyers who have ascended to the highest ranks of leadership at major firms, those who serve as general counsel at large companies and younger partners who are putting their stamp on a more inclusive future right now.
