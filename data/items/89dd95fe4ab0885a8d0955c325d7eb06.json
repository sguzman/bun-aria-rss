  "description": "<p>Darkness Radio goes on a Ghost Adventure to Horror Hotel with guest Jay Wasley<br>\n<br>\nJay Wasley has been an important aspect of the Travel Channel's hit series, Ghost Adventures, both behind and in front of the camera and has become a beloved member of the team. This is his first appearance on Darkness Radio. Today we discuss his work, experiences and the creepy new special Ghost Adventures: Cecil Hotel.<br>\n<br>\nStationed along downtown Los Angeles’ Main Street stands an infamous hotel with a checkered past beset by multiple suicides, murders, devil worshipping and serial killers. Perhaps it is most known for the recent mysterious death of a young girl named Elisa Lam, whose body was found in the hotel’s water tower without any explanation as to what may have happened. Her peculiar demise remains unsolved, and bizarre elevator surveillance video of Lam has fueled an abundance of theories, including that of supernatural forces. Now, for the first time ever, the Cecil Hotel is allowing cameras inside for an investigation of ghostly proportions in the two-hour special, <strong>GHOST ADVENTURES: CECIL HOTEL,</strong> launching on Discovery, Inc.’s new <strong>discovery+</strong> <strong>streaming service</strong> beginning <strong>Monday, January 4, 2021.<br>\n<br>\n</strong>For more information on discovery+, please visit <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3D4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUcZXUx58JMoB-2BtLdOD0o-2BUUg66-2BlgsPv-2BAWsOhNPNqnFz_Gi_BfvFY8HVlI0CjVMN4yem2MxC9iOVutrqP-2Bl9rRvAAEC9t4lTve49jeyzvSxnqZHQEyrHgg5H3g4Mk9K0NRnlmGwfhDrM47FiBogFJS6zuUjEFBT3UlFv8Mcv8o-2FIDXwoq2aYix-2F8Jfi8iFr4X52WybzZEIfyxiZOOCfWl9c7HOtw68KZ3fPoeq1eKKKnOhRSrAHB2y6ylz0gGw-2FrPI-2BTLiDDUSCTxRkCoi0K8sYdwAeE84Q3vjMnSNG5Wro6-2FE-2FpGqJXEU-2BlnYJ3IDYXB-2F70d3n23-2Bk00b8AI7Ntx5nGqsvGC-2BWbY36i0CMi9HPJKCssED6MV8LkF3zLMR-2FknJjoOMiC31G6g9TSzMV7E-2FOCFBc-3D&data=04%7C01%7Cstephanie_sarcona%40discovery.com%7C352e314204484ce68fb108d8a6ad2ccd%7C092a1ba4a4fe4172970e7ab3035e7c94%7C0%7C0%7C637442610015424700%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=bPocUNOJ1k0CdNGeiaOjpiFwQwNsTlqsQZIDe7XkFx4%3D&reserved=0\">discoveryplus.com</a></p>\n",
