  "description": "<p>Lindsey is a phd of medical history and is a really fun and interesting storyteller. She was so good on Rogan’s podcast. She talks about how fucked up surgery was back in the 18th century. When you check this podcast of Joe’s out make sure to watch it on You Tube as there are a bunch of images that are worth seeing.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p><a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</a></p>\n",
