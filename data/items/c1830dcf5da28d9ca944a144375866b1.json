  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>Y’all know that I am a huge reality tv fan and one of my favorite newer shows is \"The Circle\" on Netflix. Season 2 of the show wrapped in May 2021 and there were lots of twists and turns that required the contestants to think quickly on their feet and stay on top of their strategies. As the season progressed, I was paying close attention to the Black women in the game and the choices they were making and how other players were responding to them, and thinking a lot about what kind of strategy I might employ if I were to be on a show like this. Needless to say I had lots of questions and who better to help us answer some of these questions than Season 2 winner, Deleesa St Agathe. Deleesa and I chatted about why she chose to go into the game as her husband Trevor, how she prepared for the game, her thoughts about the perception of Black women on reality tv, how she kept herself busy in isolation, and the surprise of finding out she was expecting while filming.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our Amazon Store for all the books mentioned on the podcast. <a href=\"https://therapyforblackgirls.com/amazon\">therapyforblackgirls.com/amazon</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Deleesa</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/LeesaUnique\">https://www.youtube.com/c/LeesaUnique</a></p><p>IG: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/leesaunique\">https://www.instagram.com/leesaunique</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Leesa_Unique\">https://twitter.com/Leesa_Unique</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
