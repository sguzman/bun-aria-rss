  "description": "<div>Just after midnight on November 10 2012, a loud and frightening sound erupted in the Indianapolis subdivision of Richmond Hill. The force was so powerful that it registered on a regional earthquake sensor and homes were left rattling from the impact. Emergency services raced to the scene but were unable to save the lives of two residents, Dion and Jennifer Longworth.Â <br>\n<br>\n---</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Episode narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a><br>\nResearched and written by Elsha McGill</div>\n<div>Creative Director: Milly Raso</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"https://casefilepodcast.com/case-140-richmond-hill/\">casefilepodcast.com/case-140-richmond-hill</a>\n</div>\n",
