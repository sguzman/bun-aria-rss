  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, things get crazy! First of all, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by the one and only Rich Condon of \"Civil War Pittsburgh\" and \"Pennsylvania in the Civil War\" to talk about the Battle of Fort Necessity. Not only known for being the first major battle with George Washington in command, Fort Necessity was also the beginning of the first large-scale world war: The Seven Years War, or more locally known as the French & Indian War. Just a disclaimer that this episode will sound a little different because Audacity sucks sometimes and audio issues hit hard. Hence, the entire episode is shot from Rich's perspective, who single handedly saved the podcast from annihilation. It was still a good time and hope you all enjoy the ride. If you don't, sorry not sorry. Cheers!</p>",
