  "description": "<p>This week Connor and Dan take on two master debaters. You know them, you love them, it's Chomps and the Frenchman. In 1971, these two titans of thought sat down on Dutch television to debate the existence of human nature. Almost 45 years later, two drunk guys are sitting on a podcast trying to parse out what the hell they were talking about. Other topics discussed: sub-genres of sex, being born on a soccer field, and potentially racist terms from the Vietnam War.</p>",
