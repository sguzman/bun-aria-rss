  "description": "<p><em>This season, More Perfect is taking our camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution. We're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story. This episode is best listened to alongside <a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>, an entire album (an ALBUM!) and digital experience of original music and art inspired by the 27 Amendments. Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.</em></p>\n<p>Let's get started. If we're talking about the Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it only feels right to start at the beginning. The <strong>First and Second Amendments</strong> are arguably the most ferociously contentious amendments of them all, and the <strong>Third Amendment</strong> is the underdog that everyone underestimates but (maybe) shouldn’t.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Episode One dives into the poetic dream behind the First Amendment. This is the amendment that reflects the kind of country the Founding Fathers hoped we would be. Next, we examine the fiercely debated words of the Second Amendment, words that often feel like they divide our nation in two. And finally, we question whether the seemingly irrelevant Third Amendment might actually be the key to figuring out where our country is going.</p>\n<p>And when you're done with the episode, take a <a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">listen</a> to the songs by Joey Stylez, Cherry Glazerr, Sateen, Flor de Toloache, Michael Richard Klics, Palehound, and They Might be Giants inspired by Amendments 1, 2 and 3 on<em> <a href=\"http://mostperfectalbum.org\">27: The Most Perfect Album.</a></em></p>",
