  "itunes:summary": "Healing through improvised harp and open heart\n\nClare Cooper is the one of the subcultural world’s innovation pin-ups. She plays the harp and guzheng, sometimes she tap-dances. She’s passionate about the sociability of improvisation and it’s capacity to encourage compassion and radical acts of trust. This performance was recorded on the 19th of April 2018 at the Tote, Melbourne. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/brotzmann-leigh\n\nRitual Community Music\n29 April 2018\nThe Tote, Collingwood\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, the Goethe-Institut, and the Audio Foundation, NZ\n\nImage: Tania Kelley\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
