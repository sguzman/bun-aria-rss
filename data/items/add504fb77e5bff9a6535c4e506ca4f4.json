It was developed by a scientist whose son suffered from asthma and whowas frustrated by the fact HEPA air purifiers did not relieve his son’s symptoms. As a result, Dr.Yogi Goswami spent 20 years developing a completely new, totally effective way of removingindoor air pollutants. Unlike HEPA filters, Molekule destroys indoor air pollutants at a molecular level, completely removing them from the air you breathe.<br>\n<br>\nYou can find all of our sponsors or become a patron on our new website <a href=\"http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.sleepwithmepodcast.com</a><br>\nCommission a Song from Jonathan Mann @ <a href=\"http://song.jonathanmann.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">song.jonathanmann.net</a></p>",
