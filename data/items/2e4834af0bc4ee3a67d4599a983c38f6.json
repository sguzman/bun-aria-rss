The authors completed a five-year study where they interviewed over 150 women in North Carolina, and share their findings in this book. They find that much of the cooking advice of modern-day food gurus such as Michael Pollan or Jamie Oliver isn't relevant or realistic for many who would otherwise like to, and that we need to solve social inequities through policy first. The authors share some ideas for making cooking efficient, economical, and communal.</p>\n<p><em>Eat Your Words</em> is powered by <a href=\"https://simplecast.com\">Simplecast</a>.</p>\n",
