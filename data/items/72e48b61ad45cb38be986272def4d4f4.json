  "description": "<p><p>On today's episode, Chaps and Cons discuss recent criticism of Trump for not visiting active combat zones, and how it's bullshit. They discuss it by themselves because Kate was so late, that Chaps felt the need to issue her a Page 11. Joe Quinn from the HEADstrong Foundation joins us to speak about his inspiration for creating the organization, and to encourage veterans to get help. UFC Champion Randy Couture also joins the show to talk about working with Jay Glazer on his 'Merging Vets & Players' organization, and Chaps fanboys all over the place! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
