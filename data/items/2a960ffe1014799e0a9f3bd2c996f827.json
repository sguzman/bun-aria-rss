  "title": "10: Dueling, Life Sucks at Valley Forge, von Steuben's Cool & the Battle of Monmouth",
  "description": "“Stand fast, my boys, and receive your enemy!”\nThis is the story of a miserable winter and the summer of 1778. It's full of conniving, vengeance, honor, and starvation. George's political enemies learn the hard way not to mess with him. We'll have two duels in this episode alone. Most of this goes down during a grim winter at Valley Forge, where one fourth of the Continental Army will die from exposure and starvation. But it's not all bad news in this deadly winter's camp; von Steuben's teaching the Americans how to fight like pros. They're going to need those new skills. It's getting real at the Battle of Monmouth.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
