  "description": "<p>Amber Mayfield doesn’t let much get in her way. The events she worked on at her corporate job were a little stale, so she launched her own events company, To Be Hosted. She thought Black culinary creatives deserved attention year-round, not just for Black History Month, so she launched her own print and digital magazine, While Entertaining. She wanted to pay homage to her grandmother’s recipes, so she self-published a recipe journal (coming this fall), rather than go the traditional publishing route. Amber is organized, centered, and spiritual and she joins host Kerry Diamond to share her story.
