  "description": "We all have things that come against us and experience things we don’t understand. It’s easy to live uptight wondering how everything is going to work out. It we’re not careful, we’ll get discouraged, live worried, and not believe things are going to change. But there’s a simple phrase you have to get down in your spirit - God’s got this. Joel wants to teach you in this encouraging message that you don’t have to figure it all out. In the natural, you may not see a way, but that’s okay, we serve a supernatural God. He sees what’s happening in our lives and already has a solution. Instead of living frustrated, learn to let go and let God. When you turn it over to Him and say, “God, I know You’ve got this. I know You’re in control,” not only will you feel the heaviness lift off of you, but God will make things happen that you couldn’t make happen on your own.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
