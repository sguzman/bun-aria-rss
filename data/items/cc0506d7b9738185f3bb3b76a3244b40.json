  "description": "60,000 Americans are dead. 1 million are infected. And those are just the official numbers. 30 million are unemployed. And Jared Kushner declares \"Success!\" And Trump's approval rating rises. But the coronavirus pays no attention. The total dead is probably closer to 85,000. The total infected may be as high as 15 million. And we're just getting started. There are global and domestic waves to come. Does anyone--in either party--have a strategic plan to deal with this? We discuss with Pultizer Prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett, the FT's Ed Luce and Just Security Editor-in-Chief Ryan Goodman. It's a chilling, essential episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
