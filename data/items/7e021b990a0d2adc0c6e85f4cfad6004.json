  "description": "Did you miss our LIVE bonus show on Fireside, the interactive storytelling platform? Don’t worry— you can catch the replay on Fireside, or enjoy the bonus audio here. In this conversation from early December, I spoke with Laura Morelli, a USA Today bestselling author and art historian who writes amazing historical novels involving the art world. We discussed her background in art history, how she writes and structures her novels, and get into some of the nitty gritty on her latest book, The Stolen Lady, a book about the Mona Lisa that takes place in both the Italian Renaissance and in france during WWII. It is not only a fascinating and engrossing read, but the conversation with Laura herself was absolutely lovely, too--and I hope you enjoy listening in. \nWant to join in on the fun next time? Join Fireside now and follow me for invites to each live recording, where you can participate in the audience and ask questions live! And who knows? Maybe we’ll even throw a trivia contest every now and again. The next one is coming up on January 12 at 2 PM eastern, when I’ll be speaking with author Jeffrey H. Jackson to discuss his latest book, Paper Bullets, about the incredible artists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore--two women who risked their lives to defy the Nazis. It’s an awesome real-life tale of using subversive tactics to disrupt Hitler’s crew--and you’re not going to want to miss it.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE and REVIEW our show on Apple Podcasts and FOLLOW on Spotify\nTwitter / Instagram / Facebook / Fireside\nDon’t forget to show your support for our show by purchasing ArtCurious swag from TeePublic!\n\nSPONSORS:\nHoMedics: receive a FREE PORTABLE PHONE SANITIZER when you buy $100 or more in massage products\nNYU Tisch Pro/Online: Register for spring 2022 film-making and screenwriting courses online with NYU’s Tisch Pro online\n\nWant to advertise/sponsor our show?\nWe have partnered with AdvertiseCast to handle our advertising/sponsorship requests.
