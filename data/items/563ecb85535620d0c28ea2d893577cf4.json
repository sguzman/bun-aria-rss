  "description": "Phil remembers thinking Dan's dad might be an angel, so of course he had to ask. Al recalls driving his cheap car 3 miles in reverse. The guys are joined by Mike Kellett, an elder who preaches with Al at WFR Church. Al reveals his favorite line about their community of believers. And they discuss what Christianity is in its simplest form, the seven last sayings of Jesus on the cross, how to forgive someone who's wronged you terribly, what we can learn from the relationship between Jesus and Mary, and what people think about on their deathbeds.\n\nWFR Church: https://www.wfrchurch.org/\nLearn more about your ad choices.
