  "description": "<p>A cornerstone of this podcast is celebrating the power of a plant-based lifestyle. Today we do just that with one of the movement’s most influential founding fathers.</p><br><p>That father is none other than the great Plantstrong pioneer himself,&nbsp;<strong>Rip Esselstyn</strong>—returning for his second appearance on the podcast for a continuing dissertation on all things plants.</p><br><p>If you caught our first conversation in December of 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rip-esselstyn/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 336</a>), you already know Rip and I go way back. As swimmers we crossed paths as teens, later as college rivals, then decades thereafter as plant-based athlete and advocate allies. From the outset of my journey, he’s been a steady source of inspiration, encouragement and wisdom. An incredible mentor. A lighthouse. A loyal friend.</p><br><p>For those unfamiliar, Rip was a three-time NCAA All-American backstroker at the University of Texas.&nbsp;After graduation, he spent a decade as one of the premier triathletes in the world. He then joined the Austin Fire Department where he introduced his passion for a whole-food, plant-based diet to Austin’s Engine 2 Firehouse in order to rescue a firefighting brother’s health. To document his success he wrote the national bestselling book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Engine-Diet-Firefighters-Save-Your-Life-Cholesterol/dp/0446506680/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Engine 2 Diet,</a>&nbsp;which shows the irrefutable connection between a plant-based diet and good health.</p><br><p>Thus began an illustrious career as a multiple New York Times bestselling author, in demand public speaker, health advocate, and food entrepreneur—catapulting the fledgling plant-based movement into mainstream adoption.</p><br><p><em>Not enough? At age 56, Rip broke the master’s world record in the 200-meter backstroke.</em></p><br><p>Today we pick up where we left things in 2017. More Rip. More plants. More awesome.</p><br><p>Given Rip’s OG status, it was only fitting that today’s exchange was conducted OG style. No fancy studio. No cameras. Just two guys and two mics seated at Rip’s breakfast table in Austin. An old school, back-in-the-day podcast.</p><br><p>Of course, we discuss the many benefits of a whole food plant-based diet—the Planstrong lifestyle as he calls it.</p><br><p>In addition, we review the exploding popularity of this movement. How to rewrite your relationship with food in the new year. Plant fueling strategies to perform athletically. And how to leverage the nascent power within to positively and sustainably change our lifestyles for the better.</p><br><p>We also dissect his recent world record-setting swim. What the future of the plant-based movement looks like. And the story behind his brand new food company titled, of course,&nbsp;PLANTSTRONG.</p><br><p>To read more,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rip-esselstyn-656/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
