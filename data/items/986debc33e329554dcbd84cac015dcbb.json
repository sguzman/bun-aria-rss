  "description": "Adam remembers “jamming” with Blues Traveler’s John Popper and Dr. Drew on ‘Loveline’. He talks about how thinly sliced tomatoes are not an acceptable pizza topping and how being a vegetarian doesn’t mean you have to eat vegetables with everything. The gang is joined by Manhattan Institute fellow, Leor Sapir, who wrote an article for city journal called ‘The Assault on Children’s Psyches’. He talks about the potential risks and danger of teaching gender fluidity to children. \n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nGeico.com \n\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM\n\nFreezePipe.com enter CAROLLA\n\nSoloStove.com enter ADAM",
