Naseema is an RN with a master’s degree in healthcare administration, who also founded the website Financially Intentional and launched the podcast, Nurses on FIRE. Both of these resources exist to help nursing professionals achieve a sense of financial freedom in their lives. Given the demand for healthcare workers, there are a lot of career opportunities available so we’re excited to touch on that. Naseema also wrote the book, Smart Money, to give folks a step-by-step plan to crush their debt. But most impressively- Naseema has paid off over one million dollars of debt which doesn’t even seem possible- don’t worry, she explains her story! She details how she climbed out of massive debt as a single mother, the turning point in her journey towards financial independence, nursing as a cheat code to earning more, keeping lifestyle inflation in check, and much more.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Dosvidanya Rye Barrel by Destihl Brewery!
