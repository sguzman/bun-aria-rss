  "description": "<p>In a slight change to the normal format, host Pádraig Ó Tuama speaks with the poet Jake Skeets who reads his poem “Daybreak,” a poem combining Diné language with English, a poem rich with observation: of land, of growth, of memory, of place. Land is not just a tool to use for food, nor is it a blank space for human projection. In this poem, Jake Skeets reflects on an ethical engagement with land: an engagement that sees land as itself, not just for its uses.</p><p><strong>Jake Skeets</strong> is the author of <i>Eyes Bottle Dark with a Mouthful of Flowers</i>, winner of the National Poetry Series. He is the recipient of a 92Y Discovery Prize, a Mellon Projecting All Voices Fellowship, an American Book Award, and a Whiting Award. He is from the Navajo Nation and teaches at Diné College.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/jake-skeets-daybreak/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
