  "description": "<p>There’s something about the sound of Mark Nepo’s voice that just puts me at ease. He’s been immersed in a path of spiritual inquiry for more than forty years, taught all over the world, authored more than twenty books, including the #1 New York Times bestseller The Book of Awakening, More Together Than Alone and others. His books have been translated into more than twenty languages and in 2014, Mark traveled the country with Oprah Winfrey on her sold-out The Life You Want Tour and has appeared several times on her Super Soul Sunday program.</p><p>The last time I sat down with Mark, we caught up on life, then dove into his decades-long inquiry around how we are wired to live in community, what happens when the bonds that connect us fail and how to rediscover community at a time when we seem more divided than ever. This conversation was actually recorded before the year we’ve all just been through, but it is more relevant and more needed than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Mark Nepo at:</p><p><a href=\"https://marknepo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>&nbsp;: https://marknepo.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mark_nepo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/mark_nepo/</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
