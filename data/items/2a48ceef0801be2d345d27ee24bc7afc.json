  "description": "Tariffs and trade barriers are rising, and major diplomatic institutions that have long promoted liberal trade are coming under attack as impending trade wars threaten global trade and global value chains. At the root of this crisis, argues Geoffrey Pigman, is accelerating technological change. Negotiating Our Economic Future: Trade, Technology, and Diplomacy (McGill-Queen's UP, 2020) traces the impact of today's major technological transformations on global trade and the diplomacy that makes trade possible. Not only is global trade changing, in terms of what is traded and how, but diplomacy in the digital age is changing as well. Arguing that we must think differently about trade and diplomacy, Pigman proposes pragmatic policy approaches for the diplomatic management of a challenging and potentially dangerous future.\nLeo Nasskau writes and thinks about leadership and change, exploring how leaders can build societies fit for the 21st century. We face change in our economic, social, and political worlds; it is the role of leaders, in business, society, and politics, to ensure that this change manifests as opportunities rather than challenges.
