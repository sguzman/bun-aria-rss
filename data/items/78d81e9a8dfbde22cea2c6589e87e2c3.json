  "title": "PMS 2.0 131 - He Hit Him With His Own Helmet.. WILD TIMES In The NFL + Ike Taylor & Brandon Flowers",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat reacts to Myles Garrett trying to cave Mason Rudolph’s head in with his own helmet moments after they land back in Indiana from Pittsburgh, and Pat throws to Tone Digz’ incredible Steelers/Browns rant from yesterday’s radio show before the game. Pat also talks more about the Colin Kaepernick situation and what to expect from this weekend’s workouts, what that entails, and which teams could potentially be interested outside of the teams who said they would be in attendance. Pat also dives into the proposals for the new CBA and whether or not players will like the proposed changes, and if it could actually work for both parties involved. Also included are interviews with 2x Super Bowl champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. He talks about which teams he think could use Kaepernick, whether or not he’s still got it, what he thinks of this maturing Steelers defense and what he see’s in Minkah Fitzpatrick, and he sheds some light on what he thinks of Tim Tebow (21:17-33:46). Later, former Pro Bowler and Cornerback for the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs, Brandon Flowers calls into the show. He explains why he doesn’t like the idea of another game being added in the new CBA, what he thinks of defensive units currently in the NFL especially the back end, talks about what it was like being a smaller guy and having to get chippy with WR’s in order to prove a point, and who he’s got in the Super Bowl this year (44:41-57:04). Today’s show is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
