  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, today the Democrats unconstitutionally impeached an innocent man in the House. Jerry Nadler was the point man in today's impeachment and he was also the man that, years ago, requested that President Clinton pardon domestic terrorists from the Weather Underground. Even the Washington Post timeline proves that the attack on the Capitol building occurred before President Trump concluded his speech, which called for a peaceful and patriotic protest. Chief Steven Sund, the outgoing Police Chief of the US Capitol Police, says his requests for help were hamstrung by the House and Senate leadership who directed their respective Sergeants-At-Arms. Then, Jake Tapper questions combat veteran and amputee, Brian Mast's, commitment to America. Also, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggests a media literacy commission so that more Americans can better understand the media. Later, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft hold thousands of contacts with the US military and federal law enforcement, yet former employees say they prefer to not deal with the military. In effect, the American taxpayer is subsidizing these tech companies. Google is considering a censored version of its search engine called project Dragonfly specifically designed for China. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
