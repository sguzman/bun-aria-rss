Having his own businesses since the age of 8, mowing lawns, Charles has made plenty of mistakes and had a few successes along the way. Creating new ventures and solving tough problems are two of the most exciting things in life, the way Charles sees it. The lifestyle he’s created means its hard to tell if he’s working or playing since it’s all intertwined in a beautiful manner. From real estate development to investment fund management to custom gun grips, it’s all in a fun day’s work. With 5 companies that have done over 7 figures, Charles is staring at the 9 figure mark as his next goal. Along with his entrepreneur wife Elisha, there’s no telling what the Covey’s will create next.</span></p> <p><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-covey/<br />  https://www.facebook.com/Charles-Covey-345817616184209/<br /></span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How To Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steve Schabacker is the co-founder of Sheepdog Firearms and an entrepreneur, bestselling author, and marketer.
