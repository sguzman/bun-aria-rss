  "description": "<p>We consider unsupervised learning methods for characterizing the disordered\nmicroscopic structure of supercooled liquids and glasses. Specifically, we\nperform dimensionality reduction of smooth structural descriptors that describe\nradial and bond-orientational correlations, and assess the ability of the\nmethod to grasp the essential structural features of glassy binary mixtures. In\nseveral cases, a few collective variables account for the bulk of the\nstructural fluctuations within the first coordination shell and also display a\nclear connection with the fluctuations of particle mobility. Fine-grained\ndescriptors that characterize the radial dependence of bond-orientational order\nbetter capture the structural fluctuations relevant for particle mobility, but\nare also more difficult to parametrize and to interpret. We also find that\nprincipal component analysis of bond-orientational order parameters provides\nidentical results to neural network autoencoders, while having the advantage of\nbeing easily interpretable. Overall, our results indicate that glassy binary\nmixtures have a broad spectrum of structural features. In the temperature range\nwe investigate, some mixtures display well-defined locally favored structures,\nwhich are reflected in bimodal distributions of the structural variables\nidentified by dimensionality reduction.\n</p>",
