  "description": "In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.\nI discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction & Note About Diagnosis\n(00:03:27) Sponsors \n(00:07:56) ADHD vs. ADD: Genetics, IQ, Rates in Kids & Adults\n(00:13:00) Attention & Focus, Impulse Control\n(00:14:57) Hyper-focus \n(00:16:45) Time Perception\n(00:18:25) The Pile System\n(00:20:00) Working Memory\n(00:24:10) Hyper-Focus & Dopamine \n(00:26:40) Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network & Task-Related Networks \n(00:32:57) Low Dopamine in ADHD & Stimulant Use & Abuse\n(00:37:10) Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil & Armodafinil \n(00:47:00) Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine\n(00:49:18) How Stimulants “Teach” the Brains of ADHD Children to Focus\n(00:52:00) When To Medicate: A Highly Informed (Anecdotal) Case Study\n(00:56:35) Elimination Diets & Allergies In ADHD\n(01:04:46) Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPAs & DHAs \n(01:07:00) Modulation vs Mediation of Biological Processes\n(01:10:50) Attentional Blinks \n(01:16:56) Open Monitoring & 17minute Focus Enhancement \n(01:22:50) Blinking, Dopamine & Time Perception; & Focus Training \n(01:30:10) Reverberatory Neural & Physical Activity\n(01:33:40) Adderall, Ritalin & Blink Frequency\n(01:35:00) Cannabis \n(01:37:30) Interoceptive Awareness \n(01:41:15) Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil; Smart Drugs & Caffeine: Dangers\n(01:48:05) DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine\n(0:1:50:54) Ginko Biloba \n(01:51:45) Modafinil & Armodafanil: Dopamine Action & Orexin\n(01:56:19) Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC\n(01:59:04) L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine \n(02:01:23) Racetams, Noopept \n(02:05:15) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Combining Technology & Pharmacology \n(02:09:14) Smart Phones & ADHD & Sub-Clinical Focus Issues In Adults & Kids\n(02:14:30) Synthesis/Summary\n(02:16:10) Support for Podcast & Research, Supplement Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
