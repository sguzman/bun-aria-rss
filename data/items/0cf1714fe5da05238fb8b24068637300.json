  "description": "<p>It’s Gio’s Birthday-sode! And listen. It’s a doozy. Em covers the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, which once housed a circus-builder who “cured” cancer with watermelon seeds and is haunted by a ghost who does NOT wear capris. Meanwhile, Christine gets ~timely~ (and pretty graphic) with her coverage of Edmund Kemper III, the mofo featured in Netflix’s recent drama Mindhunter. And that is most definitely why we drink.<br />Don’t forget to check out our sponsors, BaubleBar (promo code “Drink”) and Firstleaf wines: www.tryfirstleaf.com/drink</p>\n",
