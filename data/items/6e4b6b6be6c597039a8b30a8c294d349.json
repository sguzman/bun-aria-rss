It produces two major thyroid hormones, and the overproduction of these hormones is termed hyperthyroidism. Sixty to seventy percent of individuals with hyperthyroidism suffer from an autoimmune condition called Graves' disease. So, what is driving these issues and how can that information be used to treat the root causes of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease?</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. George Papanicolaou to discuss how they work with patients to treat the root causes of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease. They discuss topics including environmental toxin exposure, the role of gut health in driving autoimmune disease, using thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and much more.</p><br><p>George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. He is also an Institute for Functional Medicine Practitioner. Upon graduation from his residency he joined the Indian Health Service. He worked on the Navajo reservation for 4 years at the Chinle Comprehensive Medical Facility where he served as the Outpatient Department Coordinator. In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He practiced with a philosophy centered on personal relationships and treating the whole person, not just not the disease. He called that philosophy “Whole Life Wellness”. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive this kind of personal care Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health – a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine. Dr. Papanicolaou joined The UltraWellness Center in 2017.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Rupa Health and Paleovalley.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
