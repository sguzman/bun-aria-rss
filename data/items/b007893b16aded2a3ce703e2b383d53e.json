  "description": "Delusional Liz Cheney loses by 37 points, compares herself to Abraham Lincoln. Clay says, \"This is like not making your high school basketball team and declaring for the NBA.\" What's next for Cheney, a show at MSNBC or a run for president? Clay explains why he thinks George Bush is the worst two-term president in modern times. Biden (who still has not visited border since being president) border disaster continues: Border arrests top 2021 record, on pace for 2 million by end of September! Buck says, \"There's a different set of rules for the illegals, so that they can break more laws.\" Credit to Texas Governor Greg Abbott for exposing Democrats on illegal immigration. Buck could just walk steps to see New York City moving illegal immigrants into famed luxury Times Square hotel, at tax payers' expense. Buck discovers that Costco has some great deals for his upcoming honeymoon.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
