  "title": "#378: Her Name Was Mariah Alvarez - Part 2",
  "description": "<p>We finish analyzing the heart wrenching case of Mariah Alvarez, the 2-year old who died of blunt force trauma to the head. Her mother Melissa Lucio was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. But did Melissa in fact commit capital murder? Was she criminally neglectful of her child? Was she physically abusive? Was Mariah’s death an accidental fall down a steep stairs? Was Mariah abused by someone else? An eyewitness says someone else banged Mariah’s head on the floor that day.&nbsp;Was Mariah’s death a combination of all of these factors? Why did Melissa get the death penalty instead of life in prison?
