  "description": "<p>This article builds on a previous article on curling numbers by van de Bult\net al. There, sequences $A^{(m)}$ were defined for $m\\in\\mathbb Z_{\\geq1}$\nwhich we call the level-$m$ Gijswijt sequences. Van de Bult et al.\\ proved that\nthese sequences contain all integers $n$ that are at least $m$. They also made\na conjectural estimate for the position of the first $n$ in Gijswijt's sequence\n$A^{(1)}$. The main result of this article is an expression for the exact\nposition of the first $n$ in the level-$m$ Gijswijt sequence, thereby proving\nthe estimate by van de Bult et al. Along the way, we give a rigorous definition\nfor constants $\\epsilon_m$ for $m\\geq1$ which occurred in their paper. Our\nexpression also uses constants $\\nu_m$ for $m\\geq1$. We prove that the\nirrationality measures of both $\\epsilon_m$ and $\\nu_m$ are at least $m+1$, for\nall $m\\geq1$. Additionally, we prove the estimate of van de Bult et al.\\ for\nthe first 5 in Gijswijt's sequence. We also prove that each integer $n$ has an\nasymptotic density in $A^{(m)}$, and that $A^{(m)}$ has a mean value.\n</p>",
