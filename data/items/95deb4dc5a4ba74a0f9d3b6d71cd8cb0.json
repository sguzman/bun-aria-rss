  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, squad member Cori Bush gives a shockingly honest answer when asked why she uses private security even as she calls for defunding the police. You should hear this, and we’ll play it today and talk about the lessons we might learn from it. Also, CNN runs a story that unintentionally reveals the psychological abuse that some COVID-panicked parents are subjecting their children to. It’s worse than you think. And Ron DeSantis again proves why he should be the 2024 frontrunner. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we have a story about a trans YouTuber named Chris Chan that is so outrageous that if I summarized it right now, you’d think I was making it up. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
