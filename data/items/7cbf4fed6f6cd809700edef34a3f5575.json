So how does it work? Is it necessary to eat lots of meat and dairy if you are keto? And do you need to be keto forever to reap its benefits?</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman explored these questions in his conversations with one of the leading voices in the Paleo/Primal and keto movements, Mark Sisson, and with Dr. Carrie Diulus, who has found a vegan-keto diet to be the best approach for her when it comes to managing type 1 diabetes and maintaining a healthy weight.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Mark Sisson is the founder of the popular daily health blog, Mark’s Daily Apple, godfather to the Primal food and lifestyle movement, and the New York Times bestselling author of The Keto Reset Diet. His latest book is Keto for Life, where he discusses how he combines the keto diet with a Primal lifestyle for optimal health and longevity. Mark is the author of numerous other books as well, including The Primal Blueprint. After spending three decades researching and educating folks on why food is the key component to achieving and maintaining optimal wellness, Mark launched Primal Kitchen, a real-food company that creates Primal/Paleo, keto, and Whole30-friendly kitchen staples.</p><br><p>Dr. Diulus is an orthopedic spine surgeon, vice chief of the medical staff, and director of the Spine Wellness Center at the Crystal Clinic, in Akron, Ohio. Prior to that, she was both a spine surgeon for the Center for Spine Health at the Cleveland Clinic and also a medical director in their IT department. Dr. Diulus’ surgical practice focuses on minimally invasive spine surgery.&nbsp; Her clinical interest involves strategies for improving patients’ musculoskeletal health and surgical outcomes by improving metabolic health with dietary and exercise strategies. She has type 1 diabetes and has published and is involved in ongoing research at Boston Children’s on the use of a low carbohydrate diet in the management of type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by ButcherBox.
