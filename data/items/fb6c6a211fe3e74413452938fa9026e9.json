  "description": "- Happy Birthday Eric!\n- Callum Turner cast as Theseus Scamander\n- What do we know about Newt's older brother besides a brief mention in Fantastic Beasts?\n- We analyze the letter between brothers that never made the final cut. Would it have put too much emphasis on Grindelwald early on?\n- What kind of relationship do the two brothers share? Micah and Eric have differing opinions.\n- Isn't it a bit ironic that Theseus is tasked to track down Grindelwald and its Newt who catches him? How will Theseus react?\n- Theseus and Graves worked together - how close did Grindelwald get to Theseus without him knowing?\n- Is Theseus even still alive? Could he possibly be a Grindelwald supporter?\n- Will the two brothers work together when Grindelwald inevitably escapes?\n- Will Theseus die tragically like the Greek hero for which he is named?\n- We share some more first Potter memories!",
