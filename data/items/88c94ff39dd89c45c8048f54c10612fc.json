  "description": "Anthony Jeselnik (Comedy Central Presents, Comedy Central Roasts, CD \"Shakespeare\") is Anthony Jeselnik ALL THE TIME. This episode is a delightful and oddly honest and weird conversation about EGO (Pete and Anthony discuss at length their egos and the importance of a performers ego), confidence, voice, persona, weed, traveling first class, likability, and of course sex and God. Plus a bonus track from the unreleased UCB NY CD about, fittingly, bragging. Enjoy you weirdos!!",
