  "description": "<p>Uh... Stunning Talent On The Pod Alert! Ryan O'Connell joins the women of Las Cultch ahead of the release&nbsp;of both his debut novel Just By Looking At Him (out June 7th) and Peacock's&nbsp;Queer As Folk, on which he writes and also stars (out June 9th)! The three discuss their origins as snarky internet gays, splurging on ridiculous rideshares, working with Kim Cattrall (who plays Ryan's mom on QAF.... gag), horny photo shoots, how Kim Petras commands gays with her voice, relationships to the original Queer As Folk, and living on the same street where they filmed Erin Brockovich (the part where she's poor and amongst cockroaches). Also, thoughts on this season's RHOBH, how being a reality star alters the psyche, Gregg Araki, the goddess Parker Posey, and formative indie films of the 90's. Would YOU give your dog a human's name? What would it be? Think about that while you press PLAY on this episode... of LAS CULTURISTAS.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
