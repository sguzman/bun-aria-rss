Most of these cases were accidents due to the river rising well above its usual levels. But in West Quincy, Missouri, there was another culprit, James Scott. His crime? Knowingly causing a catastrophe by breaking the levee. But his motive was not what prosecutors expected. \nThanks to Noam Osmand for the story.  \nFor more information, check out Adam Pitluk's book, Damned to Eternity.\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
