Can we have a bit more on how the sausage gets made for e3 judges week? Do you have to book your own appointments? Do you get unlimited time with the games on display? How many people are there?

I hope yall had fun during Judges week (please blink twice if you saw a new Fable game). Do the general gaming audience have a misconception when it comes to the Microsoft/Sony Azure server partnership?
