ISIS and al Qaeda continue their competition to inspire lone-wolf jihad. Turkey’s crackdown on would-be putschists continues. Anonymous goes after targets in Turkey. Cyber M&A notes. Dr. Charles Clancy from the Hume Center at Virginia Tech tells us about the challenges and opportunities coming with Smart Cities. And a look back at Friday’s inaugural Billington Global Automotive Cybersecurity Summit.",
