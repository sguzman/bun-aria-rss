  "description": "Donald Trump is the biggest threat that the ruling class has ever faced and now they're coming after him to get to you. The espionage act cannot be applied to a President and was never even intended to be applied to a former president, and to do so would be unconstitutional. Woodrow Wilson threatened newspapers that challenged his views and used the Espionage Act to jail opponents. President Biden signed the putrid, massive spending bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act which will not ease inflation but add to it. This fractures the connection between the individual citizen and their government in a way that empowers the bureaucrats and weakens the people. This bill will add to the deficit and further hurt the struggling U.S energy industry. Biden will subsidize illegal immigration, the industry-crushing Green New Deal, and pitch this bill as a win for Democrats and a detriment for Republicans that voted against it. The CDC received a blistering report regarding its handling of COVID and it was determined that it fell short of expectations and will be shaking things up. Contrary to what it sounds like the CDC will likely shake things up to make things more political while instituting additional woke policies. The FBI wants to keep the Trump affidavit sealed because the FBI may have spies inside Mar-A-Lago. Merrick Garland was apparently unsure what to do even though they suspected the destruction of documents, so he waited a couple of weeks before he authorized the raid. From the low-level conflicted Magistrate Judge to the politicized prosecutors, the whole thing stinks of a political witch hunt. AG Garland and others must be investigated and exposed for treating America like the Soviet Union. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
