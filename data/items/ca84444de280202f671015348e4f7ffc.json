  "description": "With time comes perspective and it is clear now that January 6th was not an isolated event. In fact, there are real dangers in perceiving it as one, dangers that could play to the interests of the coup plotters and against the long-term interests of U.S. democracy. We seek to reframe the events of that day and where they fit in the bigger picture with Yale University historian and noted author Joanne Freeman and University of Michigan Law School professor and former U.S. attorney Barb McQuade. We promise, it's not like any discussion January 6th you've heard before...and it's one you need to hear. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
