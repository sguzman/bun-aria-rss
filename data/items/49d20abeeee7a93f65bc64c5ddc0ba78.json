The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMLOps Pipelines to Deliver Tf.Lite Models to Distributed Compute Pools at the Edge - Maciej Mazur, Canonical\n\nThis session will be a demo showcasing how to create an automated MLOps pipeline, that trains a model for different classes of infrastructure. You will see how with Kubeflow and TensorflowLite you can work on a model for a smart city, which will detect cars, do license plate recognition and tell if plates actually match the car. This model will be then, from the same pipeline, available for a mobile phone app, a small form factor device like RaspberryPi/NVidia Jetson as well as a standard Tensorflow model for the datacenter.",
