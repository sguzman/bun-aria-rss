  "title": "Federico Fabbrini, “Fundamental Rights in Europe: Challenges and Transformations in Comparative Perspective” (Oxford University Press, 2014)",
  "description": "Federico Fabbrini is Assistant Professor of European & Comparative Constitutional Law at Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands. In his new book, entitled Fundamental Rights in Europe: Challenges and Transformations in Comparative Perspective (Oxford University Press, 2014), Fabbrini analyses the constitutional implications of the highly complex European architecture for the protection of fundamental rights and the interactions between the various European human rights standards.\n\nBy innovatively comparing this architecture with the United States Federal System, the book advances an analytical model that systematically explains the dynamics at play within the European multilevel human rights architecture. The book however also goes beyond simple theory and tests the model of challenges and transformations by examining four very interesting and extremely relevant case studies. In the end, a ‘neo-federal’ theory is proposed that is able to frame the dilemmas of ‘identity, equality, and supremacy’ behind this multilevel architecture in Europe.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
