  "title": "Ep. 839 - 'Diversity' Is Code For 'Go To Hell, Whitey'",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Marine Corps hires a “chief diversity officer” as it moves towards its goal of creating a more diverse, equitable, and tolerant force. That’s the way they’re selling it, anyway. But today we’ll talk about what they really mean. Also, Kamala Harris is upset that she doesn’t have enough to do as Vice President, and now her team is accusing Joe Biden’s team of racism. Who could have possibly seen this coming? Plus, a Michigan school is forced to shut down because a large number of staff members have an adverse reaction to the COVID booster. And, as we discussed on Friday, a college professor is on a campaign to destigmatize pedophiles. The college has responded to the outrage. And Britney Spears is free. Should we celebrate? Should we care at all? We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nAndrew Klavan's latest novel When Christmas Comes is now available on Amazon.
