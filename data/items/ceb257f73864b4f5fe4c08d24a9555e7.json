  "description": "<p>Welcome to this new season of The Literary Life podcast! This week we bring you an introduction both to William Shakespeare and his play <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn\">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a>.</em> Hosts Angelina, Cindy and Thomas seek to give new Shakespeare readers a place from which to jump into his work and more experienced readers eyes to see more layers in his stories. Cindy begins with some perspective on how to start cultivating a love for Shakespeare. Angelina shares her “hot take” on whether you should read the play or watch the play. They suggest some books for further digging into Shakespeare’s works, and Angelina gives an overview of the format of his comedies. Thomas goes into some detail about Roman comedy.</p> <p>Next week we will be back with a discussion of Acts I and II of the play. Also, if you would like to join the free live read-along over at <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.
