  "description": "In 2010, Logic the rapper, born as Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, released his first official mixtape titled \"Young, Broke & Infamous.\" At 20 years old, Logic certainly was young and broke, and while crashing on a friend's couch, he poured himself into his music. Logic's career could have fizzled if it wasn't for Chris Zarou, a young college athlete-turned-manager who had no more experience in the music business than Logic. Undeterred, the two decided to work together, continuing to use free music and social media to build Logic's reputation as a talented, fast-flowing rapper with a hopeful message. In 2012, Logic signed to Def Jam Records and in 2014 dropped his debut album \"Under Pressure,\" which shot to number 4 on the Billboard charts. His third album in 2017 went platinum and included the breakout single \"1 800 273 8255.\" PLUS in our postscript \"How You Built That,\" we check back in with Cassy Burnvoth who built a skincare company using an unlikely ingredient – beef tallow.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
