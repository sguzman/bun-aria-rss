  "description": "This week we are joined by the wonderful, whimsical, and swagger filled Jonathan Adler. He talks with us about how he grew up on a tiny farm town in New Jersey and used his skills as a potter to see beyond just one path and create a huge and well-respected name in the industry as a designer, author, and personality. Jonathan shares how he got started in design, the inspiration behind the iconic Parker Hotel Palm Springs and Modern American Glamour style, why worrying about trends is a thing of the past, and why we shouldn’t be afraid to design with putting our most optimistic and bold foot forward.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs including a whole lot of painting, Ikea basket storage, furniture placement, and office spruce up.\n\nJonathan grew up in a tiny farm town in New Jersey and tried pottery when he was 12 at camp. He fell immediately in love with the art and knew he wanted to pursue it for his lifelong passion in a unique and inimitable way.\n\nJonathan got studio space in SoHo by teaching classes and his atypical thinking kept him open to branching out towards all elements of design, including his friends’ home.\n\nJonathan’s Modern American Glamourous style encourages people to reach beyond their limitations and preconceived style restrictions and get as funky and weird as they want.\n\nAs a decorator, Jonathan feels like he is a slimming mirror for his clients, reflecting the best and most optimistic version of themselves.\n\nWhy a neutral slate is a great place to start and build colorful and whimsical additions.\n\nJonathan shares how he used timeless elements mixed with rustic modern and hippie aesthetic in the Parker Hotel, and what his process was behind the refresh.\n\nWhy we can take more risks now more than ever with so many options being out there that trends are really just more about people picking what they personally like.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nJonathan Adler \nJonathan’s Hilarious Timeline \n@jonathanadler \nBenjamin Moore Crushed Velvet \nNew York Magazine\nElle Decor \nParker Palm Springs\nDavid Hicks\nStrand Book Store \n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nFirst off, this house is incredible and your staircase is amazing! What Jonathan would do is keep the floors and paint everything else white including the kitchen. Since it is a loft-like space, you will need to do some seating pavilions and pads. White walls and wood floors will bring a cohesive feel. We are loving the front doors! Marble would be lovely for the countertops.",
