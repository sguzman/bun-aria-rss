  "description": "<p>How’s your relationship with your finances? Let’s be straight – money is a tough topic for most. And with good reason. If we aren’t careful, the fear of money (or lack thereof) can squeeze its way into the back of our mind and just sit as a nagging reminder. Enter: anxiety mode. But no longer, sister. Listen into this episode as Jordan dives into finance freedom by shifting your mindset from money is ‘bad’ and something to be feared - to stepping into viewing money as a tool to create your (and your family’s) foundation. In this episode, you’ll learn questions to ask before making a purchase, where to include purchase swaps, and the creative way Jordan made a little extra money in college. Insider secret? You can do it, too. With a little creativity and a lot of heart, you can find unique ways to bring in a side bit of cashola. If you’re feeling unsettled about your financial situation or simply desire to adopt a healthier financial mindset, this episode is for you. </p>  <p>Pre-order the book:<a href=\"jordanleedooley.com/book\" target=\"_blank\"> jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Grab your preorder bonuses! <a href=\"jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies\" target=\"_blank\">jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href=\"instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p>\n",
