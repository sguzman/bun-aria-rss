  "title": "The Mystery of Art: Should We Share Our Creative Techniques? [45]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we're diving into a topic we've both wondered about ... how much should we share? If we let people in to all aspects of our creative process, does our art lose its mystery? Do collectors really want to see the good, the bad and the ugly of our artistic process? And what about sharing with other artists? Should we keep some things as trade secrets? If we share everything, are we worried about people copying us? &nbsp;During our conversation, we share some of the benefits we've both experienced from sharing our work, our processes and our creative lives. We also discuss the potential pitfalls of being open and honest.</p>\n<p>Later, we answer a listener question from Wendy about substrates ... why do we choose to work on boards or canvas or paper? What factors do we weigh and how does that decision impact our work? All this, plus the week's inspiration, which includes a kick-ass group of artists and the story of how one amazing woman turned hardship into massive success.</p>\n<p>Mentioned:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thought for the Day: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07vp1z4\"><u><strong>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07vp1z4</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Wharfedale Grange wedding venue: <a href=\"https://www.wharfedalegrange.co.uk/\">https://www.wharfedalegrange.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p>Louise's free acrylics video: <a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/acrylics/\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/acrylics/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
