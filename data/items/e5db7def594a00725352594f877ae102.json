  "description": "After days of railing against \"weak\" immigration laws and border security, President Trump is deploying National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. China is hitting back at the U.S. with tariffs of its own, largely targeted at Trump country. And with CEO Mark Zuckerberg preparing to testify before Congress next week, Facebook is now saying that some 87 million users — not 50 million, as had previously been said — had their data shared with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. This episode: host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, White House correspondent Scott Horsley, political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter Tim Mak and national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
