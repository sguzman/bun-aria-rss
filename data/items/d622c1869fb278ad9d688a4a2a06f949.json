  "description": "For three decades and counting on The Simpsons, Yeardley Smith has voiced the smart and compassionate middle-child Lisa, who became a vegetarian early in the show’s history thanks to a little help from Paul and Linda McCartney. Aside from life as an animated kid, Yeardley has been busy in her kitchen with the Instagram/YouTube series Oil & Water, as she takes two clashing ingredients and attempts to make them work together. On today’s show, Homemade host Martie Duncan welcomes Yeardley to discuss the origin of Oil & Water, her dream dinner party guests, who she’s been starstruck by after all these years in television, and how she’s learned to love the margins of her cookbooks.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
