The $10 billion package includes money for COVID testing and treatment as well as vaccine distribution, but without additional funds for foreign aid. We&#8217;ll see what happens when the House gets its turn to vote on the deal. There&#8217;s also a new report from the United Nations&#8217; climate science agency suggesting that only drastic  emissions cuts will save us from some of the worst effects of climate change, and most countries lack the political will to do anything about it.
