  "description": "<p>You can gain just as much weight eating gluten-free cupcakes as you do eating gluten-filled cupcakes.</p> <p>We don’t want the latest marketing trend to be the demise of your health and fitness goals. Though many gluten-free efforts mean well, as with anything, marketers can really mess things up. They’ll take a good wholesome idea and you turn it into a tactic.</p> <p>Gluten-free options came into play to enable folks with gluten sensitivities to still enjoy some of their favorite comfort foods. Then more gluten-free options hit the market to meet the demand of people finding out the big potential downsides of eating gluten. The next thing you know there’s a gluten-free label slapped on everything from soups, to salads, to potato chips, and pizza. I think I even saw someone sipping a gluten-free bottle of water the other day.</p> <p>You’re about to get an in-depth look at the gluten-free phenomenon (and where our initial good intentions may have gotten off track). Plus, we’re covering some of the basics of the If It Fits Your Macros movement that’s hotter than men’s rompers right now.</p> <p>It’s said that many things come into our lives for a reason, a season, of for a lifetime. When it comes to diet and nutrition we have to be able to roll with the punches and identify which thing is which. Today is all about adding more tools to your superhero utility belt to make the best decisions for yourself and the people you care about.
