  "description": "<p>Every week, we’re taking one of the things that in our culture troubles people the most about Christianity. We’re now going to look at the Christian teaching that God is a judge and a judge who consigns people to hell. </p>\n<p>Someone says, “How can you possibly reconcile the concept of judgment and hell with the idea of a loving God? They just don’t go together.” What do we say about that? I’d like to argue that understanding what the Bible says about hell is crucial for understanding your own heart, for living in peace in the world, and for knowing the love of God. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on October 22, 2006. Series: The Trouble with Christianity: Why It's So Hard to Believe it. Scripture: Luke 16:19-31.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
