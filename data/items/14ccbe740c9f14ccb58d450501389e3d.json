  "description": "<p>Understanding what our time is worth allows us to make more informed decisions regarding our time and money. Your hourly rate informs your decision to DIY a project at home, determine whether you’re spending too much time searching for a deal, or whether its time to negotiate a raise or other benefits at work. Your personal hourly rate shouldn’t be the only consideration but understanding the relationship between our time and money will allow us to live more meaningful and optimized lives.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Seismic Positivity by Pipeworks Brewing Co which you can find on Untappd.
