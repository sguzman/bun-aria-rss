  "description": "<p>Ronald Dominique confessed to raping and murdering 23 boys and men between the ages of 16 and 46 between 1997 and 2006 across six Louisiana parishes. When he was caught, investigators were shocked by... how harmless and unintelligent he seemed. How did THIS guy do what he did for so long?  In part, he was able to do what he did because he targeted the poorest members of one of the poorest area of the nation. Law enforcement where and when he was killing didn't have much of a budget to dedicate enough resources to finding him, and also, the people he killed weren't people, typically, who kept regular social schedules. Police had a hard time, over and over, figuring out exactly where victims had been right before the died. Ronald was NOT a criminal mastermind. Not be a long stretch. He just figured out a simple con to get guys to tie themselves up so he could do what he wanted to do to them, and he got away with it because those guys typically lived high risk lifestyles in an area full of hard times and few resources. Despite how dark this subject is, I actually find a lot of humor to lighten it up because in addition to being a serial killer, AND an idiot, Ronnie Joe was also a Patti Labelle impersonator, a dude who had some super interesting rationalizations for why he had to do what he did, and a man with, apparently, the tightest, most fragile butthole on the planet. </p><p><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  In honor of the passing of Jeff Burton from the Rizzuto Show aka the Rizz Show on 105.7 FM in St Louis, we are donating (amount tbd) to Jeff's charity of choice - Kids Rock Cancer.
