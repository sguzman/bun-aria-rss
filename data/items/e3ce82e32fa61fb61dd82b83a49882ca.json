  "description": "“All classes are sorta boring” (p. 19). This statement is one that college students might believe, along with many of their professors, but not Dr. Mark Carnes, author of Minds on Fire: How Role-Immersion Games Transform College (Harvard University Press, 2014). In Carnes’ book, he describes a new type of learning and classroom pedagogy called “Reacting”, where students take control of the class by being immersed into various roles in a certain event in history and given a competitive goal to complete by the end of the exercise, sometimes over a month long. For instance, students could be assigned as Jacobins in the French Revolution or Gandhi during the partitioning of British India. Each role is different and each student is tasked with various objectives to complete. The method, which can be used in disciplines beyond history, is akin to Model UN or mock trials, but on overdrive.\n\nCarnes, professor of history at Barnard College, asserts that through these immersion activities students will gain a better sense of morality, foster greater leadership and community-building skills, and learn more on a particular subject overall than a traditional class setting, as students are tasked with knowing their characters and historical background information much more intently than their typical class workload. The reacting method taps into the “subversive play” that has been present on college campuses for centuries–from fraternities, mixers, and football, to beer pong, Facebook, and World of Warcraft. The role immersion method gets students excited about going to class and even raises the stakes for how much students care, which can result in crying sessions after a tough loss in the imagined world, as Carnes witnessed on several occasions. Despite countering teachings from Plato, Rousseau, Dewey, and other educational thinkers, Minds on Fire provides a compelling case on how to rethink the modern classroom experience in higher education. Dr. Carnes joins New Books in Education for an interesting discussion on his book and urges anyone interested in implementing this new pedagogical tool to visit the Reacting to the Past website.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
