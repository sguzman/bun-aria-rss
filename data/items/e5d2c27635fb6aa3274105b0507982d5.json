  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, equality has now evolved into equity and President Biden will mention it often, but he rarely mentions the word freedom. One can have equity in poverty but that's not helpful. Constitutional amendments and the civil rights movement paved the way for equality for minorities under the law and the issue of equity is a farce. The denial of school choice in communities of color is the simplest test to prove what Biden or any other Democrat truly care about, the education of kids in urban areas or teachers' unions. Then, Marxism seeks to eliminate history, the founding, and eventually all Americanism. The identity politics movement upsets genuine Marxists who argue that all things relate to materialism, not to mention that Karl Marx was a racist. This is why Marxists reject the concept of distinction and individuality so that all people will focus on the all-provident central government, the state. The goal must be to treat individuals as human beings not as part of a group, caste, or class as Marx suggests. Groupthink and bigotry promote government power to make decisions on race or sex, this gives the government power they must not have. Later, Biden is taking off where Obama left off; he is the new imperial President. Biden has now passed 28 executive orders surpassing the 6 orders previously signed by Presidents Trump and Obama at the same time in their first weeks in office. Also, Chuck Schumer suggests declaring a climate 'state of emergency' so that Biden could use presidential power to usurp the Constitution. Afterward, Rand Paul joins the show, to explain that the impeachment trial to remove President Trump is dead on arrival. It's an illegitimate process that is unconstitutional and has no chance of success. Paul again rejected how irresponsible it was to even suggest that Trump had anything to do with the pre-planned attack on the Capitol. He also reiterated the importance of adhering to the Constitution for impeachment and the creation of voting laws.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
