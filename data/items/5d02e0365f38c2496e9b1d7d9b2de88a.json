  "description": "In his new book, Man Seeks God: My Flirtations with the Divine (Twelve, 2011), Eric Weiner, former correspondent for both NPR and the New York Times, confronts his spiritual side after a medical emergency takes him too close to death. Weiner’s quest to understand faith carries him across the globe, from Las Vegas, where he gets to know a few Raelians a little more closely than he’d like, to Turkey, where he practices whirling with Sufi dervishes.\n\nIn our interview, we talked about whether his frequent jokes are a defense mechanism of some kind, why his Hebrew school experience lacked meaning, how the Rinpoche insulted Cher, and why people seem to need to find some type of divine meaning in life. Read all about it, and more, in Weiner’s amusing new book.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
