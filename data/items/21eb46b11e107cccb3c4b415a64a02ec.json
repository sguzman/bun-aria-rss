  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! We're officially in a stock picker's market. The gold and junior mining sectors are not what they were two years ago. You used to be able to just take a dart, throw it, and be up 200% - 300%... But market dynamics have shifted. These are sectors that have recovered significantly since record-level lows. And now that the market has gone up, extra homework on the individual companies is a must. To begin today's show, I explain exactly what investors need to look for in these risky markets... and how to tell if their flagship mining projects are worth betting on. Switching gears... I then talk about the difference between American and Canadian stock exchanges... and why I always push listeners away from the OTC. Many of my stock recommendations fall under Canadian listed exchanges. And as I explain on the show... the more volume, the safer the exchange. Then, to end the episode, I share with listeners one of the biggest market disconnects today. This is a popular stock that has recently come down 8, 9 points and is currently sitting at a bargain price. Don't bet against Warren Buffett here. This particular company is spending a lot of money in all the right growth markets. Your'e getting paid to wait. Other topics talked about: An updated outlook of a stock I recommended 6 years ago - Steel Dynamics (STLD)...A break down on how private-placement offerings work... And an update on Amir Adnani's GoldMining (GOLD) Special thanks to Luke, Paul, Jared, Daniel, and Michael for all the great questions. Keep em coming!",
