The 2015 Emmy winner and 2016 Emmy-nominated actress not only fields some of the most outrageous \"Dealbreaker\" questions to date (you'll never think of the name \"Heather\" the same way), but beats Anna handily in a game of \"Football Player or Stripper\" (same goes for \"Lucious Pusey\"). Regina and Anna also practice accepting Oscars on each other's behalf, read lines from a new stoner movie in a hilarious audition improv, and role-play a mother/daughter-in law having an unusual heart-to-heart. Later, Regina, Anna, and Sim talk to a newly-engaged woman whose fiancé's family remains inappropriately close with his ex-wife.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
