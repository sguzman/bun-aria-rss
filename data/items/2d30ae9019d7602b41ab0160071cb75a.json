Engineering in Computer Science</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Previous Profile  >>></strong></td>\n<td><strong>Current Profile</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Company: Amdocs<br />Profile: <strong>SQL, UNIX Developer</strong><br /><strong>(Ordering and Billing)</strong><br />Designation: System Engineer<br />Domain: Telecom<br />Experience: 2 years</td>\n<td>Company: TSystems <br />Designation: <strong>Consultant</strong><br />Profile: <strong>Data Science</strong><br />Designation: Data Scientist<br />Domain: Telecom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"> </div>\n\n\n\n<h3>My journey into Data Science<br /><br /></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Why Data Science?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Day by day, the technology is evolving. I didn’t see myself getting the career growth I wanted with the technology I was working on before (SQL/UNIX). As anyone in IT would know, having a job as a System Engineer in SQL/UNIX these days is very mundane. I thought I wouldn’t survive for long. That was the main motivation to keep myself updated with the latest tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it came to choosing the new tech, I found myself being more keen towards Data Science. It’s very interesting and insightful. It called to my intellectual side. It’s like you’re creatively playing with data and getting business results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Why Dimensionless?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a funny story. When I decided to go with Data Science, I enrolled in a classroom course mainly because I was never comfortable with Online Classes. It was mostly theory and my experience was neutral. <br />Since I was already working as a System Engineer using SQL, I had the database part covered at my end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was only when I started giving interviews, that I realized that their course curriculum and faculty was sub-par. A lot of the interview questions asked were not even covered in the lectures. When I went back to them with these doubts, they said it was out of syllabus.<br />Then I tried to learn by myself. I checked out some free courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of my interviews, I met this guy. He was a fellow candidate and he seemed pretty confident. We got to talking and he told me that he did a Data Science specialization course from Dimensionless. He was so satisfied with the course that I could feel his genuineness. Obviously, I got very excited to know more about Dimensionless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next thing I did was I spoke to their counsellors and joined in the next batch itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Experience with Dimensionless?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>TBH, before taking up this course with Dimensionless, I was convinced that I can only learn properly in a physical classroom. I thought physical classrooms provide more support and are more accessible. Now I am much more comfortable in online training. Online or offline, if the teachers are good and doubts are handled, it doesn’t matter. It was so comfortable to attend classes from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew why that guy in the interview was so happy with Dimensionless. The doubt-solving was quick. Teachers were available on call too. The sessions had a lot of communication and they were interactive overall. The course content was practical and easy to follow too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Career Transition to Data Science</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the course in 5 months, I did some more self-study because I thought why someone would select me over an experienced Data Science professional.  I delayed applying for jobs. Finally, after some moral support from their mentors and mock interviews with Dimensionless HR, I built up the courage to apply for jobs and give interviews. Among other companies, I applied at TSystems, Wipro and Capegemini, and I got selected in all three!!! Imagine my excitement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started giving interviews I realized that interviewers judge you based on knowledge and not past experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Data Science, as well as every other advanced technology, the main thing that matters is practical knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you also want career transition like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchi-saboo-5126287a/\">Ruchi</a>? <br /><strong>Follow this </strong><a href=\"http://dimensionless.in/\"><strong>link</strong></a>, and make it possible with Dimensionless Techademy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, if you want to read more about data science, you can <strong>read our blogs </strong><a href=\"http://dimensionless.in/blog\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
