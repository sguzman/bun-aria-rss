  "description": "Last Friday, a surging crowd killed at least eight people and left hundreds injured at Travis Scott’s music festival Astroworld in Houston. Public uproar over the needless deaths has placed responsibility at the rapper’s feet - and at those of police officers who failed to intervene and shut the show down.\n\nHow did Scott’s signature “raging” spill over into a mass casualty event? And how do we tease out blame between Scott himself, and the way music festivals are run? \n\nGuest: Tom Breihan, senior editor at Stereogum. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
