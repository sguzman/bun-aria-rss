  "description": "Earlier this week, a Fed member suggested hiking interest rates from 2.5% to 4% by the end of the year. Daniel explains why this isn’t feasible without crashing the market… I go on a rant about the Fed… and why idiotic comments from its members continue to be the biggest risk in the markets. For instance, the Fed said it needs to see evidence inflation is coming down before it alters its rate-hiking path. I give it to them… Turning to earnings: Ford (F) finally seems to be getting its act together… but it continues to drive me crazy. Paypal (PYPL) surged following earnings. Daniel breaks down why he’s bullish on the stock—but it has nothing to do with its results. And finally, I call out popular hedge fund manager Chamath Palihapitiya for taking advantage of SoFi (SOFI) investors… and how to find great companies that have gotten wrecked. In this episode:  How the Fed is causing volatility [3:00] The Fed is made up of idiots [6:25] Convincing evidence inflation is coming down [11:25] The Fed could cause the market to fall 25% [13:10] Ford is getting its act together [22:50] Why Daniel is bullish on PYPL [27:10] How Chamath took advantage of SOFI investors [32:00]  Enjoyed this episode?
