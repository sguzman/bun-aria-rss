It was candid, it was fun, and there was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thephysicsgirl/status/1123711675008471041\" target=\"_blank\"><i>a lot </i>of latte art</a>.  From burning questions posed to YouTube Leadership to meaningful discussions with peers, the creators and artists who joined us fostered a special kind of community this year. There was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EhBeeFamily/status/1123677956822458373\" target=\"_blank\">energy and excitement</a> in the air that was palpable and spirited, which gave the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smartereveryday/status/1123791820541001728\" target=\"_blank\">rollerskating extravaganza</a> extra pizzazz.<br /><br />We caught up with a few creators right after Susan Wojcicki (CEO), Neal Mohan (CPO) and Robert Kyncl (CBO) spoke about how creators and artists are the very heart of YouTube.<br /><br />“The Internet’s always going to be asking for more, but hearing them talk about it in person — their steps and plans, what they’re planning to do to fix it, and how many people are part of the team to work on very specific issue — it’s comforting to hear them say that and know that they’re on our side,” said Lily Hevesh, the domino artist behind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hevesh5/\" target=\"_blank\">Hevesh5</a>.<br /><br /><i>Interviews have been condensed for clarity.</i><br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0zck76ObIXI/XMxiaMdgEAI/AAAAAAAACMk/AihSHjsRbQQSupy3GU7sXs9QWZMMjOSPACLcBGAs/s1600/creatorsummit-sam.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-original-width=\"1000\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0zck76ObIXI/XMxiaMdgEAI/AAAAAAAACMk/AihSHjsRbQQSupy3GU7sXs9QWZMMjOSPACLcBGAs/s640/creatorsummit-sam.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Sam Tsui performing at Creator Summit (Photo by Alexander Stein)</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&amp;v=ylDmCWp0_9s\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Tsui</a></h3><br /><i>Sam Tsui is a singer-songwriter who’s been on YouTube since August 2011.</i><br /><b>YouTube: Favorite part so far?</b><br /><b>Sam Tsui:</b> It’s incredible to have the face-to-face with YouTube, with Susan [Wojcicki], and all the people who make this platform possible.
