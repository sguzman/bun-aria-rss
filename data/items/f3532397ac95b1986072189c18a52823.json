  "description": "Making All Things New. Today, we sit down and discuss the version of Christianity we’ve been handed and the version that appears in the Bible. Mike offers a different take on the narrative, one where the goal is 'New Creation,' not the judgment —-> heaven/hell idea we were raised with. Is God’s goal to make new things or to make all things new? How does Jesus speak to and embody this idea of 'New Creation?' Where do we fit into it? What are the implications for evangelism & church? How are we to relate to our communities and the world at large within this ideology? \n\nThis is part one. We will follow it with a conversation on Judgement and Sin.\n\nHere is a graphic that illustrates the concept: https://www.instagram.com/p/CNShxDmrNLI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nBooks!\nSurprised By Hope: https://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Hope-Rethinking-Resurrection-Mission-dp-0061551821/dp/0061551821/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=\n\nThe Skeletons in God’s Closet: http://www.joshuaryanbutler.com/books/the-skeletons-in-gods-closet/\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
