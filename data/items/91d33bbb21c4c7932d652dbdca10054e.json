  "description": "President Biden delivered his first State of the Union address last night. Daniel shares what he thought Biden did well… while I focus on what upset me about the speech—and what politicians could learn from Mike Tyson. [0:45] Of course, much of the address centered on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Daniel and I discuss the economic sanctions against Russia… whether they’re working as planned… and how the war will impact energy prices. [9:53] Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to raise interest rates by 0.25% later this month... saying he “hopes” inflation goes down. While I’m riled up about the flip-flopping Fed, Daniel says I shouldn’t be surprised. [14:25] Warren Buffett released his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) shareholders over the weekend. Daniel explains why every investor should read these letters… and a couple of items that stood out to him from this year’s. And we discuss why Berkshire will benefit from inflation. [20:10] Next, we focus on Buffett's comments regarding share buybacks. I break down why you should pay attention to Buffett’s share repurchases… And Daniel highlights one company aggressively buying back its stock. [26:16] During its recent earnings report, semiconductor company Ambarella (AMBA) said the supply chain crisis is far from over. This will have a huge impact across sectors—and automakers in particular. [31:48] Speaking of autos, Ford (F) continues to spew bulls*** about its electric vehicles (EVs). I go on a small rant about the company’s tactics to distract from its problems… and why I’d consider shorting Ford right now. [33:13] Enjoyed this episode?
