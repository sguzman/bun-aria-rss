  "description": "<p>Host Sonari Glinton checks in with college student Jacob Sarasohn. When his art school classes went virtual, Jacob decided to put college on hold and become an Emergency Medical Technician. We find out how that experience changed him and if he’ll go back to college. At Georgetown University, we meet Bushra Shaikh and her professor, Elizabeth Grimm, who found ways to make their Zoom class meaningful and effective. Tech CEO LaShana M. Lewis had a difficult time finding her place at college and ended up leaving without a degree. She struggled for years to land a job in her field, until an apprenticeship program offered a breakthrough. Finally, Sonari speaks with Brenda A. Allen, President of Lincoln University, a historically Black university about how a shift to virtual school during the pandemic has brought home the value of the campus experience.</p><p><em>Disclaimers: The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
