While macro conditions remain uncertain, the conditions of the crypto markets and ecosystems are perhaps surprisingly more digestible.</p> <p>With the Proof-of-Stake merge on the way and the modular blockchain thesis taking shape, the inevitable conclusion is that ETH is destined to go up.</p> <p>What’s 2022 going to look like?
