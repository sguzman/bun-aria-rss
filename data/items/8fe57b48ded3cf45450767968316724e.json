We'll chat about her new book, <em><a href=\"http://quincandy.com/secretmessage/?mc_cid=001b1d783d&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D\">Candy Is Magic</a></em>, how she creates her happiness from scratch, and what it’s like to live with the world’s cutest cat.</p>\n<p>We'll also talk about running a modern candy company. When she was getting QUIN off the ground, Jami wanted to make great handmade treats, but without the yucky ingredients found in conventional candy. Today, she uses Oregon-grown fruit, fresh cream and butter, and all-natural extracts and colorings to make her caramels, gumdrops, lollipops, and something she calls Chocolate Magic Dust.</p>\n",
