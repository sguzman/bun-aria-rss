  "description": "<p>Here on How to Money, we often debate the merits of a purchase, not because we hate spending money and try to avoid doing so at all costs, but because we are constantly checking ourselves to avoid the MINDLESS spending of our money. It is a challenge to make every financial decision with the same level of intentionality but we find we are often more wasteful when we are feeling too tired or lazy to be intentional. But just being aware of some of the triggers and circumstances that lead us to spend in ways that don't align with our financial goals can help us see it and own it when it happens, and lead us to effectively change our habits for good. Being excited to spend our money mindfully on a purchase that aligns with our financial goals is a good, healthy feeling- whereas impulse spending can leave a spending hangover, often accompanied by debt. Listen as we run through several rules that help us be mindful spenders.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a National Cherry Blossom FestivAle by Old Ox Brewery which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to our good buddy Andrew for donating this beer to the show!
