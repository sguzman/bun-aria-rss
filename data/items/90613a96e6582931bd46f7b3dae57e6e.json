The guys also answer some listener questions including what movies best put them in the mood to fight or go to war, they check in with the Boobz Brothers down under, and Billy Tubes wages on all out war on the Rocky Mountains as they talk about a treasure 12 years in the making that was recently found. Have a good one, and enjoy.</p>\n",
