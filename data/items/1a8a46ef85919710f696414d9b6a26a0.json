  "description": "<p>How do you recover from COVID brain?</p> <p>Most people are familiar with the physical symptoms of COVID, but it also affects the brain. Things like memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and loss of taste and smell can last much longer than the initial infection. With more information emerging every day, it can start to feel overwhelming and increase your overall stress. But there are actionable steps you can implement in your daily lifestyle to reduce these symptoms and maintain your physical and brain health.</p> <p>To go more in depth on this topic, we’re excited to have Dr. Daniel Amen back on our show. Dr. Amen is a physician, double-board certified psychiatrist, and founder of Amen Clinics and BrainMD. He’s a twelve-time New York Time bestselling author, including his latest book \"You, Happier: The 7 Neuroscience Secrets of Feeling Good Based on Your Brain Type.\"</p> <p>As a physician and psychiatrist, Dr. Amen saw first-hand the emotional and mental impact COVID had on his patients. By using the over 200,000 brain scans in his clinic, he developed several practical recommendations to help you reduce COVID-related inflammation and maintain your overall brain health. If you or someone you know has been struggling with long-term COVID brain symptoms, this episode is for you.</p> <p>Please remember to consult a physician or other health practitioner before making any major decisions regarding your physical or mental health. This episode is not intended to treat or diagnose any medical conditions.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
