  "title": "1. The NIL Era: Paying NCAA Athletes Is Changing Sports",
  "description": "College sports is closing out the first year of the name, image and likeness era for athletes.\nSince July 1 2021, athletes have been free to earn money from marketing deals on their NIL rights, including through endorsements, appearances, modeling, and hosting camps. One UCLA basketball player even launched his own cryptocurrency. The right of publicity now belongs to collegiate athletes. This comes after decades of strictly enforced rules barring student athletes from receiving any compensation beyond the value of their scholarships.\nNIL rights mark an inflection point in both college sports broadly, as well as the decades-long legal battle to allow athletes to share in the billion-dollar collegiate sports industry. But lingering questions remain. Even among those who say athletes deserve to earn money, some say the current NIL state laws and NCAA guidelines aren't working.\nIn this first episode of a two-part series, the [Un]Common Law podcast will examine the NIL landscape, some of the cases that led to this new era, the patchwork of state laws, and the legal and policy concerns going forward.\nIn this episode we speak with:\n\n\nKyle Jahner, a reporter covering trademark and intellectual property for Bloomberg Law.\n\n\nTim Nevious, a sports attorney who was part of the original legal team that brought the Alston vs. NCAA case.\n\n\nDavid McGriff, an private practice attorney who specializes in setting up NIL deals.  \n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
