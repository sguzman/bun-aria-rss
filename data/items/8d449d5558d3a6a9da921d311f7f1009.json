  "description": "<p>These last few years have left so many of us feeling drained, stifled, without energy, excitement or well, happiness or joy. At least not consistently. And that’s understandable, it’s been a tough moment. But, what if access to feeling these things was more in your control, regardless of your immediate circumstance, than you thought? That feeling of being alive, of flourishing, of feeling positive and hopeful and connected, it’s so important to our ability to live a good life. And after all, that’s what GLP has been all about, for a decade now.</p><p>So, today, we’re going to dive into a powerful, science-backed model that comes out of the world of positive psychology, that’ll help you understand how to reclaim those feelings of flourishing or aliveness that, for so many, seem to have gone missing over these last few years, no matter what life has delivered to your doorstep. And, along with each element, we’re including specific actions you can take to start feeling more like yourself, more alive and capable and connected than maybe you have in a long while. A quick reminder, I am not a mental health professional. While the ideas and the framework and specific exercises I’m about to share come from the world of research and clinical application, if appropriate for your unique needs and circumstances, please be sure to check in with friends, family, the many freely available mental health resources, and a qualified mental health professional. Okay, now, so excited to share today’s exploration of how to feel more alive in this new year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast-worksheets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">You can find the 1-page worksheet HERE.</a></p><p><strong>Find All Of The Episodes In This Series:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/fa2f801d6f182ca1e6af7fe86c3cbdb1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Do the Ultimate Year-End Review</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/c373f46ebdbdab7dadc293b510db0b42\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Accomplish Big Things | The 2022 Plan</a></p><br><p><strong>My new book</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a>!</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
