  "description": "The deadline for players on the franchise tag to sign an extension has passed and Dak Prescott still doesn't have a long-term deal. Derrick Henry does though! Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Jared Dubin to break down everything that happened and didn't happen on Wednesday. The guys first focus on Dak and the Cowboys failure to lock up their young QB for the long haul (3:00). How will the situation continue to play out through the season and into next offseason? Next, in a bit of a surprise move, the Titans did come to an agreement with Derrick Henry (35:30) Was it the right move? Will, Ryan, John and Jared also address big new contracts for Chris Jones (41:00) and Myles Garrett (45:00) as well as the other players on the tag that will be playing on 1-year deals. What does the future look like for players like Yannick Ngakoue, AJ Green, Joe Thuney and Hunter Henry? All that and more on this reaction pod. \nNominate Pick Six for The People's Choice Podcast Awards: https://www.podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @johnbreech, @ryanwilsonCBS, @jadubin5\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
