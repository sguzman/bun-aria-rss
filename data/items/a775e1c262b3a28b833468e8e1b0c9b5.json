She’s been held in a Russian prison ever since — and a court recently extended her detention until May 19. \n\nWhy is Russia pursuing charges so vigorously against an American basketball player with a large Russian fanbase? And how long could it be until Griner gets to go home?\n\nGuest: Meredith Cash, sports reporter for Insider.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
