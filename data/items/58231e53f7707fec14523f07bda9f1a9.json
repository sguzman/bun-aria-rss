This is a very difficult job for all the reasons that leadership is difficult, management is difficult and that software development is a difficult discipline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For various reasons &#8211; we <em>as a species</em> suck at writing software. Writing great software is HARD. Nevertheless we as a community are learning a lot more about this, and we at least have some patterns that work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wanted to share some lessons I&#8217;ve personally learned over the last few years from operating in teams and building teams. I&#8217;ll also link them to a sport I love &#8211; Rugby. Even if you don&#8217;t know Rugby, the lessons should still be relevant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Know your role</strong>: It&#8217;s important to know your role and operate in that role &#8211; a mistake a lot of leaders and operators make is that they either try to do <em>someone else</em>&#8216;s job &#8211; and then try to do too much and fail. Or they don&#8217;t realise that they&#8217;re part of a larger system. In Rugby &#8211; this is like situations where the defensive line becomes misaligned. If there&#8217;s not a solid defensive line other teams can attack. Alignment is super important in executing any strategy, and not forgetting that as a leader a big part of your job is to set the direction for the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Building and forming trust is important</strong>: A lot of training for sports is about forming trust among the team. This can be fostered by drills etc &#8211; however it&#8217;s often best formed by performance. This also means though that like in sports, the relationships matter. If the team doesn&#8217;t trust the coach, or even within the team, such issues need to be addressed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>The competition are human too</strong>: It&#8217;s easy to respect your competition too much, or even think you can&#8217;t win a big customer because your product isn&#8217;t good enough. But self-belief matters, and you need to play your own game-plan in Rugby, in business you need to play your own strategy which suits your team. <br><br>4. <strong>Best form of defence is attack</strong>: In Rugby it&#8217;s often better to not focus on defensiveness, it&#8217;s best to just attack. In startups it&#8217;s the same thing &#8211; the most debilitating thing for a competitor is to simply be able to move faster than them. Speed wins in business as in Rugby. One of the questions to ask is what you can do as a leader to encourage agility and speed. It&#8217;s often worth thinking about what you can do to improve the speed of the team. In sport that may be better training, or better drills. In business &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot you can do to encourage speed &#8211; send that email today, get that prototype done today, don&#8217;t wait until next quarterly planning to schedule that sprint. <em>Set your operating cadence to run</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>You have to analyse and learn from what went wrong:</strong> In software we often have &#8216;postmortems&#8217; about outages. A fundamental part of that, like with sports is that in a fast moving environment you need to adapt to change. It&#8217;s sort of a cliche. But it&#8217;s good to be honest with yourself about what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t. Fundamentally though this is hard because people feel shame. And it&#8217;s easy to regress to &#8216;blaming others&#8217;. Remember you&#8217;re all part of the same team. This is where techniques like <a href=\"https://kellanem.com/notes/whys-of-organizational-design\">5 why&#8217;s</a> can come into it. Because often it&#8217;s more about the system than about a particular player. It&#8217;s easy in sport to say think &#8211; &#8216;it was the player who missed the last tackle who gave it away&#8217;, but often it&#8217;s poor alignment, or other mistakes that happened earlier in the game that caused things to go wrong. <br><br>Those are just some thoughts, I&#8217;ll keep fleshing this out.
