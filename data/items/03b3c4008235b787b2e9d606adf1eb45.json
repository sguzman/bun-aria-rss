  "description": "<p>We're so happy to be bringing you a story that Mr. Eric told along with our friend Jonathan Cormur on his podcast, Dorktales Storytime. Normally, we replay an old favorite once a month, so I hope you all enjoy this rare treat!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jonincharacter.com/dorktales-storytime-podcast/\"><u>Dorktales Storytime</u></a>, hosted by voice actor Jonathan Cormur, is a podcast featuring slightly wacky and very geeky retellings of classic fairy tales with social-emotional lessons and the untold stories about the hidden heroes of history.</p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by<a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/\"> <u>KiwiCo</u></a>!

Sherlock Nettlesbee, the great deducing squirrel detective, joins Jonathan and Mr. Redge in an afternoon of imagination and good old-fashioned make believe. When their cloud gazing doesn’t cut it, Sherlock declares that “the Improv Game is afoot!” Can the trio find inspiration from Mary and her little lamb, Lula? Yes and…they’re sure to find a whole-lotta playful, floofy fun everywhere they go!</p>\n<p><strong>PARENTS, TEACHERS AND HOMESCHOOLERS:</strong> This story is about making time for imaginary play! Improvisation, or improv, is when you make up a story, or a scene, or a little bit of music on the spot. The ‘Yes And’ game is when you listen to another person in your improv scene and agree with what they are saying—that’s the ‘yes’ part—and you use your own ideas to build on their thoughts—that’s the ‘and’ part. It’s entertaining and very fun, plus it also encourages listening skills, collaboration and cooperation.</p>\n<p>Go to the episode webpage: <a href=\"https://jonincharacter.com/mary-had-a-little-yes-and\"><u>https://jonincharacter.com/mary-had-a-little-yes-and</u></a></p>\n<p>Visit the Dorktales Storytime Podcast website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://jonincharacter.com/dorktales-storytime-podcast/\"><u>https://jonincharacter.com/dorktales-storytime-podcast/</u></a></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong> Today’s story was written by Amy Thompson, and edited by Molly Murphy.
