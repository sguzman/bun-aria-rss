We open the show with a clip of a super cool guy hitting on ladies at the gym and causing a scene. Is he the son of FedSmoker? We then watch clips of a lunatic crusading for acceptance and understanding of a super stigmatized group, an enraged Uber driver, and we talk about wild bumper sticker culture. We see Patty's doppelganger give a sermon, discuss why compliments from black people are the best kind of compliment you can get, and we try to find a video of an Asian guy crushing \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston. Will Nadav find it? We have a new video from \"I turn into a telescope\" guy and he's got some information to share with us. We go through a few Horrible or Hilarious and a fun bunch of Christina's TikTok curations.</p>\n",
