  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, Sam is joined by Richard Dawkins to talk about his new book <em>Books Do Furnish A Life: Reading and Writing Science</em>. Richard tells Sam - among much else - what makes science writing (and science fiction) exciting; the questions science can (and can't) answer; why he felt it necessary to invest so much of his time arguing against religion; and why the left recurrent laryngeal nerve of the giraffe is such an odd shape.   </div>\n",
