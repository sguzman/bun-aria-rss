  "description": "<p><strong>This week on philosophy Connor and Dan finally get back to something Connor actually gives a shit about: robutts. Specifically, whether we should be afraid of them or impressed by them. To answer these questions, your hosts consult the One Pump Chumpsky himself, Noam Chomsky. The linguistics expert from MIT has some pretty damning things to say about all this Artificial Intelligence fervor, and one person on this podcast is happy to hear it (hint: it's not Connor). All things being equal: this is a fun episode! Enjoy it!</strong></p>",
