Be proud of the stuff that has knocked you down. Be proud of the crap, the adversity that you've gone through and it didn't break you. You came through the other side of the tunnel.” - Jay Glazer<br /> <br />They say you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.<br /> <br />This is especially true for Jay Glazer - and for his latest book: Unbreakable: How I Turned My Depression and Anxiety into Motivation and You Can Too<br /> <br />If you’ve been watching Jay on camera over the years, you might find it hard to believe that, under the surface, he lives with an almost daily struggle with anxiety and depression.<br /> <br />But he doesn’t let it keep him down or stop him dead in his tracks - instead he uses it as fuel for his relentless drive and motivation.<br /> <br />In today’s interview, we go deep on the importance of loyalty, being of service, and the importance of learning to build yourself up from the inside out, rather than looking for validation only from the outside.<br /> <br />If you’ve ever struggled with anxiety and depression and felt like you had to “fake it” to get through the day, this one’s for you.<br /> <br />Likewise, I especially recommend that you check out Jay’s new book, Unbreakable: How I Turned My Depression and Anxiety into Motivation and You Can Too: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33CWuXf\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/33CWuXf</a><br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br />00:00 | Introduction<br />01:22 | What Drove Jay to Endure Years of Hardship<br />06:44 | Authenticity, Loyalty, and Helping Others<br />09:52 | What “The Gray” and “The Blue” Mean to Jay<br />19:52 | Jay’s Journey to Find Happiness<br />27:59 | Merging Vets and Players<br />34:04 | The Origins of Jay’s New Book<br />39:39 | Helping Others Not Feel Alone in Their Struggle<br />43:40 | The Balance Between Toughness and Caring<br /> <br /> <br />QUOTES:<br />“As a result of me not knowing how to build myself from the inside out, I had to go do everything that I could to try to get some love from the outside in.” [02:28]<br /> <br />“Whoever says quitting is not an option is the biggest moron in the world, because it's an option every day, right? It just sits on your shoulder every day.” [04:55]<br /> <br />“I think if all of us do that a lot more for each other, where we're not just thinking about, “Hey, how can I get by, how can I move myself?” the world would be a much better place. And we'd all be able to stress a little less, but I think too many people just take care of themselves.” [09:03]<br /> <br />“The universe is not against me, and the sky is not falling - hasn't fallen all this time yet. I wake up every day feeling like it's going to - a lot of people, successful or not, have that same fear. But no one talks about it. I’m like fuck it, I'm going to talk about it. I’m gonna put it all out there for us.” [24:22]<br /> <br />“I tell them all, ‘That game starts, that cage door locks, you gotta make that guy across from you beg to get out of that cage with you.
