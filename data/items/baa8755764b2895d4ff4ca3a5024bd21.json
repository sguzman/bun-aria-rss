  "description": "<p>There are Christmas trees and reindeer and candy canes, but Santa Claus is probably one of the most familiar images intertwined with Christmas. Most of us as kids were raised with the warning that you better be good, for goodness sake, or you would end up on Santa's naughty list and thus receive coal in your stocking. But as we trace back the various traditions associated with the holiday season, we come upon a character that has been around longer than good old St. Nick and the warnings that came with him, were far more dire. On this episode, we will explore the origins, history and terror that are a part of the legend of Krampus. Moment in Oddity features the Dragon's Triangle and This Day in History features the abandonment of the Mary Celeste.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-87-legend-of-krampus.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-87-legend-of-krampus.html</a></p> <p>Make a resolution in 2016 to become an Executive Producer and become an intregal part of bringing the podcast to the world:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
