Earlier that evening, his parents had talked to him about his use of marijuana in their home after his mom found a small amount of it in the pocket of his jacket. Before he went to bed, he and his dad made plans to do some work the next day, agreed on a time, and said \"I love you\" to each other. This would be the last time James’ father spoke to his youngest son. The next day, his parents realized that he was missing and called the local police. Searches for James commenced, however, no trace of James has ever been found.</p><p>If you have any information about James’ disappearance, you can call the Vegreville Royal Canadian Mounted Police at 780-632-2223.</p><p>You can follow James’ story on Facebook at: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FindJamesCandy\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/FindJamesCandy</a></p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://vanished.robinhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robinhood</a>-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://vanished.robinhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robinhood</a>&nbsp;is giving listeners a FREE stock like Apple, Ford or Sprint to help build your portfolio!
