George’s mother, Tillis, was confused by this interaction but never imagined this would be the last time she would ever see her son. As the days passed with no word from George, Tillis reported him missing. And since that day, she has never stopped searching for her son.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of George James, please contact the Montgomery Police Department at 334-625-2532.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p><a href=\"http://goodrx.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GoodRX</a>- For simple, smart savings on your prescriptions, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://goodrx.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GoodRX.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
