  "description": "Lawfare: The dirty Democrat midterm plan unleashed. Merrick Garland waited weeks to approve warrant for Mar-a-Lago search. Clay says, \"How do you debate whether or not to grant these warrants as the attorney general for weeks, if it is such a clear-cut case?\" Buck's take: \"They're just using the legal apparatus as a weapon of politics in every way they possibly can.\" Of course, Buck says, regarding the raid, but for everything, like the announcement about Rudy Giuliani. DOJ admits FBI over-collected Trump documents, will give back passports and privileged documents in the next two weeks. Norah O'Donnell caught reporting lie about Trump's passports. Primary day in Alaska and Wyoming. After her primary loss today, Liz Cheney is going to make herself a martyr. The Democrat plan to win your vote is to sue all of their political opponents into oblivion or prosecute them.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
