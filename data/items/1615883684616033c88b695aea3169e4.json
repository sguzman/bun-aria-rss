  "description": "<p>We introduce the notion of performative power, which measures the ability of\na firm operating an algorithmic system, such as a digital content\nrecommendation platform, to cause change in a population of participants. We\nrelate performative power to the economic study of competition in digital\neconomies. Traditional economic concepts struggle with identifying\nanti-competitive patterns in digital platforms not least due to the complexity\nof market definition. In contrast, performative power is a causal notion that\nis identifiable with minimal knowledge of the market, its internals,\nparticipants, products, or prices.\n</p>\n<p>Low performative power implies that a firm can do no better than to optimize\ntheir objective on current data. In contrast, firms of high performative power\nstand to benefit from steering the population towards more profitable behavior.\nWe confirm in a simple theoretical model that monopolies maximize performative\npower. A firm's ability to personalize increases performative power, while\ncompetition and outside options decrease performative power. On the empirical\nside, we propose an observational causal design to identify performative power\nfrom discontinuities in how digital platforms display content. This allows to\nrepurpose causal effects from various studies about digital platforms as lower\nbounds on performative power. Finally, we speculate about the role that\nperformative power might play in competition policy and antitrust enforcement\nin digital marketplaces.\n</p>",
