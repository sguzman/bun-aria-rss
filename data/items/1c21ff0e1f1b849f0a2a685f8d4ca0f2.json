  "title": "David Bashevkin, \"Sin•a•gogue: Sin and Failure in Jewish Thought (Academic Studies Press, 2019)",
  "description": "By its very nature, the ideals of religion entail sin and failure. Judaism has its own language and framework for sin that expresses themselves both legally and philosophically. Both legal questions―circumstances where sin is permissible or mandated, the role of intention and action―as well as philosophical questions―why sin occurs and how does Judaism react to religious crisis―are considered within this volume. This book will present the concepts of sin and failure in Jewish thought, weaving together biblical and rabbinic studies to reveal a holistic portrait of the notion of sin and failure within Jewish thought.\nThe suffix \"agogue\" means to lead or grow. Here as well, Sin•a•gogue: Sin and Failure in Jewish Thought (Academic Studies Press, 2019) will provide its readers frameworks and strategies to develop even in the face of failure.\nMatthew Miller is a graduate of Yeshivat Yesodei HaTorah. He studied Jewish Studies and Linguistics at McGill for his BA and completed an MA in Hebrew Linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. He works with Jewish organizations in media and content distribution, such as TheHabura.com and RabbiEfremGoldberg.org.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
