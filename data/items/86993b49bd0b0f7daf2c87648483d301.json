Powerful men brought down by #MeToo or trying to make a comeback, and a Supreme Court nominee accused, then elevated to the bench. Questions about a murdered journalist, about election interference, about how much Facebook knew. A midterm vote that delivered one of the most diverse — and divided — governments in American history. Here’s what 2018 sounded like. </p><p>For more information on today’s episode, visit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/thedaily\" target=\"_blank\">nytimes.com/thedaily</a>.</p>\n",
