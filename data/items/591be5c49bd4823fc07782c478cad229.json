  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Joe Biden is off to Georgia to support a racist anti-Semite, Raphael Warnock. Biden went from embracing White separatists in the 1970s to embracing Black separatists in 2020. Democrats and media lie when they embrace nullification like confederates did and embrace secession with their sanctuary city policies. There's a growing wing of anti-Semites on the Democrat left just looking for new minorities to attack. Then, RINO establishment Republicans like Mitch McConnell have used President Trump just like they used the Tea Party in 2010. Ronald Reagan and Trump are the two greatest Republican presidents since Calvin Coolidge and RINO bureaucrats can't wait to undo all of their hard work. Later, they call the Trump lawyers crazy yet Joe Biden himself said we have to avoid situations where machines and records can be manipulated. Civil litigation requires a reasonable basis in fact and law and that all true inferences favor the plaintiff when dismissed, in particular when injunctive relief is sought. Afterward, but for Trump and Operation Warp Speed, America and the world would not have a coronavirus vaccine. Some critics of Hydroxychloroquine at the American Medical Association have now miraculously reversed course. Plus, the Biden campaign is incestuously connected with tech-fascists at Facebook.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
