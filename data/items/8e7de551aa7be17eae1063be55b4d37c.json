  "description": "<p>Wednesday 6/6- Today on the show we had basketball player Iman Shumpert stop by and the first thing asked was if the rumors were true about him and Drake's alleged baby mom, but the kicker is his wife Teyana Taylor was right next to him to hear the answer as a surprise to him. Also, Iman spoke on JR Smith, and his new EP. Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a man that threw his three-year-old son and two-year-old daughter in a dryer, and then recording it on Snapchat. Also, Angela helped some listeners out during \"Ask Yee\".</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
