What intrigued me most was (perhaps\nunsurprisingly) Stamper&rsquo;s description of how Merriam-Webster gets written, and\nwhat a striking resemblance that process has to many successful unstructured\ndata projects in the wild. I want to use this blog post to ruminate on this.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>First</strong> it begins with collection and curation of raw, unstructured data.\nStamper describes a fascinating process called <em>&ldquo;reading and marking&rdquo;</em>, whereby\neditors are assigned reading of current magazines, periodicals, blogs &mdash;\nalmost anything written in English, it seems &mdash; and read and underline any\nwords that catch their eye: new words, or words that get used in new ways.\n(This is, contrary to first impressions, a non-trivial task for which requires\ntraining: good readers-and-markers will pick up on the recent trend of <em>&ldquo;bored\nof&rdquo;</em>, instead of the more historically common <em>&ldquo;bored with&rdquo;</em> &mdash; this doesn&rsquo;t\nimply that <em>bored</em> is picking up a new meaning, but rather that <em>of</em> is&hellip;\nwhich as you can imagine, can get lexicographers very excited.)</p>\n<p>Stamper also describes the use of corpora, which are basically large structured\ndatasets of English being used in the wild &mdash; a dataset of tweets, say, or\ntranscripts of popular TV shows. As data gets increasingly commoditized, data\nprojects will increasingly have the luxury of starting with structured data (or\nat least, supplementing their raw unstructured data with structured data).</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong> is the actual structuring of the data. This entails a small army of\neditors dividing the entire dictionary amongst themselves, and defining (or\nrevising definitions of) each word by hand. In practice, that means opening up\nthe database of read-and-marked words (and maybe also the structured corpora),\nseeing if the current definition needs to be revised to accommodate new senses\nor usage of the word, and potentially writing or rewriting a definition for new\nwords&hellip; all in the span of maybe 15 minutes per word, on average.</p>\n<p>This seems to be the most labor-intensive step in the &ldquo;Merriam-Webster data\npipeline&rdquo;, but of course is also the one that adds the most value. There&rsquo;s no\nreason to think that this phase (or any of these three phases, really!) needs\nto be technologically sophisticated &mdash; the dictionary-maker still makes use of\nindex cards and filing cabinets today. Lucrative products <a href=\"https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the\">being underpinned by\nvast amounts of manual human labor is unfortunately nothing\nnew</a>, but\nit&rsquo;s good to be reminded of it. The fact that product value and technological\nsophistication are unrelated is underappreciated: you don&rsquo;t unlock more value\nfrom your data by writing better code or training better machine learning\nmodels.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally</strong> comes any ancillary features or datasets that Merriam-Webster\noffers on top of their existing data (a.k.a. the dictionary), simply because\nthey are best positioned to deliver them. Think of things like etymology,\npronunciations and dates<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It can seem funny that a dataset&rsquo;s true value to users (or, if you like, the\ndataset&rsquo;s &ldquo;product-market fit&rdquo;) might come from one of these subsidiary\ndatasets or features, instead of &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo;. This makes sense though:\njust as companies pivot products and business models to stay relevant, so too\ncan unstructured datasets &mdash; after all, it&rsquo;s not a huge stretch to think of\nunstructured datasets as products in their own right.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So here we have a recipe for a successful data project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Collect and curate raw, unstructured data,</li>\n<li>Structure it (ideally also adding some value to the data in the process, but\nstructuring the data is value enough), and</li>\n<li>Offer subsidiary datasets that you are best positioned to offer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What other data projects have followed this recipe?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Google Search</strong>: Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/googlebot\">crawled the\ninternet</a>,\nand continues to do so on an ongoing basis; they invented\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a> and other methods\nalgorithms to make searching (a weak form of &ldquo;structuring&rdquo;, I suppose) the\ninternet possible; and their question-answering and\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/carousel\">carousels</a>\nare good examples of ancillary features on top of their core offering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://cryptics.georgeho.org/\"><code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code></a></strong>: my <a href=\"https://www.georgeho.org/cryptic-clues/\">dataset\nof cryptic crossword clues</a> started by indexing several\nblogs for cryptic crosswords; I then wrote a ton of <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to parse\nstructured clue information out of the blog post HTML; finally, I ran some\nsimple searches and regular expressions to produce more valuable resources\nfor constructors of cryptic crosswords.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be convinced that this is the <em>only</em> way for data projects succeed,\nbut it does seem like a helpful pattern to keep in mind!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>I was surprised to learn that words with multiple definitions are defined\nin chronological order of first usage, and not, as I imagined, some kind of\n&ldquo;importance&rdquo; of definitions.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
