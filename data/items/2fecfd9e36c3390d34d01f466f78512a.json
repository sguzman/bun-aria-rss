  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about Yingmob's HummingBad Android malware, what it's up to and where it might be headed. We also learn about Eleanor, a Mac OS-X backdoor masquerading as a document conversion app, and we hear about the shifting form of the pseudo-DarkLeech ransomware campaign. The ThinkPwn zero-day may have a wider scope than originally thought. Observers wonder whether ISIS may be overplaying its bloody hand, and, of course, we find out what the FBI concluded in its investigation of former Secretary of State Clinton's emails. Joe Carrigan, from the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute, reminds us to take care when setting up a new router.",
