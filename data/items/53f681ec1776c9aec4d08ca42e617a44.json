  "description": "<p>Fear and anxiety stink. While there are other ways to phrase that more eloquently- that pretty much sums it up. If this uninvited guest (ahem fear, worry, overwhelm) has been a part of your narrative, Jordan is here to share that you are not the only one. In this special episode, Jordan brings on friend, speaker, digital content creator, female empowerment advocate, and Co-Founder of The Refined Woman, Kat Harris, as they share their own stories and experiences with overworking themselves and complete burnout. Listen in to learn how the women tackle their fear narratives, tangible tips to keep your feet on the ground when anxiety hits, and boundaries to set in order to lead the joyful life you were created for. In the wise words of Kat, sometimes we don’t know the lies we are believing until we look at the results of our actions. Sister, kick the lies and start believing the truth that you are strong, enough, and a delight.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Back to Basics Bootcamp: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/bootcamp-early-enrollment\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/bootcamp-early-enrollment</a></p>  <p>Silent Stressor Challenge: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/challenge\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/challenge</a></p>  <p>Moving From Fear to Freedom: <a href=\"http://www.therefinedwoman.com/freebie/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.therefinedwoman.com/freebie</a></p>  <p>Dr. Therese: <a href=\"http://www.drtherese.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.drtherese.com</a></p>  <p>Episode Details: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/An-open-conversation-on-stress-anxiety-burnout\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/An-open-conversation-on-stress-anxiety-burnout</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media network of podcasts.
