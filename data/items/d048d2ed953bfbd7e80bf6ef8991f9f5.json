  "description": "Our audiobook this week is ANYONE BUT YOU by Mae Harden \n\nSutton\n\nIt was supposed to be a quick boat trip out to the island. One morning, just enough time to get the photos I need for my research grant. But nothing ever goes according to plan. The ship captain I’m expecting is replaced at the last minute, leaving me stuck with Dean Carpenter. Cocky, charming, and unfairly sexy, my best friend’s older brother is six-and-a-half-feet worth of thorn in my side.\n\nThe more time I spend with Dean, the more I can grudgingly admit he’s not the teenager I remember. He still loves to push my buttons, but he’s found new ones. In places I can’t resist.\n\nDean\n\nFilling in for my brother has never had a better view. When Sutton O’Brien turns up on my pier, the mouthwatering curves are all-new, but her fiery spirit is just as intoxicating as I remember.\n\nStranded by a heart-pounding accident and a storm of biblical proportions, I’m given the one thing I want more than anything else: more time with my uptight little historian.\n\nNow I just have to show her how right we can be for each other. In bed and out.\n\nAnyone But You is a safe, quick, and steamy novella.\n\neBook Anyone But You: https://amzn.to/3ik1HYr\n\nThis ebook contains an exclusive bonus epilogue.\n\nMore Mae Harden eBooks: https://amzn.to/3jkdwNy\n\nOther Books Discussed\nThe Best Thing by Mariana Zapata\nKulti by Mariana Zapata\nFrom Lukov With Love by Mariana Zapata\nDear Aaron by Mariana Zapata\nBy A Thread by Lucy Score\n\nShows Mentioned\nMob Wives\n90-Day Fiance\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
