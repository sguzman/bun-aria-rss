We go over what really happened with Bryce’s arrest, Charli singing for the first time on the D’Amelio show, Tyra Banks refusing to get Landon Barker’s name right, Kanye West going off (again) on social media, TwitchCon breaking people’s backs, Nelk and Bob Menery feuding, Logan Paul being clowned over cheating comments, Jake Paul wanting to fight Draymond Green after his leaked sucker punch video, Bryce thoughts on Addison and Omer, and the backlash at Chris Pratt over his Mario voice. \n\nWe finish up the first section of the show with BFFs corner where we dig in what is going on with Bri/Bryce/Grace/Josh on tour, Bri skipping the 100th episode for Mr. Breast, and whether or not Josh is back with Ellie after their trip to Denver last week.\n\nWe then have our interview with Steve-O and his dog Wendy and discuss everything from Jackass, to his inability to quit chasing fame, sex addiciton, and his love for the UFC and Barstool’s own Paddy the Baddy and Molly the Meatball.\n\nSupport Our Sponsors!\nRaising Canes: Get your Cane’s fix fast by ordering through their app or online at https://barstool.link/RaisingCanesBSS\nTakis: Try Takis and face the intensity!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
