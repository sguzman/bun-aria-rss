  "description": "<p>These days, we hear a lot about carbs versus fats. But what about protein? It’s become the forgotten macronutrient. The diet-wars have been tough on protein, as strict vegans and believers in Paleo strongly disagree on the best forms of it to consume. But protein plays an essential role in good health. So despite the emotional response it elicits in many, it’s about time we pay it more attention. Protein is responsible for the growth and maintenance of new tissue (the building blocks for a strong body!) and makes up certain hormones that act as messengers, as well as the enzymes that we need for metabolic reactions.</p><br><p>Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I talk with Dr. Gabrielle Lyon about the importance of protein and why we should shift our dietary focus. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is an integrative physician who completed her fellowship in Nutritional Sciences and Geriatrics at Washington University, St. Louis.
