  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Elizabeth Frazer, Professor Kimberly Hutchings, Professor Paul Kelly | In his new book Paul Kelly considers the lessons about political violence, war and revolution to be learned from ten major thinkers over centuries – Thucydides, St Augustine, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Clausewitz, Lenin, Mao, Schmitt - and draws some lessons for our times. Join us as a panel of speaker discuss the theme of this new publication from LSE Press.\nModern international relations apparently shows a rapid swing back towards ‘great power’ politics and the use of force and violence in inter-state relations, dashing the millennial hopes of an irreversible shift towards a more ethically based international regime. Yet a whole succession of major thinkers have espoused versions of a ‘realist’ strand urging recognition of the inevitable presence of violence in international affairs.\nYou can order the book, Conflict, War & Revolution: the importance of violence in international politics, (UK delivery only) from our official LSE Events independent book shop, Pages of Hackney.",
