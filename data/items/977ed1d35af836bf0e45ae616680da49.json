  "description": "<p><strong>John Edelman </strong>and<strong> John McPhee </strong>met by chance while working for Edelman’s brother, Sam in the footwear business—their partnership would ultimately reshape the design industry as we know it. Together, they exponentially grew the Edelman family leather business, which they ultimately sold to Knoll for $67 million. They then went on to pull off a dramatic rescue job on then-struggling retailer Design Within Reach, selling that business to Herman Miller for $154 million. Now, the pair have their own ventures: McPhee is the new CEO of chilewich, and Edelman has acquired cult favorite design brand Heller. But they continue to work together and share insights on a fast-changing market. On this episode of the show, they talk about how difficult times lead to the most growth, and why betting on great design always makes for good business.  </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://crypton.com/\">Crypton</a>.  </p><p>Click <a href=\"www.businessofhome.com/futureofhome\">here</a> to register for the Future of Home conference. </p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"https://www.hellerinc.com/\"><strong>Heller</strong></a><br /><a href=\"https://www.chilewich.com/\"><strong>Chilewich</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.comd/dennisscully\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dennis Scully</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a></p><p> </p>\n",
