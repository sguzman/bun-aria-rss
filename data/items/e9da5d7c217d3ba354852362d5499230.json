  "title": "Ep 137 | The Doctor Who Nearly Got Joe Rogan Canceled | Dr. Robert Malone | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Two years after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, Glenn sits down with one of the biggest victims of the other pandemic it ushered in: censorship. Dr. Robert Malone invented the original mRNA vaccine technology in 1987 when he was a 28-year-old graduate student. As a high-level scientist, he’s been involved in the response to every major outbreak since AIDS. But more recently, he's been permanently suspended from Twitter and banned from LinkedIn. And his appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" triggered Neil Young so much that the musician requested that Spotify pull his music — all because Dr. Malone would rather speak freely than toe the approved line. But on this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Glenn challenges you, his audience, to ask Dr. Malone anything — censorship-free. Dr. Malone walks Glenn through all the complicated science behind mRNA vaccines, where he believes COVID-19 came from, and what he believes should have been done differently over the past two years. He also offers insight into the modern propaganda machine that has corrupted the scientific community.\n\nSponsors:\n\nThe Ministry of Pre-Born and Blaze Media are partnering up to help rescue babies from abortion in 2022.
