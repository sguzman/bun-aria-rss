    "media:description": "Joseph is diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a condition that results in a disregard for what most people deem right and wrong. He believes that he was not born this way and it was caused by trauma during a pivotal time in his development. Joseph wants others to know that antisocial personality disorder, which is often referred to as sociopathy or psychopathy, is not what the media often portrays.  \n\nSupport SBSK at https://www.patreon.com/SBSK\n\nSBSK's Socials: \nhttp://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisulmer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids",
