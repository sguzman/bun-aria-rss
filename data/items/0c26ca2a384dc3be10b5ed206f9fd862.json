  "description": "Depending on what you're into, Dave Rowntree is either one of the most famous drummers in modern rock 'n' roll history or the Councillor for the University Ward on Norfolk County Council. The Blur drummer talks about his own political journey, from young radical via headline Glastonbury slots and number 1 singles to solving leaks. There is of course some Cool Britannia chat, about how Dave felt about it at the time, the conversations within the band about new Labour and his view of it in retrospect. Dave also explains why the happiest day of his life wasn't beating Oasis to number 1, but meeting Gordon Brown in Downing Street.
