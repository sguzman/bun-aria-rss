  "description": "Three years ago this winter hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered in Kiev's Independence Square, demanding closer integration with Europe instead of Russia, and, eventually, forcing the government's resignation. But what's changed in the years since? Demonstrators continue to protest over poor economic conditions and entrenched corruption, and there has been an exodus of reformers from the government, claiming their attempts at change are being blocked. Meanwhile, despite intermittent ceasefires, the conflict in the eastern Donbass region with Russian-backed rebels seems no closer to peace. Join Owen Bennett Jones for a special edition of Newshour Extra in Kiev, as he and his expert panellists discuss the future of Ukraine.\n\nContributor names:\n\nSvitlana Zalischchuk - Member of the Ukrainian Parliament and former journalist.\nVladimir Gusak - Member of the Ukrainian Parliament.\nTaras Berezovets - Political analyst.\nTom Burridge - BBC Kiev correspondent\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)",
