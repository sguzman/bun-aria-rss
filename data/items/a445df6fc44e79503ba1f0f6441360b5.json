  "description": "<p>We start the show off with the shocker of all shockers: Tana Mongeau bailed on the pod 20 minutes before we started recording with the same excuse as last time. Luckily, Ellie Zeiler just happened to be at Josh's house and filled in. Dave eviscerates Tana to start the pod, we then get into headlines and talk Grammy's, Noah Beck's new movie, James Charles maybe getting a BBL, Sydney Sweenie's grandparents seeing her nude, and more.\n\nWe also get into the controversy caused by our title makers with last week's Mads Lewis and Loren Gray title, Bri's social media drama that has spilled into real life, and end the show with a \"Tik Tok Awards\" game that actually just turns into a roast of Josh, Bri, and Dave. \n\nSupport Our Sponsors:\n\nCoinbase: Sign up at https://barstool.link/CoinbaseBFF for $10 in free Bitcoin.\nGametime: Download the Gametime app and redeem code BFF for $20 off your first purchase (terms apply).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
