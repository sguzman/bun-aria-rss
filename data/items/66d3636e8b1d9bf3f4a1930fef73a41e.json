  "description": "<p>Controversy has erupted on the Kirk Minihane Show Youtube channel. Steve Robinson made the unilateral decision to censor a conspiracy theory show, and Kirk ain't happy. Menners, the shortest and second most likable Minifan in Australia, engages in some censorship of his own when callers suggest he's not taking good care of his employees. Mike Francesa continues to make waves in the broader media, now with his comments about President Trump's response to coronavirus (0:49:00). The ghost of Ronald Reagan joins the show (1:11:28).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
