  "title": "Cheryl Strayed: The Humble Journey to Greatness",
  "description": "<p>In a live appearance at UCLA’s Royce Hall, New York Times best-selling author Cheryl Strayed explains why you shouldn't let your dreams get in the way of achieving your goals. Cheryl says at the age of 33, she rented a cottage in the town of Sheffield, Massachusetts, hoping to finish writing her first book. It had been her lifelong desire to write the great American novel, but now that she was so close, she found herself procrastinating and watching TV instead. She says she started to feel like a failure. \"I had my dream in my grasp, and I was too weak to hold it,\" she says. But Cheryl went on to great acclaim as an author, writing best-selling books like “Wild,” “Tiny Beautiful Things” and “Brave Enough.” In this refreshingly honest SuperSoul Session, Cheryl explains why embracing humility is just as important as striving for greatness.</p>\n",
