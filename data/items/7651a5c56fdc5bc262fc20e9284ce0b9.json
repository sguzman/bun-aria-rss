  "description": "<p>Norwich State Hospital in Connecticut served as a home and place of treatment for the mentally ill for a hundred years. As is the case with many old insane asylums, treatment methods were arcane and in some cases torturous. Mental illness was not understood and people were mistreated years ago. Places that harbor pain and suffering seem to capture the energy for all eternity and that energy tends to lead to supernatural activity. Is it because spirits become trapped? Are evil beings attracted to the painful emotions and so they come and take up residence? Or is the bad energy trapped within the walls of the building itself? Today, we talk about the history and hauntings of the Norwich State Hospital for the Insane. The Moment in Oddity features Bog Bodies and This Day in History features the assassination of France's King Henri IV.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Check out the show notes here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-46-norwich-state-hospital.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-46-norwich-state-hospital.html</a></p>",
