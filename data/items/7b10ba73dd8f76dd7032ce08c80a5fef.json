  "description": "On today's show, Pat joins the guys live from a hotel room in Orlando as he is away on a business trip. They chat about him getting on the plane with a burger loaded with onions, and trying to track down a cornhole board once they landed in Orlando, which proved to be more difficult than expected. They also chat about Maroon 5 being announced as the Super Bowl halftime performers, Pat explains what collabs he'd like to see and Todd, Digs, Nick, & Zito give their picks on who their dream performance would be. They also chat about Hall of Famers wanting $300,000 and insurance every year from the NFL and whether that is sustainable, and give out a couple of Quick Picks for week 3 in the NFL. Closing out the show is a great interview with Albert Breer from MMQB. They chat about Josh Gordon going to New England, his stance in the Colin Kaepernick situation, his favorite story he's ever reported on, and why certain writers believe that they are bigger than the game (56:02-1:17:17).\n",
