  "description": "<p>You know Laura Jane Grace from Against Me! and her solo career, but we bet you don't know about her childhood obsession with action figures. This week Laura stopped by the podcast to discuss her decades-long relationship with G.I.Joes and the detailed storylines she would build around them. We also discuss getting cappuccinos at Lilith Fair, band reunions ranging from Genesis to the Black Crowes, and Vanessa and Laura's experiences hanging out with Cyndi Lauper and seeing her \"true colors.\" (Spoiler alert: She's very nice.) Whether you're a fan of Aus Rotten or Sarah McLachlan, this episode truly has something for everyone.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
