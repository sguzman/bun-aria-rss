  "description": "If you have Julio Jones, Tee Higgins or Will Fuller on your Fantasy team, are you getting nervous? What if the Falcons, Bengals or Dolphins select a TE or WR? We go over these types of scenarios and figure out which players could be affected by the NFL Draft. Let's start with the players who could gain the most (6:40) and those who could lose the most (9:45) as the draft unfolds ... What kind of impact do rookie WRs and TEs have on veterans (12:30)? What does recent history tell us and how will it translate in 2021? Also, do teams that draft WRs in Round 1 throw the ball more than they did the previous season (17:45)? We put it all in perspective ... News and notes (23:30) and then a longer look at the QBs (31:40), RBs (35:40), WRs (42:00) and TEs (51:00) who could gain or lose value during the NFL Draft. Can we get excited about Daniel Jones if the Giants draft a WR? Is Myles Gaskin about to be out of a job? What about Ronald Jones? We also discuss Marquise Brown, Mark Andrews and many more ...
