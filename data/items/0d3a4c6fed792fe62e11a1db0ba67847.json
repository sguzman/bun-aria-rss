  "description": "<p>Happy Twosday! Em's celebrating by sending themself the most precious gift from the past and teaching us all a lesson in self care. They're also bringing us a mind-bending, alien-related topic today in the Fermi Paradox. Are we the most advanced beings in the universe or are we the hillbillies of the universe? Grab your wine (and wine colored shirts in case of spills), because we're pretty sure it's the latter. Then Christine covers the second in her two-part series on the horrifically abusive Élan School. And tag us if you accept Em's challenge and treat yourself to something nice! ...and that's why we eat chocolate covered strawberries we scheduled to have sent to us months ago!</p>\n",
