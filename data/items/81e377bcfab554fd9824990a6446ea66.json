  "description": "Boston University School of Law Professor Jay Wexler offers readers an entertaining and enlightening tour through a “constitutional zoo” of ten strange-yet-important provisions of the Constitution of the United States in The Odd Clauses: Understanding the Constitution Through Ten of Its Most Curious Provisions (Beacon, 2012).\n\nAs the nation’s foremost scholar of Supreme Court laughter (he could claim he invented the burgeoning field), Professor Wexler proves in this book that he is not just a critic of legal humor, Professor Wexler is a master himself. On the serious side, the work succeeds in using ten oft-forgotten constitutional provisions as a means of illustrating how contemporary problems are imbued with constitutional issues.\n\nInspired by his time at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel providing legal advice to the Executive Branch, Professor Wexler’s book will delight both the most seasoned legal veterans and even those whose last brush with the Constitution was in high school. Perhaps due to Professor Wexler’s extensive experience in teaching Administrative Law, as well as his experience in the Executive Branch, the book would serve as an excellent preface for those law students who plan to take Administrative Law.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
