  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, America is a partially occupied country and if the democrats win in November their 'brown-shirted thuggery' will occupy all of our land. When you're no longer safe to have free speech and walk the streets, America is no longer free. Then, George Soros funded the campaigns of scores of candidates for mayor and prosecutors knowing that they intended to be soft on crime and had no intention of enforcing the law. This is in sync with the long history of the Democrats which have shunned civil rights and skirted the system to achieve their political goals. Later, Democrats are power-hungry American-Marxists. Herbert Marcuse was a Marxist philosopher in France and together with Saul Alinsky and others, they have been fundamentally transforming America with their teachings on colleges and universities across the country. Their goal is to break the American social contract. Afterward, Kamala Harris says she's proud of accused rapist Jacob Blake. Joe Biden remains mostly silent of the violent riots still plaguing some American cities.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
