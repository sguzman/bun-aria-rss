  "description": "<p>A sea change in the Las Cultch executive branch! Meghan McCain has resigned from our Board of Directors after blocking us on Twitter and then publicly flopping so absolutely hard that we have to spend our time and energy on it in this episode. That bullshit, WandaVision and how it was Agatha All Along, plus a revisitation of Mean Girls and how Rachel McAdams as Regina George both captured and influenced a generation of social terrorists in our high schools. Are you interested in the style evolution of both hosts over time? No? Well, we also talk about The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, so just hit the 15 second skip when we start chatting about how, as teens, we used to rock jeans and flip flops on the regular. Stop when you hear us rescinding our idol worship for Mary M. Cosby. Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
