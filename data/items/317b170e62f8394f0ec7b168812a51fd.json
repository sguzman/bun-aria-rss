  "description": "<p>In January 2013, Susan Cain published a book that would spark a global conversation and change the world. Her stunning, international bestseller,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>gave voice to nearly a third of the human race, those who'd often walked through life believing that their quiet nature, their love of smaller groups, individual conversations and solitude was something \"to be fixed.\" Something that would hold them back in life, keep them from the good jobs and from rising to embrace their potential.</p><br><p><em>Quiet&nbsp;</em>was shock to the system. It validated this often-maligned social orientation with a fierce attention to science and revealed the stunning creative and social power of introverts. Cain let the quieter set, of which I am a member,&nbsp;know we're okay, better than okay, we are blessed. She also pulled back the curtain on how society and the corporate world build structure and culture that supports and rewards extroversion, while downplaying the value of introverts and stifling their ability to do the often game-changing work needed most.</p><br><p>This week's conversation with Susan features not only what her book and ideas have done to the lives of millions, but also what the book has done to and for her. How it's changed her, thrust this previously introverted, solitude-loving writer onto the global stage and how she has found a new normal in her role as a leader and a public introvert.</p><br><p>Follow Susan: <a href=\"http://www.quietrev.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/susancain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
