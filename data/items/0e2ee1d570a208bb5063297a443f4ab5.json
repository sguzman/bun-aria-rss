  "description": "<p>r/Confession In today's episode, OP was driving his car through a familiar neighborhood. He looked down at his radio for just a moment, and when he looked back up an old man was walking across the street. He couldn't stop in time, and he ended up killing the old man. Luckily for OP, the collision was ruled an accident, so he didn't have to spend any time in prison. He's never told another soul about this horrible event, but now he's confessing anonymously on the Internet to get it off his chest.</p>\n",
