  "description": "<p><strong>Halloween came a little earlier this year on Drunken Philosophy! This week, Connor and Dan discuss the idea of a philosophical zombie, i.e. a physically identical human being that lacks consciousness, and decide whether or not they create problems for physicalists. Philosophers mentioned include David Chalmers, Daniel Dennett, and at least one other, maybe! Also discussed, the career of Daniel Day Lewis, a review of Game of Thrones in emoji form, and Connor's Top Five Berries! (Apologies for a little buzzing at the beginning on Connor's audio, I swear it goes away)</strong></p>",
