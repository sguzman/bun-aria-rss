  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the idea that God created the universe and then left it for humans to understand by reason not revelation.  Edward Herbert, 1583-1648 (pictured above)  held that there were five religious truths: belief in a Supreme Being, the need to worship him, the pursuit of a virtuous life as the best form of worship, repentance, and reward or punishment after death.  Others developed these ideas in different ways, yet their opponents in England's established Church collected them under the label of Deists, called Herbert the Father of Deism and attacked them as a movement, and Deist books were burned. Over time, reason and revelation found a new balance in the Church in England, while Voltaire and Thomas Paine explored the ideas further, leading to their re-emergence in the French and American Revolutions.\n\nWith \n\nRichard Serjeantson\nFellow and Lecturer in History at Trinity College, Cambridge\n\nKatie East\nLecturer in History at Newcastle University\n\nAnd \n\nThomas Ahnert\nProfessor of Intellectual History at the University of Edinburgh\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
