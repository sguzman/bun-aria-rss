  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins are having a conversation about why everyone ought to read myths. Angelina begins by explaining what a myth is in terms of literary genre. She talks about the characteristics that run through myths, such as explanations of origins and natural phenomena, common characters, and a universe that hangs together. Cindy poses a question about why we have come to interpret the word myth to mean something untrue since the time of the Enlightenment.</p> <p>Angelina helps parents feel more confident about their children’s ability to know the difference between reality and fantasy. Cindy talks about how knowing mythology is a key to understanding other stories and literature. Unfolding a portion of church history, Angelina explains how early Christians wrestled with pagan stories and Old Testament stories at the same time. When we go looking only for morality tales in the Bible, Cindy points out, then we miss the main idea. Getting a bit more practical, Angelina gives some examples of the role of pre-Christian storytellers who pointed to the Truth.</p> <p>Be sure to be back next week for the beginning of our series on <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/321JPIK\">Til We Have Faces</a></em> by C. S. Lewis, in which we will be covering chapters 1 and 2. <em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</span></em></p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The imagination of man is made in the image of the imagination of God. Everything of man must have been of God first; and it will help much towards our understanding of the imagination and its functions in man if we first succeed in regarding aright the imagination of God, in which the imagination of man lives and moves and has its being.</p> <cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Those who do not know that this great myth became fact when the Virgin conceived are, indeed, to be pitied. But Christians also need to be reminded–we may thank Corineus for reminding us–that what became fact was a myth, that it carries with it into the world of fact all the properties of a myth. God is more than a god, not less; Christ is more than Balder, not less. We must not be ashamed of the mythical radiance resting on our theology. We must not be nervous about “parallels” and “pagan Christs”: they ought to be there–it would be a stumbling block if they weren’t. We must not, in false spirituality, withhold our imaginative welcome. If God chooses to be mythopoeic–and is not the sky itself a myth–shall we refuse to be mythopathic? For this is the marriage of heaven and earth: perfect myth and perfect fact: claiming not only our love and our obedience, but also our wonder and delight, addressed to the savage, the child, and the poet in each one of us no less than to the moralist, the scholar, and the philosopher.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <h3>from “Mythopoeia”</h3> <p><em>by J. R. R. Tolkien</em></p> <p>The heart of Man is not compound of lies,<br /> but draws some wisdom from the only Wise,<br /> and still recalls him. Though now long estranged,<br /> Man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed.<br /> Dis-graced he may be, yet is not dethroned,<br /> and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned,<br /> his world-dominion by creative act:<br /> not his to worship the great Artefact,<br /> Man, Sub-creator, the refracted light<br /> through whom is splintered from a single White<br /> to many hues, and endlessly combined<br /> in living shapes that move from mind to mind.<br /> Though all the crannies of the world we filled<br /> with Elves and Goblins, though we dared to build<br /> Gods and their houses out of dark and light,<br /> and sowed the seed of dragons, ’twas our right<br /> (used or misused).
