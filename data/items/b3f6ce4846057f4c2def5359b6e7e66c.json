  "description": "Former NFL player Colin Kaepernick has been a prominent activist and a Rorschach test in the culture wars — and he's been widely reconsidered in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests. But he hasn't really gotten to tell his own story until now. He stars in the Netflix series <em>Colin In Black & White</em>, which he co-created with director Ava DuVernay. It's a dramatization of his life as the biracial son of white adoptive parents.",
