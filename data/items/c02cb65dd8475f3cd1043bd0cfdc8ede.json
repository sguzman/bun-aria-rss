  "description": "<div>Slavery might have officially ended over 150 years ago, but a case can be made that it never really went away, but rather it just changed forms. The physical chains may have been removed, but like the Elephant Principle, sometimes the emotional chains remain.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>The Black community has some legitimate reasons for rising up against a policing system that has disproportionally targeted them through Stop & Frisk and Broken Windows policing policies. Through the rise of the private prison industry introduced through the Clinton Omnibus Crime Bill, the Black community has been decimated in a variety of ways.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Was the fuse of 2020 riots actually lit decades earlier, and do the people even really know what they are actually fighting for? Hear what Bishop Larry Gaiters thinks the real problem facing his community is, and how he proposes to make the changes that will stick.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong><br>\nDelete Me: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yxo48w\">https://bit.ly/2yxo48w</a>\n</div>\n<div>Cash Advance: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2XVWsog\">https://bit.ly/2XVWsog</a><br>\nFiverr: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2KpYkO0\">https://bit.ly/2KpYkO0</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>Â </div>\n",
