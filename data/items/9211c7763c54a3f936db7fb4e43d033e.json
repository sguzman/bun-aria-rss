  "description": "On The Gist, President Donald Trump has finally made a nomination for ambassador to South Africa. And it is a terrible one.\nIt’s hard to make comedy when your story, like Ben Stiller’s latest direction, is based on a state inspector general’s report. Escape at Dannemora is drama through and through, based on the prison break of two men, aided by a female employee (and lover), from New York’s Clinton Correctional Facility. Stiller talks filming bad sex, turning villains into heroes, and what makes Patricia Arquette a great actress. Escape at Dannemora premieres Sunday on Showtime.\nIn the Spiel, get this: a podcast where the interviews never get past “hello!” and “can you hear me all right?”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
