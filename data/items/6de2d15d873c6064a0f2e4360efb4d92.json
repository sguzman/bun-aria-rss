  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Democrats want to tank this economy by holding the Coronavirus relief bill hostage for same-day voter registration and other pork like solar and abortion subsidies. Yet, every single member of Congress still has a job and is still getting paid. Instead of the moniker Democratic-Socialist, they should admit that they’re actually Democrat-Fascists. Their knee-jerk answer is automatically to nationalize industries. The Party of the Klan, the Civil War, Jim Crow laws, and the soft coup against President Trump is hell-bent on a massive governmental takeover to remedy their own shortages and lack of preparedness. Then, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in to discuss how the Democrats have become the enemy of the people by stalling this critical aid. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi are unable to rise to the level of non-partisan patriotism that Gov. Cuomo and Gov. Newsom have throughout this process. Later, shutting down the whole country is not necessary to fight the Chinese virus and might hurt more than it helps. This makes the case for a herd immunity approach that only isolates the most vulnerable. Unlike Italy, the U.S has a robust private sector to support the federal and state responses. Afterward, Dr. Marc Siegel, author of “False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear” calls in to discuss the anecdotal evidence showing success with the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in patients suffering from the Coronavirus.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
