  "description": "<p>We are here for the first proper day of competition for Beijing 2022 and we have the whole gang together to recap one epic day! We talk about a medal winning day for Canada and find out from Colin just how he feels about their first day of success. We also get back on the commentary slopes to call some more moguls and leave some more memories that you won't soon forget. Added to this we find out just why we still love the curling, why the women's ice hockey should just be called right now, why Hakuna Matata is such a wonderful phrase and celebrate another iconic Aussie Winter Olympian and award another edition of the DAILY DALE. It's one stacked show that you won't want to miss!</p>",
