The book focuses on the character of Laura Palmer, the beautiful homecoming queen whose murder sets in motion the mysteries at the heart of David Lynch’s eccentric small town. Through conversations with women involved in both the show itself and the Twin Peaks fan community, Laura’s Ghost explores Laura’s legacy from a host of different perspectives. Stallings speaks with the actor Sheryl Lee about her experience of playing Laura Palmer, with filmmaker Jennifer Lynch about writing Laura’s backstory in The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, and with a range of artists, authors, performers and teachers about Laura’s impact on their lives. In this way, Laura’s Ghost excavates the layers of complexity embedded in Laura’s character, framing her as a friend, a daughter, a mischief-maker, a rebel and, most importantly, a survivor.\nCourtenay Stallings is a writer and professor based in Los Angeles.\nContent Warning: This episode discusses sexual abuse and incest.\nResources for sexual abuse and domestic violence survivors can be found here and here.\nThe author is donating 10% of all proceeds she personally receives to The Rape, Abuse & Incest National \nNetwork.\nMiranda Corcoran is a lecturer in twenty-first-century literature in University College Cork.
