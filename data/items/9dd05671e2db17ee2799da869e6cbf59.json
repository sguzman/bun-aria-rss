  "description": "The first book of Cicero's \"On Duty\" concerns what is morally right for men to do. The second is what is expedient, or how to get what you want. Cicero isn't exactly a face-melter, so it's easier to get the synopsis here than it is to read on your own (don't let me stop you, just don't say I didn't warn ya). ",
