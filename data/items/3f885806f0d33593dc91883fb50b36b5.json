  "title": "Modern Classics: Mark Ronson on Ginuwine's \"Pony\"",
  "description": "Mark Ronson has a CV too long to list here. Suffice to say he’s a musician who’s worked with everyone from Amy Winehouse to Lady Gaga to Dua Lipa, has one of the highest selling singles of all time with Bruno Mars in “Uptown Funk,” and has been making just really good music since the turn of the millennium. He’s also the presenter of one of our all time favorite TED talks on the history of sampling, and he’s been continuing that journey of musical curiosity with the Apple TV show “Watch The Sound,” which explores the untold stories behind music creation and the lengths producers and creators are willing to go to find the perfect sound, and the FADER Uncovered Podcast, where he interviews artists ranging from David Byrne to HAIM. Today, Mark is the guest for another episode of Modern Classics, in which he brings Ginuwine’s classic 90s jam “Pony,” produced by Timbaland and Static Major, as an example of the ways that innovation and radical experimentation undergird even the biggest of pop smashes. \n\nSongs Discussed\n\nGinuwine - Pony\n\nRakim - Juice (Know the Ledge)\n\nMobb Deep - Shook Ones Part II\n\nNotorious B.I.G. - Juicy\n\nAaliyah - Are You That Somebody?\n\n10cc - I’m Not in Love\n\nShangri-Las - Remember (Walkin’ in the Sand)\n\nAmy Winehouse and Mark Ronson - Valerie\n\nPaul McCartney - Get Enough\n\nUsher - Climax\n\nBeatles - Maxwell’s Silver Hammer\n\nStevie Wonder - You Are the Sunshine of My Life\n\nCher - Believe\n\nGang Starr - Work\n\nNikka Costa - Like a Feather\n\nStevie Wonder - Superstition\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
