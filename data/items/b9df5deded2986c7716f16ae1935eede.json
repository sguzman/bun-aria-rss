From whom did this idea originate? [07:25]</p><p>What books has Hugh gifted most? [11:44]</p><p>What does Hugh’s regular meditation practice look like, and what benefits does he enjoy from it? [15:22]</p><p>How does Hugh summon and maintain the emotional and physical energy necessary for performing — particularly when he has to give his all multiple times per week on stage in front of a live audience? [19:42]</p><p>As someone who’s performed across countless stage and screen productions, why was Hugh nervous about coming on this podcast? [27:34]</p><p>What lessons did Hugh’s father teach him about being an example to others by way of action, making decisions, and always keeping his word? [29:41]</p><p>To what does Hugh owe his eloquent (or, as his wife might say, “too verbose”) communication skills? [39:16]</p><p>Hugh’s relationship with journalism, journalists, and a newfound love for the work of Ken Burns. [44:13]</p><p>Hugh talks about the contract he made with himself at the end of drama school about pursuing acting — and being wary of the word “career” in relation to that pursuit. [46:28]</p><p>Some of the best decisions Hugh made in the first years of being an aspiring/working actor. [51:26]</p><p>Why does Hugh think he was extended the kindness of auditioning for Sir Trevor Nunn — one of his idols — even though he had no intention of accepting a part in the musical he was directing? [57:02]</p><p>How has Hugh learned to trust his intuition — even when it leads him in unexpected directions? [58:52]</p><p>Can Hugh recall any times when the purpose of a nudge from intuition wasn’t easily fathomed — when the dots didn’t connect in an obvious way, but paid off in a big way when it was heeded? [1:06:29]</p><p>Am I talking to Hugh Jackman, or Perfect Tommy? [1:10:57]</p><p>Hugh elaborates on one of his daily morning practices — the design of the day — pondering the efficacy of manifestation and how it played into a major career decision. [1:12:16]</p><p>Hugh puts discipline in perspective, talks about the importance of incorporating relaxation into physical activity (or possibly any activity) for best results, the types of exercises he’s found to be most effective, and a Viktor Frankl quotation that he finds especially inspiring. [1:18:33]</p><p>Hugh is a connoisseur of puzzles and games. So what does he recommend for someone who needs to unwind from taking themselves and their work too seriously? Furthermore, what is it about puzzles that keeps him occupied all night if he doesn’t remember to set an alarm for himself? [1:27:46]</p><p>Parting thoughts.
