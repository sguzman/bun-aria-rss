Sexologist, Author & Legend Carol Queen shares a vintage story - ah, memories! - about a very special ‘book’ in her sexual library. When 6 women get together to shoot their own porn, newcomer Mark shows up & volunteers to have sex with all of ‘em, and Carol offers to go last. She expects that Mark would be so exhausted after all those women, but he comes home with her for a threesome with her boyfriend, TOO. Takeaway?
