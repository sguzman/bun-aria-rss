  "description": "<p>Public schools are inequitable because the school systems are maniacally loyal to white families. We can’t have equitable public education unless schools limit the disproportionate power of white parents. But is that even possible?

The other is upstairs at BHS, the newly renamed SIS.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/rAgzxY6ICCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />\n",
