  "description": "<p>The previous studies of the island and double holography mainly focus on\ncodimension-one branes. This paper explores the island on the codimension-two\nbrane in AdS/dCFT. The codimension-two brane is closely related to conical\nsingularity, which is very different from the codimension-one brane. We analyze\nthe mass spectrum of gravitons on the codimension-two brane and find that the\nlarger the brane tension is, the smaller the gravitational mass is. The\nmassless mode is forbidden by either the boundary or normalization conditions.\nWe prove that the first massive gravitational mode is located on the\ncodimension-two brane; the larger the tension, the better the localization. It\nis similar to the case of codimension-one brane and builds an excellent\nphysical foundation for the study of black hole evolution on codimension-two\nbranes. We find that the Page curve of eternal black holes can be recovered due\nto the island ending on the codimension-two brane. The new feature is that the\nextremal surface passing the horizon cannot be defined after some finite time\nin the no-island phase. Fortunately, this unusual situation does not affect the\nPage curve since it happens after Page time.\n</p>",
