  "description": "In an important ruling this week, Judge Amy Berman Jackson wrote a scathing assessment of the Barr Department of Justice's efforts to rationalize their handling of the serial obstruction of justice within the Trump Administration. This may have been another significant step toward getting some accountability for the last administration's serial abuses. The decision came in a case brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). We are joined by CREW president Noah Bookbinder and our regulars, NYU Law Professor and co-editor of Just Security Ryan Goodman and former senior Obama White House official and former Senate staffer Dr. Kavita Patel to discuss how, if ever, we might get from where we are toward bringing Trump and his associates to true justice. It's an important discussion that you won't want to miss. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
