They play for us the words of an entitled drug dealer who asks why he should pay rent when he's so well-subsidized by benefits from San Francisco. Dems have ruined these cities (\"hellscapes,\" as Buck calls them) with their idiotic ideas. When will it end? Rep. Michael Waltz joins C&B to discuss NBC spiking his Olympic genocide ad, made with Enes Kanter Freedom. NBC called for so many changes, including not mentioning corporate names, that it was a \"nonrejection rejection.\" </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
