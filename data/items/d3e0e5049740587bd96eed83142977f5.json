  "description": "<p>[Part 1 of 2]</p>\n\n\n<p>Donna had recently received a few prank calls and she was getting nervous. She had a young baby and didn’t like the idea of being alone at night. Her boyfriend Les worked as a pizza delivery driver, and she decided to spend the night driving around in the car with him, rather than stay home alone.</p>\n\n\n<p>The first thing Donna saw when she returned home was her cat on the lounge room floor, dead. The words “Donna you’re dead”, were written in blood up on the wall. In the bathroom were Donna’s two kittens. Both also dead.</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-23-the-frankston-serial-killer-part-1/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-23-the-frankston-serial-killer-part-1\">casefilepodcast.com/case-23-the-frankston-serial-killer-part-1</a></strong></a></p>\n",
