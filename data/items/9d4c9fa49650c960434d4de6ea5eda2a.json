  "description": "You may not know the name Glenn Gordon Caron, but if you’re a TV fan, you’ve heard of one of the shows he’s worked on, especially his groundbreaking ’80s detective dramedy Moonlighting, which popularized the will-they/won’t-they relationship, introduced the world to Bruce Willis, and created a tabloid sensation. But Caron’s résumé is so much more than Moonlighting. He’s worked on numerous films, he’s created a short film about human sexuality for Epcot Center, and he’s made many more TV shows, ranging from one-season wonders (like 1999-2000’s Now and Again) to long-running hits (like Medium, which aired throughout the 2000s). His latest task is taking over as showrunner on CBS’s legal series Bull, and he’s given the CBS case-of-the-week format a bit of spit and polish, focusing more on the characters than the cases but still leaving plenty of room for intriguing investigations and legal maneuvering. Caron joins Todd to talk about how he came to Bull, the height of Moonlighting media attention, why David and Maddie hooking up could have worked, and so much more.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
