  "description": "<p>Meditation: Living Loving Awareness (2019-01-23) - By bringing our full attention to the aliveness in the body, we can open to the experience of interior space and the space that includes all sensations and sounds. This then allows us to perceive continuous space filled with the light of awareness. This meditation attunes us to these dimensions of awareness: continuous open space, heart space and full aliveness. We end with a Zen poem that invites us to rest in this living, loving awareness, and know it as home.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation:<br /> \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\"<br /> when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
