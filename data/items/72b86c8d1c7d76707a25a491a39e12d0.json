  "description": "<div> <p>Richard Powers is the author of 13 novels, including <strong>The Overstory</strong>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. His new novel, <strong>Bewilderment,</strong> shortlisted for The Booker Prize and longlisted for the National Book Award for Fiction, is an intimate story of two lost boys—father and son—and it’s a bit of a departure from his earlier books. Richard joins us on the show for a charming conversation about where the title came from, why he used a first-person narrative for this book, the connection between writing fiction and computer code, writing about grief, and more. Produces/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p> </div>",
