  "description": "<p>Anthony writes “I live in Kentucky. I’ve had several encounters with Sasquatch, or as we refer as “Haints”. My encounter started when I would ride my motorcycle and would always park at a secluded rock quarry lake.</p> <p>I’ve had hands on interactions with a juvenile that resulted in me thinking it’s mother and another female was going to rip me to pieces. I later come to find out that an elderly lady feeds them and this is gonna sound really strange but she kind of ran a baby sitting house for the juveniles.</p> <p>This all seems unbelievable but I won’t waste your time if you don’t waste mine. I’ve told 3 people about this encounter and I figured I could tell you. If you choose to believe me or if you want to listen to my story just message me back.”</p> <p>I spoke to the witness late last night. The witness said “I was on my motorcycle and I was out in the woods and I heard what sounded like a child crying. I came up on this thing. It was small and was hanging upside down in a tree, it was small. I think it fell from the top of the tree and got stuck as I walked up on this thing I thought I was dreaming. I had never seen anything like this before. It looked like a hairy human/animal/kid.</p> <p>I am sitting there watching this thing trying to figure out how I am going to help it out of the tree and what is it….you are not going to believe this, I wouldn’t if someone told me this. As I am watching this thing two more stepped out and they were both females. It is a long story but one of the females screamed at me and I ran.</p> <p>This haunted me, I didn’t know what I saw. Later I went down that same road and I parked my bike. A short while later this old woman walked up to me and started talking about what I had seen. I had not told anyone about what I had seen and somehow this old woman knew what happen to me. She told me to come by her home sometime as she lived up the road.</p> <p>I decided later to stop by her home and this is where it gets really strange. If someone told me what I am about to tell you I would NOT believe them…..”</p>",
