  "description": "Next year is shaping up to be a big one for live streaming. Typically characteristic of even years, when many major international sporting events take place, 2021 looks like it could defy the trend. Akamai is predicting an unprecedented surge in live streaming that will start in late 2020 and continue throughout 2021. During this stretch, we could realistically see 50 million people concurrently streaming a single live event. That's roughly double the largest number of viewers we've seen during a single event in the past. With this in mind, Akamai has used much of 2020 to prepare new capabilities included in the Akamai Platform Update that will help customers prepare for this surge in live streaming.",
