  "description": "As part of this past summer's CHIPS and Science Act, Congress not only funneled $50 billion of federal funding into U.S. semiconductor production, but also allocated $1 billion for a new place-based policy â€“ the Recompete Pilot Program (RPP). The RPP, unrelated to semiconductor production, seeks to boost competitiveness and growth in several of the nation's persistently economically distressed areas. The program intends to target long-term comprehensive economic development and job creation in selected areas by supporting workforce development, business development, and infrastructure activities.",
