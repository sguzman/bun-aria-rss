    "media:description": "I2C is one of the most common interfaces to connect chips on a circuit card. From reading temperature sensors, to reading data from ADCs, to driving DACs, to passing information between two processors, I2C is a very common interface that has been around for decades.\n\nIf you've never worked with I2C, it can be a bit overwhelming. But this short introduction will tell you everything you need to know to get you confident when working with your own I2C circuits. Learn about the data transmission protocol called I2C, or Inter-integrated circuit. I talk through the basics of I2C for both a microcontroller or FPGA implementation, how data is exchanged, and how the hardware is designed. If you like this video, please help me make more content by supporting me on Patreon.\n\npatreon.com/nandland\n\nAnd if you want to test FPGA code on your own, buy a Go Board, the best FPGA development board for beginners. It comes with lots of great tutorials.\n\nnandland.com/goboard/introduction.html",
