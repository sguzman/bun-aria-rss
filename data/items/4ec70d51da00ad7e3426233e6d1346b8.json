Cynthia, the executive pastry chef at Butcher & Bee, is crazy talented when it comes to sweet stuff and baked goods and she’s made a name for herself on the smokin’ hot Charleston food scene with her crave-worthy creations. Cynthia talks about great dairy, seafoam candy, bakewell tarts, and more. Joining host Kerry Diamond are our friends from Effinbradio: Lindsay Collins, Nikki Fairman, and Philip Michael Cohen. The interview with Cynthia was recorded at their new studio/bar/hangout in Charleston. (Go visit!) And speaking of nerdy, tap into your inner cheese nerd for the second half of our show. Mark Goldman, the founder of Formaticum cheese papers, explains how to properly store and care for cheese. Cheese is a living thing! You can’t just shove it in a plastic container and Mark explains why.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the maker of delicious cheeses from Switzerland, for supporting Radio Cherry Bombe.
