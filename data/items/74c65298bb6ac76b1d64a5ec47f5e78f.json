  "description": "<p>Tonight night I will be speaking to Connie. Connie said \"when all of this started happening I thought it was homeless people but it just kept getting stranger. Several times I would go out on the property and call for my dog and something would mock and mimic me calling the dog. They sometimes call my husbands name. I have heard screams, whoops and strange chatter.</p> <p>My daughter caught one running off of the porch at the guest house.\"</p> <p>Connie said \"We are seeing strange lights out here. I wanted to ask you have you ever seen one of these strange lights that almost forms like the michelin man? This strange figure keeps showing up in the pictures. At first I brushed it off as just something strange showing up, maybe it is a light and my eyes were playing a trick on me but this \"thing\" or strange light in the form of a person keeps showing up.</p> <p>The strange part is where we are seeing these lights come out of the forest is the same area where the creatures come out. I never wanted this, I just want all of this to go away. Here is a couple of pictures I have many more including hours of audio.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>To see the pictures Connie submitted, visit the episode page on our website <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep433-they-made-themselves-known/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p>",
