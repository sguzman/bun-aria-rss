Delaware North, the owner and operator of the arena, spent $100 million to upgrade and expand the building. Fans, however, lots of them, have complained that the new seats don't have enough leg room. Delaware North is mulling how to proceed. Also talked about is Major League Baseball's decision to change its ownership rules, allowing investment funds to buy limited stakes across multiple teams. It spurred Galatioto Sports Partners to create a $500 million fund -- the GSP Baseball Fund -- to invest in teams.
