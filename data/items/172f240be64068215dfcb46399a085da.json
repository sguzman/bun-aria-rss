  "description": "<p>This week's discussion was originally planned as a chat about persevering with unfamiliar materials, but it soon broadened into a conversation about change in our work. We discuss the importance of finding ways to shift our work, and the role materials can play in that. We both strive to constantly push our work in new directions, but this can lead to real feelings of discomfort if we are also seeking results in the form of finished paintings. In the end, we both agree that new ideas need time and space in which to grow. If we give up at the first hurdle, we never get to find out what might have been possible. So Alice has decided to persevere and make life difficult sometimes with new materials while Louise will continue to make paintings she doesn't yet understand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Khadi paper </strong><a href=\"https://www.jacksonsart.com/brands/khadi\"><strong>https://www.jacksonsart.com/brands/khadi</strong></a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
