  "description": "<p>Get ready for another high and tight episode mommies! We start off the show with a classic cool girl we know everyone will love. We then get into Christina P's Tik Tok profile and why the sites algorithm keeps giving her the coolest people on the internet! We then check to see who at YMH has the lowest Uber rating. What's yours??? A neat video for Christina, and couple SOLID entries for #HorribleOrHilarious .</p> <p>We then welcome our first guest, Jim Gaffigan! He tells us about growing up Catholic, starting comedy and finding his \"style\" and having FIVE kids! We ask him about the time a bunch of horse enthusiasts got mad at his horse jokes, and we run him through one of our favorite videos! #4strokegang</p> <p>Then, we have on comedian Andrew Collin, who actually went to high school with Tom and played football with him! He tells us about getting connected with Nikki Glaser, partying in South Beach with Lil' Jon, contributing to the mortgage crisis, hitch hiking, and much much more!</p>\n",
