  "description": "Contested and complicated histories create the best books. This is true for many volumes and is certainly so for Jazz Dance: A History of the Roots and Branches (University Press of Florida, 2014), a recent work edited by Wendy Oliver and Lindsay Guarino. Picking up where Marshall and Jean Stearns left off over two decades ago, Oliver and Guarino bring to the field a book that culls together some of the best contemporary scholarship on the history, progenitors, and cultural forces that shape the uniquely American art form known as jazz dance. Created in part as a resource for students, the book is unique in its accessibility, diversity of authorship and willingness to engage the complicated racial and social history of jazz dance. Wendy Oliver has been teaching and choreographing at Providence College since 1985, and is the director of the PC Dance Company. Dr. Oliver is Chair of the Department of Theatre, Dance and Film, and also runs the Children’s Dance program on the Providence College campus. An Active dancer and choreographer, Lindsay Guarino is Assistant professor of Music Theatre and Dance at Salve Regina University and artistic director of Extensions Dance Company.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
