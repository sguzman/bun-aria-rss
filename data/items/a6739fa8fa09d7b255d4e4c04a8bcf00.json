  "description": "An episode with a story from Scandinavia about trolls. Not the internet kind. No, these are the less annoying ones that will murder you in the forest.  Two creatures this week! And they are dogs! And Myths and Legends will ruin dogs for you, too! Sponsors: Check out http://www.audible.com/myths for a free 30-day trial membership (and to get a free audible book). If you play your cards right, you could get 62 hours of Stephen Fry narrating Sherlock Holmes. I was an English major so this will only be a rough estimate, but I believe that breaks down to $0/per hour to listen to Sherlock Holmes for 62 hours.
