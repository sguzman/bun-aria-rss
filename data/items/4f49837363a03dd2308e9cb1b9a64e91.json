  "description": "The president's wife carries industrial strength disinfecting wipes wherever she goes because her man is a germaphobe.  But when it comes to the growing ebola outbreak in Africa, he seems anything but prepared.  (Pro tip for POTUS: The wipes won't help.). In fact, when it comes to the big crises that might come from left field--epidemics, climate crises, cyber attacks, and the like, Trump's America is even more unprepared than we usually are.  Which is why Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Bonnie Jenkins and David Rothkopf end up discussing why it may be that in this day in age, we need bigger, better emotional support animals.  Like hippos.  Or maybe a dinosaur would be good.  And our silo accepts service animals.
