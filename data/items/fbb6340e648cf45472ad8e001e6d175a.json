  "description": "<p>Absolutely LOADED Friday episode for you.\n\n-Manscaped.com 20% off and free shipping with code \"Zero\"-\n-Deathwishcoffee.com 15% off with code \"Viva\"-\n\nROUND 1: We’ve got the latest on the USS Bonhomme Richard and it’s, ah, not great! Also, we asked sailors what happens to sailors assigned to a ship that is lost & contrary to some of the answers they do not get to hang out in a pineapple under the sea. \n\nROUND 2: As Kate’s peace offering to Captain Cons, she’s got a round of “Fun Army Facts” for everyone and she will also allow him to list two fun facts about the Army/Navy game. But no more than that.\n\nROUND 3: We have updates on the Vanessa Guillen case along with news regarding PV2 Gregory Wedel Morales, whose remains were found during the search for Guillen. He had been listed as a deserter but new evidence shows otherwise. \n\nROUND 4: Mess nights can certainly get messy but across the pond they sound like an absolute shit show.  Especially the one where a Sergeant got drunk at a racecourse and headbutted a colleague in the face.\n\nROUND 5: US Military recruiters are using online gaming to recruit teens but one journalist is pulling an echelon right & fighting back in the comments section & claiming it’s a predatory practice.
