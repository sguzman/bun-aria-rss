  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Joe Biden walked away from the media today, taking no questions. Vice President Kamala Harris is missing in action, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the withdrawal from Afghanistan. The military leaders also gave a press conference confirming that they had not planned for all possible outcomes in Afghanistan. In 20 years, the Taliban hasn't taken action on the U.S because we were engaging them there. Now they're in control. Then, Donald Trump sat for an interview with Sean Hannity and made it clear that Biden is a disaster, endangering America, and turning his back on Afghanistan. Trump said that what Biden did is America's greatest embarrassment behind the border crisis - two areas where Biden inherited Trump's successes. Later, Biden threatened Republican governors in his press conference today. He completely avoided any questions and acted as if nothing was happening in Afghanistan. Afterward, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt joins the show to discuss his announcement to run for the US Senate. Laxalt highlighted how Harry Reid's hand-picked candidate is stopping progress in Nevada.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
