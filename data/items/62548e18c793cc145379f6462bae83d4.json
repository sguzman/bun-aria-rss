Find it by searching for \"Little Hedgehog Goes to School\" on Amazon or by visiting [THIS LINK](https://amzn.to/3RRovO5). I hope you LOVE IT!\nOur story today is about a tiny person joining a family as a toddler instead of as a newborn baby, in a foster care or adoption situation. Foster care and adoption can look so many different ways and this story depicts just one way it might look (from the perspective of a sweet little hamster, naturally). My hope is the story can convey some of the many feelings that family members experience during such a time and can spark a conversation about how families can grow. Thank you to the family of tiny people that inspired this story: REID, NOLYN, MILES, BLAIRE, and MASON.\nToday’s episode features wonderful SOUND EFFECTS from listeners GRACE, EVRYN, NORA, LUKE, BRIANNA, GLORIA, ALAINA, and SAGE. You can send me your very own sound effect. Just use the voice memo app on your phone, record your Tiny People making a (recognizable) sound, and email it to rhea@littlestoriestinypeople.com! They might just hear their sound in a future story.\nThe first LSFTP PICTURE BOOK, Little Fox Can't Wait to Dream, is on its way!
