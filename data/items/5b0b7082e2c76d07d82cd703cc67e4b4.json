  "description": "<p>Known widely as The Iceman, <a href=\"http://www.wimhofmethod.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wim Hof</a>, is a Dutch-born world record holder, adventurer, daredevil and researcher.</p><p>While best known for his seemingly freakish ability to withstand extreme cold, and the many world records that've come along with that,&nbsp;even more significant is the work he has done blending extreme cold with breathing and mindset exercises to alter physiology and short-circuit responses thought impossible to control.</p><p>Through his <a href=\"https://www.wimhofmethod.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wim Hof Method</a>, Wim asserts that he can “turn his own thermostat up” and consciously activate his sympathetic nervous system. What makes his work even more unusual is that he's partnered with academic researchers in a quest to<a href=\"https://www.wimhofmethod.com/science\" target=\"_blank\"> scientifically validate</a>, measure and teach his techniques.</p><p>In this week's episode, we dive into the early life experiences that turned Wim on to the transformational power of extreme cold and water. We explore his obsession with existential questions and Eastern philosophy at an early age, how that led to him being viewed as a bit of an outcast and how he kept to his studies despite this. We also explore how the death of his wife and his experience raising his kids pushed him to explore extreme cold, breathing and mindset training as interventions for not just disease and inflammation, but also anxiety and depression.</p><p>It also bears mentioning, Wim's ideas are very progressive, as with any health/lifestyle advice that pushes paradigms, be sure to check in with a qualified healthcare provider before exploring these ideas and, if you choose to try them, be sure to do so under the guidance of a trained professional and never alone.</p><p><strong>We're grateful for the kind support of:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>ShipStation: </strong>Manage and ship your orders. <strong>FREE for 30 days, plus a bonus.</strong> Visit <a href=\"http://ShipStation.com\" target=\"_blank\">ShipStation.com</a>, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in <strong>GOODLIFE</strong>.</li><li><strong>Bombas:&nbsp;</strong>Shop today at <a href=\"http://Bombas.com/goodlife\" target=\"_blank\">Bombas.com/goodlife</a>, and get <strong>20% off</strong> your ENTIRE purchase.</li><li><strong>Tunein</strong>: Catch all-new episodes of some of your favorite podcasts early with <a href=\"https://tunein.com/radio/First-Play-Podcasts-c100001746/\" target=\"_blank\">TuneIn First Play</a>?&nbsp;Download the free TuneIn app now.</li><li><strong>Videoblocks:&nbsp;</strong> Go to <a href=\"http://videoblocks.com/goodlife\" target=\"_blank\">videoblocks.com/goodlife</a> to get all the stock video, audio, and images you can imagine for just $149.</li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
