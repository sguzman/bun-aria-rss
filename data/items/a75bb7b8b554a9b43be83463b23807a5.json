  "description": "In her new book, Rescue Board: The Untold Story of America’s Efforts to Save the Jews of Europe (Doubleday, 2018), Rebecca Erbelding examines the War Refugee Board created by FDR in 1944 near the conclusion of World War II. At the center of the books narrative, she places the numerous efforts to save Jews from Nazi control areas. The book also highlights the young and dedicated individuals who made up the War Refugee Board and how their passion and zeal led to the rescue of tens of thousands of innocent people. Ultimately, the book demonstrates that although America started too late in their efforts save the Jews of Europe, the War Refugee Board made a significant impact and should be viewed as a success.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
