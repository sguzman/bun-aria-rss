  "description": "I just got back from a trip to Las Vegas with my wife. I highlight some of our adventures (including driving excavators)... and why the bustling Vegas economy is a bit of an anomaly. Stocks have been rallying thanks to better-than-expected results (so far) this earnings season. But the headlines aren’t telling the real story. I explain what’s behind the numbers… why this rally won’t last… and why investors need to brace for the downtrend to continue. But that doesn’t mean you should sell everything. I share how to make a fortune as stocks move lower with the Moneyflow Trader strategy… while holding onto quality long positions (like the one I’m recommending tomorrow in Curzio Venture Opportunities). In this episode   A recap of my trip to Vegas [0:30] Don’t trust this earnings rally [7:22] Inflation still hasn’t peaked [16:10] Why there’s more pain ahead for the market [20:50] How to make a fortune when stocks crash [26:30] How to find high-quality long positions [29:45]  Enjoyed this episode?
