  "description": "<p>In this 84th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens—now for the first time live on Odysee!<br/> <br/>In this episode, we discuss chapter 1 of our forthcoming book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, and read an excerpt on culture and consciousness, and the need for generalists in a hyper-specialized world. Bret then introduces a new term: Asch-troturfing, to help explain some of the problems on social media (and beyond). We briefly discuss a new meta-analysis that reviews the evidence for the efficacy of Ivermectin as both prophylaxis and treatment for Covid-19. We discuss the perils of the politicizing of science, and also the perils of bringing market forces directly into contact with scientific endeavors, as the grant-university pipeline in the U.S. has done for many decades now. We discuss what science is, and how varied it can look. We mock PolitiFact for its absurdity. And we read a few excerpts from Nineteen-Eighty-Four, in honor of this moment in time, and this being episode #84.<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
