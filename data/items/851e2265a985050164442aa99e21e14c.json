  "description": "<p>I will be releasing the public show tonight. I am working on a special show for the members on Sunday. I really think you guys and gals are going to like it. Tonight we will be talking to Ned who is a retired law enforcement officer from New York. Ned’s encounter took place many years ago and it started when his car broke down. Ned struggled for many years on what he ran into that night. It is very interesting to hear the ambush behavior Ned describes.</p> <p>Dylin who is from Louisiana will discuss his encounter while he was a truck driver for a logging company. Dylin had stopped his truck and trailer on the job site around 2 AM. As he was adjusting his straps on the side of the trailer he heard his driver door close. He felt something on the other side of the trailer messing with his straps. He thought a worker was messing with him or it was the wind until he looked up and saw the creature.</p> <p>Dylin writes “I could definitely make out an elongated pointed head and the whole left side of its body was covered in what looked like matted wiry hair and the one arm and hand I can make out has sausage like fingers, a forearm that’s larger in proportion that it’s bicep and it’s all hairy there is a difference in fur and hair and this was definitely hair. It reminded me of the beginning stages of dreadlocked hair that’s been unwashed and starts to kink up. I’m standing here frozen in fear trying not to breath, scream and piss myself at the same time. You just don’t expect these things during the daylight much less at 2am on a high traffic road standing right next to your vehicle between you and the cab of your vehicle which is the only area of safety you have. I can feel it’s sizing me up it’s head is steadily moving up and down but at the same time I feel it’s more curious than it is aggressive.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p>",
