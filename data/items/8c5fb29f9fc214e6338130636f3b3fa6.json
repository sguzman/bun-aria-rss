  "description": "We are joined today by Professor Marc Bellemare of the University of Minnesota to talk about his research on the recent price spike in quinoa due to its rising popularity in many western countries as a 'health food’ and how this rise as a viable export economically impacts those who traditionally grow and consume it.  We also discuss how food staples become staples and why only eating food that indigenous to your region isn’t necessarily a good practice.  Hosted by Ceren Karacasu, Yudong Rao and Professor David Just.",
