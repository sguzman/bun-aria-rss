  "description": "<p>Sonia Manzano is one of the most influential voices in the history of public television. For more than 40 years, she was our neighbor, Maria, on <em>Sesame Street,</em> and she continues to connect her experiences and imagination through her new show for PBS Kids,<em> Alma&rsquo;s Way. </em>In Part Two of her <em>Your Hometown</em> episode, she talks with host Kevin Burke about how she made her way from her coming of age in the South Bronx to <em>Sesame Street</em> and how the real and fictional maps of those neighborhoods &ndash; one real, one imaginary &ndash; overlapped inside of her and in the TV worlds she created for us. As a magical storyteller, Sonia knows just where to go in her memories for that powerful combination of laughter amid pathos &ndash; the funny in the sad, the lessons in the every-day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Your Hometown </em>is a show where the local is the epic.
