  "description": "Last week it was the live show. This week the OM3 crew breaks some new ground once again as they welcome in their very first NFL player - Kansas City Chiefs All Pro tight end (and future HOF’er) Travis Kelce. Travis covers just about everything in this wide open interview as they tackle topics such as his golf game, his hoop skills, how his talents translated from basketball to football, what it’s like playing with Patrick Mahomes, and so much more. Then the gears switch to a whole new direction as JJ and Tommy are joined by YouTube megastars Marques Brownlee and Kenny Beecham to discuss all the hot new products and stories coming out the their worlds. (Editor’s note: this interview was recorded backstage at the OM3 live event with an iPhone, so it may sound a bit different than what you’re used to on the OM3. Still great either way, so don’t miss it). \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
