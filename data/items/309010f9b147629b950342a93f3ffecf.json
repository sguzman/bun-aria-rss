  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, a federal judge, Ketanji Brown-Jackson, has ruled that former White House Counsel Don McGahn must testify in Congress. This will be appealed and will likely be reversed because the President of the United States must be able to have legal advice without congress interfering. It doesn't matter if it's an impeachment proceeding or anything else. In fact, for more than 180 years subpoenas were never issued on the President or White House staff because there has always been an understanding in western civilization and the American legal system that the executive branch must be free to operate unmolested. Then, in Hong Kong young people are staring down tyranny. Sadly, in our country American students are demanding tyranny, embracing the policies of Elizabeth Warren, socialism, Marxism, Anti-Semitism, and anti-Americanism. Later, Joe Biden makes buffoonish remarks and suggests that the U.S Senate should interfere in the 2020 election by removing his potential opponent from the office of the presidency via impeachment. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has entered the Democrats primary for President and has been making his apology tour for implementing stop-and-frisk policing while mayor of New York City. Plus, CNN defends disgraced Rep. Katie Hill claiming she was a victim of a right-wing smear, not a victim of her own actions and extra-marital affairs.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
