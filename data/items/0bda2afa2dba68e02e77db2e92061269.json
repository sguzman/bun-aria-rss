  "description": "<p>Oftentimes, our society’s systems tell us that we have to follow a linear progression when it comes to growth. We see growth and progression as following Step 1, then Step 2, and then Step 3… However, to realize how far we have come and be able to move forward, it’s important to realize that healing is not linear.</p> <p>In this episode I break the question of “How Can I Coach Others If I’m Not Totally Healed”? down, while honoring the place that it’s coming from.</p> <p>If you’ve been holding back from helping others and coaching them because you’re afraid you might not be totally “healed” or in the “place to do so” yet… This episode will be a transformational experience where you’ll be able to identify where those feelings are coming from and move past them with ease.</p> <p>Ready to integrate your full multidimensional self into a thriving career as a Soul Purpose + Spiritual Life Coach?
