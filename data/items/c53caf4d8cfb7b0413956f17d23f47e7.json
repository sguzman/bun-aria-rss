He also lays out why some people still have reservations about insect diets (beyond the ick factor), since we don’t know whether insects feel significant pain.\n\nLearn More: \n\nRead Dylan’s story here. \n\nAnd you can read more about sustainability and farming from the team at Future Perfect. \n\n\nThis episode of Tell Me More was made by: \n\nHost: Emily Stewart (@emilystewartm) \n\nProducer: Sofi LaLonde (@sofilalonde)\n\nEngineer: Paul Mounsey\n\n\nEnjoyed this episode?
