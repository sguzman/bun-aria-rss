  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, while the legal challenge is an uphill battle there are still serious legal issues pending. The premise of the equal protection clause argument in some of the Trump legal challenges has yet to be heard - specifically by the Supreme Court of the United States. There is no incentive to relent at this time. Conversely, giving up prematurely would be immoral and can impact all future elections. Then, for months it was reported that President Trump was sabotaging the election by suppressing USPS and removing/replacing mailboxes - this was a lie. The media turns a blind eye to the DOJ's warning that Russia was attempting to influence the election in favor of Joe Biden. There is virtual silence on the success of Trump's Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the testing of a COVID-19 vaccine. Interestingly, Biden and the media have no explanation as to why is there an uptick in coronavirus cases when most Americans are wearing masks. Later, Daniel Horowitz of the Blaze called in to discuss the anomalies in Georgia's vote totals where their previous ballot rejection rate was 6.5%. Oddly, the 2020 election, with mail-in ballots, only had 0.2% and had many more ballots cast and still had a lower rejection rate. Horowitz added that the Constitution precisely names which day Presidential elections can be held and no state court has the power to alter that. Afterward, Sen. Kelly Loeffler calls in with an update on her runoff campaign in Georgia. Loeffler confirmed that anyone caught moving to Georgia just to vote will be referred to the State's Attorney General. Finally, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Lessig joins the program to discuss Lessig's column critiquing this program's comments on Article II of the Constitution. Lessig agreed with Mark Levin's point that Article II grants the state legislatures the power over the manner of the selection of electors. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
