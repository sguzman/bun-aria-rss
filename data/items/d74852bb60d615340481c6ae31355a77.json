  "description": "<p>The transverse force exerted on a rotating sphere immersed in an otherwise\nuniform flow of a rarefied gas is investigated based on the\nBhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzmann equation assuming the\nMaxwell boundary condition on the sphere. In several existing studies, it has\nbeen shown that the transverse force acting on the sphere, also known as the\nMagnus force, has opposite signs in the free molecular and continuum flows. The\npresent study intends to clarify the force's transition in terms of the Knudsen\nnumber (i.e., the reciprocal ratio of the sphere radius to the molecular mean\nfree path) with a particular interest in the impact of the sphere's surface\naccommodation. It is found that the threshold of the Knudsen number, at which\nthe transverse force changes the sign, depends only weakly on the accommodation\ncoefficient, suggesting certain robustness in the threshold. The present study\nis an extension of the previous work [S. Taguchi and T. Tsuji, J. Fluid. Mech.\n933, A37 (2022)], in which the case of complete accommodation (diffuse\nreflection) is exclusively considered.\n</p>",
