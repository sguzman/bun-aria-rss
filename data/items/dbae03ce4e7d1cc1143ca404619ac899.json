  "description": "A beautiful family. A luxury home. An idyllic street. A perfect town. Seems like the recipe for the American dream. But this family's dream soon turned into a nightmare when they began receiving threatening letters from someone simply known as The Watcher who made it very clear they were not welcome in the neighborhood. But who could have been demented enough to send these sinister messages? Was it a neighbor from hell, a bitter real estate agent, or could it possibly be the entire thing was a hoax concocted by the family themselves?\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices.
