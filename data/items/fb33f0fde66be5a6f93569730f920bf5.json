  "description": "<p>Jessica Chambers' mother sat through two grueling trials, hearing gruesome evidence of how her 19-year-old daughter was strangled, set on fire, and then taken to a hospital where nothing could be done to save her life. Both trials ended with hung juries despite what seemed to be overwhelming evidence against Quinton Tellis, a Mississippi man charged with her murder. Lisa Chambers gives her first interview about these mistrials to Nancy Grace in this episode. Joining the discussion are prosecutor Kenya Johnson, criminal defense lawyer Eric Johnson, private investigator Vincent Hill, prosecutor Wendy Patrick, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Bober, and Clarion-Ledger reporter Therese Apel.</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
