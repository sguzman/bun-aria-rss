  "description": "Cambridge Analytica is at the center of a growing controversy over how it obtained the private data of millions of Facebook users, and how it may have used that data in its work for the Trump campaign in 2016. Congress unveiled a $1.3 trillion dollar spending bill less than two days before government funding runs out — it's over 2,000 pages long. And John Dowd, who had been leading President Trump's outside legal team, has resigned. This episode: host/White House correspondent Tamara Keith, congressional correspondent Scott Detrow, political reporter Tim Mak, congressional reporter Kelsey Snell and political editor Domenico Montanaro.
