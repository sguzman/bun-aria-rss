  "description": "Let’s bring some joy and color into our week with Courtney McLeod, the designer behind Right Meets Left Interiors. Known for her beautiful and fun yet sophisticated body of work, Courtney is a true pro at using color to create joy and personality in her clients' homes. She talks with us about taking risks in business and in design, ways that we can start to incorporate more color in our design, and how to use color in small spaces.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs about new art lighting up our homes, a doctor’s visit for the pup, and great solutions for those unorganized beach towels.\n\nHow Courtney’s background of business and the finance industry mixes with her artistic side to create a perfect balance of mixing creativity with the analytical.\n\nCourtney’s process at Right Meets Left Design is all about listening to her clients and interpreting their desires and dreams into what is doable for their particular situation, taste, and budget.\n\nColor doesn’t always have to be loud, but it can be just as interesting when it is soft.\n\nHaving a contrast of shapes creates an interesting and engaging space, so it’s not all about going all angular or all circular.\n\nWays we can work with color, even if it intimidates us. Also, using color in small spaces and busting the myth that you can’t use bold color in a small space.\n\nDo what feels good for you when it comes to color and pieces that you love. Don’t worry about what anyone else thinks, or if you aren’t able to use it in your home just yet - you will one day!\n\nThe inspiration behind Courtney’s super cute designs in both New Orleans and Antiqua.\n\nFun and imaginative ideas for kids rooms that are interactive and great to stand the test of time including a comic book mural wall.\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nMelissa McGill \nBallard Cabot Hook \nSherwin Williams Dynamic Blue \n@rightmeetsleftinteriordesign\nRight Meets Left Interior Design \n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nThe tile to the ceiling is one of our favorite tricks, so we are glad you did that, and your space already has incredible bones and structure! It looks like you already have an area for counter stools in the kitchen and a really great dining area, so maybe make the center section more of a seating area and snacking area. We would recommend a tight back bench so you don’t get the squishiness when you sit on it and you can have an upright feel. Check out our banquette sofas, and one that was skirted would add some softness with a classic dining table look. For a chandelier, something smaller and undersized that looked like a little jewel would be super cool.\n____________________________________________________________________\nYour pieces have great lines, and we do agree that the brown feels a bit heavy. The two head chairs with chartreuse cushions would be excellent as white, making the cushions pop even more. Check out the Ballard chair options here, If you do decide to go for print, pick a print where your accent color is that smallest color in that print. You will be surprised how the solid will pair with the print.",
