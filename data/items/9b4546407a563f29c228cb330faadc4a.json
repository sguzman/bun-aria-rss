  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys cover everything that happened in week 2 of the NFL including Lamar Jackson showing out and why the Ravens might be the real deal, the Packers staying hot and taking a commanding lead in the NFC North, Kirk Cousins’ woes at Quarterback for the Vikings, Ben Roethlisberger needing season ending elbow surgery and how Sunday could potentially be the last time he throws a football in the NFL, the Dolphins being possibly the worst team in NFL history, and whether or not Alabama could beat them. The guys also cover the theatrics surrounding the Wake Forest/North Carolina game that Pat called on Friday of last week, Doug Marrone wanting to smack a few of his players in the mouth, whether the Giants should move ahead with Daniel Jones and if Eli is done, Julio Jones being a freak of nature, Pat chats about Adam Vinatieri’s struggles and the conversation they had after the Colts big divisional win against the Titans, and who the favorite in the NFC South is now that Drew Brees is out for the foreseeable future due to thumb surgery. Today’s a good one, covering everything you need to know around the league after week 2. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
