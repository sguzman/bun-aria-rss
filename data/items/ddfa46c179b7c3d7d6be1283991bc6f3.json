  "description": "<p>I started looking at Bancor years ago, because it had the same name as the world currency John M. Keynes had in mind. Their math fascinated me, and that's how I got started with the AMM rabbit hole! The Bancor V1 token economics analysis report (<a href=\"https://www.economicsdesign.com/portfolio/bancor/\">https://www.economicsdesign.com/portfolio/bancor/</a>) is about how Bancor works and what the token does.</p>\n<p>Bancor has been working on a few improvements, from price slippage issues to impermanent loss. V2 of Bancor was about dynamic weight, which is something really fascinating. But let's focus on their latest update, V2.1.</p>\n<p>V2.1 follows the static 50-50 weight as V1, aka the Uniswap style. The new introduction is the insurance for impermanent loss. So you <strong>will</strong> have ZERO impermanent loss. You get subsidised for any losses sustained. How does that work? Let's find out in this episode.</p>\n<p>We will also cover the supply of $BNT based on the various actions in the ecosystem and how that indirectly affects the price of $BNT.</p>\n<p>Want more in-depth content?
