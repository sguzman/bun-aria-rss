  "description": "<p>Bonus: Check out Get Real with Caroline Hobby!</p><p>Lauren and Thomas Rhett met when they were in first grade. They were great friends then tried dating around 15 years old. It didn’t work out then, but they stayed besties and after college TR confessed his love to Lauren and dared her to kiss him. The rest is history.  Lauren walks me through their whole love story, why their marriage isn’t perfect, their love of therapy, life on the road when they were newlyweds (it’s not always glamorous or fun FYI), becoming a huge celebrity in her own right and how she learned to process it. She then shares how she fell in love with the children and families of Haiti and Africa and knowing she was called to work with and change lives of children in need. She talks about finding balance between the poverty of 3rd world countries, where her heart lives, to walking red carpets.  Plus how she learned to embrace her platform to spread awareness of how her community can help those in need.  Also we talk about how TR knew they should instantly adopt Willa Gray and how they navigated being new parents to a 1.5 year old and newborn at the same time!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
