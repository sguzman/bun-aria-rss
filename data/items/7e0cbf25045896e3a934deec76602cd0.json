  "description": "<p>In May 1996, Lollie Winans and Julie Williams were murdered at their campsite in the popular Shenandoah National Park in the middle of rural Virginia, not far from a busy tourist resort called Skyland. Many people, including park and resort staff, had seen the happy, friendly couple in the area and were alarmed when they were reported missing. As experienced outdoorswomen, Lollie and Julie knew how to take care of themselves and each other.&nbsp;When their bodies were discovered, despite evidence that the women had been brutally tortured and killed, law enforcement decided not alert the public that a murderer could be in the park, and in fact diverted attention away from the crime. This and other shocking facts about the case are revealed in Kathryn Miles new book “Trailed: One woman’s quest to solve the Shenandoah murders”.&nbsp;&nbsp;We interview Kathryn about new details that have emerged about possible suspects. Jim and Laura discuss the victimology of Lollie and Julie, two extraordinary women whose families are still left searching for answers about their deaths.&nbsp;</p><p>#LollieWinans #JulieWilliams #Trailed #KathrynMiles #ShenandoahValley #MurderinNationalParks #WomenAreTargets #Femicide&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>*************** SUPPORT OUR OTHER SHOWS ***************</p><p>CRIME ANALYST PODCAST -&nbsp;</p><p>You’re interested in real crime?
