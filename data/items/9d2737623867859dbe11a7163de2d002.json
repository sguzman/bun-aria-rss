  "title": "PMS 2.0 548 - Aaron Rodgers Tuesday Week 12, Monday Night Football Recap With AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game and whether or not the Seahawks are dead, if this is truly the end of an era with Pete Carroll and Russell Wilson, if the Football Team is someone to keep an eye on as we reach the most meaningful football of the season, Tom Brady's comments about beating the Colts again on the Let's Go Podcast on Sirius XM, if people cant stand Tom Brady more now than when he was a Patriot, and tonight's episode of Man in the Arena. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk like he does every Tuesday, coming off a huge win over the Rams, is the Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about the big win over the Rams, some of the freedom that Davante Adams has while running routes, their chemistry in the offense, his incredible pump fake touchdown on Jalen Ramsay, how the toe is feelings and whether or not he's going to have surgery on the bye week, or if that is something that will happen in the future, his feelings about playing in the cold in Green Bay, and much much more (29:55-1:09:14).
