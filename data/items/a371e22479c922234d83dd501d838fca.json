  "description": "<p><em><strong>The Limits of Church Unity</strong></em><em>.</em> Gombis joins us this week to talk about Church unity. We discuss the article <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/\">\"THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH IS BREAKING APART: Christians must reclaim Jesus from his church,\"</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-wehner/\">Peter Wehner</a> in the Atlantic, which looks at the fragmentation of the Church and how we arrived here. For the most part we all see the brokenness of the Church on a macro level... what about on the micro level, within our own communities? How do we approach this topic? What duty do we have on both that macro and micro level? What does the Bible have to say? How do we un-disciple the last few hundred years that built this model? How do the \"Powers & Principalities\" play into the equation? Gombis is here to sort through the mess with us.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
