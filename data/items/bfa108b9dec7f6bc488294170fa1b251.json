  "description": "The Russian-Afghan bounty on allied troops scandal is rocking the White House. But it is actually many scandals in one. There is the scandal that Russia sought to pay to have US and allied forces killed, the scandal associated with the president's assertion he never heard about it, the scandal that exist if he did hear about it and didn't do anything about it, the compounding of that last scandal that occurs because he sought to reward the Russians in the wake of this news becoming known, and the scandal of keeping this information from the U.S. Congress. But as our panel--Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of AEI, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and David Sanger of the NY Times--point out, there is another scandal brewing. And that is that this entire matter may have no impact at all--politically, on Trump or, once again, on the Russians. (They have literally attacked Americans every way imaginable and have discovered that under Trump there are absolutely no consequences.) Don't miss this conversation on this big breaking story.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
