  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, once Iran has a nuclear weapon the situation and survivability of many countries in the Middle East and the West will come into question. President Biden seems to be secretly allowing Putin to negotiate on behalf of the U.S for the Iran deal. Then, it’s absurd to think that the older MIG-29 fighter jets would not be of benefit to Ukraine's efforts to defend itself. The U.S has the experience and satellite information and Mark suspect the U.S is sharing this information with the Ukrainians. Later, WNBA player Brittany Griner is still being held in a Russian jail and there's not a peep from corporations beyond a single statement coming from the U.S media and the American Marxists in professional sports. They celebrated the un-American group Black Lives Matter, but they won't support an athlete being held by Russia on minor marijuana-related charges. The further we move away from our founding, from the family, and God almighty himself, you get a failing decrepit society where those destroying it have political representation, a voice in the media, and have a force to promote their cause in our classrooms. These are the enemies from within the American Marxists. Also, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in to remind us that he has not been briefed by Nancy Pelosi even once on the Iran deal. McCarthy added that a majority in Congress isn't going to be just given to Republicans, they're going to have to earn it. Afterward, we are spending our way to hell. The left is destroying our currency and outsourcing our ability to produce energy. They want you to hate oil companies but love the government. The same government that drove up the prices of fuel by stopping domestic drilling and they think you're dumb enough to believe it was Putin that did it, not Biden. Finally, why is the New York Times now admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop is in fact real?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
