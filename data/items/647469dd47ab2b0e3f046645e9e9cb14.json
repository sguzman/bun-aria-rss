  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, In light of Gov Andrew Cuomo’s sexual harassment allegations, Jen Psaki was asked for her reaction to the Tara Reade/Joe Biden sexual allegations. Psaki dodged the question and reiterated that Biden believed that all women should be respected after brushing it off as \"heavily litigated during the campaign.\" Biden and Psaki seem to be done talking about this issue, however, it is impossible to believe Reade and Biden at the same time. Are they sticking to the notion that all women should be believed? Did Reade ever have her day in court? Then, McAllen, Texas is feeling the brunt of the border crisis and has declared a state of emergency after Biden's policies just dumped 1500 illegal aliens in their small city. Later, Rep Rashida Tlaib is a Hamas-supporting anti-semite and says that Palestinians have been cut off from clean water for a profit. Tlaib was alluding to a global Jewish structure that defends itself against Hamas' terror attacks. Meanwhile, Iran has blown an Israeli tanker out of the water, and in an act of appeasement, Sec. Blinken says he will leave it to Britain to figure out. Afterward, Biden and the CDC don't have the authority to extend any eviction moratorium. Moreover, not all renters are facing eviction, this is about power and expanding their massive and spending. When will the freebies end?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
