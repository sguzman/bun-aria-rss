  "description": "<p>May 17, 1953. Isojoki, Finland. 17 year old Kyllikki Saari bicycled home after a prayer meeting with a friend. Kyllikki had earlier expressed a bit of fear about riding home at night, but when it came time for the two to go there separate ways, she seemed to downplay her fear. Perhaps she felt that three and a half miles was close enough to home or that her fear was not something that she wanted to give into. Her final words to her friend began, \"I'm sure I'll be fine from here on, as I have been before.\" But Kyllikki was never seen alive again. Less than six months later her remains are found. Her burial site seemingly marked by a sharpened pine stick pushed into the ground. As the investigation into her murder got under way, a list of suspects grew. Who could have murdered this young woman? Was it the local vicar? A former police officer? Or was it a suspect from the Lake Bodom murders case? A tragic case of murder and a list of strange evidence and suspects adds up to one of the most infamous cases in Finland's history.</p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
