They then pivot to Carol Burnett's amazing cameo performance as cab driver Jeff's mom and speculate on what the title sequence and a recent Vanity Fair video featuring Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn may be revealing about the upcoming events in the final stretch of the series.(13:42) Next, they break down what the audience can learn from the college football dialogue within the episode and draw character and timeline parallels between Jimmy/Saul/Gene and Walter White. (34:34) After the break, they discuss how the tension during the heist sequence brought out the best aspects of Bob Odenkirk's acting prowess, their hopes for the end of the series, and how 'Better Call Saul' has changed how they view the 'Breaking Bad' universe.(47:57)\nHosts: Joanna Robinson and Ben Lindbergh\nProducer: Chris Sutton\nLearn more about your ad choices.
