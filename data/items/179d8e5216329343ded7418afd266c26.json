  "description": "<p>Marcel Breuer was one of several architects who brought European Modernism to the US. He was known for hundreds of projects including the Atlanta Public Library, The Whitney Museum in New York, the Pirelli Building in New Haven, The Housing and Urban Development Building in Washington DC, and many iconic houses in Massachusetts and Connecticut.  No one was more passionate than Breuer about his work - except for maybe Rufus Stillman, who commissioned four houses over the years. Joining us is James Crump, author of Breuer’s Bohemia, a new Marcel Breuer book - and movie. Later on, a few minutes with architect Frank Harmon.</p>",
