  "title": "68: The SoftBank Question",
  "description": "For years, tech startups could do no wrong. They were changing the world - and always for the good, or so we thought. The thinking changed when office leasing startup WeWork imploded last year. Much of the hype that built up WeWork and tech unicorns can be tied to SoftBank, a Japanese telecom giant that has poured $100 billion worth of investment into startups. It's become the face of tech's failures, but ask SoftBank and, for the most part, things are still going according to plan. This week Barron's Eric Savitz joins Alex Eule on The Readback. Produced by Mette Lützhøft.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
