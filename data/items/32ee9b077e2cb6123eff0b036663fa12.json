  "description": "Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander met in September of 2006 and from day one they were hooked on each other. Their relationship started getting toxic when Jodi became overly possessive and started listening in on Travis’s conversations when he was unaware. Travis broke things off with Jodi but the two of them never really stopped seeing each other, even when Jodi’s toxic behaviour was in full bloom. Unfortunately things escalated in June 2008 and Jodi murdered Travis in his own home. The details involved in this case are truly mind boggling. <br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nPretty Litter: Do what I did and make the switch TODAY by visiting <a href=\"http://PrettyLitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">PrettyLitter.com</a> and use promo code morbid for 20% off your first order<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://Stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a>: Save time and money with <a href=\"http://Stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a> & with our promo code, MORBID, you get a special offer that includes a 4-week trial PLUS free postage and a digital scale <br>\n<br>\nDaily Harvest: Go to <a href=\"http://DAILYHARVEST.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">DAILYHARVEST.com/morbid</a> to get up to forty dollars off your first box!<br>\n<br>\nCurology:  You can start your Curology journey just like I did with a free 30-day trial at<br>\n<a href=\"http://Curology.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Curology.com/MORBID</a>.
