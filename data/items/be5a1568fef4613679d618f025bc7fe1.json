  "description": "In this episode of The Barron Report, host Paul Barron meets with Nabeel Alamgir, the chief executive officer and co-founder of Lunchbox, to explore the future of eating and online ordering in the hospitality industry.<br /><br />Three Key Points:<br /><br />Lunchbox Technologies was launched in 2019. The company supplies multi-unit restaurants with an online ordering system and marketing engine. Before founding Lunchbox, Alamgir worked his way up from busboy to chief marketing officer at Bareburger.<br /><br />For Alamgir, operators today need three things: a direct order option, half the sales coming directly to their system, and a coherent virtual and digital presence. Restaurateurs need to have the pace and mobility of start-ups to stay ahead of an ever-changing industry.<br /><br />Looking ahead, operators are becoming more ambitious. Tech companies would do well to go beyond making websites and loyalty systems, and start crafting more data-driven offerings and virtual experiences that give operators the ability to build consumer attention without a storefront.<br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />“GrubHub and the restaurant industry were never aligned, and I wanted to do something about it. So Lunchbox was born. We grew 700 percent last year and we’re growing 500 percent this year. It’s been bonkers.” – Nabeel Alamgir<br /><br />“We’re not trying to hire the best people. We’re trying to hire the right people for what this company needs right now.” – Nabeel Alamgir<br /><br />“The problem is people give up. Restaurateurs are not tech-savvy—and it’s fine for them not to be. What is not okay is not hiring people who are.” – Nabeel Alamgir<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business insights to the next level. The restaurant industry isn't just the business of food. It's a cross-functioning, multivariate entity that touches almost every industry — after all, everyone needs to eat. So, why not learn from the greats from all businesses? Connect the dots, read between the lines, build innovative strategies, become a thought leader, get the inside scoop on trends and open your eyes to the full vision of restaurant and hospitality with The Barron Report.<br /><br />To keep listening to The Barron Report, check out the podcast on iTunes Now!",
