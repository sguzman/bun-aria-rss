  "description": "To recognize Black History Month, <em>Book of the Day</em> is digging into the archives to bring you some important interviews. In 1977, author Alex Haley told NPR he didn't want to put the main character of <em>Roots</em>, Kunta Kinte, on a slave ship. To prepare for writing that portion of the novel, Haley flew to Africa and caught a voyage home on a cargo ship — sneaking down into the hold after dinner. In the mornings, he would write notes about what he thought Kunta's experience would have been like. He told NPR's Marty Griffen that the experience weighed him down so much it nearly cost him his life.",
