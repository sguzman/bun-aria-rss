  "title": "Ep 145 | How to END Marxist Attempts to Destroy America | Douglas Murray | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "There’s a war on the West, and it’s distinctly Marxist, author Douglas Murray warns. It's taking America down a very dangerous path. Our story is being rewritten from one of heroism to one of sin, one that makes slavery our defining characteristic and abortion our highest virtue. But on this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Douglas tells Glenn how Americans can end this Marxist attempt to destroy America once and for all. Murray breaks down the realities we’re facing, as he describes in his new book, “The War on the West: How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason.” And he unapologetically makes it clear that enough is enough: “Long term, there’s no way we CAN’T win.”\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nBuilt Bars are made with real chocolate, high in protein and low in calories and carbs, and taste exactly like a candy bar.
