  "description": "<p>To effectively optimize and personalize treatments, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the heterogeneity of treatment effects. With the wide range of\nusers being treated over many online controlled experiments, the typical\napproach of manually investigating each dimension of heterogeneity becomes\noverly cumbersome and prone to subjective human biases. We need an efficient\nway to search through thousands of experiments with hundreds of target\ncovariates and hundreds of breakdown dimensions. In this paper, we propose a\nsystematic paradigm for detecting, surfacing and characterizing heterogeneous\ntreatment effects. First, we detect if treatment effect variation is present in\nan experiment, prior to specifying any breakdowns. Second, we surface the most\nrelevant dimensions for heterogeneity. Finally, we characterize the\nheterogeneity beyond just the conditional average treatment effects (CATE) by\nstudying the conditional distributions of the estimated individual treatment\neffects. We show the effectiveness of our methods using simulated data and\nempirical studies.\n</p>",
