  "title": "Ep 122 | Why the Radical Left Is DESTROYING Our Cities | Michael Shellenberger | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Author Michael Shellenberger knows the radical Left. In high school, he joined the Sandinistas. As an environmentalist, he worked alongside eco-anarchists. In the 1990s, he literally designed policy with George Soros. But the progressives of today scare him. The Left is attacking every single institution. These modern leftists want to destroy our country and everything that makes it wonderful. In this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Shellenberger reveals the Left’s anti-civilization agenda. His latest book, \"San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities,\" challenges many of the Left’s recent myths and delusions and exposes the Left’s tendency to completely destroy cities, which are where leftists happen to be most concentrated. Shellenberger came away from writing \"San Fransicko\" convinced that everyone should be pro-police. “If you really care about black lives, you should be pro-police,” he tells Glenn. \"San Fransicko\" has already pissed off progressives. They have responded exactly the way Shellenberger describes in the book: by ignoring the data and attacking him personally and pretending he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He does. This interview proves it.\nSponsor:\nPre-Born partners with clinics in the highest abortion-rate cities and regions. They have a passion to save babies and to see these women come to Christ.
