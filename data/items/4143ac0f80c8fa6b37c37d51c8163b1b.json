I could see that she was excited to share it with everyone but there was a problem—she told the story in Spanish, a language that I don’t understand. I pulled out Google Translate to transcribe the speech as it was happening. As she was telling the story, the English translation appeared on my phone so that I could follow along—it fostered a moment of understanding that would have otherwise been lost. And now anyone can do this—starting today, you can use the Google Translate Android app to transcribe foreign language speech as it’s happening.</p><p>Transcribe will be rolling out in the next few days with support for any combination of the following eight languages: English, French, German, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Thai. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--2 h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-5 h-c-grid__col--offset-4\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"Ongoing translated transcript\" class=\"article-image--small\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/transcribe_v1_gif_-_for_blogpost.gif \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><br/></p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To try the transcribe feature, go to your <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate\">Translate app on Android</a>, and make sure you have the latest updates from the Play store.
