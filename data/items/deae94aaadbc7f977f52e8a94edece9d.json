  "description": "Or at least let's not talk about Florida-Tennessee very much, and, guess what! We don't! Not when we can ponder Brian Kelly losing his job after giving up 50 points to Boston College, or Papa John debating health care with Stephen A. Smith, or Wisconsin fans trying to get drunk in Provo, or doing a live edition of the Shutdown Fullcast at the last remaining Popeyes with a buffet?\n(Seriously, I hope we do that last one.
