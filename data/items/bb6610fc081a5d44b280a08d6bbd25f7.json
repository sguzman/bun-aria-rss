  "title": "Ep 154 | Jim Breuer Doesn't Care if You Think His Comedy Is Too Political | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "These days, everything is political, and comedy has been one of the biggest victims. Comedians are told to walk on eggshells. But Jim Breuer doesn’t care. He’s going to walk wherever he damn well pleases. On this episode, the hit stand-up comedian and \"Saturday Night Live\" alum joins Glenn for a laugh-out-loud chat about why he’d rather be funny than fearful. Breuer also reveals his favorite comedian of all time, what inspired his comedy special, “Somebody Had to Say It,” and his secret for dealing with tough times. And he’s seen his share. But he’s also seen miracles, including the incredible (and hilariously told) story of how God saved his marriage.\n\nSponsors:\n\n﻿You could have a real steakhouse experience in your own home before you know it. The first step is visiting https://Goodranchers.com/Glenn today and saving $30 on your first order of American meat delivered!\n\nIf you're one of the millions of Americans who suffer every day from pain, there is hope, and it comes in the form of Relief Factor.
