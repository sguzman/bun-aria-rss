  "description": "<p>For Avery's birthday, a very special episode was recorded: The Battle of Naboo as seen in the climax of \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\". Avery was joined by fellow Star Wars nerds Julia Wall, Mary Challman and Jeff Martin as they helped him celebrate his 28th with a four-hour long Skype call and the subsequent discussion about all things Star Wars that followed. The gang dissects the Battle of Naboo from all angles: the diversionary role of the Gungan Grand Army, the incredible leadership of Padme Amidala, the craziness of a 9-year-old Anakin Skywalker in a space battle, and the \"Duel of the Fates\" itself, Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Tune in if you're a fan of a galaxy far far away as this was a good time! Enjoy!</p>",
