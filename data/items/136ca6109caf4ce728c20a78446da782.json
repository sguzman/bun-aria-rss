  "description": "<p>The new film “Green Book” is rolling out across the country. I have not seen the film, so I can’t speak to its merits or shortcomings, but while people are possibly being introduced to the concept of the Green Book for the first time, we thought we’d re-release this story from a few years ago about the origin and significance of the Green Book: the Negro Motorists’ Travel Guide to the segregated US. </p>\n<p>As a special bonus to our story, we also have a Green Book story from Nate DiMeo of <a href=\"http://thememorypalace.us/\" target=\"_blank\">the memory palace</a>. Nate had coincidentally written his episode called “Open Road” and we both released them without having heard the other. I think hearing them one after the other is real treat. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=27546&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">The Green Book</a></p>\n<p>Subscribe to the memory palace in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-memory-palace/id299436963?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts </a>or <a href=\"https://radiopublic.com/TheMemoryPalace\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Public</a></p>\n",
