  "description": "<p>We treat dogs like they're part of the family. But do they know they are a different species, or do they think they're just short, four-legged people?</p>\n<p>In this episode, canine cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz helps us puzzle out this question. We’ll also find out what happens (or doesn’t) when a dog looks in the mirror. Dogs are always dozing, and we’ll check in to see if they are dreaming too. And, we take a quick trip around the world in the language of barks. </p>\n<p>All that, plus a brand new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: “Why does the moon follow us?”</p>\n<p> Today’s episode is sponsored by Hooked On Phonics (HookedOnPhonics.com/brainson).
