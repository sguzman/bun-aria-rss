A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. Identity Politics,\n\nImmigration, the Wall, security, unwanteds, deportations, and the list goes on and on. The Left seems to think the good times will continue to roll in and when it does make an appearrance, they think its just a blip, an abberation, but they still want to be the altrustic sort that puts others first, with complete disregard for oneself. The past week has seen the government take action in immigration, toe the line with good and bad decisions, and of course fall flat on its face when caught with its hand in the proverbial cookie jar. So, whats left to talk about? Well, tune in and see.\n\nJoin me tomorrow at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss these and much more.\n\nTrigger Warning; I'm not intending to be Politically Correct.",
