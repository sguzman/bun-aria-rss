  "description": "Five days a week, Carl Cannon writes the Morning Note newsletter for Real Clear Politics, and includes a historical vignette about something in American history that happened on that date. Now he’s turned his daily vocation into a book. On This Date: From the Pilgrims to Today, Discovering America One Day at a Time (Twelve, 2017) is a collection of essays, one for each day of the year, each providing fresh perspective. From Pocahontas to Susan B. Anthony, Benjamin Franklin to Ronald Reagan, Hattie McDaniel to Jesse Owens, Cannon covers five centuries of American history. By tracing how America has been shaped by debates, war, sports, science and art, Cannon subtly reminds us that America and its democracy has faced many trials, only to survive and thrive. For those who fret that America is in decline, On This Date will renew one’s faith in the American spirit.\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News, among other publications. He is author of Wait!
