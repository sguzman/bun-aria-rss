  "description": "<p>On this special episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by recurring guest host Jeff Martin to discuss a piece of American history that has not been heavily examined until recently: the 1985 raid and bombing of the MOVE Black Liberation group by the Philadelphia Police Department. In these uncertain times, it is important to examine the past and hopefully learn the lessons it can teach us. In this episode, Avery & Jeff discuss the forgotten standoff between police and MOVE, and examine what led to the police dropping an aerial bomb on a Philadelphia neighborhood. DISCLAIMER: the point of this episode is not to get political or offend certain parties out there, but to bring this topic to light and relate it to current events. It's an emotional and sensitive subject, but we still hope you enjoy.</p>",
