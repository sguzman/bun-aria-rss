  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, what is the Left’s real problem with the anti-groomer efforts? It’s that we’re trying to get their religion out of the school system. A separation of the leftist church and state. Also, the Biden Administration is claiming that inflation is “Putin’s price hike.” We’ll take a look at the data and see if that claim holds up. Plus, DeSantis puts policies in place to support fatherhood in Florida, which has some leftists upset. And a male prisoner first identified as a woman and now identifies as a baby. And of course that self-identity is being respected by prison staff. In our Daily Cancellation, a libertarian magazine laments the lack of porn online. Apparently there isn’t enough of the stuff. We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show.  \n\nJoin Ben’s Third Thursday Book Club now to get his notes for The Once and Future King by T.H.
