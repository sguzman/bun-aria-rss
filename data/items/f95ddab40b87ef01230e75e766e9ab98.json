    "media:description": "Despite its name, Power Pop as a genre has often failed to accrue the popularity necessary to set the charts ablaze. Fountains of Wayne’s brand of detail-rich storytelling and bittersweet character study twinned with a sugary 90s alt rock crunch did little to change that. \n\nThey were the bizarro Weezer, loved by critics but underrated by the general music listening public. That was until they created the “second-catchiest song ever written about a girlfriend's parent.\" [Ben Greenman, The New Yorker, June 2003] By that point though, one of their songwriters had already racked up his fair share of fantasy pop gems for Hollywood.
