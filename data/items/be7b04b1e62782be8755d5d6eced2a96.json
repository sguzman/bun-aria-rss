  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, in usual fashion the press can't help themselves but wrongly accuse President Trump of calling Duchess Of Sussex Meghan Markle nasty, which he did not. He simply said that he didn't know she'd been nasty in her comments toward him during the campaign. Yet the media never pauses before comparing Trump to Stalin, calling him a white supremacist, and more. This pseudo-event has been covered as major news by the likes of hack reporters such as Jonathan Lemire, the Associated Press' White House correspondent. Lemire positioned Trump's comments as an attack on Markle because she is part African American and an attack on Muslims because the Mayor of London is a Muslim. This is why it's important to recognize these manufactured media falsehoods as pseudo-events as explained in chapter five of \"Unfreedom Of The Press.\" Then, a federal judge ruled in favor of Trump using funds to build the border wall saying that congressional Democrats had no standing and that the Administration was correct, citing the Constitution and Political Doctrine Exception that the courts shall not interfere in political battles. In the same way, the Supreme Court will never weigh in on impeachment because it’s a political process. The media’s headline should be - 384 Members of the House of Representatives oppose Trump's impeachment.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
