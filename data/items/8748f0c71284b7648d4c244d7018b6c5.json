  "description": "Jennifer Aniston’s story had it all: Heartbreak, secrecy, sex, betrayal. But what it also had was a new kind of tabloid: Us Weekly and its copycats. Brad Pitt leaving Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie would have been a huge Hollywood scandal no matter when it happened, but it became an even bigger one because it was turbocharged by these tabloids. Almost 15 years later, the tabloid In Touch ran an issue with the headline “Brad Stuns Jen! Marry Me again!”  What is going on? How is it still going on? Why is it still going on? \nThis is the last episode of Decoder Ring for 2018. See you in the new year. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
