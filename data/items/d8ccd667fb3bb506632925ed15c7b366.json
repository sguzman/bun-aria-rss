  "description": "We had a recent question from one of our listeners asking if we could do an episode dedicated to putting up artwork in your home, so today that’s what we will be talking about. When trying to figure out how to decorate your home, first think of what kind of art you like, and then we recommend using Pinterest where you can create your own compilation of artworks that you like. We discuss some of the different types of art and have noticed that most people don’t like a figure or subject in their art, but others, like Sue who is an extrovert, love having people in their art, so really it comes down to who you are. Pay attention to size and scale to determine how your art will fit into the design of your living space. <br /><br />Where to start 2:33<br />Forming your own opinion 4:09<br />Scale 7:08<br />Photography 11:29<br />Gloppy oils in the kitchen 13:49<br /><br />“When you are curating art, a lot of people don’t know, again we’ve said this before on previous podcasts, art is the hardest layer. Most people don’t know what to do with themselves when we come up with art. They’re like, ‘Should I like that? Is it personal? How should I respond to this?’ So we often do a few presentations, reselections on art.” 2:11<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
