First, 3x NFL Defensive Player of the Year, 5x 1st team All-Pro, 5x Pro Bowler, 2x NFL sacks leader, former Walter Payton Man of the Year, 2017 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, one of the most dominant defensive players in the history of football, JJ Watt, joins the show. He and Pat chat about his recent commencement speech at the University of Wisconsin, the massive chip on his shoulder that has led to his success, what still motivates him to be great, his new game show Ultimate Tag that he’ll be hosting with his brothers, and JJ gives Pat his personal endorsement for the Monday Night Football gig in an incredibly honest and hilarious interview (3:37-28:54). Next, Pat debuts country music star and friend of the show, Clayton Anderson’s new song, “Run Wild,” that will be available everywhere Thursday at midnight. Pat also chats about marijuana in the NFL as he brings back everyone’s favorite segment, “Some Thoughts.” Later, Pat recounts Shane Morris’ viral Twitter thread recounting how he unknowingly transported $40,000 worth of heroin across the country and narrowly escaped death when the original owner came back looking for it, and Shane joins the boys for a Q&A about how everything went down (1:14:56-1:24:19). Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
