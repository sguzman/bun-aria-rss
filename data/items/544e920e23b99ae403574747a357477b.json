  "description": "Chelsea Handler is unfiltered, unapologetic and unlike anyone else. The comedian/talk show host joins Anna and Sim this week, bringing to bear her acerbic wit and take-no-prisoners approach to love and life. In Part 1 of this two-part episode, Chelsea explains why she hates compliments, terms she finds most offensive and what exactly it takes to be her friend. She and Anna also trade break-up stories (you won’t believe how ballsy Chelsea is!) and discuss other dating misadventures. Then, in a new segment, Sim gives Anna and Chelsea twenty guesses to identify a mystery celebrity guest-caller. (See if you can figure out who it is before they do!) After Anna’s unbridled excitement subsides, the trio reflects upon the “intoxicating” effect of fame and the ups and downs of life in the Hollywood spotlight.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
