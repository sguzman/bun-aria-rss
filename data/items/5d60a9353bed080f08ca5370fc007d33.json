  "description": "<div>The government lies to you. The media lies to you. Your doctor lies to you. Even your mechanic lies to you sometimes. The major difference is that when your mechanic lies to you about needing a new fan belt, it might only cost you $200, but when a government lies it could literally cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.<br>\n<br>\nGeorge Carlin rightly stated that his policy was to never believe anything that the government tells the public about anything, so why do so many people still fall for the same lies over and over again? Are we all that gullible, or is there something else happening?<br>\n<br>\nLetâ€™s examine the official story of 9/11 to check out how the government goes about lying on a massive scale to the public, and why they never feel any obligation to tell the truth about what America is actually doing around the world.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors:<br>\n</strong>Emergency Preparedness Food:<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com/\">www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com</a><strong><br>\n</strong>Chemical Free Body: <a href=\"http://www.chemicalfreebody.com/\">www.chemicalfreebody.com<br>\n</a>Use the promo code: \"<strong>MACRO\"</strong> for a discount on all purchases!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
