  "description": "<p><em><strong>The Wanderer: Grief, Grace and the Grotesque.</strong></em> Intriguing title, right? It reads like the title of Tim Stafford's autobiography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Episode Two: Previously on <em><strong>The Wanderer</strong></em>, <a href=\"https://timgombis.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Timothy Gombis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.timothyjohnstafford.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy John Stafford</a> discussed their personal histories with the band and how U2's journey in many ways mirrored their own spiritual development. Today, the Tims dive deeper into theme and some rich spiritual ideas that are discussed in a few songs in particular. How do grief and hope relate? How is it discussed outside of sentimentality? What is the mood on <em>'Silent Saturday,'</em> the day between the crucifixion and the resurrection? What is Jesus's relationship to the Grotesque? How can something be both twisted and beautiful at once? What is the grammar of the Gospel? What is the <em>logic</em> of the Gospel??</p>\n<p>This will be a three episode mini series, and the first of several topical conversations that will be had under the moniker of the Wanderer.
