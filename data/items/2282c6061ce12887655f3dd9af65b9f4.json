  "description": "In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:05:10) Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link\n(00:07:40) Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable\n(00:10:53) To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty\n(00:15:21) Your First Feeling Was Anxiety\n(00:17:36) What Are “Healthy Emotions”?\n(00:19:03) Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App\n(00:21:08) The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself\n(00:24:00) You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions\n(00:27:57) Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment\n(00:32:40) “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written)\n(00:36:34) “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic\n(00:37:50) An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias\n(00:42:19) Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture\n(00:46:59) Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive\n(00:47:58) Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection\n(00:50:34) Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage\n(00:54:37) Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent\n(00:58:26) Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds\n(01:00:25) Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal\n(01:07:48) Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet\n(01:11:05) “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies\n(01:14:18) Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness\n(01:16:15) How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody\n(01:18:32) Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States\n(01:20:09) Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior\n(01:23:00) Promoting Trust & Monogamy\n(01:27:00) Ways To Increase Oxytocin\n(01:28:34) Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities\n(01:30:43) Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body\n(01:35:18) A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience\n(01:30:43) MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework\n(01:38:54) Roundup, Various Forms of Support\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
