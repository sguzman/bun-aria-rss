  "description": "Sometimes a podcast is more than a podcast. Sometimes a conversation can radiate such energy that it transcends the medium, becomes art and makes history. How’s that for overpromising?! Get your popcorn out because this week the boys are dialing in Aaron Levine, the SVP of men’s and women’s design at Abercrombie & Fitch, for an absolute romp. Aaron is being held hostage on the bathroom floor of his hotel room for the kind of conversation you might have if you knew it was your last, covering a smorgasbord of topics including but not limited to: living every day like a grom, following your gut, the magic of NYC, the love of the game, being a true product guy, and much more on this infectiously exuberant episode of The Only Podcast That Matters™.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.\n",
