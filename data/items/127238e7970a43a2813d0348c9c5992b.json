  "description": "In a new video update, popular crypto analyst InvestAnswers tells his 439,000 YouTube subscribers that his “bear case” for Bitcoin in 2030 is $576,000, which is about 1,886% from current prices.\n\n“So not bad from where we are today. That’s basically a 20x give or take, a couple of dollars, which is a huge return, but still, it is a moving target. Things change all the time. Adoption changes, networks changes, competition changes. Bear that in mind.”\n\nBy combining all three Bitcoin price targets, the host finds an average “expected” target of $785,955 for BTC, with $576,389 being the 'bear-case' low end of the range and $1.55 million being the most optimistic forecast for the king cryptocurrency.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
