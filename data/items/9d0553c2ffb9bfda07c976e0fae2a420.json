  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino fills in, the media would have all of America believe that nothing was done to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which is simply not true. This is the American media repeating Chinese propaganda. Then, America must re-open the economy and fast. This is not a choice between losing bad and losing less — there's no magical winning strategy to get our of this. We must go through this and rebuild. Also, the 24-hour media hysteria being peddled must stop. We can't tiptoe around this problem like victims. President Trump was right when he said we've built this country before and we will build it again. Later, small business owners need to get back to work to support their families, their customers, and the rest of America. It's not reasonable that grocers, healthcare workers and other deemed \"essential\" take all the risk and the rest of us stay home. The only non-essential business is the business that isn't yours. Afterward, despite the promise seen in Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin the media continues to take a position against the combination therapy simply because it was introduced as a solution by President Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
