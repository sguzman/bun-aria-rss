  "title": "Why Xi Jinping’s power grab is dangerous for China — and the world",
  "description": "Yochi, Zack and Jenn talk about China's decision to allow President Xi Jinping to rule the country indefinitely, a move that means the world's biggest country will likely grow even more repressive at home and aggressive abroad. On Elsewhere, they discuss a bizarre legal fight in Panama that erupted when the owners of a Trump-managed hotel in Panama tried to fire the Trump Organization, only to see the Trump employees literally brawl with both Panamanian police and the private security guards sent to evict them. Zack accuses Yochi of buying into Chinese propaganda, Jenn reminisces about Jimmy Carter’s peanut farm, and Yochi decides which kind of Chinese bear he is. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
