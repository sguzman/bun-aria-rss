  "description": "<p>Are you looking for gift ideas for the R addicts in your life or the next guest speaker at your user group? Here are a few ideas, in four categories! Not all of them feature our company, promised. ;-)</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"learning-and-using-r\">Learning and using R</h1>\n\n<p>Is your dear one just starting to learn R? You might help them by gifting them a book, or even a couple of them! We suggest the R fundamentals series by Locke Data&rsquo;s Steph Locke, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1999842618/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2\">Volume 1, Working with R</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979699933/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1\">Volume 2, Data Manipulation in R</a>, both of them available as paperback and Kindle versions. Other useful books for R users of all levels include <a href=\"http://bestprogrammingbooks.com/9-r-popular-o-reilly-books/\">R books by O&rsquo;Reilly</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got all my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> cheat sheets printed and laminated to pass around during R-Lab to help the students this semester. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tidyverse</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AcxIDfj0i9\">pic.twitter.com/AcxIDfj0i9</a></p>&mdash; Dylan McDowell (@dylanjm_ds) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylanjm_ds/status/1040644353331326976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 14, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n<p>If the R user in your life uses RStudio packages, they might appreciate using <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheat sheets/\">RStudio cheatsheets</a> about data manipulation, dates and times, Keras, etc. The cheatsheets are available for free, and you could print and laminate a few of them as a gift!</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"becoming-a-legit-package-developer\">Becoming a legit package developer</h1>\n\n<p>Is the person you want to surprise a package developer? How about increasing their confidence and joy in their package by gifting them a voucher for a hex logo creation by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LockeCreatives\">Locke Creatives</a>? Oz Locke, who has designed the hex logos for RDogLadies, <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/visdat#visdat-\"><code>visdat</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/njtierney/naniar#naniar-\"><code>naniar</code></a>, among others. Reach out to Oz on Twitter if you&rsquo;d like to know more!</p>\n\n<p>As a complement, you could then offer to print the created hex logos as stickers.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"decorating-one-s-office\">Decorating one&rsquo;s office</h1>\n\n<p>Why not gift R art to hang on the walls? We like</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">personifyr::sf [be a space wrangler]. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HehHARwM3E\">pic.twitter.com/HehHARwM3E</a></p>&mdash; Allison Horst (@allison_horst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1071456081308614656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Drawings by the very talented Allison Horst, that you could have print and have framed. She does not seem to have a shop yet, but you could contact her!</p></li>\n\n<li><p>This nifty <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/fr/listing/554706505/ceci-nest-pas-une-pipe-au-point-de-croix\"><code>magrittr</code> cross-stich found on Etsy</a>!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"getting-out-of-one-s-office\">Getting out of one&rsquo;s office</h1>\n\n<p>Loving R does not mean working at one&rsquo;s desk all the time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The R community likes hex shaped things. You could gift a hex shaped baking tin, or other hex shaped objects, with material to personalize them, or you could personalize them yourself. E.g. see these gorgeous coasters!<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I recently acquired some cork and a soldering iron, and learned how to make coasters by burning patterns into them. So even though I don&#39;t have any actual hex stickers, I now have these! <a href=\"https://t.co/g8ddXvAH3S\">pic.twitter.com/g8ddXvAH3S</a></p>&mdash; Kim Cressman (@swmpkim) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swmpkim/status/1065295487136382977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have you heard of the SatRday conferences? They&rsquo;re community-lead, low-cost one day R conferences. You could buy a ticket to your dear one&rsquo;s local satRday conference, or even make a trip out of it if the conference is not that local. Check out <a href=\"https://satrdays.org/events/\">SatRdays calendar</a>. There&rsquo;s one planned in <a href=\"https://paris2019.satrdays.org/\">Paris</a> on February the 23d!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s it! It might be a little bit late for the holidays depending on the ones you celebrate, but occasions to give presents will surely happen again soon!
