I came out above the wood\n\nWhere my breath left tortuous statues in the iron light.\nBut the valleys were draining the darkness\n\nTill the moorline blackening dregs of the brightening grey\nHalved the sky ahead. And I saw the horses:\n\nHuge in the dense grey ten together\nMegalith-still. They breathed, making no move,\n\nWith draped manes and tilted hind-hooves,\nMaking no sound.\n\nI passed: not one snorted or jerked its head.\nGrey silent fragments\nOf a grey still world.\n\nI listened in emptiness on the moor-ridge.\nThe curlews tear turned its edge on the silence.\n\nSlowly detail leafed from the darkness. Then the sun\nOrange, red, red erupted\n\nSilently, and splitting to its core tore and flung cloud,\nShook the gulf open, showed blue,\n\nAnd the big planets hanging\nI turned\n\nStumbling in a fever of a dream, down towards\nThe dark woods, from the kindling tops,\n\nAnd came the horses.\nThere, still they stood,\nBut now steaming, and glistening under the flow of light,\n\nTheir draped stone manes, their tilted hind-hooves\nStirring under a thaw while all around them\n\nThe frost showed its fires. But still they made no sound.\nNot one snorted or stamped,\n\nTheir hung heads patient as the horizons,\nHigh over valleys, in the red levelling rays\n\nIn din of the crowded streets, going among the years, the faces,\nMay I still meet my memory in so lonely a place\n\nBetween the streams and the red clouds, hearing curlews,\nHearing the horizons endure.\n\n\nNew Selected Poems by Ted Hughes. Faber & Faber; Main edition (6 Mar. 1995)",
