Because the latest apps and digital platforms are specifically designed to addict, we have become&nbsp;slaves to their irresistible allure.</p><p>Our precious attention is being hijacked. The ability to focus — to concentrate on that which is most meaningful — simply cannot compete with the magnetic pull of our Instagram feed.&nbsp;No longer&nbsp;need anyone ever be bored. Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self.&nbsp;</p><p>The result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.</p><p>The solution isn't Ludditism. Instead it's agency. We need not be victims of technology.&nbsp;We have the power to&nbsp;liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn't just the salve to what ails us, it's the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.</p><p>Indeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower.</p><p>Cal Newport is&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;has spent a lot of time thinking deeply about these issues.</p><p>An associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Cal is the author of six books, many of which focus on the impact of technology on society. The primary focus of today's conversation is rooted in his latest New York Times bestseller, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536515/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0525536515&linkId=bbace78e8d62508c9fd44e6335d2bfc2\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*.</a></p><p>Cal’s work has been published in over 20 languages. He is a frequent guest on NPR and has been featured in many major publications, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New Yorker, Washington Post, and Economist.</p><br><p>Regular listeners know I have a penchant for dropping Cal's name with regularity. I became acquainted with his work in early 2016 by way of his seminal book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkId=ee5c10969d72d485d761974285001085\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Work:&nbsp;Rules for Focused Success in A Distracted World*</a> — pages that profoundly impacted how I think about and apply my attention.

The aforementioned two rank close to the top — manifestos of great practical import for our modern age. Similarly, I estimate that this episode rates among the most consequential conversations I've had in the 6+ year history of this podcast. Packed with practical, actionable steps, Cal's message will empower you to free up precious time. Declutter your mind. Connect you more deeply to the work and relationships you care most about.
