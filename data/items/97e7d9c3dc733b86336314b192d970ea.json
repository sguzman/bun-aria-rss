  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 13 - “The Lord’s Prayer.\" Matthew 6:9-14. “This, then, is how you should pray…” Jesus walks us through a framework on how we might enter into prayer. The prayer itself is short, but as always, it is layered and nuanced and packed with so much. As we talked about last week, Jesus approaches God as ‘Father.’ What does he mean by in ‘Heaven?’ What does ‘hallowed’ imply? How does Jesus continue to use the ‘now and not yet’ structure? What does the ‘daily bread ‘ link to? Debt and debtors, temptation and delivery from the evil one… Jesus covers a ton. How then should we pray? If this is a framework, how does it apply and direct us? Brick by brick, the foundation of the Kingdom is being laid.\n\nTomorrow is “Giving Tuesday,” a day during this season to support non profits, like VOX! You can do so at: www.voxpodcast.com\n\nThis is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
