  "description": "Japan is no stranger to rich folklore on various mythical beasts and urban legends, and not all of these stories are pleasant. Some tell of horrifying creatures. Others, about tyrannical demons. Join us today as we investigate the terrors in Japan. First, we'll take a voyage across the sea and hear the ravings of an old ship captain. Next, we'll get dangerously hungry in 18th-century Japan. After that, we'll see where the path of greed will lead us. And finally, we'll encounter a snow witch in the dead of winter.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
