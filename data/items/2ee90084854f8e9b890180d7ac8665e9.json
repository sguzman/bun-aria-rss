  "description": "Microchips are in pretty much all of our electronic devices—if it’s got a plug or a battery, it’s probably got a chip. For the past 60 years, most of these have been made of silicon. But new devices demand faster, better, and more efficient processors, and engineers are hitting silicon’s physical limits. In this episode of the Future of Everything, WSJ’s Alex Ossola digs into the future of chips—how scientists are boosting silicon’s capabilities and looking for other materials that could take its place.\n\n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nGraphene and Beyond: The Wonder Materials That Could Replace Silicon in Future Tech \n\nThe Microchip Era Is Giving Way to the Megachip Age \n\nChips Act Will Create More Than One Million Jobs, Biden Says Timeline of silicon’s development (Computer History Museum) \n\nChristopher Mims’ tech column for the Wall Street Journal \n\nDeji Akinwande's research page at the University of Texas at Austin \n\nStephen Forrest's profile page at the University of Michigan \n\nDeep Jariwala's lab page the the University of Pennsylvania Wolfspeed's website \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
