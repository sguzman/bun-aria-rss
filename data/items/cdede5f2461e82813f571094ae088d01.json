  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party as an institution has never embraced this country. It’s an institution with a history that rejects the founding and regressively focuses on systemic racism. The Democrat Party gets power by hating the country, encouraging others to hate the country, and by eroding the culture of the country. Are the police guarding the Capitol systemically racist? Are all of the African American police chiefs across the country systemically racist? Then, Ma'Khia Bryant was fatally shot after charging another teenaged girl with a knife. Every police shooting is not racist, yet Democrat race-baiters like LeBron James push this false narrative to inflame the situation while doxing a cop's photo threatening that he'd be \"next.\" Exploiting these unfortunate events is wearing thin on the American public. However, Lebron and the democrats have said nothing about a 7-year-old African American girl who was killed in a gang-related shooting while at a drive-thru? The real question here is; who represents the American people who don't support riots, racism, and recklessness? Later, Jen Psaki and the media dwell in hypocrisy advocating for 16-year-olds to vote and then referring to them as children when they're involved in attacks on police. Racist Professors on the fringe of intellectualism like Ibram X. Kendi are making a fortune indoctrinating Americans to hate the White people. The media like CBS are there to help push this emotional anti-police and anti-American propaganda. Afterward, Elizabeth Warren is an anti-Semite and threatened Israel in comments she would never make about Iran, Russia, or North Korea at a J-Street conference. Warren threatened to cut off military aid to the Israelis. This is political blackmail to get the Jews to give up their native land. The Democrat party thrives on system anti-Semitism and the media is silent about it. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
