  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about the claim that \"the Turkish Crime Family\" is holding iPhones hostage. WikiLeaks grumbles that it has few takers for its Vault 7 bugs. Germany raises its state of cyber alert, pre-election. The US expects more Russian cyber and influence operations. A Russian bank says it was framed (and maybe it was). UMD's Jonathan Katz provides technical details on the recent SHA-1 collision. Mandiant's Ronald Bushar gives us highlights from their M-Trends report. Fears of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor\" may distract from real ICS risks. And no, Martians haven't landed in New Jersey.",
