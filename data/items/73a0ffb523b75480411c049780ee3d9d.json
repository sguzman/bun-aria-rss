  "title": "Warren Treadgold, “The University We Need: Reforming American Higher Education” (Encounter Books, 2018)",
  "description": "Though many Americans, Republicans especially, regard universities as heavily disposed to the political left, few people understand how much this matters, how it happened, how deeply ideologically siloed the academy is, or what can be done about it. In The University We Need: Reforming American Higher Education (Encounter Books, 2018), Professor Warren Treadgold shows the crucial role of universities in American culture and politics, the causes of administrative bloat and inept academic hiring, the decline of teaching and research, and some possible ways of reversing the downward trend. \n\nIn addition to recommending policies to address issues such as grade inflation and poor scholarship, Treadgold offers a specific proposal for the founding of a new, world-class university. He describes how to create a school which could seriously challenge the dominance of Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and Berkeley, attracting conservative and moderate faculty and students and providing a much-needed alternative to the failing status quo.\n\nWarren Treadgold is the National Endowment for the Humanities Professor of Byzantine Studies and Professor of History at Saint Louis University. With a BA and PhD from Harvard, he has taught at UCLA, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Hillsdale College, and Florida International University and has held research fellowships at the University of Munich, the Free University of Berlin, All Souls College at Oxford, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He has published ten books and many articles on Byzantine, medieval, and late ancient history and literature and published articles on higher education in Commentary, The Weekly Standard, The Wilson Quarterly, and Academic Questions.\n\n\n\nHoover Harris, editor of Degree Or Not Degree?, holds a PhD in English and writes and speaks about trends in higher education.
