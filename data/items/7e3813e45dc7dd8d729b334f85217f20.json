  "description": "<p>Twenty-one years ago, Katie Couric aired her first colonoscopy on the ‘Today Show.' It was an up-close and personal experience that helped demystify a still-taboo health procedure. A study would later find that colonoscopies increased by 20 percent as a result of Katie airing her personal business on national television. It was called “The Couric Effect.” And it turns out, the Couric Effect is still rolling. “Using you as a model,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar tells Katie, “I’ve tried to really talk about this.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and the Minnesota Democrat talk about the Senator’s recent disclosure of her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment and how it could have gone another way. “I should have gone in a year earlier.” They also talk about Capitol Hill, the Jan. 6 insurrection, what to do about Big Tech, and the outlook for 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Going-There-Katie-Couric/dp/0316535869?&linkCode=sl1&tag=katiecouric07-20&linkId=56eae1af0296e6a316322528f3a84170&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Pre-order Katie Couric’s memoir, “Going There</a>,” to learn more about her cancer advocacy, televised colonoscopy and so much more.
