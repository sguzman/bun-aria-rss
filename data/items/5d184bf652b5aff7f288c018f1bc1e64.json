  "description": "<p>r/Pettyrevenge In today's episode, a complete jerkface decides to park in disabled parking even though he doesn't have a disabled placard. OP's mom, however, is disabled and she relies on those parking spaces. When jerkface walks off and leaves his car alone, OP's mom takes advantage of the freezing temperatures and some water to encase the jerk's key wells in solid ice. Maybe next time you'll think twice about being an inconsiderate prick!</p>\n",
