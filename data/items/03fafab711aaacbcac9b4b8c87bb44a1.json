  "description": "Thank you for tuning in for another fun festive episode of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  <br />We dedicate this episode to the loving memory of David Kimowitz who was taken away from us this weekend. He was part owner of the Stand in NYC and a super kind soul.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, everyone at the stand and all of our brothers and sisters in NYC comedy scene.  Comedy lost a great one. <br />This episode we welcome author Arthur Holland Michel to discuss his book \"Eyes In The Sky\" and what the affect of the Gorgon Stare and Drones will have on business, war and our privacy.
