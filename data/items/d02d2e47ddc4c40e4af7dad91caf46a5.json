  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the media moves in a pack making them very predictable as they attacked every republican they could find over the weekend on Ukraine. The \"whistleblower\" pseudo-event is just hearsay. Joe Biden says he's never discussed his son's business dealings with him, yet Hunter Biden says he did speak with his father about these business dealings. Who’s lying? Following Biden's on-camera threats of firing the Ukrainian prosecutor, Hunter Biden was named to the board of Barisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Yet, there isn't a single Democrat willing to investigate this, or Hunter Biden's similar involvement with a Chinese company. Just like Hillary Clinton should have been indicted, Joe Biden needs to be held to account for what he did on behalf of his son which includes obstructing justice in and blackmail. The media and the Senate should be asking scores of questions of Biden, instead of asking for the transcript of a private conversation between two presidents. Then, presidential hopeful Bill Weld says that President Trump should be put to death for his \"treasonous\" actions. Meanwhile, Rep. Adam Schiff continues leaking to the media and misrepresenting the facts. Later, Jerry Nadler joins the climate change chorus saying that we may face a mass extinction. Finally, Andrew Pollack calls in to wrap up the analysis of his book, Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created The Parkland Shooter and Endanger America's Students.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
