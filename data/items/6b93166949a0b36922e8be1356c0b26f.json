  "description": "Jesse Felder, editor of The Felder Report, gives us his take on inflation and warns listeners about the risks he sees in today’s market. He breaks down how the current Federal Reserve policy has changed since the last time we dealt with inflation fears… how to position yourself for higher prices across the board... why he’s watching corporate profit margins... and where he sees value today. Jesse also explains how to profit as the COVID bull market in certain stocks comes to an end. [17:33] Then, Daniel and I take a look at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, including management’s comments on Robinhood, bitcoin, climate change, and more. We also discuss the irony of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent comments on interest rates.
