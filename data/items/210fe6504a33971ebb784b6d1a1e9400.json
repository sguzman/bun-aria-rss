  "description": "<p>Whether you’re a fan of karaoke or not, it’s probably not a huge deal for you to stand up in front of some friends and belt out a favorite song of yours from highschool- maybe some Hootie & the Blowfish or a Kelly Clarkson hit. You might be a little nervous but you’re not going to give it too much thought. But now imagine having to sing that song in a stadium full of people. Things are going to be a bit different aren’t they?! You’re likely going to be much more nervous because the stakes are a lot higher! Well similarly, the stakes are higher than ever when it comes to finding the right housing for you. Prices have gone through the roof whether you’re renting or looking to buy. The typical American homeowner saw a gain of $50,000 of home equity in 2021- that’s insane! With the stakes so high, we’re going to weigh in with our thoughts about how you should proceed if you’re not sure whether you should keep renting or take the plunge into homeownership.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an El Cedro by Jester King!
