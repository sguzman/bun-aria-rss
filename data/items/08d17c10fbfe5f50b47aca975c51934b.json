  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>Hey Acquired listeners. A note about this show: we recorded this episode the night before the 2016 Election Day in the US. At the time, the biggest change we saw coming was adding a new type of content to Acquired in analyzing IPO’s, which we introduce in this episode. Two days later, we woke up to a very different world than the one we were expecting.</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>Reflecting on what’s happened, and the past few months of our show, we wanted to say two things:</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>First, we want to apologize for our cavalier attitude toward this election cycle, and our glossing over the clearly very real problems and deep divide in America that it represented. In the Skype episode, David pretty glibly compared the AT&T - Time Warner merger to \"Make America Great Again\", arguing that any reactionary force is “on the wrong side of history” and cannot be relevant in a changing world. That was wrong, the sentiment behind it was wrong, and it was insensitive to the very real pain a lot of people are feeling out there on both sides.</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>Second, looking back on this particular episode about the Facebook IPO, we think it actually might present a relevant parable for our country right now and--we hope--some important lessons for the technology industry going forward. For all the wonderful aspects of the tech industry that we celebrate on this show, there is no doubt that it also bears a great deal of responsibility for the current divide in America, and especially in its contribution to wealth inequality. Likewise, for all the wonderful aspects to the Facebook IPO story, as told in this episode, there is a very dark side as well: Facebook shareholders, investment banks and institutional investors raked in billions of dollars at the expense of individual retail investors who lost their shirts.</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>At the same time, Facebook’s perseverance through their “broken IPO\", and their determination in overcoming with incredible speed the massive, existential challenge to their business model posed by mobile, is something we think *can be* an inspiration to us all on how to move forward even when that seems hard. We hope you’ll listen to this episode with that in mind and think about how you, we, and the technology industry as a whole can do better in serving everyone in this country and in the world.</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>Thanks for being on this journey with us. We’re sorry for our shortcomings, and we’re going to keep working hard to do better. </em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>-Ben & David</em></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"> </p> <p
