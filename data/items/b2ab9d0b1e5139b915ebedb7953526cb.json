  "description": "When I learned about the ‘Love’ quilt that the Floyd Quilt Guild, of Floyd VA, created I had to know more. The VA tourism board has used ‘Love’ many ways over the years from VA is for lovers to the new “LOVE’ with a heart logo. Many of the rest stops have giant letters in front. Being that I live in VA this makes it even more special to see this amazing quilt and hear it's story. Sallie McCauley and Gwen Goepel were the organizers of having the quilt made, I love hearing the story!\nfloydquiltguild.com\n---------------\nI’m a big fan of Kitty Wilkin’s work. She writes at Night Quilter about her own patterns, but also about quilt making she encounters along the way. She shares tutorials and this year is doing a ‘Year of Stitches’.. which is hand embroidery. I really love the idea of a ‘year of’ something and can’t wait to learn more!\nhttps://nightquilter.com/\n===============\nIt is always great to have Kimberly Einmo on my show! She is such a talented designer and is full of great ways to do thing. We are going to talk about her latest book and how to achieve spectacular quilts without a lot of work!  Then I asked Kimberly is she would talk about having quilts judged in a show. She is a quilt show judge and I'm personally fascinated by the judging process.. I have entered quilts years ago, and I’m thinking of doing that again. Because people don’t see my work in person if I don’t take the time to enter them.
