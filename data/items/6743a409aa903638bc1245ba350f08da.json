  "description": "<p>Music is one of the Gardner's intelligences in his theory of multiple\nintelligences. How humans perceive and understand music is still being studied\nand is crucial to develop artificial intelligence models that imitate such\nprocesses. Music generation with Artificial Intelligence is an emerging field\nthat is gaining much attention in the recent years. In this paper, we describe\nhow humans compose music and how new AI systems could imitate such process by\ncomparing past and recent advances in the field with music composition\ntechniques. To understand how AI models and algorithms generate music and the\npotential applications that might appear in the future, we explore, analyze and\ndescribe the agents that take part of the music generation process: the\ndatasets, models, interfaces, the users and the generated music. We mention\npossible applications that might benefit from this field and we also propose\nnew trends and future research directions that could be explored in the future.\n</p>",
