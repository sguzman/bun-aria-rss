  "description": "<p>In what may our final interview before the start of the Tokyo games, we thought it was fitting to bring you an interview with an athlete who's about to head there himself. We chat with Abdi Abdirahman about his history as a distance runner in the Olympics going back over 20 years to Sydney, his preparations for Tokyo, and why he has no plans to retire yet. He also tells us all about his new book titled Abdi's World which will be coming out very soon.</p>",
