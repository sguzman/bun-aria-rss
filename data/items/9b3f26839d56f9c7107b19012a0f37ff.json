An entitled brat walks into her room, so of course she kicks him out -- she's sick, after all! A furious entitled mom bursts into OP's room and then actually tries to spank OP. This wasn't OP's mom who spanked her -- the entitled mom was a guest in their house, and she thought it was a good idea to spank the homeowner's kid!</p>\n<p>Download the GetUpside app and use Code \"Slash\" to get up to 50¢ off per gallon on your next tank of gas.</p>\n",
