  "description": "<p>Chef Elizabeth Falkner was once described as a “high-wire artist,” and it’s no surprise. Throughout her career—and her life—she’s never been afraid of taking risks and trying new things. But she’s also been wise enough to know when she needs a break. Chef Falkner stopped by the studio to talk to us about her career, her early restaurant days, grilled cheese (hey, it was National Grilled Cheese Day), and more. Allison Lacey, the Marketing Brand Manager of Emmi cheeses from Switzerland, also came by to talk cheese and brought a beautiful selection of Emmi’s best. (Thanks, Allison!) Things got cheesy in a good way.  We also talked to Allison about her career, and how she followed her dream of securing a job in the food world. Thank you to Emmi Cheese and Le Cordon Bleu for supporting our show!</p>\n<p><em>Radio Cherry Bombe</em> is powered by <a href=\"http://simplecast.com\">Simplecast</a></p>\n",
