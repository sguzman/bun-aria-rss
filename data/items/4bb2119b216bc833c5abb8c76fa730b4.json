  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, a year ago, a gallon of gas on average was $3.04, today a gallon of gas on average in California is $6.21 and this program predicts that the national average will surpass $5.00 for a gallon for regular gasoline by next week. The government's boot is still on the throat of America's energy producers. OPEC has agreed to ramp up production, but this does nothing to accelerate U.S energy production. Then, the Biden Administration is holding back federal funds for the free school lunch program unless the school adopts the Biden Administration's definition of Title IX regarding sexual identity. Biden is holding back food from kids from low-income families if they don't bow to Biden's woke agenda. Several governors are filing lawsuits to protect school lunch participants in their states. Later, President Biden and the Democrats always sarcastically ask if citizens should own nukes when making their case for gun control, but why won't Biden stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? Biden is paving the way for Iran to have nuclear warheads that can reach the U.S via intercontinental ballistic missiles. Afterward, Biden gives a speech at the White House calling for stronger gun control laws and he wants his trial lawyers lobby to be able to sue the 2nd amendment out of existence. Biden knows all it takes is one state or federal jury to issue a billion-dollar settlement to bankrupt gun manufacturers. This would insanely disarm law-abiding American citizens. If that happens then Americans should be able to sue do-nothing pro-criminal prosecutors, mayors, judges, and government officials that have qualified immunity. Finally, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins the show to challenge Biden's remarks on gun control calling them disingenuous and adding that Biden should start with his son Hunter if he wants to be tough on gun crimes.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
