  "description": "Opportunity Zones sounded like a great idea, provide tax benefits for wealthy Americans to invest in 8,000 areas in the United States that don't receive enough investment and development and everyone wins. Unfortunately, as David Wessel describes in his new book \"Only the Rich Can Play: How Washington Works in the New Gilded Age\", the vast majority of the benefits of these zones went to the wealthy instead of the communities they were meant to help. This far ranging conversation hits on the roots of this policy failure as well as the latest plans from Democrats to tax billionaires and the global minimum tax on corporations championed by Janet Yellen.
