  "description": "A survey from a mental health charity suggested that more than a third of British teenagers had been prescribed antidepressants. We debunk the figure. Also we investigate a tweet from the UK Treasury about how much homebuyers will save in stamp duty. Plus how Mexico has been hit by earthquakes three times on the same day of the year - what are the chances? And how incorrect figures from the government have given a false picture of the number of cars on Britain’s minor roads. \n\nPresenter: Tim Harford\nSeries producer: Jon Bithrey\nReporters: Nathan Gower, Charlotte McDonald\nProduction Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson\nSound Engineer: James Beard",
