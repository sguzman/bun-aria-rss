And on the mic they never disappoint.</p><p>As you might suspect, the Cro-Mags' frontman aka Bloodclot returns to do what he does best — incite, provoke, educate and entertain. Straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose: getting people to “wake the f&*k up”, expand consciousness and take control of our lives.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Mishka fills the co-host role today and holds his own with JJ (not easy), rounding out the conversation with his always humorous, astute observations on the creative, athletic, sober life.</p><p>But the predominant subject of today's show revolves around the release of John's new book —&nbsp;a completely updated and rewritten version of his previously self-published cult hit: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062320327/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062320327&linkCode=as2&tag=ricroloffweb-20&linkId=X3JIRCXGBYERDD7D\" target=\"_blank\">Meat Is For Pussies: A How To Guide For Dudes Who Want to Get Fit, Kick Ass and Take Names*</a></p><p>If you're a long-time listener to the show, my boys need no introduction. If you're new and unfamiliar with these phenomenons, I urge you to check out my earlier introductory posts and tune into their multiple previous appearances (hyperlinks to previous shows in the below Notes).</p><p>As for JJ, suffice it to say the guy is a true American original.&nbsp;Lower East Side thief, abuse survivor, drug dealer & brawling gutter rat reborn as spiritual warrior. CBGB Street Poet. Punk-ass Robin Hood. Plantpowered Ironman. Spiritual evangelist.</p><p>A life story so astounding, I can only describe it like this:</p><p>“Take a little Charles Bukowski, add some Hugh Selby, Jr., throw in a little Jerry Stahl and finish it off with a light dusting of Paramahansa Yogananda. Then toss them all in a Martin Scorcese movie, douse the whole thing in kerosene and light it on fire. That is John Joseph.”</p><p>But John is also one of the most spiritual, giving cats I have ever met. The guy who will always engage a stranger on the street; and literally move mountains to help a less fortunate soul in need — and never ask for anything in return.</p><p>A the end of the day, all you really need to know about John is condensed into this little gem that recently appeared on <a href=\"http://munchies.vice.com/videos/how-to-juice/\" target=\"_blank\">Vice.com</a>– the most entertaining “how to make a green smoothie” video of all time:</p><br><p>Meditation; service; sobriety; GMO's; the “V” word; the nutritional plight of the everyman; balancing life as both an athlete and creative person; and what it means to truly be a man — these are the topics of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, we address head-on the heated controversy swirling around the title of John's new book.
