  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is feeling a little under the weather, so AJ Hawk steps in to steer the ship, but Pat does make an appearance during the Aaron Rodgers interview, where Pat, AJ, and Aaron chat about season 2 of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday's, how his offseason was, how his arm/body is feeling going into the season, if he put a lot of pressure on Randall Cobb with requesting to get him back, what he thought of The Match, and if he sandbagged people during the offseason after showing up at The Match with massive calves after people said he was slimming down and leaning towards retirement (25:54-44:23). Next, 22nd pick of the 2007 NFL Draft, 7 year NFL veteran, Notre Dame legend, and AJ Hawk's brother-in-law, Brady Quinn, joins the show to chat about his broadcasting career, his time at Notre Dame, what it's like being AJ's brother-in-law, how Charlie Weis was as a Head Coach, and more (44:25-1:08:03). Later, 18th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft, AJ's college teammate, and the savior of Big Ten Football, General Bob Carpenter joins the show to chat about the Mac Jones/Cam Newton QB competition and what he thinks is going through Bill Belichick's head, what Jerry Jones was like while he was a member of the Cowboys, his thoughts on the Bears QB situation, and the news that Teddy Bridgewater has been named the starting QB in Denver (1:09:35-1:26:35).
