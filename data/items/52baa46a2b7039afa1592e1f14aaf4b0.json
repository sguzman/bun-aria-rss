  "description": "I'll be honest. I was intimidated by the prospect of this interview. Plus, I never believed it would *actually* happen. I was going to get to speak to arguably the most famous activist on the planet? Yeah, right. As if.<br /><br />But then - it happened! And Greta Thunberg - the founder of the School Strike for Climate movement who has been nominated three times for a Nobel Prize - was an absolute revelation. She is a deeply intelligent and thoughtful 19-year-old: someone who takes issues seriously but never herself. I laughed SO MUCH more than I thought I would during this conversation. And I learned a lot too - about the climate crisis, yes, but also about what drives this extraordinary young woman and what she thinks of 'failure' on a personal and a global level. We talk about her failure to be a 'normal' teenager, her failure to get politicians to act and how she copes with being trolled by Presidents. Plus what she *really* thinks of everyone from King Charles to Emmanuel Macron. And: her love of carrots.<br /><br />Whatever your preconceptions might be, leave them at the door. This episode will blow your mind.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The Climate Book, created by Greta Thunberg, is out tomorrow and available to order here: <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/446610/the-climate-book-by-thunberg-greta/9780241547472\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/446610/the-climate-book-by-thunberg-greta/9780241547472</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.
