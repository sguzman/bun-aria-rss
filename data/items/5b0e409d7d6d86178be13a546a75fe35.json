  "description": "<p>Dr. Sayantani Dasgupta has a foot in three worlds: medicine, teaching and writing. Growing up the daughter of Indian immigrants, she fell in love with writing at an early age.

She started with a memoir, then collaborated with her mother on a collection of Bengali folk tales, before creating her own fantasy series designed to not only capture the imagination of young adults but also feature a heroin with brown skin that her kids could relate to. Now with 3 books out, including The Serpent’s Secret, Game of Start and the Chaos Curse, and a NYT bestseller in the mix, she splits her time between the world of medicine, teaching and writing, all the time focused on reconnecting people with stories that allow them to see themselves as they are in the world.</p><p>You can find Sayantani DasGupta at: <a href=\"http://www.sayantanidasgupta.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> http://www.sayantanidasgupta.com/| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@sayantani16\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> https://twitter.com/@sayantani16</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
