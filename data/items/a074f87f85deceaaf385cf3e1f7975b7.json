  "description": "<p>Originals are the non-conformists who drive creativity and change forward—the ones who help us progress as both independent cultures and a unified species. They're Steve Jobs' \"crazy ones.\"</p><p>Yet in spite of this, humanity has always had a fascinatingly dysfunctional relationship with originality—we simultaneously venerate and scorn it, particularly in the workplace. Originals may eventually come to be loved, but they’re almost always met with cynicism and resistance first. Because they don't fit in.</p><p>It’s a <em>fascinating </em>duality, and it’s one of the many things we discuss with today’s guest, <a href=\"http://www.adamgrant.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Grant</a>—author of two New York Times bestselling books (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Originals-Nonconformists-Move-World-Forward/dp/0525429565\" target=\"_blank\">Originals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Helping-Others-Success/dp/0143124986/\" target=\"_blank\">Give and Take</a>), and—at 34—the youngest tenured professor in the history of the <a href=\"https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wharton School</a>.</p><p>As Grant shares, thanks to shifts in social and cultural norms, it’s never been easier to be an original, but so many of us still resist the call.
