  "description": "Mike O’Connor is the author of A Commercial Republic: America’s Enduring Debate over Democratic Capitalism (University Press of Kansas 2014). He has also published articles in Contemporary Pragmatism and The Sixties. O’Connor teaches at Georgia State University in Atlanta, and holds a Ph.D. in American studies from the University of Texas at Austin. He was one of the original bloggers at the U.S. Intellectual History website, and served as a founding officer of the Society for U.S. Intellectual History.\n\nO’Connor offers an intellectual history of the relationship between government and business in the US. Starting at the very earliest days of the republic and travelling up to the contemporary time period, the book offers rich details and interesting findings about the nature of government. I was most interested in the exploration of the opposition to taxes. The book is a nice complement to previous podcasts from Daniel Stedman-Jones in May 2013.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
