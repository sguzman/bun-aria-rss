  "description": "<p>The propagation of a quasi-harmonic electromagnetic wave in a bulk hyperbolic\ndielectric metamaterial is considered. If the group velocities dispersion is\nnot taken into account, then wave propagation can be described either by the\nhyperbolic nonlinear Schrodinger equation or by the hyperbolic Manakov\nequations. It is shown that the region in the space of wave vectors in which\nthe modulation instability of a spatially homogeneous wave is possible is not\nlimited, in contrast to the case of ordinary media.\n</p>",
