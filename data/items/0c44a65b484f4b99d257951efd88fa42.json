In this conversation, the two open up about having public platforms and the pressures that come along with this. There is no blueprint for following your passion and throughout the discussion, Sharon and Glo discuss their personal experience with being in the public eye and how they got to where they are today.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= \"https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast\">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
