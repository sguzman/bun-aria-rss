  "description": "Today's show is absolutely packed. The guys cover just about everything going on in the world including everything from a wild NFL weekend, to the aftermath of the College Football Playoff selections, to an in depth discussion about Bob Knight after his recent 30 for 30 film was released. The guys also save the holiday season as the war on Christmas starts to heat up, and dive into the weight loss challenge as Block Dad himself, Tim McAfee, joins the competition. Also joining the show is ESPN College Basketball Analyst, Dan Dakich, to help break down the whole Bob Knight situation as he was intimately connected to everything, why he chose not to be in the 30 for 30, and discusses which college fan bases hate him the most (54:22-1:09:45). Later, former Colts linebacker, friend of the show, and now Tag Team Champion of the World, Pat Angerer, joins the show to discuss his new title belt, and when he plans on getting in the ring again (1:14:07-1:24:20). Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
