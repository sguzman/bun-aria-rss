  "description": "<p>Ani Sanyal is known for being a marketing genius but at his core he is the definition of a serial entrepreneur. After watching his Indian immigrant parents struggle as workers, he was determined to be on the other side of the table to provide financial freedom for himself and his family. He founded his own independent record label in high school and toured the world, he also provided Wiz Khalifa with his first opportunity to perform in NYC. In his mid-twenties, he pivoted from music to marketing when he created Green Room Creative (GRC), which is a Digital Marketing Agency that helps brands build stories online. His company has worked with HBO, Juice Press, The Daily Beast, Patch and Hilary Clinton. In addition to being a superstar in the marketing world, Ani is also the founder of Kolkata Chai Co. which is one of the hottest tea shop/eateries in New York City. It’s named after the city his family grew up in in India. Ani is also a real estate investor with developments in New Jersey and Philadelphia. He focuses on acquiring distressed, underperforming and non-performing residential and mixed-used assets. In episode 69, we covered all of the above for one of our most broad ranging conversations to date. We discussed the new age of marketing and what entrepreneurs should be doing to grow their brands organically. We also discussed India’s massive economy, hip-hops reach and effect there and where outside investors can find opportunities to profit on the subcontinent which is home to 1.3 billion people. #Realestate #investing Guest IG: @anihustles EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ Brand Resumes: https://brandresumes.com/eyl/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
