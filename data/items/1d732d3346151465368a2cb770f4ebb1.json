  "title": "Ep 558 | Jase's Zoning Out Explained & What Do We Do When God Doesn't Give Us What We Want?",
  "description": "Jase says he's built for the outdoors, so being in a windowless room is really tough for him. And he explains why, yes, he sometimes DOES zone out during the podcast recording and why retreating to the outdoors is even biblical, following the example of Jesus. Zach says we've separated the secular from the sacred, so why is anyone wondering why the secular hasn't been transformed by the sacred? Jase points out that every human is possessed by something — whether it be sin or the Holy Spirit. Al shares about an event he attended where 46 Louisiana legislators were given awards based on the bills they brought forward that rely on biblical values. Jase explores what we do when God doesn't give us what we want. \n\nVisit https://www.TommyJohn.com/PHIL and save 25% on your first order! \n\nGo to http://preparewithphil.com & you'll save 20% on a 3-month emergency food kit from My Patriot Supply! \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
