  "description": "<p><p>The Kirk Minihane Show travelled to Centerville, Mass., to record a podcast in the home of a complete stranger who was the highest bidder in last year's charity auction. Apart from Minihane's obvious revulsion at having to sit on a couch next to Steve Robinson, it was business as usual. Several whistleblowers at Winchester High School have stepped forward to share alarming details of Boston Globe columnist Shirley Leung's assembly (00:05:35). If Shirley's blathering speech to these high school kids is a sign of what's going on in the public school system, then Harry Minihane may end up in private school after all. Minihane realizes he's burned just about every professional bridge he's ever crossed (00:16:30). Barstool Breakfast talked about the kerfuffle between fitness instructor Jillian Michaels and singer Lizzo, but Willie Colon wanted to take the most sensitive parts of that debate off-air (00:31:30). Minihane erupts over Blind Mike's plans to bring his own personal assistant down to Miami on the Minifans' dime (00:39:20). The King of KMS Parody Songs returns with two hits for the special living room show (00:59:00). The Madawaska area is on edge after discovering an alleged cult leader is recruiting followers to the region (01:09:45). Our generous host takes over the show (01:49:00). </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
