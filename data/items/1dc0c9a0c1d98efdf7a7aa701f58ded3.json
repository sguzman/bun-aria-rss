    "media:description": "How do Stanford researchers collaborate with partners to solve some of our most pressing sustainability problems? This program highlights the high-impact work of Stanford faculty who are working with partners locally and globally to tackle urgent planetary challenges.\n\nThis September, the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability launched as the universityâ€™s first new school in 75 years. A key feature of the new school is its sustainability accelerator, which seeks to develop near-term policy and technology solutions to global needs in sustainability. Learn how Stanford faculty from across the university are working alongside practitioners to co-create and scale solutions for climate and sustainability challenges that threaten people globally. This virtual event was co-sponsored by Stanford Continuing Studies and Stanford Office of External Relations.",
