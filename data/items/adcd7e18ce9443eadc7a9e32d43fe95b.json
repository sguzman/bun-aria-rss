  "title": "PMS 2.0 322 - Happy New Years Eve Eve With Cameron Heyward & Santonio Holmes",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about a variety of different subjects including whether or not guys like Urban Meyer and PJ Fleck would potentially be good NFL coaches as their names are now being mentioned for a few of the openings, and look ahead at a few of the NFC and AFC playoff implications as we reach week 17. Joining the program is 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle, Cam Heyward joins the show to chat about the noise outside the locker room and whether or not they hear it at all, what happened during the 3 game skid, how much playing time he thinks he's going to get on Sunday, and what they need to do to be successful in the postseason (19:11-39:15). Next, Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 9 Year NFL veteran at WR, Tone Time, Santonio Holmes joins the program to chat about his incredible catch in the Super Bowl, his relationship with Big Ben, which WR from today's game he would like to line up with, the work his foundation is doing to combat Sickle Cell Disease, and he tells some crazy stories about rabbit hunting from his childhood (40:41-1:04:04).
