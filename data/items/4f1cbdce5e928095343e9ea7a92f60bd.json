  "title": "Steve Lacy brings bedroom pop to the Billboard top",
  "description": "It’s the song that launched a thousand TikTok videos – or over 500,000 to be exact: Steve Lacy’s “Bad Habit.” \n\nThe track is a smooth, psychedelia tinged ode to yearning, currently spending its third week on the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Lacy is an artist dedicated to shifting form and convention, from his records with alternative R&B band The Internet to his productions for artists like Mac Miller and Vampire Weekend. Even in his solo work, his songs are unpredictable, deftly moving through genre in the vein of artists like Prince and Stevie Wonder. \n\n“Bad Habit” specifically, though, is rooted in the genre of bedroom pop, a scene slowly gaining mainstream traction. With this track, Lacy is taking the sound that’s seeped through TikTok and Spotify to the top of the charts. On this episode of Switched On Pop, we dig deep into Lacy's career and his ability to craft immaculate melodies.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\n\nSteve Lacy, “Bad Habit”\n\nSam Smith, Kim Petras, “Unholy”\n\nThe Internet, “Dontcha”\n\nThe Internet, “Special Affair”\n\nThe Internet, “Palace/Curse (feat. Tyler, The Creator & Steve Lacy)\n\nSteve Lacy, “C U Girl”\n\nSteve Lacy, “Dark Red”\n\nSteve Lacy, “Only If”\n\nSteve Lacy, “Like Me”\n\nSteve Lacy, “Playground”\n\nSteve Lacy, “Static”\n\nStevie Wonder, “Signed, Sealed, Delivered”\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
