  "description": "Charli XCX and Troye Sivan conjure late 90s nostalgia in their latest banger. \"1999\" drips with lyrical nostalgia for the last decade of the millennium — but does the music follow suit? We think the pair are missing prime opportunities to bring back some neglected musical tricks from the early oeuvre of Britney Spears.\nThe 90s bug goes beyond Charli and Troye. Anne-Marie and Lauren Alaina also pine for the Clinton era in their millennial bops. Which makes one ask: is the present so bad that we miss the paranoia of Y2K? As usual, Prince has the answer.\nFeaturing:\nCharli XCX ft Troye Sivan - 1999\nDJ Bobo - Somebody Dance with Me\nReal McCoy - Another Night\nParadisio - Bailando\nBritney Spears - ...Baby One More Time\nBritney Spears - Oops! I Did it Again\nAnne-Marie - 2002\nLauren Alaina - Ladies in the 90s\nPrince - 1999\nCheck out Megan Lavengood's examples of the complementary chorus.\nMarshall Jefferson's \"Move Your Body\" from 1986 might be the ur-source of the ubiquitous 90s house piano. Jefferson recorded the original in his Chicago prophet on a Prophet 2000, but never got the rights to the song and saw little proceeds from its success. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
