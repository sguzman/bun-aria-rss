    "media:description": "I illustrate the graphical language of wiring diagrams by using it to describe how to make apple crumble. I go over definitions and intuition for monoids, monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal categories. I also describe how the graphical language of wiring diagrams can be related to symmetric monoidal categories in a formal way. I also illustrate how to use wiring diagrams and recursion to do programming, and illustrate this practically using the LabVIEW programming language. This video was heavily inspired by \n\nSeven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory By Fong and Spivak\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316\n\nSymmetric Monoidal Categories: a Rosetta Stone\nhttps://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/05/28/symmetric-monoidal-categories-a-rosetta-stone/\n\nMy friend Jos Hoebe has many interesting works. For example see\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jos-Hoebe\n\nThe LabVIEW software can be downloaded from\nhttps://www.ni.com/en-gb/shop/labview.html",
