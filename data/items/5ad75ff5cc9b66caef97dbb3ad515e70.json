  "description": "Here, Jacky Lee and Luca Capriotti present an arbitrage-free valuation framework for the counterparty exposure of credit derivatives portfolios. The method is able to consistently capture the effects of credit spread volatility and credit correlations. By introducing fast semi-analytical approximations, they demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to handle large portfolios of credit default swaps under financially realistic models of default intensities",
