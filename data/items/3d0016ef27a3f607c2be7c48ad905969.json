  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys remember Veterans Day, and dive into everything going on in the sports world. Also joining the show is the 22nd pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, former LSU standout, and current WR for the Minnesota Vikings, Justin Jefferson. Pat and Justin chat about what this season has been like so far, how he's needed to adjust, his relationship with Adam Thielen, when he started doing the Griddy, his relationship with Mike Zimmer, and much more (33:06-47:52). Also joining the program is co-host and analyst on NFL Live on ESPN, host of the Mina Kimes Show featuring Lenny, former summa cum laude at Yale, Mina Kimes. Pat and Mina chat about her path to being one of the hosts on NFL Live, her thoughts on the use of analytics in the NFL, why she doesn't mind dunking on people on the internet, some of Dan Orlovsky's bad takes, if she always aspired to do what she's doing right now, and what she got on her SATs (57:20-1:18:04). Later, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ get to the bottom of whether or not Ryan Phillippe actually big timed Aaron Rodgers like AJ insisted yesterday, plus they chat about the news that Ohio State and Maryland's game this weekend is being canceled due to a covid outbreak on Maryland's team, and what that could potentially mean for the Big Ten moving forward, plus much more (1:18:06-1:39:10).
