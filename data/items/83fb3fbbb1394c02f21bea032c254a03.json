For the first five months, this policy even targeted <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/10/12/covid-19-border-policies-strengthen-japans-insular-mindset/#more-1258847\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term foreign residents</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a few exceptions, such as the <a href=\"https://www.2020games.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/special/docs/211004_Results_of_COVID-19_Countermeasures_at_Tokyo_2020_Games.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Olympic/Paralympic travel bubble</a> in 2021 and the so-called <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/cp/page22e_000925.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business and residence track</a>. This avenue opened in August 2020 and was <a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14106101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">terminated in January 2021</a> by then prime minister Yoshihide Suga as the Delta variant spread.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s border policy also vacillated between tightening and relaxing. In December 2021, new entries of foreign nationals <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/12/a83e5677ed5e-kishida-vows-to-prepare-for-worst-amid-omicron-variant-fears.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">were banned</a> as the Omicron variant emerged. By 7 September 2022, the pre-departure PCR-test mandate for vaccinated travellers <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/24/national/pre-departure-test-kishida/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">had been omitted</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three administrations in office since the start of the pandemic have been hovering between two competing policy interests: public health and economic strength. On the one hand, former finance minister Taro Aso spoke of a <a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13432875\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">higher <em>mindo</em></a> (cultural level) of Japanese people. He deemed this to be a crucial factor in ensuring compliance with COVID-19 countermeasures.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Aso and other conservative politicians, keeping <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01171968221125482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">potentially deviant foreign influences</a> out is a pre-condition for managing the pandemic through soft measures at home. On the other hand, Japanese and foreign <a href=\"https://japan.ahk.de/en/infothek/newsroom/news-details/corona-flashsurvey-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business representatives</a> have long pointed out the need to globalise Japan’s workforce. It is no surprise that the bulk of people who entered Japan in 2020 on the business and residence track were <a href=\"https://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/87739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical trainees</a>. Trainees continue to play an important role in Japan’s low-skilled labour sector, despite scandals revealing <a href=\"https://apjjf.org/2020/18/Tran.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">workers’ maltreatment</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amid the back and forth, three developments can explain Kishida’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/10/04/kishida-reopens-the-door-to-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">re-open Japan</a> on such short notice.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, international border measures have largely converged on relaxation. Other G7 nations have re-established international travel for non-nationals and adopted a ‘new normal’ lifestyle. Several Asian nations are <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-entry-requirements-tourists-travellers-asia-south-korea-japan-taiwan-malaysia-2922606\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">easing their border controls</a>, including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/asia-save-china-is-finally-lifting-its-last-pandemic-rules#xj4y7vzkg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hong Kong</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Japan opted to join this trend. Kishida’s New York speech pointed to his role <a href=\"https://japan.kantei.go.jp/101_kishida/statement/202209/_00009.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as the incoming G7 president</a> and his responsibility to ‘build a nation that grows together with the rest of the world’ — something unimaginable without international mobility. There are also concerns that Japan is <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Japan-is-only-harming-itself-by-keeping-its-borders-shut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">losing out</a> to its regional neighbours.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, Japan’s opposition parties have long been critical of its closed border policy. In October 2021, Shu Sakurai of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan pointed out the inconsistent regulation for international students, which allowed only those on Japanese government scholarships to enter the country.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this had not posed a risk for Kishida previously, the situation has changed in the light of plummeting public support for the administration. The Prime Minister is becoming <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/10/11/abes-death-leaves-a-leadership-vacuum/#more-1255690\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a potential liability</a> to his party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early October, support for the Kishida administration stood at just <a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/articles/DA3S15433892.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 per cent</a>. His insistence on holding an unpopular state funeral for Abe and the lacklustre effort to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Unification-Church-and-politics/Half-of-Japan-s-LDP-lawmakers-had-ties-with-Unification-Church\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disclose LDP members’ ties</a> to the Unification Church explain much of the drop.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also turmoil within the LDP. <a href=\"http://www.seiwaken.jp/district/district.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abe’s former faction</a> is leaderless and rumours of its disbandment continue to spread. This might benefit Suga, Kishida’s rival, as his support is likely to grow.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last development is the rising cost-of-living due to the <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/10/07/japans-currency-bursts-its-post-bubble-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation of the Japanese yen</a> and the overall dire economic outlook. The tourism industry in particular has suffered from the border closure. Overseas travellers spent <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/10/f6b650f0e3dc-breaking-news-japan-pm-kishida-vows-to-revive-pandemic-hit-inbound-tourism-sector.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4.8 trillion yen</a> (US$32 billion) in 2019, making international tourism a major boost to the Japanese economy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In March 2022, a group of parliamentarians led by LDP heavyweight Taro Kono started promoting <a href=\"https://www.sankei.com/article/20220323-KKKWTNSDDBMKRL667IU7ET7NYQ/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">luxury tourism</a>. The idea is that a <a href=\"https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA06AKS0W2A700C2000000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">few affluent travellers</a> on private jets and superyachts spend substantial amounts of money in Japan and tourist destinations would be spared a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-05/once-overcrowded-kyoto-now-longs-for-foreign-tourists-in-japan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overtourism problem</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a problem in pre-pandemic Japan and nowadays would provoke <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-social-sciences/social-policy/iris/2021/iris-node-wp-7-2021-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concerns about virus containment</a>. One such luxury traveller entering Japan was the well-known YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PewDiePie</a>. His more than 100 million followers virtually experienced a private jet arrival to Japan and can <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2022/06/11/digital/pewdiepie-j-vlogging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watch his vlogs</a> on daily life.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his parliamentary speech on 3 October 2022, Kishida presented his plan to revive the Japanese economy. This includes a pledge to increase international tourist spending <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/10/f6b650f0e3dc-breaking-news-japan-pm-kishida-vows-to-revive-pandemic-hit-inbound-tourism-sector.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beyond the pre-pandemic high</a> in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.mlit.go.jp/kankocho/news06_000570.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">domestic travel</a> discounts and new regulations that will allow shop owners to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-weighs-plan-ban-hotel-guests-without-masks-media-2022-09-21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turn away customers</a> who refuse to wear face masks.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <a href=\"https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA273MQ0X20C22A5000000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a consensus</a> has emerged that open borders and international mobility are necessary for Japan’s economic revival and international standing, the Kishida administration <a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/10/01c20286e049-focus-japans-lifting-of-covid-19-entry-cap-may-keep-citizens-wearing-masks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remains apprehensive</a> that this might lead to rising infections and social friction. The opposing poles of Japan’s pandemic management that have characterised its border control measures since 2020 are still there. It is just that the pendulum has swung toward open borders — for now.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Gabriele Vogt is the Chair in Japanese Studies at the Ludwig Maximillian University Munich.</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Sian Qin is a PhD Candidate in Japanese Studies at the Ludwig Maximillian University Munich.</em></p>The post <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/11/02/japan-warily-welcomes-back-international-travellers/\">Japan warily welcomes back international travellers</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org\">East Asia Forum</a>.",
