  "description": "On the 35th anniversary of Janet Jackson's first No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit, we look back at <em>Control</em>, her career-defining album that changed the trajectory of pop music in the late '80s and '90s. In the second episode of a three-part series exploring crossover in pop music, we look at Jackson's musical and cultural legacy over the years. We also reconsider how Jackson was vilified after her Super Bowl XXXVIII appearance, and why. <em>You can follow us on Twitter at @NPRItsBeenAMin and email us at samsanders@npr.org.</em>",
