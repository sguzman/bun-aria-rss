Starting your business can be done in just five minutes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Let us then talk about the Sellfy platform and all the benefits it can bring to your business.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Sellfy?</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sellfy </a>is an eCommerce solution that allows digital content creators, including writers, illustrators, designers, musicians, and filmmakers, to sell their products online. Sellfy provides a customizable storefront where users can display their digital products and embed \"Buy Now\" buttons on their website or blog. Sellfy product pages enable users to showcase their products from different angles with multiple images and previews from Soundcloud, Vimeo, and YouTube. Files of up to 2GB can be uploaded to Sellfy, and the company offers unlimited bandwidth and secure file storage. Users can also embed their entire store or individual project widgets in their site, with the ability to preview how widgets will appear before they are displayed.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Features</span></h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa; font-weight: normal;\">Sellfy includes:</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Online Store</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sellfy </a>is a powerful e-commerce platform that helps you personalize your online storefront. You can add your logo, change colors, revise navigation, and edit the layout of your store. Sellfy also allows you to create a full shopping cart so customers can purchase multiple items. And Sellfy gives you the ability to set your language or let customers see a translated version of your store based on their location.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sellfy </a>gives you the option to host your store directly on its platform, add a custom domain to your store, and use it as an embedded storefront on your website. Sellfy also optimizes its store offerings for mobile devices, allowing for a seamless checkout experience.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Product hosting</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sellfy </a>allows creators to host all their products and sell all of their digital products on one platform. Sellfy also does not place storage limits on your store but recommends that files be no larger than 5GB. Creators can sell both standard and subscription-based products in any file format that is supported by the online marketplace. Customers can purchase products instantly after making a purchase – there is no waiting period.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can organize your store by creating your product categories, sorting by any characteristic you choose. Your title, description, and the image will be included on each product page. In this way, customers can immediately evaluate all of your products. You can offer different pricing options for all of your products, including \"pay what you want,\" in which the price is entirely up to the customer. This option allows you to give customers control over the cost of individual items (without a minimum price) or to set pricing minimums—a good option if you're in a competitive market or when you have higher-end products. You can also offer set prices per product as well as free products to help build your store's popularity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy is ideal for selling digital content, such as ebooks. But it does not allow you to copyrighted material (that you don't have rights to distribute).</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Embed options</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy offers several ways to share your store, enabling you to promote your business on different platforms. Sellfy lets you integrate it with your existing website using \"buy now\" buttons, embed your entire storefront, or embed certain products so you can reach more people. Sellfy also enables you to connect with your Facebook page and YouTube channel, maximizing your visibility.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Payments and security</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy is a simple online platform that allows customers to buy your products directly through your store. Sellfy has two payment processing options: PayPal and Stripe. You will receive instant payments with both of these processors, and your customer data is protected by Sellfy's secure (PCI-compliant) payment security measures. In addition to payment security, Sellfy provides anti-fraud tools to help protect your products including PDF stamping, unique download links, and limited download attempts.</span></p><br /><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Marketing and analytics tools</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The Sellfy platform includes marketing and analytics tools to help you manage your online store. You can send email product updates and collect newsletter subscribers through the platform. With Sellfy, you can also offer discount codes and product upsells, as well as create and track Facebook and Twitter ads for your store. The software's analytics dashboard will help you track your best-performing products, generated revenue, traffic channels, top locations, and overall store performance.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Integrations</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To expand functionality and make your e-commerce store run more efficiently, Sellfy offers several integrations. Google Analytics and Webhooks, as well as integrations with Patreon and Facebook Live Chat, are just a few of the options available. Sellfy allows you to connect to Zapier, which gives you access to hundreds of third-party apps, including tools like Mailchimp, Trello, Salesforce, and more.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pricing and Premium Plan Features</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Get <a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sellfy </a>14 day free trail from <a href=\"https://get.sellfy.com/crunchhype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Free Plan</span></h3><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Price: $0</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>The free plan comes with:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Up to 10 products</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Print-on-demand products</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Physical products</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Starter Plan</span></h3><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Price: $19/month</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Starter plan comes with:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Everything is Free, plus:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Unlimited products</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Digital products</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Subscription products</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Connect your domain</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2,000 email credits</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Business Plan</span></h3><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Price: $49/month</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>The business plan comes with:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Everything in Starter, plus:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Remove \"Sellfy\" branding</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Store design migration</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cart abandonment</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Product upselling</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10,000 email credits</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Premium Plan</span></h3><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Price: $99/month</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>The premium plan comes with:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Everything in Business, plus:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Product migration</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Priority support</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">50,000 email credits</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy Review: Pros and Cons</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy has its benefits and downsides, but fortunately, the pros outweigh the cons.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h3><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It takes only a few minutes to set up an online store and begin selling products.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your products on a single storefront, even if you are selling multiple product types.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy supports selling a variety of product types, including physical items, digital goods, subscriptions, and print-on-demand products.<br /><center><br /></center></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Sellfy offers a free plan for those who want to test out the features before committing to a paid plan.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You get paid the same day you make a sale.
