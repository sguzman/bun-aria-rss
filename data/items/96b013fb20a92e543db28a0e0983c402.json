  "description": "J Cole is one of the most successful rappers of his generation, someone who racks up hits while sustaining critical acclaim. But that isn’t necessarily a good thing. Cole’s sixth studio album “The Off Season” finds a musician struggling to stave off complacency and keep his skills sharp. In a short documentary about the album, Cole describes the album as an attempt to “push himself,” a sentiment reflected in a line from the Timbaland-produced track “Amari”: “If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling.” Cole is never satisfied on this album, pushing his technique to the breaking point through verbal dexterity and rhythmic complexity.\nOne way Cole stays on his toes is through the use of a trap beat melded with one of the oldest grooves in pop: the 12/8 shuffle. He’s far from the only artist to make use of an often overlooked, but iconic meter. Why does this pattern keep us moving? And where did its unique sound come from? We have a theory about that...\nSongs discussed:\n\nJ Cole - Amari, Punching the Clock, The Climb Back, Interlude\n\nBrief Encounter - I’m So in Love With You\n\nAdam Lambert - Another Lonely Night\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen - Run Away With Me\n\nDisclosure ft Sam Smith - Latch \n\nSteely Dan - Aja\n\nToto - Roseanna \n\nLed Zeppelin - Fool in the Rain\n\nKanye West - Black Skinhead\n\nBillie Eilish - Bury a Friend\n\nVulfpeck ft Bernard Purdie and Theo Katzman - Something\n\n\nWatch Bernard “Pretty” Purdie: The Legendary Purdie Shuffle\nRead more on The Off Season in Craig Jenkins in-depth review on Vulture.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
