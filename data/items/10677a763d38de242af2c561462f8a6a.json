    "media:description": "Explore a dreamlike realm where flora and fauna have evolved to use spells. A breakdown of Luca Vanzella’s surreal worldbuilding project ‘Codex Inversus.’\n---\nCodex Inversus Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/codex_inversus/\nCodex Inversus Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/codexinversus/\nCodex Inversus Stories: https://lucavanzella.medium.com/\n\nHave you ever heard of dragonflies that snipe their prey with bolts of energy? Or octopuses that serve as guard dogs? Or Necromancer Bees that live in reanimated carcass-hives? These are from the Codex Inversus — a modern worldbuilding project like Codex Serephinianus from the imagination of the brilliant artist and writer Luca Vanzella. \n\nBrought to life through collages of classical art, the world of Codex Inversus is full of flora and fauna that have evolved to use magical energy, visitors from parallel dimensions, and fractures in space and time. At a glance, the surreal, scrambled visuals are difficult to make sense of. Yet like a medieval bestiary, the project does follow a unique system of internal logic.\n\nSo, for this entry into the archive, I’ll investigate the creatures, people, and locations of this scrambled world — and reveal the hidden order to the chaos of Codex Inversus…\n\n0:00 Codex Inversus\n1:17 Strange Creatures \n3:46 A Shifting Realm\n7:07 Ethereal Ocean\n9:42 Nation of Beasts\n13:22 Tale of Two Moons\n15:06 Elsewhere Woods\n18:44 Edge of Reality\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
