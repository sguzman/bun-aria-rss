  "description": "<p>The full moon is bright, beautiful, and reappears in the sky like clockwork. Many cultures use the full moon to mark the passing of time and organize calendars around the moon’s cycle. So why does the full moon also have a reputation for causing mischief and mayhem? In this episode, we’ll learn where some of these beliefs come from and investigate whether the full moon actually does affect humans and our behavior. We’ll also hear about folklore tied to the full moon and examine how the moon’s phases work.
