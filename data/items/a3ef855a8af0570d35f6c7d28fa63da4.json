  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 10/1/22",
  "description": "This week on the Mark Levin Show, the U.S has some former Presidents who have done very nasty things and the Department of Justice did nothing at all. In fact, many Attorneys General and federal prosecutors routinely mishandle classified information as they travel in their vehicles, and no one prosecutes them. But Biden's Department of Justice decided to use a SWAT team to raid a pro-life Catholic activist. Also, the DOJ's FBI has become a Democrat Party Stasi. What they've done to Donald Trump, what they've done to citizens that peacefully attended January 6th demonstrations, and we've seen what they've done to cover up for Joe and Hunter Biden. MSNBC’s Joy Reid compares Floridians fleeing Hurricane Ian to asylum-seeking migrants. Then, Democrats are for climate change so the media is for climate change. This is how they push their economy-killing, degrowth agenda.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
