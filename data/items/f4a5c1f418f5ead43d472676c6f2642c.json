  "description": "Alexa, play “Yes Sir” by Chief Keef \nToday Sofia is joined by some ILLUSTRIOUS guests: Trevor Wallace and Michael Blaustein of the Stiff Socks podcast! Much like the raunchy title of their show, things are about to get REALLY dirty around here. Together, the three dive into the many different aspects of a relationship including (but not limited to): finishing inside a girl, dirty talk, and anal play. You know, the important stuff. We also discovered that the new go-to name in bed is “Sir”…Daddy is DEAD. The trio also unpacks the many financial dilemmas that arise within relationships such as splitting the dinner bill, rent, and when you should and shouldn’t Venmo your partner (spoiler alert ladies: NEVER). Aside from a spicy conversation with our incredible guests, Sofia also recaps her most recent trip to LA, teasing an unsuspecting collaboration in the works and her soon-to-be RHOSLC cameo…needless to say, stay tuned Sloots.  \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nOK Cupid: Download OK Cupid from the App Store or Google Play today!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
