Told live onstage at Bawdy’s 15 year Anniversary event, Educator, Artist and Rope Dojo founder Midori takes us on a bifurcated journey from flying warriors in a Shaolin Temple to an all-Male Shibari gathering in a Tokyo Swinger’s Club. Should you hide who you are so that male-dominated society isn’t threatened - or is it time to flip the script? #Rope #SoStrong #Dabbler #Feminist #Shibari #BeautifulLadyCompanion<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Take it like a Man’ (Dragonette)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Trailblazing educator, sexologist, artist, and irritant to banality, Midori founded Rope Dojo and ForteFemme: Women's Dominance Intensive.

Dan Savage calls her the \"Super Nova of Kink,\" while others affectionately call her Auntie Midori for her cool, tell-it-like-it-is, funny, reality-based teaching.
