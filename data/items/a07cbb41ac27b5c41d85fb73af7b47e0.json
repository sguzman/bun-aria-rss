  "description": "<p>“WE’RE APPLYING 20TH CENTURY THINKING TO 21ST CENTURY PROBLEMS.”<br />\nIf you wake up in the morning and find that your tire is low, what do you do? You go with the quick fix and fill it up with air.<br />\nWhat if you go to your car the next day and find it’s low. Do you fill it up again, and again, and again for days, weeks, months?<br />\nOf course not. You find the root of the problem.<br />\nYou find the nail, or whatever is causing the problem, to have it removed and have it fixed permanently.<br />\nSo why aren’t you doing it with your health?<br />\nMost of us go to the doctor and get a prescription for pills to fix our chronic problems. We just keep going for the quick fix instead of addressing the root of it.<br />\nI can’t say every medical condition is this way, but in many cases ongoing problems like depression and diabetes needs to have the root problem examined.<br />\nChances are you just need to shift your lifestyle. And that doesn’t mean a drastic change to your life. You can start small.<br />\nTo explain much more than I can, I sat down with the UK's leading doctor, Dr. Rangan Chatterjee.<br />\nDr. Chatterjee is a medical doctor who decided to rethink the way we do medicine. He’s decided that physicians need to be more holistic in their approach to treating patients and help their lifestyle as opposed to just giving them a quick fix.<br />\nHe has become the star of the hit BBC series Doctor in the House where he analyzes every aspect of people’s lives to help with their illness.<br />\nDr. Chatterjee has made it his goal to simplify the way the average person thinks about healthcare.<br />\nHe’s divided health into four easy pillars that allow anyone with a chronic disease to retake control of their lives.<br />\nLearn the root cause of most chronic diseases, how to let technology empower us, and the key indicator of how well you will age, on Episode 634.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy are people not the best they can be?
