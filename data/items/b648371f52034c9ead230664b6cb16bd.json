Whether it be through a focus on gratitude or expressive writing, journaling allows you to have an uninhibited discussion with yourself, oftentimes leading to an “aha” moment that was hiding under the surface all along. In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Leonard Calabrese, Dr. Andrea Pennington, Matthew McConaughey, and Dr. Rangan Chatterjee about the psychological and mental benefits that various types of journaling can have on our overall health and wellbeing.</p><br><p>Dr. Leonard Calabrese is a Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and Vice Chair of the Department of Rheumatic and Immunologic Diseases. Dr. Calabrese is also the director of the RJ Fasenmyer Center for Clinical Immunology at Cleveland Clinic and holds joint appointments in the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Wellness Institute. Dr. Calabrese has made significant contributions to science in the fields of chronic viral infections and autoimmunity and vascular inflammatory diseases of the brain.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Andrea Pennington is an integrative physician, acupuncturist, meditation teacher, and #1 international bestselling author. She received her Doctor of Medicine from Washington University School of Medicine, trained at Georgetown University Hospital, and received certification in Age Management Medicine with the Cenegenics Medical Institute. Her extensive study of medical nutrition, positive psychology, and neuroscience-inspired biohacking led her to create a holistic media platform, In8Vitality, to teach people how to blend ancient wisdom and modern science for enhanced vitality and life mastery. In Andrea’s latest book, <em>The Real Self Love Handbook</em>, she explores her personal journey from depression to real self-love and how The Cornerstone Process, a 5-step self-discovery framework, is setting people free from the drama of past trauma.</p><br><p>Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey is a husband, father of three children, and a loyal son and brother. He considers himself a storyteller by occupation, believes it’s okay to have a beer on the way to the temple, feels better with a day’s sweat on him, and is an aspiring orchestral conductor. In 2009, Matthew and his wife, Camila, founded the just keep livin Foundation, which helps at-risk high school students make healthier mind, body, and spirit choices. In 2019, McConaughey became a professor of practice at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as Minister of Culture/M.O.C. for the University of Texas and the City of Austin. McConaughey is also brand ambassador for Lincoln Motor Company, an owner of the Major League Soccer Club Austin FC, and co-creator of his favorite bourbon on the planet, Wild Turkey Longbranch.</p><br><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential medical doctors in the UK and hosts the most listened to health podcast in the UK and Europe, <em>Feel Better, Live More</em>. His first three books have all been #1 <em>Sunday Times</em> bestsellers and his latest, <em>Feel Better in 5</em>, shows people how to transform their health in just 5 minutes. It has been a smash hit in the UK, selling almost 100,000 copies in just 7 months, and has just been published in the United States. Professor BJ Fogg, the world’s leading expert in human behavior, calls this book, \"One of the best habit change programs he has seen—deceptively simple but remarkably effective.” Dr. Chatterjee regularly appears on BBC News and Television and has been featured in numerous international publications including <em>The New York Times, Forbes, The Guardian</em> and <em>Vogue</em>, and his TED Talk, “How To Make Disease Disappear,” has been viewed almost 3 million times.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
