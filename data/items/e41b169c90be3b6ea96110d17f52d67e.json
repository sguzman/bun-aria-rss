  "description": "<p>The resurgence of deep neural networks has created an alternative pathway for\nlow-dose computed tomography denoising by learning a nonlinear transformation\nfunction between low-dose CT (LDCT) and normal-dose CT (NDCT) image pairs.\nHowever, those paired LDCT and NDCT images are rarely available in the clinical\nenvironment, making deep neural network deployment infeasible. This study\nproposes a novel method for self-supervised low-dose CT denoising to alleviate\nthe requirement of paired LDCT and NDCT images. Specifically, we have trained\nan invertible neural network to minimize the pixel-based mean square distance\nbetween a noisy slice and the average of its two immediate adjacent noisy\nslices. We have shown the aforementioned is similar to training a neural\nnetwork to minimize the distance between clean NDCT and noisy LDCT image pairs.\nAgain, during the reverse mapping of the invertible network, the output image\nis mapped to the original input image, similar to cycle consistency loss.\nFinally, the trained invertible network's forward mapping is used for denoising\nLDCT images. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets showed\nthat our method performs favourably against other existing unsupervised\nmethods.\n</p>",
