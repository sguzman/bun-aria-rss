  "description": "With so much political effort placed into forcing a wall between the US and Mexico, Andrew Selee’s new book shows how the ties that bind the two countries together are much stronger. Selee has been on the podcast before with his book, What Should Think Tanks Do?: A Strategic Guide to Policy Impact (Stanford, 2018). His latest book, Vanishing Frontiers: The Forces Driving Mexico and the United States Together (PublicAffairs, 2018), focuses on the variety of ways Mexico and the US have been working together, on everything from air transportation to border security to innovation. The dozens of stories about cooperation suggest a bi-lateral relationship that has been growing stronger and deeper over the last several decades.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, Selee addresses the current border issues and whether changes in US policy will harm the burgeoning relationship between the two countries.\n\nSelee is President of the Migration Policy Institute, he had been Vice President of the Woodrow Wilson Center and director of its Mexico Institute.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
