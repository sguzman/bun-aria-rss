  "description": "<p>Charlie sits down LIVE with the GREAT Dr. James Lindsay at TPUSA's \"Defeating the Great Reset\" event in Phoenix, Arizona. In one of Charlie's favorite discussions he's ever had with Dr. Lindsay, of which there has been a many, Dr. Lindsay tells his fascinating story of moving from an atheist liberal to a full blown anti-woke patriot. The two discuss the various strategies of how to defeat the attacks of the left, including the \"lean in theory,\" the \"context theory,\" and the \"so what\" strategy. They also discuss how to best fight back against CRT in schools, in the military, or in your place of work, and finally how to dismantle the powerful control methods of the left in all areas of American life. But as the left's control spell is breaking, as Americans are awakening to their manipulation tactics, Charlie and James outline how now the left is moving toward a \"handcuffs and leg irons\" strategy. What is mid-level violence and how should we respond? James also walks through, in gruesome detail, exactly why leftism is actually a false religion, with all he sociological effects of a modern cult. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
