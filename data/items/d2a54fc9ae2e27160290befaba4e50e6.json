  "description": "<p>YES! Good things come to those who wait and we can't think of anything better than having STEVEN BRODY STEVENS in the Mommy Dome. They just don't make jeans high enough to express our excitement. Brody is his usual POSITIVE self and opens up in a way that will only make you love him more. We talk the Valley, audience warm-up 101, positive energy/positive language, some sports, Daisy the dog, mental health, and much more. If you're not screaming \"818 til I die!\" by the end of this episode then you needs some meds of your own! </p>\n",
