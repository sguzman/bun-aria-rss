  "description": "Today’s stories come to us out of the arid wastelands of the desert. Not many things survive out there in the flat heat, but the things that do, thirst for life and connection. First, I’ll tell the story of a young girl who encounters a monster too close to home. Next, we’ll take a bus ride into Mexico and notice some strange things along the way. After that we’ll learn of a famous palace in Egypt which houses souls of the dead. And finally we’ll sneak out to a well in Yemen, and encounter a mysterious woman.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
