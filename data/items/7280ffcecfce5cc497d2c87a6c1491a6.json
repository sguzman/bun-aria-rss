Until all stakeholders seek to mitigate concerns specific to their area of responsibility, the software supply chain cycle will be vulnerable and at risk for potential compromise.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They previously published &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF\">Securing the Software Supply Chain: Recommended Practices Guide for Developers.</a>&#8221; And they plan on publishing one focused on customers.</p>\n",
