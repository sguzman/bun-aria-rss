  "description": "<p>It's been almost a year since Trump lost the presidency and over nine months since a new administration and a new congressional majority took power. We’re moving further and further away from Trump's controversial use of presidential authorities, and it seems like we've lost momentum in the push for systemic changes to prevent future abuses. Fortunately, some people are still pushing. Natalie Orpett sat down with Bob Bauer, former White House counsel to President Obama, and Jack Goldsmith, former assistant attorney general in President Bush’s Office of Legal Counsel. Together, they are the authors of the book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/After-Trump-Reconstructing-Bob-Bauer/dp/1735480614/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">After Trump: Reconstructing the Presidency</a>,” which was published in fall 2020.
