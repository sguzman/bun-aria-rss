  "description": "<p>💬How do you control distractions? Are they inherently bad, or are good distractions necessary?</p>\n<p>When I think about answering these questions I am left wondering whether there is a concrete answer that is applicable to everyone. Like much of the literature surrounding habits and productivity, it is inherently linked to the type of individual you want to become. Those that read and choose to make adjustments are those that are wanting to make changes in order to achieve their work and personal goals. 📚</p>\n<p>Simply put I liked this book for that reason. The author makes it known that we are all susceptible for distraction. Whether it be our phones, computers, TV or any mundane activity, there are distractions lurking at everyone corner. It is too simplistic to simply blame social media, as many commentators do. They request that you immediately delete all accounts and recede to a life of solitude in the forest. For many that is not the goal. The goal is to have a healthy relationship with technology so that it can benefit our career and personal life. 👥</p>\n<p>‘Indistractable’ by @nir.eyal teaches us how we can form a better relationship with distractions. The book has similarities with other productivity books such ‘Deep Work’ by Cal Newport and ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear in emphasising the importance of time-blocking for distraction free work and environmental design to ensure a positive mental approach to work. 😀</p>\n<p>Concise chapter summaries and a wide range of examples made this book not only easy to read, but full of insightful information that I could deploy immediately after finishing the book. If you like reading about productivity and human behaviour I would definitely recommend this book. 👍📚</p>\n<p>🎥 The video review will be out tomorrow.</p>\n<p>———————</p>\n<p>5 Principles I learnt from this book</p>\n<p>1️⃣ Analyse how you spend your time and when you are most productive. Block out all your time both for work and distractions to ensure you’re creating the maximal benefit to you and your family.</p>\n<p>2️⃣ There is not right balance, there is only what works for you. Don’t feel pressured to create a schedule loaded with work just because others are doing the same. Ask yourself what you find valuable and construct your diary accordingly.</p>\n<p>3️⃣ Organise your devices. Something I have done in the past is organise my devices and declutter apps I don’t use and turn off notifications. This is done with the intention of ensuring minimal distraction.</p>\n<p>4️⃣ Use others for help. We cannot change inherent traits and habits without the help of those close to us. Use relationship and financial pacts wisely to create maximal chances for positive change.</p>\n<p>5️⃣ Schedule in specific time for distractions. We only schedule in time for productive work tasks, but there is value in doing the opposite as well. It ensures that we are becoming maximally efficient with our time without sacrificing the things we also enjoy.</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
