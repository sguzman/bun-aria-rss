  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump had even more reason to fire former FBI Director James Comey than the public originally realized. There was a leak to ABC News about a draft Inspector General’s report that found Comey repeatedly defied authority during his tenure at the helm of the bureau. This underscores the fact that Comey was a very bad employee and there were many reasons to fire him. Later, the Federal government has become unmoored from the constitution and is corrupt. We're looking at an all-powerful central government and that can lead to a an all-powerful presidency if gone unchecked. Tyranny knows no logic! That's why we need to be thankful that Trump scrapped the Iran deal. President Obama was so desperate to prop up the Iranian regime that they circumvented their own deal to give Iran cash since their currency was devalued. Finally, Social Security and Medicare are headed for broke and Bernie Sander's socialist delusions won't rescue America from this. Both the left and the right have created this complete and utter disaster for our grandchildren. They raise trillions in taxes and yet still need to dip into trust funds. Our government spending is out of control. It is they who will the destroy the wealth they create, the greatest economic system on the face of the earth and our beloved republic.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
