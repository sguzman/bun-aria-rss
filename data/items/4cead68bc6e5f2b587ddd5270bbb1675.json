  "itunes:summary": "Revisiting the first Ritual Community Music event of 2020, Vienna-based, post-classical noise artist Battle-ax performed between Eartheater and V for a night of subversive beauty.\n\nWith her viola, Battle-ax fills the room with relentless chains of reverb and distortion, generating a strong and emotional soundscape. Her sound attributes itself to the richness of late romanticism, clipped by the emergence of atonalism in all its immediacy and resolve.\n\nThis performance was recorded at Colour Club on the 19th of January 2020.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/eartheater-battle-ax-v\nRitual Community Music 19 January 2020 Colour, Carlton Presented by Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: Keelan O'Hehir\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
