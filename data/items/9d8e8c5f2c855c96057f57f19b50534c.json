Palmer is an art historian, curator and biographer, who has published extensively in art and literary journals.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/tony-woods\n\nHistories and Theories of Sound\n4 October 2018\nBuxton Contemporary, Southbank\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Discipline and Buxton Contemporary\n\nImage: A 1970 paint­ing by Woods, ​‘Pos­i­tive neg­a­tive’\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
