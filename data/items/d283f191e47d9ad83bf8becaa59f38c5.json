  "description": "<p>When the curtain rose on the murder trial of Pamela Smart 23 years ago, the stage was set for the birth of reality TV. Accused of plotting the 1990 murder of her husband Gregory, 22-year-old Smart was subsequently convicted in the first fully televised, gavel-to-gavel court case, which has inspired TV shows, books, plays and feature films.\n This documentary takes another look at everything we think we know about the case. Is it possible that Pamela had nothing do to with the murder? That her teen aged lover killed her husband in a jealous rage without Pamela's knowledge? The evidence is shockingly compelling.Â \n Join us on this bonkers romp through one of the most thought provoking true crime documentaries we've ever seen.</p>\n",
