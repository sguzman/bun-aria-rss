But these labels or diagnoses are just names we associate with a collection of symptoms. They have nothing to do with why you have those symptoms—with the root causes of the “disease.” Conversely, just because your standard lab panel comes back normal does not always mean you are experiencing optimum health.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Todd LePine about how Functional Medicine seeks to get to the root cause of health issues. They dive into the world of unconventional and advanced lab testing that they use to identify dysfunction in the body and optimize health.</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).
