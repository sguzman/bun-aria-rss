Those are the things that will drive your business. </p>\n<p>When you're David, you shouldn't play Goliath's game. When you're Goliath, you should CRUSH David.</p>\n<p>Here's an example: Did anybody think it was weird that, for three years, I NEVER mentioned VaynerMedia. The truth there was that my size (or my lack thereof) was my advantage, and I couldn't let these other big guys know how huge we were getting! I was learning the landscape. Now that we've got the money and the scale to compete, you'll see that I'm talking about it more. </p>\n<p>The important thing is to NEVER PLAY THE OTHER PERSON'S GAME.</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578223.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
