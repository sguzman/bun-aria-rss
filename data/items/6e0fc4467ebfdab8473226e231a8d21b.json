  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, what is this national climate emergency all about? President Biden now claims he will legislate on his own because Congress won't give him what he wants. The left will burn down whatever gets in the way of achieving their political will. Biden and the radical Marxists he surrounds himself with are destroying everything they can get their hands on. Then, the Capitol Police Chief fired back after the US Attorney refused to charge nine staffers from Stephen Colbert's late-night television show illegally entered the Capitol Office building. The Chief's letter revealed more information about how the \"Colbert 9\" had already been kicked out of other Capitol buildings and had been warned several times about being in the building without a Congressional escort. The production staff was denied press credentials and lied about having them so that they could prank Republican members of Congress. They claim they were inviting members to a cocaine orgy as a joke. Later, Congress is playing games and introduced unnecessary laws to protect same-sex marriage, interracial marriage, and contraception. This legislation does nothing because the Supreme Court was clear in the Dobbs case that their decision was specifically focused on abortion rights as determined by states. Democrats have done this to bully Republicans with campaign attack ads saying they didn't support the gay marriage bill. Afterward, Peter Schweizer joins the program to discuss how Hunter Biden has had more than 150 flagged financial transactions and why he is under federal investigation for money laundering and tax evasion. It is known that he has made at least $31 million from Chinese interests. AG Merrick Garland has announced that no prosecutions will be made if they can have a potential impact on a political campaign - the exact opposite of what they are doing to Donald Trump. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
