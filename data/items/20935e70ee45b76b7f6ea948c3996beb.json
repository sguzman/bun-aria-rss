Just because words like membranous are no longer in the verbal section doesn't mean kids aren't learning important vocabulary.

Nothing's hungrier than a woodpecker with a headache. Think about it for a second—it does makes sense.In the scientific sense, inertia is the tendency for things to continue doing what they're doing, like staying in motion.
