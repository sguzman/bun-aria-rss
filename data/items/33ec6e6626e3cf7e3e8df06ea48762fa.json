  "description": "<p>We automate the process of machine learning correlations between knot\ninvariants. For nearly 200,000 distinct sets of input knot invariants together\nwith an output invariant, we attempt to learn the output invariant by training\na neural network on the input invariants. Correlation between invariants is\nmeasured by the accuracy of the neural network prediction, and bipartite or\ntripartite correlations are sequentially filtered from the input invariant sets\nso that experiments with larger input sets are checking for true multipartite\ncorrelation. We rediscover several known relationships between polynomial,\nhomological, and hyperbolic knot invariants, while also finding novel\ncorrelations which are not explained by known results in knot theory. These\nunexplained correlations strengthen previous observations concerning links\nbetween Khovanov and knot Floer homology. Our results also point to a new\nconnection between quantum algebraic and hyperbolic invariants, similar to the\ngeneralized volume conjecture.\n</p>",
