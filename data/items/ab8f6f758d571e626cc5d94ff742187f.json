  "description": "<p>We’re taking on an age-old question today: Do kids have more energy than adults? Breakfast tacos, caffeine, an energized DJ and an epic battle between a girl and her parents. This episode has all that and then some. Discover how we turn food into energy at an awesome taco party. Then pump up the jams with DJ Thyroid. Speaking of music, get ready for a song from Lake Street Dive’s Mike Olson. And just when you think the show might be out of energy, we engage in an out-of breath competition between a kid and her parents. Plus, there’s a brand new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um about why we lose our voices sometimes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://laurelspringsonline.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">Laurel Springs Online School</a> (laurelsprings.com/brainson) and <a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/mlp/brainson\" class=\"default\">KiwiCo</a> (kiwico.com/brainson)</p>\n",
