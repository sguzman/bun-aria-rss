  "description": "<p>Nearly everyone has experienced the sense of being nudged and prompted to take certain actions. These intuitive hints can spur us to do big things like change jobs, or smaller things like text a friend. </p><p>My guest today says that these are callings, and that if we don't answer them, they'll continue to rememerge and can haunt us til the day we die. His name is <a href=\"https://gregglevoy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Levoy</a> and he's the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609803700/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0609803700&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Callings: Finding and Following an Authentic Life</em></a>. We begin our conversation discussing what exactly a calling is and why it's not necessarily the same thing as a vocation. Gregg then shares how callings come to people, why they're sometimes unpleasant and challenging, and what you can do to attune yourself to their signals. Gregg then shares different ways people go about figuring out their calling, including rites of passage, traveling, art, and community. We get into how you figure out if something you think is a calling is actually a calling or not, and the idea that while every calling demands a response, that response can be negotiated. We end our conversation discussing what happens when your calling ends in what looks like failure. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/callings\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/callings</a>.</p>\n",
