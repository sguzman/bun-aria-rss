  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>We’re back to paranormal romance this week — and so excited! It’s been literal years since we’ve done a deep dive like this one, talking about a beloved, long-standing, many booked, series — Nalini Singh’s Psy Changeling series. We’re deep diving on <em>Caressed by Ice</em>, which features a hero who literally experiences physical pain whenever he feels a feeling, so…of course he’s Jen’s favorite. We talk paranormal world building, patriarchy, hero’s feeling feelings, and try to explain the universe of this book. We’re not great at it, but there is about 20 minutes of bantr, so you’ll be fine!  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There’s still time to buy the Fated Mates Best of 2021 Book Pack from our friends at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3bXV8XE\">Old Town Books in Alexandria, VA</a>, and get eight of the books on the list, a Fated Mates sticker and other swag! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you, as always, for listening!
