  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap week 3 of the NFL and all the storylines dominating the league, plus look ahead to Monday Night Football. First, 12 Year NFL QB, current co-host of NFL Live on ESPN, friend of the program, Dan Orlovsky joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about everything during week 3 of the NFL. They cover tonight's Chiefs/Ravens game, how good Russell Wilson has been, why Dan thinks Aaron Rodgers looks better than he has in 5 years, why he thinks Josh Allen is the MVP right now, and what the problem with Carson Wentz and the Eagles is (23:07-37:30). Next, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the NFL and Patriots 2010 All-Decade Teams, and current Kicker for the Tennessee Titans, Stephen Gostkowski, joins the show. Pat and Stephen chat about him bouncing back from a tough week 1 and having a career week 3 after going 5-5 including a game winner, what he did to correct things after week 1, and how weird it is kicking with no fans (43:03-52:34). Later, ESPN NFL and College Analyst, 5th overall pick of the 2009 NFL Draft, and friend of the program, Mark Sanchez joins the show. Pat and Mark chat about the situation with the Jets and how he feels bad for Sam Darnold considering he was in a similar position, his thoughts on the Mitch Trubisky situation, the hardest hit he ever took in the NFL, and much more (52:36-1:16:59). The show closes with another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ recap everything from the NFL weekend, plus take a few listener calls.
