    "media:description": "Upon witnessing the danger and suffering Jews were experiencing from rampant antisemitism, Theodor Herzl proposed a temporary safe haven in Uganda. However, a Jewish homeland in East Africa was heavily opposed by the Zionist Congress. \n\nAfter much debate, the Seventh Zionist Congress decided against executing the Uganda Plan and Herzl focused his efforts on aiding the future establishment of a Jewish state elsewhere. \nFifty years later, Israel was established, keeping the Jewish state in a place rich with Jewish history, rather than merely a place of physical safety.\n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video— Theodor Herzl: The Zionist Dream of a Jewish State https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9v3xrO4tMI&list=PL-DNOnmKkUabmHqdEAhdCAd02JleQjPhA&index=2\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nExecutive Producers:\n— Debra Klein\n— Avi Naider\n— Jerry Ostrov\n— Barry Skolnick\n\nGold Level:\n— Blavatnik Family Foundation\n— The Associated’s Insight Israel Forum\n— The Crane Foundation\n— Aimee & Jerry Ostrov\n— Skolnick Family Charitable Trust\n\nSilver Level:\n— Sig and Miriam Feiger Family Foundation\n— The Messinger Family Charitable Fund\n— Rachie and Jon Teller\n\nBronze Level:\n— The Bernstein Family Foundation\n— Jewish Federation of Broward County\n— Betsy and Philip Darivoff\n— Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit\n— JCRC of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia\n— Marilyn and Neville Isaacson\n— Corie and Michael Koss\n— Steve Miller\n— Pamela Rose\n— Kim and Perry Shwachman\n— Marci and Andrew Spitzer\n\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\n\n— Duke University, Sidney D.
