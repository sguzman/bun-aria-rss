  "description": "<p>Raynham Hall in New York has seen much history in its time. The homestead survived the Revolutionary War and occupation by a British regiment. It was part of a spy ring as well. It has survived years of additions being added to the building and the changing of hands. Something else has survived from the past as well. It would seem the spirits of the former occupants have decided to stay as well. Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of Raynham Hall. Moment in Oddity features a strange creature found in Russia and This Day in History features the patent of the sewing machine.</p> <p>Check out the website:  http://historygoesbump.com</p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-67-raynham-hall.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-67-raynham-hall.html</a></p> <p>Support the show and become an executive producer!  <a href=\"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
