  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We couldn’t stop thinking (or talking) about this book and our friend Jess, so we asked friend of the pod, Katie Sturino to join us to discuss Jessica Simpson’s memoir, Open Book. Forget what you think you know about Jessica Simpson (seriously, none of us were superfans or even really fans before this book, but we sure as hell are now!). Her book dives deep into her childhood, music career, relationships, and struggles with addiction. Needless to say,  we could not get enough! We discuss the juicy celebrity goss, body image issues, family dynamics, and more in this ep. Seriously, if you haven’t read (or listened to this book!), we can’t recommend it enough. Looking forward to hearing your hot takes, join us in the FB group to discuss!</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /> <br /></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And make sure to subscribe to Katie’s podcast,</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/boob-sweat-with-katie-sturino/id1483683205\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boob Sweat</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, and follow her on Instagram</span> <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/katiesturino/?hl=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@katiesturino.</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">----</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join our</span> <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/badonpaperpodcast/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">FB group</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">for amazing book recs & more!</span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow us on Instagram</span> <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/badonpaperpodcast/?hl=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@badonpaperpodcast</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.
