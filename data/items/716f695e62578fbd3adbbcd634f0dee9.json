They savour the dubiously 'legendairy' origins of frozen cream dishes, explore some weird early flavours (including whale vomit!), and discover how ice cream went from glamorous luxury to dangerous health risk. Plus Dr Annie teaches us how to make our own ice cream in the Nuance Window!\n\nResearch: Chris Wakefield\nScript: Emma Nagouse, Chris Wakefield and Greg Jenner\nProject management: Siefe Miyo\nEdit producer: Cornelius Mendez",
