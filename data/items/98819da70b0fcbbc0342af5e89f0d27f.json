A clinician at Imperial College London, Katrina is working on both the Imperial mRNA vaccine trials, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine trials. She discusses vaccine safety, and the finding in trials that a low-dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine caused a bigger immune response. Also on the podcast, science writer Stuart Clark explains why the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24833100-800-the-universe-is-expanding-too-fast-and-that-could-rewrite-cosmology/'>unusually fast expansion of our universe might require a rethink of Einstein’s general theory of relativity</a>.
