  "description": "<p>You’ve probably heard John say this before, “One is too small of a number to achieve greatness.” In other words, if we’re going to accomplish anything of significance, we need a team around us. In this series, John teaches how to build a team environment for winning. He teaches us the ten questions leaders must ask themselves in order to assess whether or not they’re building a winning team environment.</p> <p>In part one, John teaches the first five questions to help you determine if you’re building a winning team. In the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow discuss setting team expectations and how accountability is impossible unless those expectations are crystal clear.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Building a Team Environment Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Team and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-World-Anywhere-Difference/dp/1400222311\"> <em>Change Your World</em> by John C.
