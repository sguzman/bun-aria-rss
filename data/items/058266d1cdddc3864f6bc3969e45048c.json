  "description": "<p>Dr. Peter Hotez holds an MD and PhD. His conversation with Rogan centers around the anti-vacers debate. There’s a lot to unpack in their conversation and it wasn’t easy to review without sounding stupid which I often do. If you have young kids that need vaccines or are having kids this conversation with Joe is one you don’t want to miss.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
