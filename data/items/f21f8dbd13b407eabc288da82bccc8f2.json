In 2015, Ford wrote an entire issue of Bloomberg’s Business Week titled “What is code?”  which colorfully explained how programming works on the web for people who don’t do it. Recently, he wrote a piece in Wired about how we should still be hopeful and excited about tech and what it can still do for us. \nTheres a lot of negative conversation about tech lately — regulating huge companies, what Facebook and Amazon are doing wrong — but from someone who builds things for the web, Paul brings an optimistic look at how tech can positively and creatively impact our lives in a fun and exciting way. \nPaul comes in to talk about his hopefulness, his piece in Wired, the state of building stuff for the web, and  how people think about tech today. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
