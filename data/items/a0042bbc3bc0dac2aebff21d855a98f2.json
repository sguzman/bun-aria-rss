  "description": "<p>A graph $G$ is weakly $\\gamma$-closed if every induced subgraph of $G$\ncontains one vertex $v$ such that for each non-neighbor $u$ of $v$ it holds\nthat $|N(u)\\cap N(v)|&lt;\\gamma$. The weak closure $\\gamma(G)$ of a graph,\nrecently introduced by Fox et al. [SIAM J. Comp. 2020], is the smallest number\nsuch that $G$ is weakly $\\gamma$-closed. This graph parameter is never larger\nthan the degeneracy (plus one) and can be significantly smaller. Extending the\nwork of Fox et al. [SIAM J. Comp. 2020] on clique enumeration, we show that\nseveral problems related to finding dense subgraphs, such as the enumeration of\nbicliques and $s$-plexes, are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to\n$\\gamma(G)$. Moreover, we show that the problem of determining whether a weakly\n$\\gamma$-closed graph $G$ has a subgraph on at least $k$ vertices that belongs\nto a graph class $\\mathcal{G}$ which is closed under taking subgraphs admits a\nkernel with at most $\\gamma k^2$ vertices. Finally, we provide fixed-parameter\nalgorithms for Independent Dominating Set and Dominating Clique when\nparameterized by $\\gamma+k$ where $k$ is the solution size.\n</p>",
