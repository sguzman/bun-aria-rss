  "description": "<p>On today's show, while Pat and Foxy take care of some business in Orlando, the guys play around with a different format, as they just shoot the breeze. They cover a range of topics including the difference between watching movies while streaming and on TV, the lingering after effects of the Choco Challenge, some dweeb starting a KickStarter to get the rat removed from the end of The Departed, Syracuse basketball coach, Jim Boeheim killing a guy, Casey Anthony potentially taking her talents to Hustler, what has happened to rap music over the course of the last 15 years, and some of the different experiments that the military has spent money on including skateboarding marines, bomb collared bats, \"gay bombs,\" and more. They also give an important PSA regarding the St. Paddy's Day sale going on right now at store.PatMcAfeeShow.com where everything St. Patrick's Day related is 20% off until midnight on Saturday (2/23). As always, to close out the show, the guys each pick a few Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. It's a good time, come and enjoy it with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @baileymccomas.</p>\n",
