  "itunes:summary": "Mono-Poly is Liquid Architecture’s monthly offering of sonic, filmic and performance experiments hosted at Collingwood Yards. In March 2021, for the first Mono-Poly event, R. Rebeiro explored probability as an artistic methodology to enact rhythmic expression using prepared percussion and objects. Combining both the use and misuse of instruments, R. Rebeiro exemplifies a musical practice that is simultaneously improvisational and compositional. This performance was recorded on the 4th of March, 2021.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/mono-poly-march\n\nMono-Poly-March\nThu, 04.
