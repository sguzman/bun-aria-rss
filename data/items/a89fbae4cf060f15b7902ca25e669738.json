When OP's father finally tells OP to leave the house and not come back, OP happily complies and begins living independently. He later finds out from a friend that his dad is leaving on vacation for a few days, so OP sneaks back into his old place and steals all of his dad's stuff. To be fair, it was stuff that the dad bought with OP's money, so realistically OP had every right to take it back.</p>\n",
