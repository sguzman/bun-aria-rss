Net worth values were gathered from Forbes on November 1, 2022. </p>\n<h4>George Soros (Net worth: $7B)</h4>\n<p>George Soros is a Hungarian-born American billionaire, widely known for his philanthropical efforts and for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-bank-of-england.asp\">&#8220;breaking&#8221;</a> the Bank of England. He has had an illustrious career as a hedge fund manager, founding <strong>Soros Fund Management</strong> in 1970.

He is the founder and chairman of two Super PACs (political action committees) named Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II.  </p>\n<p>Unlike regular PACs, Super PACs face no limits in terms of fundraising or political spending. </p>\n<h4>Elizabeth &#038; Richard Uihlein (Combined net worth: $7B)</h4>\n<p>Elizabeth &#038; Richard Uihlein are the founders of <strong>Uline</strong>, one of North America’s largest distributors of logistics supplies (boxes, tape, gloves, etc.).

Using equities (stocks) as an example, when a market maker receives an order from a buyer, it sells shares from its own inventory. This enables the stock market to run smoothly. </p>\n<p>Griffin found himself in the spotlight during the <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-crazy-world-of-stonks-explained/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop short squeeze</a> when his firm provided emergency funding to Melvin Capital Management. </p>\n<h4>Jeffrey Yass (Net worth: $30B)</h4>\n<p>Once a pro gambler, Jeffrey Yass is a cofounder of <strong>Susquehanna International Group (SIG)</strong>, a successful trading firm based in Philadelphia.

He has since backtracked this comment. </p>\n<blockquote><p>At some point, when you’ve given your message to voters, there’s just not a whole lot more you can do.<br />\n<cite>&#8211; Sam Bankman-Fried</cite>\n</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Stephen Schwarzman (Net worth: $35B)</h4>\n<p>Stephen Schwarzman is the chairman and CEO of <strong>The Blackstone Group</strong>, a globally recognized private equity firm.
