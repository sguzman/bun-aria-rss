  "title": "124 - Mothman",
  "description": "<p>The Mothman is a strange creature reportedly witnessed mainly in the Point Pleasant area of West Virginia between November 12, 1966, and December 1967. It’s described as a winged, man-sized creature with large reflective red eyes and large moth-like wings. Sometimes it appeared to have no head, with its eyes set into its chest. Was it real? Is it just folklore? Did anything strange roam the West Virginia woods in late 1966 and early 1967 outside of just the imagination of the people who lived there?
