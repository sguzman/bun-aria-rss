  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Bob Jones University didn’t admit black students until the 1970s and didn’t permit interracial dating until 2000. For decades the school was a symbol of white Christian racism, so why did Theon Hill, an African-American who grew up near Chicago, choose to attend BJU? Hill is now a professor at Wheaton College and shares what he learned about faith and racism from his undergraduate years at Bob Jones. Also this week, Phil and Skye discuss the rising popularity of Bible-based diets like the Daniel Plan and why they’re more American than Christian. Some feminist and gay leaders are becoming concerned that the transgender movement is eroding the intellectual foundations of feminism and homosexuality. Plus, new research finds millennials are too lazy to eat cereal.</p>",
