  "description": "<p>A listener writes, “I still have a hard time understanding what happened to me. I was charged after being hit with a baseball sized rock, after I fell down by my truck it came over the bed of my truck I was able to pull my pistol and shot it over the left eye and it ran away but continued to throw rocks. My encounter is much more than I can write in an email……”</p> <p>I spoke to the gentleman this morning and he has agreed to come on the show. I find him to be a very credible witness and some of the behaviors he describes I have heard first hand but have not talked about on the show. He was hunting and a rock hit him in the chest, the witness describes how the creature threw the rock which is very interesting because I have heard this “off the air” several times. He caught sight of the creature and ran for his truck. When he got to his truck he threw his rifle in the back and dropped his keys. The witness was upset, shaking and fell to the ground. The creature cleared a distance of 75 yards in a matter of seconds and was now on the other side of his truck. The creature came over the bed of his truck and was within a few feet of him. He describes in detail what it looked like. He said the creature kept screaming at him and was moving closer. He pulled out his pistol and shot it right above its left eye. The caliber he was using was not enough to penetrate the skull but he knows he hit it. He said that the creature let out another scream and ran off. He was able to get into his truck and drive off. As he was driving a soccer ball sized rock hit the rear panel of his truck. As you can imagine the witness still struggles with what happened to him to this day.</p> <p> </p>",
