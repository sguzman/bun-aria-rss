  "description": "<p><em>Lawfare </em>senior editor Roger Parloff has been following in a way that just about nobody else has the litigation to keep people off ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment—the part of the amendment that says that if you engaged in an insurrection, you're excluded from public office. It was the subject of a recent major Fourth Circuit opinion, and the state of Section 3 litigation is also the subject of a significant new Roger Parloff piece on<em> Lawfare </em>entitled, “<a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/after-cawthorn-ruling-can-trump-be-saved-section-3-14th-amendment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">After the Cawthorn Ruling, Can Trump Be Saved From Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?</a>”</p><p>Roger joined Benjamin Wittes to talk through the piece. What are the major legal arguments that people involved in Jan. 6 are using to keep themselves on the ballots? How strong are the factual cases against different gubernatorial and congressional actors? And why is Donald Trump uniquely vulnerable to a challenge on this basis?</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
