  "title": "306 - The Sex Slave Murders: Gerald and Charlene Gallegos",
  "description": "<p>As a couple, Gerald and Charlene Gallego turned their dark sexual desires  into a murderous rampage that left at least ten young people dead in California, Oregon, and Nevada between 1978 and 1980. Some of these were girls as young as thirteen - barely teenagers - sexually assaulted before being murdered in a remote location. Nine women were raped before being bludgeoned or shot to death… and one man was killed for happening to be with a young woman Gerald wanted to rape and kill. Most of the victims were teens. One was pregnant. The press called the crimes “<i>the Sex-Slave Murders.” </i> The disturbing true story of two of American true crime history’s lesser-known dirtbags, today, on Timesuck. <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for July is The National Compassion Fund.
