  "description": "Barack Obama is convinced that women are better than men. At an event in Singapore, he declared that women are “indisputably” better than men and everything would be much better if women were in charge. Meanwhile, in Washington, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complained that she couldn’t figure out how to enroll in any of the 66 taxpayer-subsidized health insurance plans she’s eligible for. We will examine how little Barack Obama understands. Can't get enough of The Michael Knowles Show?
