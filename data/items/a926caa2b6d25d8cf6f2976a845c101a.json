  "description": "<p><b>It’s Week 3 of our Proverbs series, and Amanda and Raechel welcome author, poet, Bible teacher, and expectant mother Jackie Hill Perry to the podcast. They reminisce on grandmothers, sigh over the beauty of clean sheets, and Jackie even briefly sings a few bars of a popular tune to our hosts’ delight. The three dig into this week’s readings, tackling hard sayings and tough topics: what it really means to be a Proverbs 31 woman, adultery, and delighting in correction. No matter how challenging the passages may seem, they take comfort in this: all of God’s Word is good and profitable because it all helps us to know Him better. </b></p><p>Show notes can be found here: <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-3-with-jackie-hill-perry/'>shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-3-with-jackie-hill-perry/</a></p>",
