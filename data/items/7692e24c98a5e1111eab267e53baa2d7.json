  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 4/30/22",
  "description": "Elon Musk has succeeded in buying Twitter to take the company private, make its algorithms open-sourced, and ensure free speech on the platform. Thanks to this new ownership this program has begun Tweeting again. Free speech is a God-given human right, it's not the social engineering that the left is used to. A cover-up and obstruction is going on right now to protect President Joe Biden. How can the Biden Crime Family get away with no Special Counsel looking into everything they are accused of and involved with? Yet, Donald Trump and his family have been investigated at every level. These are the times when we need a President like Trump or Reagan that will guarantee mutually assured destruction if Putin keeps it up. Unlike Rand Paul or JD Vance, Trump is a rational, prudential leader that knows when to use the military to protect America instead of romanticizing Putin. Later, pretend-journalist Jonathan Swan falsely claimed that this program's host was a never-Trumper. This mischaracterization was disproved several times and the archives are available for all to listen to.  \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
