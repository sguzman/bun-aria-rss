  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the rise of Jew-hatred and anti-Semitism is frightening. Open borders in Europe have created no-go zones for Jews and Christians in certain areas in the Middle East and it looks like the United States is following suit. Bigots like the Rep Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the squad stir the pot and inspire anti-Semitism. This hatred can destroy a country and affects all Americans that believe in a Constitutional system. Then, Palestinian groups in the United States have been attacking Jews in major cities across America. While we've heard of Islamophobia over and over again, yet we've heard nothing from President Biden, VP Harris who is married to a Jew, or Senate Majority Leader Schumer who is a Jew as well. Shockingly they are all silent. The FBI recently reported that 62% of all hate crimes are against Jews. Will the Democrats do anything to stop this radical wing within their Party? Later, Sen. Tom Cotton joins the show to reaffirm his support for Israel and question why Biden has been so weak in his defense of Israel. Cotton added that similarly, President Obama was also weak with Iran which has vowed to destroy Israel and the US. Cotton surmised that China's preposterous cover-up about the virus originating from a wet market is steadily being disproved as more evidence emerges regarding the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Afterward, isn't it interesting that when Donald Trump says that an election is rigged, people are asked to be quiet but when Stacy Abrams claims that an election was stolen, refuses to concede she is asked to make her case? It's a ridiculously unfair double standard.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
