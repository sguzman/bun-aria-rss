  "description": "Is there a liberal media elite in our country? If there is, do the New Media have the potential to displace it? According to Andrew Breitbart‘s Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World! (Grand Central Publishing, 2011) the answer to both questions is a resounding “Yes!”  The author, an internet and media provocateur, explores his own upbringing as a “go along, get along” liberal and examines the media-related events in his life that transformed his worldview and started his own ambitious initiative to transform the entire media culture. In our interview, we talk about American Studies, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s sadistic approach to tennis, and Matt Drudge’s first job folding t-shirts at a CBS gift shop in LA.  Read all about it, and more, in Breitbart’s provocative new book.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
