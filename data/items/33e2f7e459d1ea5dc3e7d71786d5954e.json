  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joel Evan is a health and fitness coach that wants to help everyone to get into the best shape of their life and stay there. Growing up, Joel read Muscle & Fitness Magazine, with a focus on having more confidence and getting girls to like him. As he left high school, he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, but fell into the trap of feeling like he had to figure it out. He settled on getting into police work. He served in Oakland, CA, which saw a lot of robberies and homicides. He would eventually transfer to San Francisco. It was when Joel’s first son was born that he found himself getting disenfranchised with the work. Things were getting too political, so he started to look into fitness. He began getting different fitness certifications and learning all he could about health from various experts. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Doing fitness coaching on the side, Joel made the leap to full time last October when the police department let him go for refusing to get the Covid vaccine. Having been coaching for a while, Joel felt ready to go all in. He was passionate about not only getting people physically fit, but to improve their health overall. He’s a huge advocate for clean eating and warns of the dangers of Glyphosate, a chemical that is sprayed on food crops. Joel says it does so many things to the body including leaky gut, autoimmunity, and inflammation. With traditional food, sprayed with this chemical, robbing the body of nutrients, Joel makes the case for going organic. Beyond going organic, Joel says it’s a good idea to work towards being self-sufficient. You see all the news about food plants burning down, Joel doesn’t get too much into the conspiracy theories, but still thinks it’s a good idea to be prepared. By supporting local farmers, you’re not only getting top nutrition, but also growing community with others.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to his coaching business, Joel also hosts a podcast called The Hacked Life. He interviews others who have taken a chance and done big things to inspire his listeners to take action. Joel believes that success loves speed and that we shouldn’t sit on the sidelines waiting for everything to be perfect. He encourages others to just start, to take messy action. You’ll either succeed or you’ll learn from your failures. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How intermittent fasting works.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why weight loss isn’t as simple as maintaining a caloric deficit.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How health, wealth, and mindset are all connected.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more I stand on my truth, the more good things happen.” -Joel Evan</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Connect With Joel:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.joelevancoaching.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Coaching Website</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joelevancoaching\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
