  "description": "<p>This episode brought to you exclusively by The Native SoundI was finally able to peg down a guy who I had been wanting to chat with for quite some time, Taylor Madison from the rock band Superheaven (formerly known as Daylight). He's a great dude with a very dry sense of humor so we got along swimmingly when we first met. In this episode we discussed how it feels and what it's like to change the name of your band, step-parents and social media frustrations. It's a very open and honest chat that I am proud to bring you.
