  "description": "At this point, it’s basically certain we’ll see a recession in the near future… The Fed has no choice but to cause one in order to tame inflation. But while we may be (technically) headed for recession, I explain why it’s not as scary as the media makes it sound—and why now’s the time to start picking away at great opportunities. For example, small caps are historically cheap… and one country is ripe for investment. Turning to oil… Daniel and I break down the comedic standoff between oil companies and the Biden Administration—and share several of our favorite energy plays. In this episode:  The Fed has no choice but to force a recession [1:15] Don’t wait for the market to bottom to buy stocks [8:30] Big Oil vs. the Biden Administration [12:40]  Why Russia is in a position of strength [22:00]  You can make money on “boring” oil stocks [30:10] My favorite energy play isn’t an oil stock [33:05]  Enjoyed this episode?
