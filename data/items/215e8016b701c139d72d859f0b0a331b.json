From diet and exercise to mindset and environmental factors, health is truly a holistic, multifaceted state. Now more than ever is an opportunity for us to tune into the things we can do to fortify our health and reach our potential. More often than not, simple shifts and sustainable changes can have the biggest impact.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Today’s guest, Dr. Christian Gonzales, is a naturopathic doctor, host of the Heal Thy Self Podcast, and a true expert in the areas of cancer prevention, clean living, and how environmental factors impact our overall health.
