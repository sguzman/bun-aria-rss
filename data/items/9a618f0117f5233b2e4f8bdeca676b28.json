Anybody can be an athlete.”</p><p>Chris Hauth</p><br><p><br></p><p>Today I am once again joined by 2-time Olympian&nbsp;Chris Hauth&nbsp;for another edition of&nbsp;Coach’s Corner&nbsp;–&nbsp;a spin on my typical podcast format where I go deep and get granular on&nbsp;the physical, mental and emotional aspects of high performance for both sport and life.</p><p>A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AIMPCoach\" target=\"_blank\">@AIMPCoach</a>) is an Age Group Ironman World Champion, a former 2-time Olympic Swimmer, and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches.&nbsp;In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.</p><p>When he’s not training and racing, Chris hosts the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hauthpod\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Word Podcast</a> and runs <a href=\"http://www.aimpcoaching.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AIMP Coaching,</a>&nbsp;mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.</p><br><p>Whether you are an elite athlete or just starting out, Chris knows how to get the best out of athletes the right way. A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me&nbsp;through three <a href=\"http://ultramanlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a> (’08, ’09 & ’11),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.epic5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EPIC5</a> in 2010 and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://otilloswimrun.com/races/otillo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ötillö Swimrun World Championships</a> in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.</p><p>I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel,&nbsp;so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom&nbsp;with you today.</p><p>This is a conversation and audience Q&A that explores what it means to adopt the athlete mindset. It's about the differences between&nbsp;intentional training&nbsp;versus&nbsp;simply exercising. And it's&nbsp;about the key practices that — when performed consistently — most influence success in both sport and life.</p><p>But most of all, this is a discourse about why anyone can be an athlete — a state of mind and action that&nbsp;has nothing to with elite status or genetic gifts and everything to do with your relationship with yourself and how you navigate&nbsp;the world at large.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.</p><p>For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/coachscorner377\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/coachscorner377</a></p><br><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><p>Listen, Watch & Subscribe</p><br><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://youtube.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ik2a22yi44ypcky7h6vnjvran4e?t=The_Rich_Roll_Podcast\" target=\"_blank\">GooglePlay</a></p><p>Thanks to this week’s sponsors</p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><br><p><br></p><p>DesignCrowd: Custom graphic, logo and web design from over 550,</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
