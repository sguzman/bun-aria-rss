But after a shattering experience in their life, Allie n Steve has learned to live comfortably in this in between space. And Allie n Steve has lessons to teach us about the beauty of not retreating to black and white. We also talk to a woman who suffers from a little known condition called \"maladaptive daydreaming.\" She is so addicted to her fantasy life that she's finding it hard to manage her real one.",
