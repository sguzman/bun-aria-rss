The guys talk about the Bills-Patriots game this weekend and what the Bills need to do to avenge their loss a few weeks ago in Buffalo. Doug and Jason discuss the end of the name \"Staples Center\" and how overblown the media reaction has been to that, and give their thoughts on how mediocre the Lakers are at this point of the season.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
