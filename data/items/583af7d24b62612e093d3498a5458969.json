  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!  On today’s show I bring back the rockstar of CEO’s – Keith Neumeyer. Keith is a pioneer in the resource industry. He has successfully built three publicly traded mining companies And today, he catches us up to date on two of them - First Mining Finance (FF.V), and First Majestic Silver (AG). I first invited Keith on the show directly after the launch of his first gold venture, First Mining Finance. At the time, the stock was at just at $.30. Today, the stock price rests right around $1. Keith has a knack for buying assets at the right time. In other words, he’s an expert at timing the market. As you’ll hear on the show, “what you pay for assets is how you create value” is his motto. When he launched First Mining Finance, gold prices were sitting at record-level lows. And when commodity prices finally rebounded last year, his company took off – reaching gains well over 300%. Today Keith gives us his outlook for the company going forward, along with the yellow-metal itself. Moving on, we turn our focus to Keith’s other company, First Majestic Silver (AG). First Majestic is the largest Silver producer in the world. And looking at the numbers, The company has everything in place.  Then for today’s Educational Segment, we take a closer look at one of my favorite market strategies – Buying hated stocks.  One-by-one, I break down a list of Wall Street’s most hated companys. These are the stocks that everyone avoids; and stocks that have “sell” ratings across the board. This includes names like Twitter, Valeant, Sears, Macy’s, Gamestop, and Target. By any means, what I am about to introduce to you is not an easy strategy… But when you follow these steps, it can work like a charm.  This is the stuff that has led me to my greatest gains in my career. And it’s the only contrarian formula you need to know.",
