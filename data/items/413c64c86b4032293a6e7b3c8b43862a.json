Maybe they couldn't care less that they hurt you.</p><p>Sometimes, people intentionally hurt us. Maybe you've been abused, neglected, manipulated, or harassed. As a young boy, I was sexually assaulted by a man I didn't know. It was traumatizing.</p><p>There are something things that just seem unforgivable.</p><p>But forgiveness is not something you need permission for.
