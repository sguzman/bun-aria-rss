Even after I met Zach and decided to move in with him, I still felt that way.\n\nUntil last month.\n\nI want to get married. I want to purchase a home that’s completely ours, to draw up our wills and get serious about our future. Want to do all the husband-and-wife things.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, I want the piece of paper saying he’s mine forever.\n\nI just have no idea how to tell him that.\n\nLet’s Get Textual by Teagan Hunter: https://amzn.to/2BorNTK\n\nA Pizza My Heart by Teagan Hunter: https://amzn.to/2BjZnur\n\nI Knead You Tonight (NEW RELEASE!): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YLW1C9J/\n\nGIVEAWAY! http://readmeromance.com/books/welcome-home-copy/\n\nHalf Truths by Claire Contreras: https://amzn.to/2pqsfyr\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
