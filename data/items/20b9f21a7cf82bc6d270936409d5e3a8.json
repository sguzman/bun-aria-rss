  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.\n\nKnotting is the collaborative project of electronic artist Matt Sabbadini and experimental vocalist Georgia Gamper. Born of an urge to explore the contrasts and similarities of both artist’s music, the duo create works of manipulated voice complemented by electro-acoustics and synthesis.\n\nImage: Darvid Thor\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/liquid-architecture-x-melbourne-music-week\n\nRitual Community Music \n10 - 11 December 2021\nMiscellania, Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
