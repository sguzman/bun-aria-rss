  "description": "<p>Meditation: Listening to Life (2017-08-09) - The attitude of meditation is one of engaged listening, a relaxed, receptive yet intimate attention. This meditation explores how we can listen to sounds, listen to and feel sensations, and then relax back into the ocean of awareness that includes and perceives the changing waves. In this relaxing back, we realize the peace and freedom of inhabiting our wholeness and essence.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
