  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life Podcast, we begin our new series on C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece, <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3h7iBGH\">Til We Have Faces</a></em>. <em>(Affiliate links are used in this content.)</em> This week, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks cover the first two chapters and share their observations as they reread this oftentimes challenging book. To help us gain a framework for this novel, Thomas summarizes the myth of Cupid and Psyche, the first telling of which is found in <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/325Dw6I\">The Golden Ass</a></em> by Apuleius. Angelina shares about some similarities in this myth with several familiar fairy tales. Cindy points out how Lewis changes some key pieces of the story to make it less mythical and more tethered to historical time and place.</p> <p>In opening the first chapter, Angelina tells her theory about this being a story about a character finding her identity as she looks back on her life. Our hosts talk about the strange nature of the paganism in Glome and also the interesting role of The Fox. They point out many of the classical Greek references that we need to pay attention to as we read this story.</p> <p>Tune in next week for a special interview episode with the author of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PYYDlJ\">Dorothy and Jack</a></em>, Gina Dalfonzo. Following that, we will be back with chapters 3-5 of <em>Till We Have Faces</em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>A good carpenter is known by his chips.</p> <cite>Jonathan Swift</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>All too often, the legends old men tell are closer to the truth than the facts young professors tell.
