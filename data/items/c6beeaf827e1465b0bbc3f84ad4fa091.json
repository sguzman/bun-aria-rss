  "description": "<p>An adaptive implicit-explicit (IMEX) BDF2 scheme is investigated on\ngeneralized SAV approach for the Cahn-Hilliard equation by combining with\nFourier spectral method in space. It is proved that the modified energy\ndissipation law is unconditionally preserved at discrete levels. Under a mild\nratio restriction, i.e., \\Ass{1}: $0&lt;r_k:=\\tau_k/\\tau_{k-1}&lt; r_{\\max}\\approx\n4.8645$, we establish a rigorous error estimate in $H^1$-norm and achieve\noptimal second-order accuracy in time. The proof involves the tools of discrete\northogonal convolution (DOC) kernels and inequality zoom. It is worth noting\nthat the presented adaptive time-step scheme only requires solving one linear\nsystem with constant coefficients at each time step. In our analysis, the\nfirst-consistent BDF1 for the first step does not bring the order reduction in\n$H^1$-norm. The $H^1$ bound of the numerical solution under periodic boundary\nconditions can be derived without any restriction (such as zero mean of the\ninitial data). Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our\ntheoretical analysis and the algorithm efficiency.\n</p>",
