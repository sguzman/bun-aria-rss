Don't forget to listen to our earlier episode about closet organization as well! <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.spreaker.com/user/manga-sensei/dear-alice-closet-organization\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.spreaker.com/user/manga-sensei/dear-alice-closet-organization</a><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a> <br /><br />If you have a window in your closet 4:49<br />Vantage points 7:45<br />Valet rods 10:22<br />Wallpaper 13:14<br />If you’re gonna build a whole new closet 20:29<br /><br />“These spaces are personal. It’s a very intimate space and it should reflect you. These do not need to be white and they don’t need to be neutral. You can do custom carpet in them and that really gives it kind of that scarf effect on an outfit. You could use animal prints or plaids if you’re more sophisticated and want it to feel like a Burberry store. There are a million different looks to achieve in a closet so don’t feel like you have to use the same carpet as the rest of your house. Don’t feel like you have to use the same wall color. You can paint the scene whatever makes you happy because it’s your personal space.” 24:06<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
