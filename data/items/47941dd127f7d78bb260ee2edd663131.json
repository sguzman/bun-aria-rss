  "description": "<p>It's time to return to the sport of Speed Skating and speak to a legend of the sport in five-time American Olympic medallist Chad Hedrick about his incredible skating career! We find out how Chad was literally born with skates on his feet and how this enabled him to dominate the sport in both inline and speed skating. We also learn how a trip to the 1988 Calgary Olympics didn't turn out how it perhaps should've and how close he felt he came to making a different Olympics had things played out differently. Added to this we learn which Olympic medal he won that means the most to him and just how he feels knowing he was the last person to beat the legendary Sven Kramer at an Olympics in the 5000m. It's an amazing chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
