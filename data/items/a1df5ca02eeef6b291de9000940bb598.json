He advocates for the U.S. crypto industry in Washington, paving the way for current and future regulation of cryptoassets.</p> <p>USDC and other stablecoins saw a massive influx throughout 2020 into Ethereum and DeFi as demand skyrocketed, providing a glimpse of possible long-term impacts on the future of money. Jeremy argues for a full-reserve money system based on Austrian Economics, moving away from the money creation inherent to today's fractional-reserve systems.</p> <p>Jeremy details the synergy between fiat stablecoins and non-sovereign, store-of-value, commodity assets. He envisions a future of synthetic digital currencies balanced by a basket of non-sovereign assets.<br /> This is a vital time for instituting effective regulatory measures for cryptoassets and protocols, and as a front-line advocate, Jeremy stresses the importance of the crypto industry itself taking the initiative to front-run regulatory issues via creative innovation.</p> <p>Jeremy self-describes as \"cautiously optimistic\" about establishing meaningful dialogue with regulators like Gary Gensler, Janet Yellen, and FinCen, focusing on specific issues like criminal abuse, self-sovereign identity, and consumer protection.</p> <p>Jeremy concludes with broad market predictions and analysis of DeFi as a massively underrated space, with the long-term goal of DeFi interacting broadly with real-world identities.</p> <p>This was an extremely interesting conversation that shed some much-needed light on stablecoins in a regulatory context, and Jeremy remains a key component throughout this development.</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:<br /> Jeremy Allaire on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/jerallaire\">https://twitter.com/jerallaire</a><br />  Circle<br /> <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/\">https://www.circle.com/</a><br /> USDC<br /> <a href= \"https://www.circle.com/en/usdc\">https://www.circle.com/en/usdc</a><br />  Centre Consortium<br /> <a href=\"https://www.centre.io/\">https://www.centre.io/</a></p> <p>------<br /> Don't stop at the video!<br /> Subscribe to the Bankless newsletter program<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.substack.com/\">http://bankless.substack.com/</a><br />  Visit the official Bankless website<br /> <a href=\"http://banklesshq.com/\">http://banklesshq.com/</a><br /> Follow Bankless on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ\">https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ</a><br />  Follow Ryan on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/ryansadams\">https://twitter.com/ryansadams</a><br />  Follow David on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/TrustlessState\">https://twitter.com/TrustlessState</a></p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
