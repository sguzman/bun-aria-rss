  "description": "<p>WARNING: Discussions of suicide. Holy cannoli, this week&rsquo;s episode is a barn burner! I met our guest a decade ago at the <em>Nutt Street</em> <em>Comedy Club</em> (now called <em>Dead Crow Comedy Club</em>) in Wilmington, NC. We&rsquo;ve gotten bender-level drunk in every timezone in North America since, and now she&rsquo;s sober and living it up as one of the funniest comedians in the country that you haven&rsquo;t heard of yet. It&rsquo;s Ali Clayton! From the hills of North Carolina to the streets of Chicago and the boroughs of NYC, Ali has been on quite a journey. We dig deep in this episode: Ali got through a very dark time and is in a much better place now. We are very happy to still have her voice in the world. Here are five words to describe this episode: don&rsquo;t trust your dad&rsquo;s girlfriend.</p>",
