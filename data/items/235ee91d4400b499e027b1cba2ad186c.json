Available only for the next 30 days\n\n---------\n\nAlien Isolation is the story of a dejected orphan, Big Ripple, who must find her mom -- a legendary space trucker with a heart of gold. \nShe boards a space station and learns the true meaning of love: 2 Aliens kissing with their mini mouths. \nWhat's that? Samuels has an Android phone? Disgusting. Ripley hands him her old iPhone.\n\"Thank you.\" \n\"Oh ho ho. Not so fast, Samuels. To turn it on you'll need to pass through 3 locked doors which each need a battery and go down past comms -- but that's in a different station -- and don't forget to find a hammer, which is on a different planet and so on forever and ever and ever and ever IGN 9/10 there's no story here.\"\n\n---------\n\nTwitter:  twitter.com/nethistorian\nPatreon: patreon.com/internethistorian",
