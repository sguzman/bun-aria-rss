  "description": "<p>We propose to employ the hierarchical coarse-grained structure in the\nartificial neural networks explicitly to improve the interpretability without\ndegrading performance. The idea has been applied in two situations. One is a\nneural network called TaylorNet, which aims to approximate the general mapping\nfrom input data to output result in terms of Taylor series directly, without\nresorting to any magic nonlinear activations. The other is a new setup for data\ndistillation, which can perform multi-level abstraction of the input dataset\nand generate new data that possesses the relevant features of the original\ndataset and can be used as references for classification. In both cases, the\ncoarse-grained structure plays an important role in simplifying the network and\nimproving both the interpretability and efficiency. The validity has been\ndomonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Further improvement and some open\nquestions related are also discussed.\n</p>",
