  "description": "<p>Tonight I have joining me, Jesus Payan. He is a researcher of all things Fortean, and has been doing so, for over 20 years. He had experiences when he was young that drove him to search in Europe and all over North America for things unknown. He is a member of Kryder Exploration and Crypto Four Corners, and has been chosen as a field researcher for The Falcon Project. Jesus recently had an up-close sighting of a Sasquatch and will be sharing that story for the first time tonight.</p>",
