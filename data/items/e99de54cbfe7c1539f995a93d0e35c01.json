  "description": "Coming out atheist isn’t always easy, but Greta Christina, atheist activist and blogger, has tips to make it easier for those who struggle. After scouring hundreds of coming-out-atheist stories, she comes to the conclusion that difficult as it may be, very few atheists regret coming out. Most people report feeling happier and more liberated after telling their social circle that they don’t believe in God – even if, in the beginning, that may cause strains in important relationships. In addition, coming out can help other atheists by letting them know that they are not alone and that it is possible to live a good godless life. Greta does make the important caveat that coming out is not feasible or even safe for everyone – those who might lost their jobs, custody of their children, or even their lives may have very good reasons for staying in the closet.\n\nComing Out Atheist: How to do it, How to Help Each Other, and Why (Pitchstone Publishing, 2014) is divided into chapters describing how people came out to specific people in their lives: parents, extended family, friends, and even bosses. Greta advocates being patient and giving those around you some credit – often times, their reactions aren’t as bad as you thought they would be. Greta also stresses the importance of encouraging diversity in the atheist movement, so that coming out and staying out becomes comfortable for those in all walks of life who choose to be godless.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
