  "description": "A collection of this week's Witness History programmes, presented by Max Pearson. The guest is Nicholas Smith, author of \"Kicks: The Great American Story of Sneakers\" and Presenter of the BBC's \"Sneakernomics\" podcast. He explains how footwear revolutionised sport and became high-fashion.\n\nIn 1948, two brothers from a small German town called Rudi and Adi Dassler created the sportswear firms Puma and Adidas. Reena Stanton-Sharma hears from Adi Dassler’s daughter, Sigi Dassler, who remembers her father's obsession with footwear and talks about her fondness for the rappers, Run-DMC, who paid tribute to her dad’s shoes in a song.\n\nWe also hear about one man's mission to castrate Pablo Escobar's hippos, the unpredictable rule of Kenya's former President, Jomo Kenyatta, the 'Japanese Schindler',  and the raising of the 400-year-old Mary Rose.\n\n(Photo: Adi Dassler.
