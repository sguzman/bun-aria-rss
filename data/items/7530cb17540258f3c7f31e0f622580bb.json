  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump has been diagnosed with coronavirus and gave a thumbs-up as he waved and boarded Marine-1 helicopter to head over to the presidential offices at the Walter Read Naval medical Center as he recovers. Data for recovery is very strong. Despite this virus, Trump has worked 20 hours every day, dealing with challenges most presidents never have to confront, as well as running an election in which he travels to the states to earn the public's vote, all while dealing with an extremely hostile press, Democrat Party, and federal bureaucracy -- and it is truly remarkable he did not get this virus earlier. Despite his critics, those who work with Trump know that he follows the science and the advice of doctors, he social distances and wears a mask whenever appropriate. Then, Dr. Marc Siegel calls in to discuss the progress that's been made with different drug combinations that are being used to treat the virus. Siegel added that the president's use of these medications is a good way to prevent any potential negative reactions to the treatment. Later, loathsome radical leftists within the media are more vicious than usual. Jim Acosta criticized the President for not stopping for questions on his way to the hospital. While Rep. Chris Murphy told his Democrat allies in the press that Trump's top campaign surrogate Vladimir Putin would campaign for Trump while he is in quarantine. Afterward, Congressional candidate Amanda Adkins calls in to discuss her campaign for Kansas' 3rd congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
