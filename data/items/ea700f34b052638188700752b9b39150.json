Her book, Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America, was a New York Times bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award, and The Nation magazine named it the “Most Valuable Book” of the year.\n\nTwitter: @NancyMacLean5\n\nDemocracy in Chains: https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101980965\n\nWebsite: http://pitchforkeconomics.com/\nTwitter: @PitchforkEcon\nInstagram: @pitchforkeconomics\nNick’s twitter: @NickHanauer",
