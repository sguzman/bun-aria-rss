  "description": "<p>Sept. 17, 2016. Point Judith, R.I. Nathan Carman, 22, and his mother Linda, 54, left on his boat for a fishing trip. The two hadn't been getting along but they were known to fish together and maybe this was the opportunity for them to patch things up. A week later, a Chinese freighter discovered Nathan on a life raft and rescued him. Linda's sisters and local law enforcement suspected foul play. But this isn't the first time someone close to Nathan Carman had died under strange circumstances. His grandfather, Linda's dad, was murdered on December 20, 2013 with a rifle. With the grandfather's estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars there were potentially many suspects in the family as concerns over who would inherit how much was very much on their minds. But was Linda murdered? Her body has never been found and Nathan said that he would never have killed her or his grandfather.
