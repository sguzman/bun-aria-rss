Owner and winemaker, Dennis Murphy crafts wines mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from his three Walla Walla vineyards, one of which is named after his Italian grandmother Eleanor Caprio, and another for his great grandmother Sanitella Caprio.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/caprio-fire-pit_1024x1024_crop_center.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"411\" /></p> <p>In the show, Dennis shares some good information about Walla Walla and its climate, soils, and the region’s unique position in the wine world.

His mentorship, forward thinking attitude (he was an early proponent of sustainability), and openness are a big part of the success of Walla Walla.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Jean-Francois Pellet</strong> is the Director of Winemaking and a partner at Pepper Bridge and <a href= \"https://www.amavicellars.com/\">Amavi.</a> He was born and raised in Switzerland, and is a third-generation wine grower. After working in vineyards around Europe and for Heitz Cellars in the Napa Valley, he was recruited by Norm to Pepper Bridge  and also helped start <a href= \"https://www.amavicellars.com/\">Amavi.</a> He is an active partner in the businessl and an important force in the Walla Walla wine scene.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Marty Clubb</strong> is Managing Winemaker and co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.lecole.com/\">L’Ecole N° 41</a> with his wife, Megan, and their children, Riley and Rebecca.  Megan’s parents, Jean and Baker Ferguson, founded L’Ecole in 1983. In 1989, Marty and Megan moved to Walla Walla and Marty became manager and winemaker of L’Ecole.  Marty, along with Norm McKibben and Gary Figgins (see below) were the three most important figures in starting viticulture in the Walla Walla Valley.  Marty is one of the most revered figures in Walla Walla.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"4\"> <li><strong>Gary Figgins</strong> is the founder of <a href= \"https://leonetticellar.com/\">Leonetti Cellar</a>, which was Walla Walla’s first commercial winery. The Figgins family has been in Walla Walla for over a century and Gary learned viticulture from his uncles, who were farmers. He is self-taught and has done miraculous things for Walla Walla – Leonetti’s wines were among the first to gain high scores and national recognition for the valley.

The waitlist for the winery is many years deep, so Cayuse’s wines are only available to us on the secondary market (auctions and stuff – there is a podcast to come on auctions that will make that secondary market easy to understand!).
