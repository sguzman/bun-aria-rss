  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats want to use the Cloward-Piven strategy to overwhelm the system with mail-in votes. Mail-in voting will overload the Post Office, it will overload the localities, and it will overload the country's entire electoral system. The Democrats want to break the electoral system and take control through lawsuits and they are doing it all under the cover of the pandemic. Democrats are laying the foundation to recreate how a president is elected and how it gets paid for through emergency coronavirus relief bills that include much more than aid for the virus. This is the fundamental transformation they speak of. Afterward, ANTIFA is the enemy of the people. It is made up of cowards that hide their faces and are part of networked groups that overwhelm systems with violence. Their goal is to damage and blame the police for responding to their violence, then describe the police's reaction as fascist. In Germany, their goal is a communist world order that actually uses fascism to destroy capitalism. Later, using the 2000 Florida election as precedent, state courts will be the first line of recourse to challenge an election. Supposing there is a chaotic situation in the 2020 election a state legislature may intervene and appoint the number of entitled electors for their state. There was not then, nor is there now, a need for a US Supreme Court to get involved in a certified state election. This responsibility falls to both houses of the US Congress. The House of Representatives gets one vote for their state's delegation and as of today, Republicans have more votes than Democrats, thus handing the win to President Trump. The caveat is getting the 270 electoral votes needed otherwise the recount vote must go to the House by January 6th or states will forfeit their right to have their electoral certifications and objections heard.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
