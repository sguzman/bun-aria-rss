  "description": "<p>Symplectic vector spaces are the phase spaces of linear mechanical systems.\nThe symplectic form describes, for example, the relation between position and\nmomentum as well as current and voltage. The category of linear Lagrangian\nrelations between symplectic vector spaces is a symmetric monoidal subcategory\nof relations which gives a semantics for the evolution -- and more generally\nlinear constraints on the evolution -- of various physical systems. We give a\nnew presentation of the category of Lagrangian relations over an arbitrary\nfield as a `doubled' category of linear relations. More precisely, we show that\nit arises as a variation of Selinger's CPM construction applied to linear\nrelations, where the covariant orthogonal complement functor plays the role of\nconjugation. Furthermore, for linear relations over prime fields, this\ncorresponds exactly to the CPM construction for a suitable choice of dagger. We\ncan furthermore extend this construction by a single affine shift operator to\nobtain a category of affine Lagrangian relations. Using this new presentation,\nwe prove the equivalence of the prop of affine Lagrangian relations with the\nprop of qudit stabilizer theory in odd prime dimensions. We hence obtain a\nunified graphical language for several disparate process theories, including\nelectrical circuits, Spekkens' toy theory, and odd-prime-dimensional stabilizer\nquantum circuits.\n</p>",
