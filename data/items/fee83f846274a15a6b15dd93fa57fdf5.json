  "description": "<p>Queen's Park in Toronto is a beautiful picturesque park that was a part of the early park movement in Canada. Within it's borders, it holds the magnificent legislative building. The park is encircled by the city that grew up around it and enjoyed by many. Some of those that enjoy the park are doing so in the afterlife. There are at least five spirits that have been encountered at the Legislative Building. There was another building here before the government structure, an asylum. Do the ghosts of the past haunt the marble hallways of this place? Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of Queen's Park. The Moment in Oddity features Janus Cats and This Day in History features the hanging of five women in the Salem Witch Trials.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-57-queens-park.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/07/hgb-podcast-ep-57-queens-park.html</a></p>",
