  "description": "<p>Dr. Caren Baruch-Feldman is a clinical psychologist, certified school psychologist, and author of <em>The Grit Guide for Teens</em>. She’s also authored numerous articles and workshops on topics such as cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, helping children and adults cope with stress and worry, helping people change, and developing grit and self-control. In this episode of <em>The Psychology Podcast</em>, Caren and I talk about how her work on grit was a natural outgrowth of her clinical practice, and how this led to writing a book specifically for teens. We also cover what she adds to Angela Duckworth’s definition of grit, and her thoughts on some of the controversies surrounding grit, such as the grit vs. conscientiousness debate and the circumstantial factors that affect grit that may be out of one’s control. We also discuss why parenting is different today and the importance of social support in cultivating grit. Lastly Caren sheds some light on things we can pay attention to in order to increase success in achieving our goals, such as the concept of the “two minds” she talks about in her book—the short-term and long-term minds—, effective vs. ineffective goals, why grit for the sake of grittiness isn’t the goal, and why it’s important to connect grit to our values.</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Guide-Teens-Perseverance-Self-Control/dp/1626258562/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502052940&sr=8-1&keywords=grit+guide+for+teens\" target=\"_blank\">The Grit Guide For Teens is out now</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://drbaruchfeldman.com/readings/\" target=\"_blank\">All papers mentioned can be found here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://drbaruchfeldman.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">http://drbaruchfeldman.com/blog/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carenfeldman\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/carenfeldman</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support\">https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</a></p>\n",
