  "description": "<p>The difference set of an outcome in an auction is the set of types that the\nauction mechanism maps to the outcome. We give a complete characterization of\nthe geometry of the difference sets that can appear for a dominant strategy\nincentive compatible multi-unit auction showing that they correspond to regular\nsubdivisions of the unit cube. This observation is then used to construct\nmechanisms that are robust in the sense that the set of items allocated to a\nplayer does change only slightly when the player's reported type is changed\nslightly.\n</p>",
