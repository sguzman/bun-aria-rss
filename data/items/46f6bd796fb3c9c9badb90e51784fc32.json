  "title": "Patrick Schreiner, \"Matthew, Disciple and Scribe\" (Baker Academic, 2019)",
  "description": "In Matthew, Disciple and Scribe(Baker Academic, 2019), Patrick Schreiner provides a fresh look at the Gospel of Matthew, highlighting the unique contribution Matthew's rich and multilayered portrait of Jesus makes to understanding the connection between the Old and New Testaments.\nDrawing from Matthew 13:52, Schreiner understands the author of the Gospel as a \"discipled scribe\" who brings out treasures new and old from his teacher. Jesus, as a teacher of wisdom, formed an alternative scribal school. One of the main ways Jesus instructed his students in the paths of wisdom was to reveal the relationship between the new and the old with himself at the center.\nSchreiner argues that Matthew obeyed the Great Commission by acting as scribe to Jesus in order to share Jesus's life and work with the world, thereby making disciples of future generations. The First Gospel presents Jesus's life as the fulfillment of the Old Testament story of Israel and shows how Jesus brings new life in the New Testament. This book will appeal to professors, students, and scholars of the New Testament as well as pastors.\nDr. Patrick Schreiner is assistant professor of New Testament language and literature at Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon. He is also an elder at Christ Church Sellwood in Portland. Schreiner is the author of The Body of Jesus: A Spatial Analysis of the Kingdom in Matthew and The Kingdom of God and the Glory of the Cross.\nJonathan Wright is a PhD student in New Testament at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He holds an MDiv from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and a ThM from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and can be reached at jonrichwright@gmail.com, on Twitter @jonrichwright, or jonathanrichardwright.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
