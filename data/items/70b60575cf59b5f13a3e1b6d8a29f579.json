  "description": "<p>In this Bonus episode, Sal, Adam & Justin speak with Drew Canole, founder and CEO of Organifi, Organifi is an organic supplement company and Drew shares a very interesting story on how he founded the company. As you may know, Mind Pump has been very critical of supplements, especially the industry's push to consume excessive protein, the use of artificial sweeteners and supplements that do not contain what they are advertised to contain. The position of Mind Pump is (and always will be) to get your nutrition from whole, natural, well sourced foods but the reality is, not everyone eats strictly with nutrition in mind every single day. This is where supplementation can come in and this is why Mind Pump forged a relationship with Organifi. Organifi offers certified organic greens, protein, turmeric and probiotics that are tested for purity and of the highest quality. Please check out their site at www.organifi.com and try out their products. Use \"mind pump\" at checkout for 20% off. There is absolutely no risk as Organifi offers a 60 day money back guarantee.
