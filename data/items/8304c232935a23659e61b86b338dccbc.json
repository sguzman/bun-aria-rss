  "description": "In their co-authored book, Women Will Vote: Winning Suffrage in New York State(Cornell University Press, 2017), Susan Goodier and Karen Pastorello examine the many distinct, yet interconnected, groups that fought for women’s suffrage in New York State before 1917. New York produced some of the most well-known figures in suffrage history, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but Goodier and Pastorello have dedicated chapters to the activism of rural, black, working-class, and radical women alongside the supportive role played by men. Taking into account the innovative techniques and technologies employed by suffragists across the state, Goodier and Pastorello offer an in-depth exploration into one of the most important social movements in U.S. history.\nChelsea Gibson is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Binghamton University. Her research explores the reception of Russian terrorist women in the United States before 1917. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
