  "description": "<p>On the morning of April 21st John Palmer and his wife Katie decided to start their day off with a nice walk together before the craziness of their day to day ensued. They didn’t know that one of their neighbors would also be out that morning, driving his F-250, impaired to say the least. Katie and John were both hit by that man, Cory Todd Foster. John suffered serious injuries that left him in the ICU and unfortunately, Katie was killed in the crash. Cory Todd Foster, who has a 20 year history of vehicular crimes including DWI, reckless driving and speeding faced absolutely no charges. </p><p>A huge thank you to John Palmer for speaking to us about Katie's life and the injustice surrounding her death. </p><p>There are so many injustices in this case that will leave you infuriated, but the fight is not over. There will be justice for Katie Palmer, and all of us can have a hand in helping.
