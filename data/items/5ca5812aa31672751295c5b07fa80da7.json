And the timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse, with <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-ring-gives-footage-cops\">the story about Amazon sharing Ring footage with police</a> only a few weeks old.</p>\n\n<p><center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Why is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Amazon</a> acquiring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onemedical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OneMedical</a> bad news?\"<br><br>Let's explore.<br><br>1. Horizontal integration at Amazon scale of a company that now has the right to access my medical records under HIPAA opens up a huge problem for abuse.</p>&mdash; Corey Quinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1550130226830516226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</center></p>\n\n<p>But I have a different take. The opposite, actually.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<p>First, I agree that Amazon sharing footage without permission is sketch. And I expect them to fix that. Soon.</p>\n\n<p>But when I hear something new is bad, I don&#8217;t just jump on with everyone else. First I ask how things are currently going. So how about it?</p>\n\n<p>Do you like the current security level for medical records? For small businesses in the medical field? For hospitals? For the government?</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s all rubbish. I think medical records are not only broken in terms of interoperability, but so is the security of most of the companies that maintain them.</p>\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the thing&#8212;I think the only force that can possibly make that better is someone big enough to actually get security.</p><div class=\"inline-auto-newsletter\"><div class=\"inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b\">\n<div class=\"text-lg font-bold\">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>\n<div class=\"text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg\">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>\n<div class=\"mt-2\"><form action=\"https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=49fdb7d723\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline\" novalidate > \n            <div>\n            <div class=\"mc-field-group\">\n            <input  placeholder=\"your best email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button text-system\">\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\"></div>\n            </div>\n            </form></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>If I had to pick a place to put my records I&#8217;d go with a company that, say, runs the infrastructure of most of the internet. Like the company that runs AWS. Like Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>I simply don&#8217;t see a world in which they decide it&#8217;s a good idea to be cavalier with peoples&#8217; medical data. It&#8217;s not in their interest. The thing that&#8217;s in their interest is being trusted with that data, and doing a good job protecting it.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t like Google&#8217;s ad-focused model, but guess what? If they got everyone&#8217;s medical data it wouldn&#8217;t be that bad either. I&#8217;d be more worried than with Amazon, but I think both companies are smart enough to know what to sell and what not to sell.</p>\n\n<p>And when it comes to knowing how to secure their data and products, I&#8217;ve not seen many companies better than Amazon.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=2></div>\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s my argument: Amazon will be better at securing medical data than One Medical or any other medical startup. And they&#8217;re not likely to abuse that power because of how bad it would be for their business.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s about to be important, because all the big companies are likely to play there soon. See Apple. And yeah, probably Google as well at some point.</p>\n\n<p>Sign me up. It&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s better than whatever it is we have now.</p>\n</p>"
