  "description": "<p><p>Just over a year ago a crazed activist hell bent on destroying Kirk Minihane nearly drove him to the brink of insanity. Now, Minihane is laughing in his face. In today's episode, Minihane responds to millionaire left-wing radical Bob Murchison's latest pathetic attempt to give his life meaning by tormenting the people with whom he disagrees. The new tactic is to send supporters of the Kirk Minihane Show a collection of greatest hits from this very podcast. The KMS boys can't decide whether Bob is auditioning for an internship with Minihane or trying ruin more lives. One thing is clear though: Bob is a Minifan. (Also, he might be a Dave Cullinane guy...)</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
