  "description": "Ian H. Clary, who teaches historical theology at Colorado Christian University, has written Reformed Evangelicalism and the Search for a Usable Past: The Historiography of Arnold Dallimore, Pastor-Historian (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2020)--an outstanding study of one of the most influential modern evangelical historians. Arnold Dallimore was a Baptist minister in Canada, who, with little formal historical training, spent 20 years writing the first volume of his magisterial biography of George Whitefield, the 18th-century revivalist. Clary shows how Dallimore was shaped by the subject of his biography, even as he prepared the work that has done more than any other book to call attention to his subject. Clary's work situates Dallimore in the context of the post-war revival of Reformed theology, and describes the institutions and relationships that did most to make that revival effective.
