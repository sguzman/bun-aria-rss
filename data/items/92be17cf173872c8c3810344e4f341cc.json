    "media:description": "Episode 15: The Professor's Corner - It’s nine to 12 — maybe even 18 — months after the deal closed. There’s an R&W policy in place, and the purchase agreement covers an array of representations and warranties. But you become aware of something that might be a breach.\nIn this episode of The Professor’s Corner, McGuireWoods partner and insurance recovery practice leader Tony Tatum joins host Geoff Cockrell to walk listeners through the process of filing a claim, citing the issues that might arise and errors to look out for at the onset. He also discusses the importance of gathering evidence, being thorough, advocating for your company and mitigating losses.\n\nSummary & Transcript: https://media.mcguirewoods.com/events/2022/The-Corner-Series-Ep15.pdf\n\nMore information on series: https://www.mcguirewoods.com/events/firm-events/2022/7/the-corner-series\n\nVideos may include attorney advertising and aren’t legal advice/opinion.
