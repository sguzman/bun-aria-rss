  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin and wish you a very Merry Christmas! In 2005 the Carter-Baker Commission report on election integrity warned about the disastrous election that could result if mail-in ballots were used and voter ID requirements were not. The report cited absentee ballots as the main source of potential fraud and called for the elimination of third-party handling of ballots or ballot harvesting. Duplicate registrations, deceased voters on the rolls, voting machine irregularities, and the media's role in calling elections for a particular candidate are also prominently mentioned in the Carter-Baker Report of 2005. The prosecution of election fraud is the final point in the Commission's report. Then, Georgians must get out and vote for the Republican candidates in Georgia. Hearings in Georgia revealed surveillance video of what appears to be suitcases of ballots being transported. In Nevada it was discovered that 2,468 votes were by voters that legally changed their address to another state or country, 42,000 voters who voted twice in NV, 1,500 voters were listed as deceased by the SSA, and approximately 6,000 USPS red flags on vacant addresses. Later, if mask-wearing was 100% effective the coronavirus wouldn't spread. It's obvious that masks help, but a mask won't stop the virus because it's a virus. Anthony Fauci expects to remain on the public payroll if Joe Biden takes office in January. Afterward, the Holocaust Museum is white-washing President FDR's abandonment of European Jews. As the Nazis rose to power, officers on their warships enjoyed a cordial and friendly relationship with the Roosevelt Administration. In many ways, FDR was America's first modern dictator.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
