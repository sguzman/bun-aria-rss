  "description": "Today we bring you the first episode in another mini-series, \"Sex, Love, and God.\" Over the past 4 years Mike has received so much response from these teachings that we've been wanting to post them here to the VOX Podcast.  We please ask that you take into account that Mike would also nuance some of this differently, 4 years and many many conversations later. All that said, we're excited to offer these teachings to you and hope they are as helpful as they have been to so many others. This is the first of 9 episodes that we will release out to you over time here.\n\nThanks!\n\nMike & Andy\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nMusic provided by Izzi Ray - http://www.soundcloud.com/izziray\nMusic available on iTunes - https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/izzi-ray/id386256769\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
