  "description": "<p> Bozeman, Montana. <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/steven-rinella\">Steven Rinella</a> talks with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/janisputelis\">Janis Putelis</a> and special guest Randy Newberg. Subjects discussed: assessing the monetary value of one's GPS waypoints; how fitness for mountain hunting is unlike any other kind of fitness; walleye fishing tournaments; finding elk on public land before the rut, during the rut, and after the rut; whether or not the old you is tougher than the current you; the great American fur boom; trapping beaver; Randy's impression of Steve after reading Steve's book, American Buffalo; Randy's belief that Steve is either dumb or full of shit; how old bull elk like to hide out in weird places; the difference between peace and justice, and other marriage advice that will give you more time to hunt and fish. About guest Randy Newberg: Randy is the voice of the public land hunter in America. Decades of chasing all species across public lands has provided both experience and perspective that has allowed Randy to become the leading advocate for the self-guided hunter; hunters dependent upon public lands for hunting access. What started by accident, has grown into two popular TV shows, Fresh Tracks and On Your Own Adventures, accompanied by the long-standing Hunt Talk web forum. Now added to those platforms is the Hunt Talk Podcast where you get Randy Newberg, unfiltered. Randy uses his platforms to advocate for hunters and public access. In addition to representing hunters in Congress and state legislatures, he serves as a volunteer and board member for many hunting and conservation groups.</p><p> </p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/steven-rinella\">Steve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Steve on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stevenrinella\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenrinella?lang=en\">Twitter</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"> Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"http://themeateaterstore.com/\">MeatEater Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
