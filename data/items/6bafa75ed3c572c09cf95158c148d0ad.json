  "description": "<p>How does the neuroscience of attention affect nearly every aspect of our capacity to live good lives? How can we harness tech as a tool to help our brains be more, rather than less present and aware? What do psychedelics and neuroscience have to do with each other, and how might both work together to profoundly improve our experience of life?</p><p>These are a few of the questions today’s guest, Adam Gazzaley, has spent researching for decades, and continues to immerse himself in today. Adam is a neuroscientist, inventor, author, photographer, entrepreneur and investor. He is the founder and executive director of Neuroscape, and the David Dolby Distinguished Professor of Neurology, Physiology, and Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He is also the co-Founder and Chief Science Advisor of Akili Interactive, JAZZ Venture Partners, and Sensync, and has authored over 150 scientific articles and delivered over 675 talks. And, he is also a stunningly accomplished nature photographer and artist.</p><p>We dive into all of this, with a special focus on his latest initiative, The Neuroscape Psychedelic Division, dedicated to advancing the field of psychedelic science and medicine through multi-level research covering basic to translational to clinical science. The level of scientific rigor Adam and his team are bringing to this area is kind of mindblowing, and we explore where it’s all headed.</p><p>You can find Adam at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.chrisbosh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://gazzaley.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chrisbosh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/adamgazz/</p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the conversations we had with fellow neuroscientist, <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/GLPryandarcy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan D'Arcy</a>, about advances in technology that are allowing us to rewire the brain in ways we never imagined : https://tinyurl.com/GLPryandarcy</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
