  "description": "<p>While I’d like to tell you that I have a special schedule I follow every day, it’s simply not the case.  In what might come as a surprise to some of you, there are even some days when I’m not doing anything that most would constitute traditional homestead activities.  In today’s episode, I’m going to explain how I go through planning on a weekly and daily basis to ensure everything gets done.  I discuss why planning everything minute-by-minute is sure to lead to failure, why getting your kids involved in chores benefit everyone, and how to fit in time for passions that fill you up.  This has always been one of my most requested topics, so I know almost all you will gain some valuable information from today’s show.</p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!
