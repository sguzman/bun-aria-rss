  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I had numerous encounters while hunting in south east Texas from the late 70s up until the early 90s with two visuals. I would share the exact location with you, but not publicly. I didn’t really realize what was going on at the time until the computer age came about and I started reading about others encounters and the things that they do. Anyway, I would be glad to share my encounters with you”</p> <p>I spoke to the witness today and he shared with me his experiences and talked about getting a really good look at one of these creatures. The witness said “This thing was peaking at me from behind a tree and I had to walk past it to get back to the hunting camp. I wasn’t sure what I was looking at so I put my rifle up and looked at it through the scope. I think pointing my gun at it really upset this thing because it showed me it’s teeth. I finally got up the nerve to make it back to camp and this thing paralleled me all the way back to camp.\"</p>",
