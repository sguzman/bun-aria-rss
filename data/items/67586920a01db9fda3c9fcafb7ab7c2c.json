  "description": "<p>The parable of the Great Banquet shows us that God's kingdom is a feast, but it’s not the kind of feast you’d think. Instead of the feast for the rich and the proud, it’s a feast for the humble.</p>\n<p>How can we humble ourselves so we can enter the kingdom? First, Jesus shows that you must be humbled under the slowness of the kingdom. Secondly, under the freeness of the kingdom. Thirdly, under the commonness of the kingdom. Fourthly, under the priority of the kingdom.</p>\n<p>his sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 30, 1992. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1992). Scripture: Luke 14:7-24.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
