I'm Michael Zezas, Head of Public Policy Research and Municipal Strategy for Morgan Stanley. Along with my colleagues, bringing you a variety of perspectives, I'll be talking about the intersection between US public policy and financial markets. It's Thursday, December 9th at 10:00 a.m. in New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Congress continued to check things off its year end to do list this week, following up its funding deal to avoid a shutdown with an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. The Build Back Better plan, which features new spending on environmental and social issues backed by new taxes, remains a work in progress. So, this week we want to look ahead a little to an issue which could feature heavily in congressional debate next year: regulation of the tech industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, to be clear, we think the prospects for congressional action ahead of the midterms are quite low. But major legislation that drives sea changes in policy often is a multi-year process and you can learn a lot&nbsp;by paying attention to that process. Republicans spent a decade crafting the tax reform that would drive their actions in 2018. The same for Democrats with the years preceding the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank reforms of the banking industry. And this coming year could be a particularly educational one in terms of how DC wants to tackle the tech industry. That's because the industry could continue to be a popular issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Both parties share concerns about content moderation, data privacy and company size, though they differ on the approach to dealing with these issues. Crucially, they also share a political motivation, with a recent poll showing the tech industry's approval rating with the American public at 11%, one of the few institutions with a lower approval rating than Congress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what do we think we'll learn as Congress focuses on this issue?&nbsp;Policymakers are likely to update existing templates for regulating traditional broadcast media. That's because there are already institutions in place to do this, and it's easier for voters to understand the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A bear case for what this could look like comes from overseas. The United Kingdom's Online Safety Bill and the European Union's Digital Markets Act spell out some big and potentially costly regulatory challenges for social media companies. This includes requirements to allow users to easily move their data, disallowing product tie-ins and preferential product placement, and potentially, legal and financial liability for harmful content. If such measures were adopted in the US, our colleague and coauthor Brian Nowak estimates this could meaningfully crimp social media companies’ ad revenue, leading to underperformance of the sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But for now, we expect next year will reveal the U.S. is likely headed in a more moderate direction. Early legislative proposals tend to gravitate toward codifying data transparency, portability rights and content moderation. Here, our colleague Brian Nowak notes that internet companies have already begun investing heavily to develop internal infrastructure that deals with these types of regulations, potentially limiting the cost impact of new laws. That's a key reason he still sees value in this stock sector. But of course, that also means if we've read the policy direction in the US incorrectly, there's downside for the sector. So, we'll be watching carefully in 2022 to see if the U.S. continues to forge its own path or follows Europe in its approach to tech regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for listening.
