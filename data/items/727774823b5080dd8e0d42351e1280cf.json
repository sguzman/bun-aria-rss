  "description": "Mixtape Game hosted by Drake!\n\n- You're on a first date with somebody who's extremely hot and you offered to pay. You arrive to an expensive restaurant where your date is on their phone. You attempt conversations but they give you half assed answers while scrolling on their phone the entire time. What song plays as you're sitting across the table?\n\n- You're invited to the Oscars this year and get a seat right next to the stage. Somebody starts making fun of your significant other live on TV and in front of everybody. What do you do to get back at them & what song is playing while you do it?\n\n- You're stranded on an island trying to Survive. You come across a group of islanders who only communicate via Singing & Dancing. What song do you sing & dance to communicate?",
