  "description": "David Mellor considers himself “one of the luckiest people in the world,” and his story is AMAZING. He was hit by two different cars in two different cities – and both smashed his knee.  He has had dozens of surgeries and suffered from severe PTSD for 29 years without even realizing it. But through it all, his love for his family and Red Sox baseball kept him going, and he became the leading innovator of creative turf patterns. David’s new book, “One Base at a Time,” tells his unbelievable story of overcoming PTSD, from a life of nightmares to a life of wonder.
