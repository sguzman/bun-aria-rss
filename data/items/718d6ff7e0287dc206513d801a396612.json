  "description": "<p>I’ve always wanted an Apple TV, but the high price and locked-down features made me opt for Roku’s ecosystem instead. And while I appreciate the freedom Roku offers, Devindra Hardawar’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html\">review of the new TV 4K</a> almost turned my head.</p><p>The 2022 model is cheaper, smaller and runs more efficiently than its predecessor, and it still packs that fancy Siri remote as standard. The box’s speed is its greatest strength, letting you leap between video streaming apps in the time it takes for your cable box to wake up.</p><p>Of course, there’s always a fly or two in the ointment, like the $129, 64GB model has a compromise or two. If you, for instance, want a built-in Ethernet port, or Thread IoT integration, you’ll need the $149, 128GB model. Never change, Apple.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-photography-videography-gear-gifts-140040959.html\">The best gifts for photographers in 2022</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html\">The best smartwatches</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-fall-to-new-low-of-145-for-today-only-085343121.html\">Beats Fit Pro fall to new low of $145 </a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-device-matter-support-compatibility-141558771.html\">Amazon will bring Matter smart home support to 17 Echo devices this year (updated)</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-explainer-190555318.html\">Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic with Ads plan</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-chrome-os-beta-updates-160018804.html\">Steam for ChromeOS works on more devices and is easier to install </a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-communities-rollout-group-chats-070030069.html\">WhatsApp's new Communities feature aims to bring related group chats together</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-un-carrier-on-smart-suitcase-172947176.html\">Hey T-Mobile, nobody wants your suitcase</a></p></li></ul><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-redwire-3d-printing-human-knee-161941443.html\">Astronauts will 3D print part of a human knee in space</a></h2><h3>It’s part of a test of a battlefield bioprinter.</h3><p></p><p>It would be great if we could simply 3D-print parts of our bodies that we’ve damaged or worn out through overuse.

They, not unreasonably, believed the company was working on a follow-up to <em>Parasite Eve</em>, a beloved horror RPG from 1998. Imagine their dismay when the project turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-symbiogenesis-nft-parasite-eve-155218372.html\">little more than an NFT grift</a> from a games giant who should know better.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-symbiogenesis-nft-parasite-eve-155218372.html\"><strong>Continue Reading.</strong></a></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna3-gpu-radeon-7900-xtx-7900-xt-202134224.html\">AMD's first RDNA 3 GPUs are the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT</a></h2><h3>The launch came with plenty of sass for NVIDIA.</h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amd-rdna3-gpu-radeon-7900-xtx-7900-xt-202134224.html\"><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/9418c820-5c29-11ed-bfd7-574266a176da\" alt=\"Image from AMD's XTX Launch\" data-uuid=\"69f85dee-fb4e-38da-a26b-45b65581c2f8\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">AMD</div></figure></a><p>When NVIDIA launched the teeth-meltingly powerful RTX 4090, everyone waited to see what AMD would offer in return.

The technique relies on the protocol’s automatic contact response and can pinpoint equipment to within three feet of its location. To demonstrate the need for better WiFi security, the team equipped an off-the-shelf drone with a WiFi scanner that cost just $15 to make. They flew it around the outside of a house, pinpointing the home’s occupants and WiFi-enabled hardware, such as security cameras. There are several worrying uses for such technology, including looking for unguarded areas of a home for burglary or unauthorized surveillance, none of which are particularly good.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wifi-security-hole-see-through-walls-152138038.html\"><strong>Continue Reading. </strong></a></p>",
