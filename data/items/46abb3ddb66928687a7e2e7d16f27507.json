  "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it so hard to pray? We know prayer is essential, but like the discipline of healthy eating, we turn to the chips instead of the veggies. We choose the quick fix, rather than the thing that sustains. In the first episode of our mini-series on prayer, Emily and Laura talk about our common struggles with prayer, the benefits of this essential habit, and why prayer is possible right now. Prayer keeps our eyes on the Lord, changing our lives today and generations to come—why wait? Listen in to hear the many ways prayer benefits you and how prayer has been part of God’s plan for his people from the beginning!</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">_____</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the Flourish Bible Studies series by Lydia Brownback.
