  "description": "<p>Is everything in life negotiable? It depends on who you ask. We all enjoy paying less than we have to and getting a deal, but there are certain instances where it makes more sense than others. Just because you <em>can</em> negotiate a bill to get a few bucks off doesn’t mean it’s a good use of your time, when there might be a different bill that you should focus on instead. There are several areas in our personal finances that we often overlook to the detriment of our bank accounts. And then one of the other problems is knowing how to go about the process of negotiating- what strategies to use and what steps to take in order to make the biggest impact. And so we’re going to address, not only <em>how</em> to negotiate, but also <em>who</em> to negotiate with<em>,</em> in order to make it worth our time.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Tampa Timeshare Grapefruit-Basil Gose by Wrecking Bar Brewpub- one of our favorite local breweries.
