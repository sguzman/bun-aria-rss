  "description": "<p>Identifying words which may cause difficulty for a reader is an essential\nstep in most lexical text simplification systems prior to lexical substitution\nand can also be used for assessing the readability of a text. This task is\ncommonly referred to as Complex Word Identification (CWI) and is often modelled\nas a supervised classification problem. For training such systems, annotated\ndatasets in which words and sometimes multi-word expressions are labelled\nregarding complexity are required. In this paper we analyze previous work\ncarried out in this task and investigate the properties of CWI datasets for\nEnglish. We develop a protocol for the annotation of lexical complexity and use\nthis to annotate a new dataset, CompLex 2.0. We present experiments using both\nnew and old datasets to investigate the nature of lexical complexity. We found\nthat a Likert-scale annotation protocol provides an objective setting that is\nsuperior for identifying the complexity of words compared to a binary\nannotation protocol. We release a new dataset using our new protocol to promote\nthe task of Lexical Complexity Prediction.\n</p>",
