Deeply ashamed and terrified to confront their truth, these lost souls dwell in the shadows. Paralyzed and powerless, addiction strips them of their humanity as they descend into darkness, wandering lost and alone in what author and addiction medicine specialist Gabor Maté (<a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/gabor-mate/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #188</a>) dubs&nbsp;the realm of the hungry ghost.</p><p>As a culture we perpetuate the cycle of shame by judging those afflicted as weak, even sub-human. This creates a climate of fear and silence, further entrenching a deep sense of self-hatred that drives the addict into a prison of loneliness and despair, isolating that individual from the life-saving solution to their fatal disease.</p><p>But shame can’t survive the light.</p><p>So let’s shine a light on it.</p><p>Towards that end, I give you the story of Amy Dresner.</p><p>A former stand up comic, recovering drug addict and all around fuck up (her words), Amy is a writer and author who humorously chronicles her epic ups and downs for The Fix, Refinery 29,&nbsp;Alternet,&nbsp;After Party Chat,&nbsp;Salon,&nbsp;The Frisky,&nbsp;Cosmo Latina,&nbsp;Addiction.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;Psychology Today.</p><p>I first came across Amy by way of our mutual friend (and record-setting <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/podcast/mishka-shubaly-8/\" target=\"_blank\">8-time podcast guest</a>) Mishka Shubaly and her recently released memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316430951/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0316430951&linkId=ad873e74777faae5f3f434de783b89bf\" target=\"_blank\">My Fair Junkie: A Memoir of Getting Dirty and Staying Clean*.</a>&nbsp;I dig a good addiction yarn, and Amy’s descent into the throes of addiction and ultimate redemption is one for the ages.</p><p>Growing up in Beverly Hills, Amy had it all: a top-notch private school education, the most expensive summer camps and even a weekly clothing allowance. But at 24, she started dabbling&nbsp;in meth in San Francisco and unleashed a fiendish addiction monster. Soon, if you could snort it, smoke it, or have sex with, she did. Smart and charming, with daddy’s money to fall back on, she&nbsp;sort of managed to keep it all together. But on Christmas Eve of 2011, all of that changed when, high on Oxycontin, she stupidly “brandished” a bread knife on her husband and was promptly&nbsp;arrested for felony domestic violence with a deadly weapon. Within months, she found herself in the psych ward–and then penniless, divorced and looking out on a court-ordered 240 hours of&nbsp;community service. For the next two years, assigned to a Hollywood Boulevard “chain gang,” she would sweep up syringes (and worse) on Hollywood Boulevard as she bounced from rehabs to&nbsp;halfway houses, all while struggling with sobriety, sex addiction, and&nbsp;starting&nbsp;over in her 40s.</p><p>Amy pulls no punches. Her raw honesty is as devastating as it is courageous – perhaps even shocking for those less intimately familiar with the ravishes of addiction.
