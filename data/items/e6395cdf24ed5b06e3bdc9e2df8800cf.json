  "title": "\"Absolutely explosive growth.\" How Kathy Kuo built a digitally nimble design business",
  "description": "<p>Kathy Kuo got started in the aftermath of the great recession, back when selling furniture online was still something of a novelty. Over the past decade she’s grown her business by taking a nimble, catch-all approach: when customers come to her site shopping for a few sconces, often they end up buying an e-design package. And if they come looking for an e-design package? Well, Kuo’s company is happy to recommend a few good sconces too. On this episode of the podcast, she speaks with host Dennis Scully about the challenges of reaching clients who don’t know they need an interior designer yet,  why she thinks trade pricing will disappear someday, and why she’s betting that, post-COVID, the demand for home goods is going to get even stronger.  This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.theshadestore.com/customer-service/to-the-trade\">The Shade Store</a> and <a href=\"https://www.onsidedoor.com/\">SideDoor</a>.  </p>\n",
