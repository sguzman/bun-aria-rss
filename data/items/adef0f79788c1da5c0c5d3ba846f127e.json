  "description": "<p>It is estimated that around a fifth of people working in the UK today are disabled in some way. Many of these people report feeling that their employers do a poor job at accommodating their requirements to make their workplaces more inclusive. </p><p>Yet the 2010 Equality Act was designed to protect disabled people from ‘discrimination or disadvantage’ in work by placing a legal responsibility on employers to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to accommodate their disabled workers' needs. </p><p>So why is this discrimination still occurring? Is the Equality Act still fit for purpose? And what can be done to improve the situation?</p><p>To discuss these questions and the launch of their new report, Uncovering Politics is joined by two members of the UCL Department of Political Science: <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/academic-teaching-and-research-staff/dr-sarabajaya-kumar\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Sarabajaya Kumar</a>, Lecturer in Voluntary Sector Policy and Leadership; and <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/people/academic-teaching-and-research-staff/dr-colin-provost\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Colin Provost</a>, Associate Professor of Public Policy.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><ul><li>S.
