  "description": "<p>Mike Black and Steve Simeone met me at the Comedy Store and we talked about the new Star Wars. There's tons of spoilers in here so stay away if you want everything to be fresh. But it's really not that important. The movie was just fun anyway. It ain't like getting a spoiler for 6th Sense or the movie where the guy was a girl. This is the 4th in my series of spoiler alert podcasts. Check out the others if you can find them.</p>",
