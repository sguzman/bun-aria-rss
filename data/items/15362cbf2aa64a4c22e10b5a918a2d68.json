    "media:description": "Step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Halloween Ends!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nAfter decades, the Halloween saga is coming to an end. Again. In a different way, and like in a different timeline? Don’t worry about it too much– the point is, Michael Myers is BACK. Kind of. Actually he’s not really in this movie, but he’s definitely on the posters and in the trailers. So that’s pretty cool!\n\nHalloween Ends definitely raises some questions. Like why, in this movie marketed as the epic final showdown between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, are we spending 90% of our time with a new dude named Corey? Why did Michael go from being an unstoppable force of evil in the last movie to being a weak old man living in the sewer? Why is Laurie living so calmly and casually now that Michael Myers has killed her daughter and is roaming free somewhere? \n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to the Halloween Ends! \n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud7b8Mg6iVI\n\nMorbius Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5I1WWeFQg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",
