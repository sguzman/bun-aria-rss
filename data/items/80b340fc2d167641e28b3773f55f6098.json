  "description": "<p>Jamila Davis has a life story that could be a motion picture. You may have seen her on Love & Hip Hop but her story is way deeper and digs into the depths of the financial crisis of 2008. In the mid-2000’s, she was in the middle of the biggest economic meltdown since the Great Depression. She was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for mortgage fraud, which was more time than almost anyone on Wall Street received, even though her crime paled compared to the biggest investment firms. Her story involves the infamous Lehman Brothers investment firm, former Republican Presidential candidate Christie, Multi-Million Dollar Estates, Superstar Entertainers, and Corruption at the highest level of finance and government. #JamilaDavis Guest IG: @Jamilatdavis Link to Jamila’s Books: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Jamila+davis&i=stripbooks&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&linkId=25a06ded78d1074b750e01e634d3bbe4&tag=eyl0b-20 EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com Code for 40% annual discount: Earners EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
