  "description": "<p>This week, in honor of the upcoming Academy Awards, <em>Here's the Thing</em> brings you a collection of conversations with Oscar-winners -- and, today, with a pair of 2020 nominees. They are Waad Al-Kateab and Edward Watts, the co-directors of <em>For Sama</em>, which is up for Best Documentary Feature. It's a movie pieced together from more than 500 hours of footage shot by Al-Kateab, a young mother in rebel-controlled Aleppo, Syria, as government troops closed in. <em>For Sama</em> is about what it's like for an ordinary, middle-class family to conceive and raise a child in a city under siege.  As the San Francisco <em>Chronicle</em> puts it, \"<em>For Sama</em> is a film made with the instincts of a journalist, the passion of a revolutionary, and the beating heart of a mother.\" Watts, Waad, and Waad's husband, Dr. Hamza Al-Kateab, joined Alec at a live taping of <em>Here's the Thing</em> at the Hamptons International Film Festival.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
