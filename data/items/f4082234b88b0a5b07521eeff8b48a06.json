  "description": "<p>Happy Thanksgiving! We are so very thankful for all of our listeners and...according to Denise...ghosts! We thought we would throw up a special extra episode featuring some legends from the Ojibwa Native American tribe: the legend of Indian Corn and the cryptozoological creature known as the Windigo, a fearsome nasty cannabilistic type creature. Today would be an excellent day to check out our Plymouth episode as well! The Moment in Oddity features the Phantom of Flatwoods and This Day in History features the Great Storm of 1703.</p> <p>We so appreciate the support you all have given us whether it is listening, reviewing, sharing, joining us on air or at meet-ups, suggesting locations, helping with research or financially backing the show! Thank you!!</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-85-legend-of-indian-corn.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-85-legend-of-indian-corn.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
