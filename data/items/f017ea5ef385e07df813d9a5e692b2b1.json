In addition to designing unmanned weapons systems, she was one of the Navy's first female fighter pilots—an experience she chronicles in her book&nbsp;“<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hornets-Nest-Experiences-Female-Fighter/dp/0595001904\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hornet's Nest</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>There are currently around 20,000 robots deployed in U.S. theaters of operation. These robots, which are getting cheaper and easier to make, are characterized by increasing capability and increasing miniaturization.
