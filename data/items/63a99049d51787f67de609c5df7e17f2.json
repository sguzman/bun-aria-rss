  "title": "Ep. 23 - Turkey Hangover",
  "description": "On today's show, the guys try to deal with their collective turkey hangovers and discuss the man with the bionic penis running into some issues, a radio DJ from England who ran his show from a shed in his backyard for one listener for 44 years, and the American adventurer who died trying to tango with some exotic locals. Todd wants to know where the guys wish they could be a native of if they weren't from the US, they take a shot with or at someone, and answer some listener questions including what real or fictional weapon they'd like to possess, and what they would get fired for if they coached in the NCAA, and as always help send you into the weekend with some Friday Bangerz. It's a good one. Come and have a good time with us.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, and @evanfoxy.\n",
