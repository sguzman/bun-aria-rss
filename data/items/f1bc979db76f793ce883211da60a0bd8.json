  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today's guest is Steve Koomar - former derivative trader at Goldman Sachs and editor of the Vigilante Investor newsletter. He called it... Last time Steve was on the show, he explained why fears of a U.S. economic collapse were completely overblown. In addition, he told listeners that the natural gas sector was a sure bet. Here we are 5 months later... Natural gas has surged and the US stock market is sitting near all-time highs. Whenever Steve talks, I listen. And every time he gets on the show I learn something new. On today's episode, Steve starts off by giving listeners his updated economic outlook. He believes short-term market expectations are \"unrealistic.\" However, he is still incredibly bullish on U.S. investments in the long-run. Steve also revisits his positions in natural gas, uranium, and farmland. And then shares his top picks within these sectors. These are safe and diversified investments that define his balanced approach. Then, on my educational segment, I'll be talking about one of the most overlooked stocks today. A lot has changed within the company in the past couple years. And today - I'm giving listeners a full break-down. Not only does this stock have huge growth potential, it has a single-digit P/E ratio, a 4% yield, and is dirt cheap. So don't sign off when Steve leaves us. To end the episode, I tell listeners my favorite growth and income stock for the new year. This is a strong buy... PS - It's finally here... Right now I am at the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. I've been posting live updates on my Twitter & Facebook accounts. Don't miss a beat.",
