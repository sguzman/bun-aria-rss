  "title": "Writing in Disciplines: A Discussion with Shyam Sharma",
  "description": "Listen to this interview of Shyam Sharma, Associate Professor and Graduate Program Director in the Department of Writing and Rhetoric at Stony Brook University. We talk about how mutually appreciative attitudes advance Writing in the Disciplines, about how other languages matter to writing in English, and about how US Presidents have changed the ways we teach writing and learn to write.\nInterviewer: \"Where does language come in to the sort of writing development called Writing Studies or English for Academic Purposes or Academic Literacies?\"\nShyam Sharma: \"Well, there are language-focused academic curriculums around the world. But language is not writing. If it was, then I wouldn't have my job. You know, for the most part, students who speak English as a native language wouldn't need to learn anything about genres and conventions and writing and rhetoric and communication. And so, where English is taught in non-English-speaking regions, the concern about language buries everything so far down that it is difficult for people to foreground it and to pay specialized attention to it and to develop research programs and to be funded and to be recognized and so on.\"\nDaniel Shea, heads Scholarly Communications, a Special Series on the New Books Network.
