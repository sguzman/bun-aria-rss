  "description": "<p>There&rsquo;s a right way and a wrong way to do all sorts of things. For instance we think that the right way to load toilet paper is with it dispensing over the top of course! Or, sometimes you see guys at the beach and they&rsquo;re beet-red but they&rsquo;ve still got their shirt off and they&rsquo;re likely not wearing any sunscreen- what&rsquo;re they doing?! And similar to quitting your job the right way, getting burned seems to be a lesson that many folks don&rsquo;t often learn until they are older, or until after they&rsquo;ve learned the lesson the hard way. But when it comes to your professional career, we want you to realize that quitting poorly can have very negative long-term ramifications. And the flip side of the coin is true as well- higher pay, more work flexibility, and better opportunities in the future await! Learn what you should be doing before you quit your job, how to ensure that you&rsquo;re not leaving money on the table when you leave, and how you can best transition out of your current job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bumblestick Nut Brown Ale by Bhramari Brewing!
