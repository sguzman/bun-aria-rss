  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today's guest is Nicole Gregory, a person that understands what beauty means. Several years ago, while traveling, Nicole Gregory found that finding a place to go to get all of her beauty needs met was nearly impossible unless you personally knew of local beauty artisans; hair, brows, make-up, nails, and medical spa services. She found that many others had the same frustration. Nicole decided to create Urban You Modern Beauty & Wellness. In our conversation, we will talk about how Nicole is empowering women, both her clients and her employees. We will also look at the blueprint of what other women could be doing within their own companies.</span></p>",
