After documenting the behind-the-scenes dialogue that led to a slow-burning interpretation of the Bee Gees's 1977 classic \"Staying Alive,\" we called up Ryan, Jack, and the song's lead vocalist, Lizzy McAlpine, to hear their insights on making a song that everyone knows sound fresh and unfamiliar \n\nSongs Discussed\nBee Gees - Staying Alive (Scary Pockets Cover)\nPaul McCartney and Wings - Arrow Through Me (Scary Pockets Cover)\nBeatles - Maxwell's Silver Hammer\nColdplay - Fix You (Scary Pockets Cover)\nParcels - Tieduprightnow\nBill Withers - Just the Two of Us (Scary Pockets Cover)\nJustin Bieber - Peaches (Lizzy McAlpine Cover)\n\nMore on Scary Pockets\nWatch the video of Scary Pockets and Lizzy McAlpine covering \"Staying Alive\"\nSee them LIVE with David Ryan Harris & John Scofield, November 16 at Echoplex in Los Angeles! Tickets\nSubscribe to their YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/scarypockets\nMerch Store: https://www.scarypocketsfunk.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/scarypockets\nListen on Spotify: Scary Pockets\nInstagram: @scarypockets \n\nMusician Credits:\nVocals: Lizzy McAlpine\nBGVs: Sophia James, Arielle Kasnetz\nGuitar: Ryan Lerman, Will Graefe\nWurlitzer & Synth: Jack Conte\nBass: Travis Carlton\nDrums: RJ Kelly\nAudio: Engineered & mixed by Caleb Parker\nLearn more about your ad choices.
