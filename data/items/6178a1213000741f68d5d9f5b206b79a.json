  "description": "<p>In the latest episode of Off The Podium we're excited to learn a bit more about the sport of diving for the very first time, as we sit down with Australian diver Laura Hingston to learn more about the sport and her amazing career. We find out which sport Laura started off in and how it brought about an interesting transition into diving. We also learn all about the finer details of just how the skills are developed and why a fear of heights isn't exactly a barrier when it comes to certain disciplines in the sport, as well as learning how the disappointment of not making the Tokyo team is spurring her on towards a tilt at Paris 2024. It's one fun chat that will have you trying not to splash your entry into listening, so get to it!</p>",
