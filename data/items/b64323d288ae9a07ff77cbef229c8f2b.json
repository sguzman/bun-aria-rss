But when it does, it’s nice.\nI wonder if we’ll look back and think that these miles of cornfields,\nthese anguished breaths, these forced smiles, these moments when we’re gone,\nthe momentary calms\nand the thousands of little bugs pressed against our windshield…\nwere all worth it.\nI don’t know exactly where I’m supposed to be\nIt’s a hollow thought that takes control of me\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\nDon’t stop (giving up)\n\n#CINEMA #TheMarias",
