  "description": "<p>Matt Carano of The Quantum Week podcast fills in at producer and we get an update on his relationship with The Gerry Callahan Show. Finally we get some honest journalism out of northern Maine, which may just result in Kirk returning to radio to hit the post on the hottest adult contemporary station in Aroostook County, Q96.1. The character of Richard Chandler somehow gets more bizarre as we now don't know if he is real or just a pseudonym for Mark Stewart.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
