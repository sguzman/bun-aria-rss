  "description": "<p>“We're all constantly translating ourselves to the world—we all are trying to take the inevitable stuff that happens in our psyche, our fears, and hopes and desires and dreams and trying to communicate that with others. And some of us are more successful at it than others.” A group of four friends find themselves at the center of a deadly battle between good and evil at an alternate 1800s Oxford University in <em>Babel</em>, the epic new novel from R.F. Kuang, author of the bestselling Poppy War series. Rebecca joins us on the show to talk about world-building, friendship, colonialism, her literary inspirations (including <em>The Secret History</em> by Donna Tartt), Victorian ideas of masculinity and queerness, how she writes, and more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.
