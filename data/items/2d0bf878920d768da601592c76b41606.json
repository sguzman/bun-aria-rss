  "description": "<p>Cape May in New Jersey is considered to be America's oldest seaside resort and while the word \"cape\" is part of its name, Cape May is actually an island. Dr. Emlen Physick, Jr. built his home on Cape May at the age of 21 and he spent his entire life there. The estate is gorgeous with a unique \"Stick-Style\" Victorian architecture style. The doctor clearly loved the home that he shared with three other family members. They all died here and perhaps that is why it is believed that all of their spirits have remained here as well. Join us and Deana Marie of the TwistedPhilly Podcast as we discuss the history and hauntings of the Emlen Physick Estate! Moment in Oddity was suggested by Lindsey Sutton and features Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley dying on same date and This Month in History features first car number plate issued in England.
