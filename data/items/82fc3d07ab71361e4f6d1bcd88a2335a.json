  "description": "Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, was this week, and there's a lot of news that could impact you come the fall. David, Joanna and Christopher sort out the game-changers from the who-caresers. The hosts also dig into Apple's latest privacy initiatives, and try to decide whether Apple's promises are worth believing. In this week's Today I Learned, Christopher has a story about password hacking and quantum computing. It confuses everybody. Finally, David interviews Fred Chesnais, the CEO of Atari (still a thing!) about what the decades-old brand might have to say about the future of gaming.",
