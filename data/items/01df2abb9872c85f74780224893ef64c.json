Alex and Shalaun were in a 20-year marriage before Alex was caught having an affair with Shantell, whom he met at work. After reassessing their relationship, the three of them started exploring the idea of polygamy. Over the past five years, they have learned to navigate the challenges that come with being a throuple. They are now working as relationship coaches, mentoring and supporting other throuples on their journeys.
