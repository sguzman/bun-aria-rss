  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Francis Chan says it’s time for Christians to take Jesus’ command about unity seriously. His new book, “Until Unity,” outlines the biblical call to be one, and why we struggle to achieve it. Skye talks with Chan about what Christian unity looks like practically, the role of racism in keeping us apart, how a focus on church growth distracted Chan from seeking unity, and how to know when disunity is the only option. Also this week, a new study finds less than 50% of Americans are now members of a church for the first time in a century. Should secularists be rejoicing? Not necessarily, as some experts fear religious zeal is now shifting into politics. Plus, smuggling baby tortoises, Phil’s worried about a 3,000-year-old knife-wielding spider god, and a fecal fight between Godzilla and King Kong.</p> <p class=\"p1\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/644356/godzilla-king-kong-whose-poops-would-be-bigger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/644356/godzilla-king-kong-whose-poops-would-be-bigger\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/644356/godzilla-king-kong-whose-poops-would-be-bigger</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/world/galapagos-airport-tortoises-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/world/galapagos-airport-tortoises-trnd/index.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/world/galapagos-airport-tortoises-trnd/index.html</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.insider.com/japan-early-cherry-blossom-bloom-climate-change-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.insider.com/japan-early-cherry-blossom-bloom-climate-change-2021-4\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.insider.com/japan-early-cherry-blossom-bloom-climate-change-2021-4</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mural-knife-wielding-spider-god-found-peru-180977360/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mural-knife-wielding-spider-god-found-peru-180977360/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mural-knife-wielding-spider-god-found-peru-180977360/</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/03/29/church-membership-fallen-below-majority/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/03/29/church-membership-fallen-below-majority/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/03/29/church-membership-fallen-below-majority/</a></p>",
