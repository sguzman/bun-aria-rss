Either way, it's actually really easy to download your existing courses to your computer as Anki decks.\n\nGo to nodejs.org and download your OS' version of npm (Node Package Manager). If you're using Linux or BSD, you can install npm through your system's ports or packages.\n\nRun: npm install memanki-cli -g\n\nThen run: memanki --id ####### (course ID number taken from url in your browser)\n\nYou can also run: memanki --merge --id ####### (this will merge all course decks into one big deck.",
