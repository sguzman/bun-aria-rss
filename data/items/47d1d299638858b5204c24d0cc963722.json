  "description": "<div>LET'S GET READY TO RUUUUMMBBLLLEE! In the ring today we former inmate, present day barber, and future opponent to David Dobrik...Jeff Wittek! There's enough sarcasm to go around this week. We're not here to be corrected, we're here to have fun and break some balls!!! Although getting the vlog squad in the ring with each other would break the internet, nothing will beat Jeff's most iconic match....the fight for his life. Hear what happened the day of Jeff's horrific accident and how he's doing today. Enjoy!</div>\n",
