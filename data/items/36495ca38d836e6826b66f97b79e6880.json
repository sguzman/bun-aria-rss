In this second episode of our series on the National Park system, we head to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bith/index.htm\">Big Thicket National Preserve</a> in Texas. Among the trees and trails, researchers like <a href=\"https://entomology.tamu.edu/people/oliva-chavez-adela/\">Adela Oliva Chavez</a> search for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/surveillance/BlackleggedTick.html\">blacklegged ticks</a> that could carry Lyme disease. She's looking for answers as to why tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease are spreading in some parts of the country and not others. Today: What Adela's research tells us about ticks and the diseases they carry, and why she's dedicated her career to understanding what makes these little critters... tick. ",
