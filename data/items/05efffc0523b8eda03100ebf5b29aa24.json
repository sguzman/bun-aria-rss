  "description": "SUBSCRIBE ON ITUNES FOR FREE! This week, Obama gave his speech/plans on immigration. The short end: it’s a fast-track to get illegal immigrants their green card.  You know who’s not happy about that?  MY MOM! French-Canadian mamma Crowder calls in to tell us what it was like to immigrate here LEGALLY. Don’t miss her hilarious, broken-english rant. Also, my dad counters with HIS experience in immigrating to French Canada. Insightful and frustrating. Also, progressive HipHughes stops by for some debate, and psychologist Julie Steiner enlightens us on mental health issues and chemical addictions.",
