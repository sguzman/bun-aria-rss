  "description": "<p>Eli and his buddy, Jesse, run <a href=\"http://www.backtoearth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Back to Earth</a>, an organization created to take groups of boys and young men into the wilderness for ten days and nights. What happens is powerful, magical, and utterly natural.</p> <p>Eli is trained through The Tracking Project in Corrales, New Mexico, a non-profit led by John Stokes devoted to peacemaking, nature awareness and cross cultural respect. He is a NOLS alumnus and a certified Wilderness First Responder.</p> <p>In addition to his work at Back to Earth, Eli is PhD candidate in Geography at UC Berkeley, working on a dissertation about public space and the politics of belonging in Oakland. He has previously conducted research in Haiti and India, and holds a double bachelor's degree and a master's degree in international development studies from Brown University.</p> <p>Eli is also a poet, dancer, songwriter and spoken-word performer. He was a first generation Youth Speaks poet, and was (maybe still is) the youngest member of a winning Brave New Voices National Slam Team, as well as the youngest to win the Bay Area Slam. He continues to perform original work in a wide variety of venues.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode sponsored by <a href=\"http://sannyceramics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sanny Ceramics</a>.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to catch Eli on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-millennials-guide-to-saving-the-world/id1439745707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Millennial's Guide to Saving the World</a>.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.chrisryanphd.com/support\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by</span> <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Basin and Range</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; “Key West Run” by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4i9w0FR_qtXfOc9888V9Ig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bobby Weidman</a>; “Smoke Alarm,” by</span> <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carsie Blanton</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
