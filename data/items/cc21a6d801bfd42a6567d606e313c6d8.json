  "title": "Why your blood cholesterol levels are important with Sean Ryan",
  "description": "In Episode 93 I sit back down with Sean Ryan to check in and see how he's been going with his transition to a plant based lifestyle. We pick up from where we left things in Episode 88, review his pre-transition baseline blood work and then spend the majority of the episode dedicated to the walking through cholesterol and how we can use diet to effect our cholesterol levels. At the end we also touch on meal prep, handling social conversations and a few other questions that Sean had since our last episode together.\n\nWhether you are thinking about transitioning to a plant-based diet, are currently transitioning or already eat a plant-based diet I think you will take something away from both today's episode and Episode 88.\n\nEpisode Resources:\n\n1 - 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk\n\n2 - 2020 Consensus paper from European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel stating that LDL lipoproteins cause atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery)\n\n3 - ACC guidelines - 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. Recommends people adopt a Mediterranean or Plant-based diet for cardiovascular health.\n\n4 - Garden of Vegan Meal Delivery Service (Australian based)\n\n\nNutrikynd Supplement\n\nFrom time to time I am asked what supplements I take. The only supplement I currently take is the Nutrikynd Essential 3 which combines B12, Omega 3 and Vitamin D.\n\nPlant Proof X Journey Retreat\n\nFor more information on the July 11-17, 2020 Plant Proof X Journey Retreat please visit here.The retreats are an incredible week - a mix of exercise, connecting with like-minded people, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, delicious plant-based meals and snacks, massages and plenty of downtime to relax by the pool or explore the local area.\n\nAs always, I hope you do enjoy the listen. If you did please share your feedback on social media, both Sean and I would love to hear from you. And of course, share the episode link with anyone you know that could benefit from listening.\n\nFinally, if you can take a minute or so to leave a review on the Apple podcast app it would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you for tuning in friends. I appreciate all of you. See you next week.\n\nSimon\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
