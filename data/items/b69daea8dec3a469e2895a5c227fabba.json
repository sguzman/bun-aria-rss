  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>We didn’t elect Dr. Fauci. Drive-By Media crowing about unemployment numbers. WH briefings becoming commonplace, apocalyptic. Two big stories echo what Rush said earlier in the week: modeling death toll projections in doubt. Emails from Rush’s former Democrat friend in Chicago telling him he’s the only person in media questioning this economic suicide. In two separate stories, modelers cast doubts on death toll projections they give to the White House! Trump listened to Fauci and Birx, now media wants to say Trump inflated the projections to make final results look better. Small business owner complains about bailout red tape. Kudlow: We’ll open the economy when the doctors tell us we can.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>What we’re doing to the country is tearing Rush apart. History of Great Depression isn’t taught, lasted 10 years longer because of FDR’s socialism. Homeschool with Rush Revere. Pelosi’s coronavirus commission. Biden’s running mate. Freedom Caucus’ Andy Biggs: Get America back to work. Podhoretz begs for hope from Andrew Cuomo. Media hypes Pentagon body bag order.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Dr. Fauci cross-examined on hydroxychloroquine on Fox, sides with bureaucracy over hope. CDC, NIH are Washington establishment government bureaucracies. WHO is corrupt, in bed with China. Worldwide survey of doctors favors use of hydroxychloroquine. UPMC vaccine study. Media wants to get rid of Trump at all costs, happy about economic destruction, happy about active hurricane forecast. Apple plans to open U.S. stores in May, re-opened stores in China. Caller remembers Rush said he called his mother every day.
