  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Larry O'Connor from WMAL fills in for Mark. The left continues to employ mob tactics and despite Hillary Clinton and CNN's attempts to blame the right for the ANTIFA mobs, normal Americans are not the problem as the media and the left suggest. We're only four weeks away from the Congressional midterm elections so we need to stay focused to keep the mob from taking power! The new Democratic Party kicks people while they're down, that's why they have aligned themselves to these protesters. Instead of condemning the mob, the left is condemning the American people for calling out the mob tactics of protesters. Later CNN host Don Lemon says that the mob tactics are okay because they do it to public officials. Mark Levin responded via social media that this \"exemplifies the disastrous ignorance & ideological state of the modern media\" because \"the First Amendment does NOT protect your “right” to trespass onto a restaurant and harass someone, even a politician, at dinner. The First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights protects the individual against the government. That includes due process and presumption of innocence, which Lemon and his leftist media ilk rejected in the Kavanaugh hearings. Also, a New York University School of Law program funded by Michael Bloomberg is suing the Trump administration over their energy and environment policies. They are trying to shut down progress so they can do the bidding of the environmental wackos.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
