First up, we have Franke Blydenburgh from Rockabilia discussing with me the merch world, how bootlegs work and the changing ecosystem of that side of the business. INCREDIBLY fascinating stuff. Then, Aaron Gillespie from The Almost/Underoath jumps on the line and we get in DEEP with aesthetics, not being a \"cool band\" and anxiety. We also discuss his role as a father to his kids and so much more. Enjoy! Visit Rockabilia and use the code PC100WORDS for 15% off of your order.
