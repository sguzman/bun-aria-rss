  "title": "Ep 2: Pornography with a Mystery Guest",
  "description": "<p>In this episode, my mystery guest and I discuss the topic of pornography. My guest, who prefers to remain anonymous, edited porn for 5 years and now that he’s out of the biz has some great stories to tell. From the smells to the squirts, he shares it all. We discuss the philosophical aspects of porn, namely degradation vs. liberation, the rise and acceptance of raunch culture and why we secretly hate porn stars. Now that porn is more accessible than ever, is it necessarily a good thing and why do I feel profound shame after watching it? Maybe that’s just my problem…enjoy this episode. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Books referenced are : Female Chauvinist Pigs by Ariel Levy, He’s a Stud, She’s a Slut by Jessica Valente</p>\n<p> </p>\n",
