  "description": "<p>In this 95th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we take on culture and consciousness. Beginning with an excerpt from the penultimate chapter of our forthcoming book, we define the terms somewhat differently from how others define them, and discuss how human history can be understood as a tension between culture—received wisdom, orthodoxy, that which works in times of stability—and consciousness—with both its high error rate and promise of innovation, which works in times of change. We discuss collective joy, dancing in the streets,  Carnaval, astrology, taboos,  the sacred and the shamanistic, and hallucinogens. We talk about things that are literally false, metaphorically true. <br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Heather’s newsletter, Natural Selections (subscribe to get free weekly essays in your inbox): https://naturalselections.substack.com<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Allform: Get 20% off any order (of a beautiful sofa) from Allform at https://allform.com/darkhorse.<br/><br/>ExpressVPN: VPNs keep you and your information safe.
