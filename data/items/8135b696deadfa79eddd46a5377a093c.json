    "media:description": "Minneapolis has not had one cyclist death in over 2 years!\n\nIt is certainly one of NYC's best cities to bike in and getting even better with commitment to on-street protected or sidewalk-level paths. \n\nI got to take a wonderful 3-day trip (one day it hit 100 degrees) and there were still so many people out. Of course this film does not look at what it is like to ride during the Winter (many of the people in this film said they do) but if you want to gauge that there are many other videos to choose from.",
