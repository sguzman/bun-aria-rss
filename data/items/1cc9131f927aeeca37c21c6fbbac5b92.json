  "description": "<p>This is part 2 of a &ldquo;double-album&rdquo; interview with Darryl &ldquo;DMC&rdquo; McDaniels, who grew up in Hollis, Queens in the 1960s, &rsquo;70s, and early &rsquo;80s, where he became one of three founding members of the Hall of Fame hip-hop group, Run-DMC. Hear DMC talk about his childhood passion for comic books, how they introduced him to his hometown of New York City and inspired his creativity as a rapper, and how they ultimately informed his search for meaning and identity as the adopted son of Byford and Banna McDaniels &ndash; a secret he didn&rsquo;t discover until he was 35.</p>\n<p><em>Your Hometown </em>is a show where the local is the epic.
