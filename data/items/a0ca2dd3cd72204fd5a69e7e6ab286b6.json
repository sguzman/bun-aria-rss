  "description": "<p>We theoretically investigate a spin-mediated conversion from fluid dynamics\nto voltage, known as spin hydrodynamic generation (SHDG), in oscillatory and\ntransient unsteady flows. We consider unsteady flows of liquid metal between\ntwo parallel infinite planes and then calculate its vorticity fields based on\nthe Navier--Stokes equation for an incompressible viscous fluid. The spin\naccumulation and spin current generated by unsteady flows are derived using a\nspin-diffusion equation, including spin-vorticity coupling, which is a couple\nof angular momentum between electron spin and vorticity field in unsteady\nflows. The estimation of SHDG in liquid mercury flow suggests that an\nobservable magnitude of voltage can be induced in unsteady flows. Our results\nare expected to enable the realization of high-speed spin devices with unsteady\nflows and broaden the range of fluid spintronics applicability.\n</p>",
