[04:51]</p><p>What reference material did Edward use in his first trip to the blackjack table in Vegas, and why was Claude Shannon at MIT — a person known to be difficult to reach — willing to spare five minutes to meet with him around this time? [12:01]</p><p>What method did Edward and Claude devise to beat roulette with the assistance of what MIT considers to be the first wearable computer? [15:11]</p><p>Edward looks great for a man in his 60s — which is especially incredible when you consider he’s 89! Is it just a case of lucky genetics, or does he follow some kind of mortality-cheating health regimen? Has his approach to remaining in shape changed over the years? [17:13]</p><p>How did finance and investing enter the picture for Edward? Where did this lead, and who did he meet along the way? [25:19]</p><p>What was it about Warren Buffett that made Edward come away from their first meeting convinced he’d someday be the richest man in the world? [34:22]</p><p>If Edward were teaching a seminar in investing to a modern student body (some of whom might not possess an aptitude for math), what frameworks would he impart to get them started? [38:55]</p><p>What lessons learned from investing are transferable to other areas of life? [43:50]</p><p>Even at 89, Edward considers himself a long-term thinker. How might those of us who struggle to think beyond the short-term be more like Edward? [45:59]</p><p>How did Edward suss out that something was fishy about the way the Madoff brothers were doing business 17 years before everybody else finally caught on? [50:58]</p><p>Exploring the mental models of externalities, the tragedy of the commons, and fundamental attribution errors. [59:15]</p><p>What you should be reading and listening to if you want to enact positive change in the world right now — politically or evolutionarily. [1:08:29]</p><p>What investors, aside from Warren Buffett, impress Edward — and why? [1:13:48]</p><p>How has Edward known where to draw the line between growing a business and withdrawing before it consumed all else in his life? What catalyzed his decision to wind things down? [1:17:48]</p><p>What does independence mean to Edward and how did he spend his time after winding down the investment side of things? [1:22:52]</p><p>Is there anything Edward’s particularly curious about learning right now? [1:24:27]</p><p>Pondering a conversation between Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut and other parting thoughts.
