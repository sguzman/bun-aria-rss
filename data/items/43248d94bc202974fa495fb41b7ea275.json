  "title": "Ep 121 | 'Welcome to Anarchism, Glenn' | Michael Malice | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Buckle up, this one is a wild ride. Author of \"The Anarchist Handbook\" and podcast host of \"Your Welcome\" Michael Malice wants to burn it all down, peacefully and with a smile. “My rights are NOT up for discussion,” he tells Glenn. He explains why his version of America will save America. He and Glenn also discuss why corporate media is shrinking, why Boomers love Martin Luther King Jr., how Trump earned the spite vote, and why gun control is officially solved. But how does anarchism solve the China problem or potential nuclear threats? Somehow, he has the answer. He also tells Glenn how a concept like Blaze Media brought down the Soviet Union and why, in spite of anxious talk of \"national divorce,\" he has so much hope for the future. \n \nSponsor: \n\nPre-Born partners with clinics in the highest abortion-rate cities and regions. They have a passion to save babies, and to see these women come to Christ. Over the past 15 years, they’ve counseled over 340,000 women considering abortion: more than 169,000 babies have been saved, and over 51,000 women have surrendered their lives to Christ.
