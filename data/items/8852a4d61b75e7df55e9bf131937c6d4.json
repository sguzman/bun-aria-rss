Plus, we hear a crazy pregnancy story from a woman who had no idea she was pregnant until the baby's head came out. We go around the room to see if you believe it. We open the mailbag and help a listener who doesn't want their 18-year-old son to get a tattoo just yet and needs advice on how to get him to think and wait on it.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
