  "description": "<p>We discuss our different approaches to summer - Louise doesn’t slow down in summer and in fact, her online course is about to start which means she is working even harder. Alice has children, which means her summers have always been a time for family. Even with the best will in the world, it’s almost impossible to work while caring for young children so she has always had to find ways of creating that could be squeezed into the gaps around family time. This has included other creative projects including home decor, gardening, cooking, and reading the art books that she has never got round to. We also discuss sketchbooks and the different ways we have both used them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh, and also we started a hashtag for sharing how you are keeping in touch with your art practice over the summer!!<br>\n<strong>Use #artjuicesummer on Instagram</strong></p>\n<p>Our audience question is about charity donations: The listener wrote: <em>“Had my fill this week. Would make an interesting podcast. The tactics they use to get free artwork. How to say no. How to not feel guilty. If I’m targeted then others artists must be too.”</em></p>\n<p>We have a slight reframe on this one … listen for ideas on how you can turn this around so it works for you AND for the charities you choose to support.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Find your Joy FREE mini course runs Aug 2nd - 10th and you can sign up </strong><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/find-your-joy-free/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a><br>\n<strong>Simple sketchbooks for the sketchbook in a day project</strong> <a href=\"https://www.jacksonsart.com/daler-rowney-graduate-stapled-softcover-sketchbook-140gsm-20-sheets-a4?___store=jacksonsart_en&acc=bcbe3365e6ac95ea2c0343a2395834dd\">HERE</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\"><strong>Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\"><strong>bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:<br>\n</strong>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp; @louisefletcher_art &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>See fuller show notes on our websites:<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcerart.com</a></p>\n<p><u><strong>Credits</strong></u></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</em></p>\n<p><em>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em>&nbsp;</p>\n",
