We clicked immediately, grabbed lunch and laughed a lot. I asked her to come and share a bit of her journey with our Good Life Project community. The conversation that unfolded left me changed.</p><p>Brown’s fascination with what she calls wholehearted living eventually led her to explore how we dance with shame and vulnerability, and how we navigate criticism, and awaken to our own power and potential. How we become brave, awake and alive. She's since written numerous books, including, <a href=\"http://brenebrown.com/books/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Daring Greatly (</em></a>http://brenebrown.com/books/)<a href=\"http://brenebrown.com/books/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>,</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vvqvnE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rising Strong</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/2vvqvnE)<em>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2YWfQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Braving the Wilderness</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/2M2YWfQ).</p><p>I asked her to join me on Good Life Project in October 2012 and the conversation that unfolded moved us both to tears at various points.
