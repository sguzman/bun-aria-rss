  "description": "<p>In this twentieth episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast, co-hosts Dr. Eric Thomas Weber and Dr. Anthony Cashio interview Chris Tatem, a Clerk of Courts in Wyoming and the host of the <a href=\"http://www.crossexaminedlife.com/\" target= \"_blank\">Cross Examined Life podcast</a>. </p> <p>Chris has always been interested in philosophical questions. Early on, he asked his teachers and parents endless questions. At an early age, he wrote Socratic dialogues, before he went on to study under a professor who was his inspiration for that kind of writing. He continued on into work in the justice system. His undergraduate studies in Philosophy inspire him daily, he explains. His inspiration for creating the Cross Examined Life podcast stem from that love of philosophy, connected with the inspiration he gains from watching talented attorneys engage in cross examination in court rooms. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target= \"_blank\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href= \"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href= \"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
