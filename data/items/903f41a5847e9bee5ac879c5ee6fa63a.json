We talk baseball being back, loch ness monster, and aliens.\n\n(35:28) Scott Eastwood joins the show. We discuss his role on Fast and the Furious, portraying a real life war hero, which marvel superhero he would want to play, and basically how he's the most manly man out there. Check out his move The Outpost this Friday July 3rd, on demand and in drive in theatres.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
