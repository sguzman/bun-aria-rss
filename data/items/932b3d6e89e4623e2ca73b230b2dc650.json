  "description": "Where’s the party at? Austria threw a fiesta to remember after snowboarder Anna Gasser created history by winning gold at the inaugural Olympic Big Air event. We chilled with another Austrian snowboarder Julia Dujmovits who is into yoga. Plus, can cheerleading make it as an Olympic sport? Olympic channel reporter Alessandro Poggi went to find out. We also sent him to US skier Lindsey Vonn’s press conference. Let's just say that she was a little surprised by our question. Get episode 15 on your headphones immediately.",
