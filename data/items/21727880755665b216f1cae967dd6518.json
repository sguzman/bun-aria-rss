  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap everything from Browns v. Bengals on Thursday Night Football. To do so they welcome in 9 year NFL veteran, friend of the program, host of the Man-To-Man Podcast, one of the smoothest athletes on earth, Darius Butler. Pat and Darius rehash everything from last night's game, why Darius was so confident in Joe Burrow's over 237.5 passing total, and if he likes any other QB's to have big games this weekend (:39-14:22). Next, 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, New York Jets legend and owner/creator of Seventy Four BBQ, Nick Mangold. Pat and Nick chat about how much the Jets stink, set a season long bet with each other, Nick explains how offensive lineman adapt when guys get hurt, what his best lift was in college and the NFL, and how you block a guy like Aaron Donald (16:04-39:39). Later on another installment of McAfee & Hawk, Pat and AJ are joined by 10x Pro Bowler, 8x All-Pro, a unanimous selection of the 2010's All-Decade team, and surefire Hall of Famer, Joe Thomas. Pat, Joe, and AJ discuss last night's Browns/Bengals game, what playing in Cleveland was like, his appearance on the Titan games, and why he thinks Baker Mayfield may still be the franchise guy for the Browns (58:38-1:12:28). Plus Pat and AJ discuss some of the most memorable comeback victories of their careers, and look ahead to the week 2 NFL slate (41:55-1:16:55).
