  "description": "On this week’s show I’m joined by the biggest bear I know on Wall Street – Richard Suttmeier. Rich has been analyzing stocks for over 40 years. He's currently the founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants. He's also a weekly contributor to Forbes and TheStreet.com.  Richard is an expert at analyzing what he calls \"the balance sheet of the U.S. economy,\" otherwise known as the FDIC Banking Profile. Using this hard data, which most investors tend to overlook, Rich gives us his economic forecast… More specifically, he dives into the recently released U.S. home sales data… and why the housing market may be due for a correction within the next 6 to 12 months. For today's Educational Segment [46:45], get your pens ready... We're going to talk about what President Trump's tax reform means for you. And I'll be sharing the names and symbols of at least 30 stocks in this \"winners and losers\" discussion.",
