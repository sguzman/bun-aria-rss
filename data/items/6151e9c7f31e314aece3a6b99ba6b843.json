  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Republicans are buckling on President Trump's National emergencies Act declaration because they are ignorant. Do any of these so called constitutionalists claim that the Administrative State is unconstitutional when the massive federal government leviathan writes more regulations than Congress does? How many of them proposed a repeal of DACA? President Obama issued this executive action knowing that he couldn't legislate from the oval office, but he did it anyway. Not a single one of these constitutionally critical Congressmen said a word. Congress issues statutes allowing the president to move funds from one account to another. Trump is citing the actual statutes that Congress voted on, DACA was dictatorial—plain and simple. The question to them is: Is it constitutional for people to pour in at our border? Also, Michael Cohen, and his attorney Lanny Davis, admitted liar and confessed criminal will take the witness stand in congress Wednesday to spew lies to the fake news media; nothing he has to offer has any legislative consequence to our Congress, but their goal is to sabotage him. So the show must go on. Later, Democrats defend infanticide, yet again by voting against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Healthcare cannot be a right because we don't have the right to a doctor's services whenever we want. Finally, Gary Sinise calls in to discuss his new book: Grateful American: A Journey from Self to Service.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
