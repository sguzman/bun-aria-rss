  "title": "PMS 2.0 031 - A Huge Giveaway, A Future HOFer, & Life Talk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the guys get a surprise call from AQ Shipley and they chat about the Cardinals' past game, his nightmare flight from New York to Phoenix with his baby and him trying to get her to stop crying, and if he has any questions for Joe Thomas (12:02-19:32). Next, future Hall of Famer, former Browns legend, and the first offensive lineman in NFL history, Joe Thomas, joins the show. They discuss his thoughts on the Browns this season, staying in shape around the holidays, how much he's enjoyed being on the media side in the NFL, and whether or not he's going to consider calling any football games next year. To close out the interview, Joe answers questions in a lightning round from all the guys in the studio (19:34-44:50). The guys also discuss Pat's new three-legged cat, and dive into an NFL conversation about whether or not the Patriots are done, if the Steelers are back/Boz's woes, if the Colts have quietly become one of the best teams in the AFC, and their thoughts on some of the demands of retired players and HOFer's. Pat also announces a HUGE GIVEAWAY towards the end of the show. Stick around afterwards to hear some of the live phone calls from Pat opening up the phone lines to the public. It's a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
