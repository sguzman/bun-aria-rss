  "description": "<p>A British author founded the village of Rugby in the beautiful Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee. This was meant to be a utopia and for a time, it really was. Large Victorian buildings were constructed, social clubs were founded, lawn tennis was played and the library was stocked full of books and became the pride of the colony. Then it all ended amid financial issues, epidemics and fires. The village was revitalized in the 1960s and is a place tourists can visit for a time capsule into the Victorian era. And several locations in Rugby are reputedly haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Rugby, Tennessee! The Moment in Oddity features The Valley of Headless Men and This Month in History features the death of Judge Roy Bean. Our location was suggested by Tammie Burroughs. </p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br />  <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2022/03/hgb-ep-427-village-of-rugby.html<br />    <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode: </p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Forest Full of Colors by Stock Music</p>",
