  "description": "THE GAMES ARE HERE! It's time to get excited as the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics have started and your favourite Olympics podcast is here to give you it's take on the opening ceremony! Just how bad were Channel 7 in covering the event? What was with all the outfits? Did the cauldron look like a giant space penis? How good was the traditional Korean song of 'Imagine' performed by out of tune buskers? Why was everything pre-recorded? Why did we have to add another Canadian to the episode to balance it out? Have we found our winter Ryan Lochte already? Why do Canadian skiers poo themselves? And can any of our fan messages actually get published on the AOC website? It's all here and more in our epic recap of the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics!",
