  "description": "Few artists have survived the constantly mutating world of dance music from era to era quite like Moby. From his roots in New York's early-'90s rave scene to the commercial gold of Play and 18's ambient electronica, Moby has maintained his place on the shortlist of the genre's crossover stars. His recent performances have highlighted his work as a DJ, departing from his mid-period forays into rock musicianship, but at Moogfest, he was in full-on rock star mode, stalking the stage and playing guitar, drums and keyboards while leading a band clad all in black through songs from throughout his nearly 20-year career. Hear Moby perform a full concert, recorded live on October 28, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.",
