We talk with Dodd who shares with us how to find locations, things that have to be considered for locations and working with the budget. He also talks about how he needs to get into the director’s head, how the location department are the ambassadors of the film and the importance of getting to know the location neighborhood and the people living there. We also touch on reusing locations, remembering logistics when looking for locations and the difference in locations for film and TV. And much more!!</p>",
