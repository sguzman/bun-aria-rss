  "description": "<p>Well the sun is gonna surely shine this week because we are joined by star of the sitcom \"Blossom\" and friend of the Bayers, Jenna von Oy! On this episode, Vanessa fact-checks the bizarre direct message (and probably fictional road trip) that lead to her friendship with Jenna, we learn about the unlikely relationship between \"Blossom\" and \"Seinfeld\" and deconstruct Jenna's experiences doing commercials in the '90s which ranged from Kool-AId to Members Only to Quilted Northern. We also dig deep into the era's fashion—and what could accentuate a hat with fabric flowers attached to it more than crimped hair? (Unfortunately, crimping wasn't so easy for those of us with curly hair.) Finally, we discuss her co-star Joey Lawrence's \"Nothing My Love Can't Fix\" music video and play an insightful round of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" where we explore misguided opinions on marketing, economics and junk mail. Also, be sure to check out and donate to Jenna's wonderful new project at https://www.thecassandraproject.net.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to learn more about The Cassandra Project please follow the links below:</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthecassandraproject.net%2F&data=05%7C01%7COliviaAguilar%40iheartmedia.com%7C506bfd7ece3441aa978c08da8ab7b820%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C637974818924718591%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=yviZKswMGjfMaZJop5WUC8Cy1ZWM2kUwQ5BQzrOEQ84%3D&reserved=0\">TheCassandraProject.net</a></p>\n<p>Instagram: @CassandraProjectFilm</p>\n<p>Twitter:  @Cassandra_Films</p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcassandraprojectfilm&data=05%7C01%7COliviaAguilar%40iheartmedia.com%7C506bfd7ece3441aa978c08da8ab7b820%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C637974818924718591%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2Fn31n9dMEUKy07YWNGr2CZkPAiVRM31B66wdqjE22XQ%3D&reserved=0\">https://www.facebook.com/cassandraprojectfilm</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
