  "description": "<p>We’re starting a new series on spiritual disciplines, or Christian practices, like gathering for corporate worship, private meditation and prayer, the disciplines of simplicity and generosity, reading the Bible in community, and spiritual friendship. </p>\n<p>The best way to introduce the series is to plunge into the first Christian practice, the first of the spiritual disciplines, which is worship. We’re looking at Psalm 95, which is called the Venite. In Latin, venite is the first word. It’s “O come.” It’s probably the best single place in the Bible to go if we want to understand what worship is all about. </p>\n<p>In this Psalm, we’re going to learn three things about worship: why we should, what it is, and how it’s done.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on April 6, 2008. Series: Practicing The Christian Life. Scripture: Psalm 95:1-11.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
