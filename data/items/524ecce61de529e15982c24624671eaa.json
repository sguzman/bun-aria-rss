Songs like “Loving The Alien,” a David Bowie song that Frampton says is a tribute to his childhood friend who helped revitalize his career. And George Harrison’s “Isn’t It A Pity,” which reminds Frampton of the time he jammed with George in Abbey Road studios while Phil Spector looked on from the control room. And Frampton also talks about how becoming a pinup sex symbol in the late ‘70s almost sidelined his career. Plus, how managing an inflammatory muscle disease has impacted his writing and playing.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Peter Frampton songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7l7VXY5Z6XhGrAszCrYIcu?si=92ac7e78db8542cc\">HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
