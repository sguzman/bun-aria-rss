  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment according to Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution. It was designed to include the entire house by a vote, not just the democrats. What Speaker Pelosi is doing is lawless and rejects the spirit of the constitution and the precedent that's been established by a vote. This unilateral move by Pelosi and a few committees violates the doctrine of separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. This is why Pelosi and her committee Chairs haven't issued letters instead of subpoenas because they fear they'd be unenforceable in federal court since the courts have already ruled on this. Then, with respect to Ukraine, we know that Adam Schiff lied saying he had no contact with the so-called whistleblower. We know that Ukraine was investigating Burisma months before the call between President Trump and president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. We know that Ukraine didn't know about the U.S withholding any funds until a month after the call. We know that the Zelensky has said on the record that he was not being pushed or pressured in their phone call. Afterward, Mitt Romney continues trying to take out President Trump while Joe Biden is actually interfering in our election by promoting the use of the impeachment inquiry process for his own political gain and should be criminally investigated for his Ukrainian collusion. Finally, the Kurds should not be abandoned and Turkey should not be allowed to destroy the Kurds.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
