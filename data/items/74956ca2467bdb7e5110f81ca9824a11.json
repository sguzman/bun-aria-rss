  "description": "<p>It's time to get fast and skate into another epic interview as we chat with two-time Canadian speed skating Olympian and Olympic silver medallist Laurent Dubreuil about his incredible career and even more incredible Olympic experiences! We find out from Laurent just how influential his Olympian parents were in getting into the sport as well as why he actually never knew his parents were Olympians as a young child. We also learn about his experiences at multi-sport games growing up which helped towards his eventual Olympic experiences and why he wishes there were more to attend. Added to this we find out how he was able to overcome the disappointment of not making the 2014 Olympics to his advantage, why winning the silver in Beijing felt like a gold and just why he also may own the most expensive drink coaster in the world. It's an incredible chat that you won't want to miss! </p>",
