  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about 4/20 and how even though it has been vilified for years, more people than you would realize actually participate in 4/20 festivities, plus they chat about different draft scenarios as we get closer to the NFL Draft, and chat about the picture floating around that suggests the Packers are preparing to trade Jordan Love, the 29th pick, and another late round pick, for the Patriots 15th pick (definitely not real). Joining the program is friend of the show, former teammate of Pat and AJ Hawk, member of the US House of Representatives serving Ohio's 16th Congressional District, United States Congressman, Anthony Gonzalez. Pat, AJ, and Gonzo chat about the bill he's trying to pass for the NCAA's name, image, and likeness, when he anticipates marijuana will become legalized in more states, how crazy the last year has been for him, what he thinks the problem with politics these days are, how you trust what you see in the news and where to look, when he expects Ohio to legalize mobile sports betting, if he'll ever run for President, and if he would consider making two footed driving illegal (22:59-56:56). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the shift in defensive line play and how this is the thinnest year for defensive line prospects, if AJ thinks that trend will continue in the future with the way football is changing, Laremy Tunsil dropping in the draft despite having potentially the best lung capacity of any player in NFL history, the death of the European Super League which was gaining steam and losing steam yesterday, and much much more (59:22-1:36:39). Make sure you subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> and listen every day on Mad Dog Radio, Sirius XM Channel 82. We appreciate you all for listening, come and laugh with us, cheers, and Happy 4/20.</p>\n",
