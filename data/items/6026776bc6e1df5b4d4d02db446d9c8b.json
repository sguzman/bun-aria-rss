  "description": "Betty Gilpin’s performance on GLOW has brought her critical accolades, Emmy nominations, and personal fulfillment. So why does she feel like she’s constantly running from a monster that is snapping at her ankles? Part of it is she lost a certain degree of invisibility as a performer and as her visibility rises the job gets harder and weirder. Betty and Marc discuss the strange out-of-body experiences of talk shows and junkets, and how learning to fight for yourself becomes a critical survival tool. Betty also deploys an elaborate metaphor for life that involves vestibules, Patti Smith, soil and brain scrolls. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://anchor.fm/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anchor</a> (<a href=\"http://anchor.fm/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anchor.fm/wtf</a>), <a href=\"http://spotify.com/drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> (<a href=\"http://spotify.com/drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spotify.com/drive</a>), <a href=\"http://fi.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Fi</a>, and <a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BetterHelp</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
