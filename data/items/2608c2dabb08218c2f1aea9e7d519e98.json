Today on the show I chat with Watercolor Artist Yao Cheng and she embodies this principle in ways I’ve never seen!\n\nWhen you think of watercolor art, whatever images spring to mind are not what you see in Yao’s portfolio!! Why? Because there aren't many, if any, watercolor artists who are pulling their inspiration from quantum mechanics!\n\nThis episode is a goodie bag of creative inspiration and a masterclass on how to approach getting inspired in a completely new and profound way. I left this conversation buzzing with motivation and curiosity… and you will too!\n\nYao Cheng is an artist on the roster of our artist management agency Co-Loop. Find Out More at Co-Loop.co",
