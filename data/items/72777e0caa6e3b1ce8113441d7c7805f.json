  "description": "A few years ago we created a generic \"rich results\" search appearance group in Search Console that included multiple rich result types,\n      including those that didn't have their own breakout row on Search Console. This is not required anymore, since we now have breakouts for\n      most rich result types. Therefore we decided to sunset the rich result search appearance.",
