  "description": "In today's podcast we hear that MysteryBot is under development and presumably being prepared for sale on the black market. Satan ransomware gets a makeover and a new name. Apple has taken measures to make iOS traffic less accessible to snooping, but lawful snoops may already have a way around that security. Kasperky will no longer work with Europol. The US Justice Department IG reports on the FBI. And a former Jeopardy champion cops a hacking plea. Robert M. Lee from Dragos, on his efforts to educate through the use of comic strips. Guest is Scott Petry from Authentic8 discussing their FAKE booth at the RSA conference.",
