  "title": "100 - Drunk as F*#k Suck of the Axeman of New Orleans",
  "description": "<p>Well, you asked for it.</p>\n<p>We got a bunch of emails to do something special for the 100th Monday episode of TImesuck and the main request was to do Timesuck's version of Drunk History. So, the good folks from fantastic restaurant 10/six in Couer d'Alene brought over crawfish etouffee, beignets, whiskey, beer, and mixed up some hurricanes... and I got blackout drunk. I don't start out drunk - it was a steady progression. Started out buzzed for the first sixty minutes or so of the recording and then, well, things get messy. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>In 1918 and 1919 (and also in 1910 and 1911), someone or several people terrorized, for the most part, Italian Grocers living in New Orleans with, you guessed it, an axe. Or, rather, with several axes. And razors. And even an iron bar in one incident. Someone was breaking into homes, grabbing the most terrible weapon they could find in the victim's house (usually a meat cleaver/butcher's axe), and giving citizens of New Orleans about the worst wake up call you can imagine. And authorities never figured out who did it. We examine the crimes, we take a fun look into the history of New Orleans, and my wife Lynze steps in and helps me finish the Suck I get to too drunk to complete on my own. I had a great time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking us to 100 episodes Timesuckers and Space Lizards!
