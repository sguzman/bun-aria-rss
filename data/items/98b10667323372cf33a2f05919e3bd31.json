  "description": "<div> <p>Denise Marrone comes from a long line of wine growers and winemakers in Barolo. Starting in 1910 when Pietro <a href= \"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Marrone</a>, at age 23, asked his father in if he could improve vineyard practices, the family has had a dedication to producing the highest quality grapes and wines  possible from the Langhe, specifically Barolo and Barbaresco.  The family’s legacy, dedication to the land, and their unbelievable hospitality at the winery in La Morra (you have to visit), is such a joy to learn about.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/DSC_1221.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"200\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Denise Marrone, Courtesy of Marrone</span></em></a></p> <p>Denise and her sisters run <a href= \"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Marrone</a> with their father, Gian, today. Denise is a fireball of energy, and her outlook on wine, her candor, and her genuine kindness make this show one of the best I’ve done! I hope you love her as much as I do!</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> </div> <ul> <li>Denise tells us about her life in Barolo and a bit about her family’s history in the region, as well as about what life used to be like there, during her grandparents’ time<br /> <br /></li> <li style=\"text-align: center;\">We discuss how young Barolo is as a region, and why it’s important to realize that although it has made wine for a long time, really Barolo is at the beginning of its journey versus regions like Chianti<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/marronebarolobottle.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href= \"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Marrone Barolo Bussia, Courtesy of Marrone</span></em></a><br /> <br /></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.agricolamarrone.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Denise</a> gives us a full education on the terroir of Barolo, the most important thing behind the wine.
