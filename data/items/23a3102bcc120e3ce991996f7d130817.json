  "description": "<p>Today's show is anchored by two incredible interviews. First, 2x Super Bowl Champion and friend of the show, Ike Taylor calls in. Ike and Pat chat about the Steelers/Bills tilt on Sunday Night Football and whether or not this Bills team has the pieces to make a deep run into the playoffs. They also cover Ike's thoughts on Spygate 2.0 and while it might not mean much, the Patriots are the only team that ever gets caught doing things like this. Ike also gives a few thoughts on the coaching carousel and whether or not he thinks Urban Meyer would be successful if he were to get the Cowboys Head Coaching job, if the 49ers recent defensive struggles is a cause for concern or is just something that happens during a long NFL season, and Ike gives his thoughts about guys getting into snowball fights during pregame (3:13-20:42). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, 3x Super Bowl Champion, chili connoisseur and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth stops by. They discuss if it is time to finally close the book on this Patriots dynasty, how big of a fan Stink is of the Ravens brand of smash mouth, old school football, and why it works so well. Mark also gives his thoughts on the success of the Watt family, and who he thinks the best teams are in the AFC and NFC after another crazy weekend in the NFL (25:23-42:01). Pat and the boys also break down everything else that happened in week 15 of the NFL including why he thinks the Cowboys will clinch the NFC East next week against the Eagles, why he is a little bit concerned about the 49ers recent defensive performance, Pat has more issues with the Al Riveron Gang after Mike Vrabel almost came to blows with a ref at the end of the Titans/Texans tilt, explains why he thinks the Chiefs are heating up at just the right time and might be poised to make a Super Bowl run, and Digs calls in to give his take on the Bills and Steelers after watching the Sunday Night game in person at Heinz Field. It's another great overreaction Monday. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
