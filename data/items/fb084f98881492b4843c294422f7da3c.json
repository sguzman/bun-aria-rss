It's how you relate to it.” [23:42]<br /> <br />“The Buddhist teaching is such a help, because it's what it's saying is, this aspect of experience is unavoidable. And we can find our best selves by staying with it, rather than trying to get away from it.” [40:11]<br /> <br />“The ego doesn't need or doesn't actually want to be in control all the time. We just need it for certain things, and then we have to learn to let it go.” [55:23]<br /> <br />“Why don't you leave yourself alone? Why don't you just let yourself be? Why don't you see who you are that way?
