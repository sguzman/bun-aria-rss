  "description": "<p>First, Haseeb Qureshi was a Texas Hold’em poker player. Then Haseeb learned how to code and worked as a software engineer for Airbnb. He went down the crypto rabbithole and is now the managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, as well as an accomplished writer and coder.</p> <p>When Haseeb has come on the podcast previously, we covered theses and mental models. Today on Layer Zero, we explore the dynamics of being a venture capitalist in Web3. How does one find a path to becoming a VC?</p> <p>We dive into what to look for in an internal team and external portfolio companies, as well as proper form for selling investments in a credible and honorable way.
