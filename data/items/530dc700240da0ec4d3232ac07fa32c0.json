  "description": "<br><center>narrated by Chris Gratien<span style=\"font-size: large;\"> featuring Joshua White, Neelam Khoja, Aslıhan Gürbüzel, and Maryam Patton </span></center> <div class=\"hidden_synopsis\">  | The political expansion of the Umayyad and Abbasid periods brought a wide range of territories into the Islamic fold. By the end of the 9th century, the Abbasid Empire could no longer exert central authority over its vast caliphate. Semi-autonomous governors throughout the Islamic world would gradually form their own dynasties. In the eastern portion of the Islamic world, this resulted in the rise of a number of Persian and Turkic dynasties that rather than displacing the Arabo-Islamic culture of early Islam, fused it with a Persianate tradition of statecraft, literature, and scholarship.   In this episode, we&#39;re exploring the Turco-Persian dynasties of the 9th-13th centuries. We&#39;ll discuss the works of scholars like Ibn Sina, Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, and Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi and their far-reaching impacts in the Islamic world and beyond. In addition to examining the evolution of Islamic polities, we&#39;ll shed light on the rise of Sufism and how it tied the new regions of the Islamic world together. We&#39;ll call that world &quot;Rumi&#39;s world&quot; after the 13th century mystic, scholar, and poet who was born in Khorasan but rose to fame in the newly conquered lands of the Seljuk Empire in Anatolia.  </div>  <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/09/persianate.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
