  "description": "<p>In a recent talk given to the Knights of Malta, Bishop Barron addressed this convulsive time in our national history, demonstrated by the global pandemic, unstable politics, and outbursts of violence. What he shows is that behind much of the rioting and deep unrest stand ideas stemming from four influential thinkers: Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault.
