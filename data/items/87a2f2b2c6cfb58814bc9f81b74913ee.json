  "description": "Hey Thrilling Tales fans, we wanted to introduce you to another show you might like! Join journalist, host and amateur detective Ben Baskin as he goes on an intrepid quest to solve various sports mysteries in Lost in Sports, a new podcast from Religion of Sports and PRX. In every episode, Ben will explore the mysteries of the lost, the forgotten and the disappeared. And you’ll never know where his journey will take him as he chases down answers to some of the biggest questions in sports history— and some you never thought to ask. Lost in Sports is now streaming wherever you get your podcasts. \n\nThis episode takes you to 1999, when a small apparel company named And1 released a VHS tape filled with streetball highlights and turned streetball into a worldwide craze. By the early 2000s, there was a global tour, an ESPN show and a video game. But then, just as quickly as it rose, it disappeared. Twenty years later, Ben untanges the complicated origins, rise and untimely demise of the phenomenon he fell in love with as a kid.
