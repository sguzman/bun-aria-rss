  "description": "<p>“…And I had arrived at McDowell, with about 200 pages in the summer of 2018…And the great thing about these writing retreats is that they give you a chance to do nothing but just think about your work. And that was a real gift to me, because it was both time and peace and quiet, to just think about this book. And to be really honest with myself about what was doing well and what it wasn't doing well at all….” Jung Yun had our attention from the very first page of her debut novel, <em>Shelter</em>, and we’ve been waiting for her terrific new novel, <em>O Beautiful</em>, set during the North Dakota oil boom.

Featured books: O Beautiful and Shelter by Jun Yung.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
