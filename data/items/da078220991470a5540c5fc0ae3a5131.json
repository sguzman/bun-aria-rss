  "description": "<p>Chapter 4: H.G. Wells (Paul F. Tompkins) welcomes author, inventor, diplomat and party animal Benjamin Franklin (Scott Aukerman) to the Dead Authors stage for an oft-sprited, oft-absurd, and oft-off-kilter discussion about God knows what. It must be heard to be believed, and even after hearing it you should still check three sources.  Ambassador Franklin is a bit of a libertine when it comes to naughty words, so plug your ears up, you bunch of nuns! (Sorry, It's infectious!)</p>",
