  "description": "<p>On <em>How to Do Things with Words</em> (lectures from 1955). What's the relationship between language and the world? Austin says it's not all about descriptive true-or-false statements, but also includes \"performatives\" like \"I promise…\" and \"I do\" (spoken in a wedding) that are actions unto themselves. They can't be true or false, but they can be \"unhappy\" if social conventions aren't fulfilled (e.g., you try to marry a pig). Austin thinks performatives will change your whole view of language and of linguistically expressed philosophical problems!</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Please support PEL.</a></p>",
