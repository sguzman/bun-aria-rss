In the midst of a rainy, cold and snowy winter, U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant launched an ambitious campaign to open Tennessee to Federal invasion by capturing two forts on the Tennessee & Cumberland Rivers. Coordinating with U.S. \"brown-water navies\", Grant's plan was a smashing success and the joint victories at Forts Henry & Donelson made him a national hero, especially in the eyes of President Abraham Lincoln. The guys discuss the major significances of the campaign and how it impacted how the rest of the way played out from there. Enjoy!</p>",
