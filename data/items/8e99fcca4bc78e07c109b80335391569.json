  "description": "<p class=\"\">This week we're mixing it up, talking about an author more than a specific book -- the Queen of Dirty Talk herself, Tessa Bailey. But we're not just talking about the sexybits -- we're also talking about working class heroes, women and worry and how awesome it is to watch authors evolve.</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast if you’re so inclined!</p><p class=\"\">In two weeks, we’re reading a book that blooded both Sarah and Jen — and approximately 50% of Romancelandia, we think -- Stephanie Laurens's Devil's Bride, starring Devil Cynster, who also happens to be the only romance hero Sarah's husband can name (yes, even now). Find it at: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38Zqn1v\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/devils-bride-stephanie-laurens/1103371022\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/devils-bride/id363686327?app=itunes&at=1l3vpAR&mt=11\">Apple Books</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/ww/en/ebook/devil-s-bride\">Kobo</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363499.Devil_s_Bride\">your local indie</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Full Show Notes @ </strong><a href=\"http://fatedmates.net\" target=\"\"><strong>FATEDMATES.NET</strong></a></p><p class=\"\">- Sarah was heading to Birmingham for the <a href=\"http://www.hooverlibrary.org/sv\">Southern Voices Book Festival</a>. The last time she was there, it was when she was a kid going to a <a href=\"https://www.soinc.org/\">Science Olympiad</a> competition. Based on the description of that event, Jen suspects that she was outside <a href=\"https://orienteeringusa.org/\">orienteering</a>. She's going to see <a href=\"http://freshfiction.com/author.php?id=23852\">Rachel Hawkins</a> and <a href=\"http://freshfiction.com/author.php?id=35030\">Naima Simone</a>!</p><p class=\"\">- Meanwhile, Jen went to see <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-ent-bug-steppenwolf-review-0205-20200204-o4ksoshisvdddffaqpewaromji-story.html\">Bug</a> by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/tracy-letts-is-still-haunted-by-his-past.html\">Tracy Letts</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf Theater</a>, which is known for being the home theater of <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/ensemble/member-pages/john--malkovich/\">John Malkovich</a> and also where hope goes to die.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen wrote about <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/remembering-romance-novelist-johanna-lindsey/\">Johanna Lindsey and her New York Times obituary</a> in a column for Kirkus.</p><p class=\"\">- The hero of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w1zfVA\">Protecting What's His</a> is Derek Tyler, which is Jen's <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/9/24/s021-lisa-kleypas-does-spectacles-better-than-f-scott-fitzgerald-dreaming-of-you\">second favorite romance Derek</a>. Derek and Ginger also appear in a follow-up novella, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3c84zT5\">Protecting What's Theirs</a>. Derek also appears as a secondary character in the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32u87uz\">Crossing the Lines series</a>, where he assembles a team of ex-cons and misfits as a special crime fighting team. Ginger's sister gets her own book in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39Z6Dek\">Unfixable</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- The rise of eBooks made room for indie publishing and small presses like Entangled. Here's the story of <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-barbara-freethy-becam_b_5647391\">how Barabara Freethy</a> took advantage of <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2009/02/the-amazing-amazon-kindle-is-bad-news-for-the-publishing-industry.html\">the Kindle revolution</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/10-enemies-turned-lovers-stories-that-take-the-hating-you-to-dating-you-trope-to-the-next-level-61001\">Enemies to Lovers</a> is one of the most beloved romance tropes. Jen is going to talk about her whole energy theory in an upcoming Kirkus column.</p><p class=\"\">- This is a romance that deals with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/86194.Class_Differences_in_Contemporary_Romance_\">class</a> in an unusual way--she's the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl\">poor little rich girl</a>, while he's working two jobs because of family obligations to his siblings.</p><p class=\"\">- Tessa Bailey is the Queen of Dirty Talk. She just is. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1114312353976332289\">Jen's favorite is Duke from Worked Up</a>, who is a perfect <a href=\"https://frolic.media/grunt-work-when-your-romance-herp-can-barely-make-a-sound/\">grunting hero</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen noticed that several motifs that appear in Asking for Trouble appear in other books -- for example, there is a trip to Atlantic City in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2uvkTwo\">Worked Up</a>, and connecting doors in a hotel room in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2HQrWTc\">Driven by Fate</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Sarah identifies \"heroine as rock\" as part of Tessa Bailey's <a href=\"https://jamigold.com/2019/12/author-insights-whats-our-core-story/\">core story</a>, Jen noticed the pull between familial duty and individual needs. At first Sarah thought Tessa's most recent book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Tbleg7\">Love Her or Lose Her</a>, doesn't fit into the core story...but after talking it through, she thinks it fits perfectly.</p><p class=\"\">- Sarah mentioned the one with a hero who is a recovering alcoholic called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3807OIV\">Indecent Exposure</a>. Jen also loved it and <a href=\"https://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2018/01/jens-review-indecent-exposure.html\">reviewed it for The Book Queen</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Some advice in case you ever need to <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/05/how-to-stop-a-wedding-two-methods.html\">stop a wedding</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- But <a href=\"https://www.jenreadsromance.com/shop\">buttons and stickers from Kelly at Jen's shop</a> and the newly available <a href=\"https://jordandene.com/collections/romance-sarah-maclean\">full line of t-shirts from Jordandene</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6QWZy7vo4Dw9eS733PJj1U?si=rpsmW2Q9TzWtHBJwTCGdzQ\">this week's music selections</a> and peruse <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/2/24/s0225-asking-for-trouble#transcript\">this episode's transcript</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Next time on Fated Mates, we'll be reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VkQTOE\">Devil's Bride</a> by Stephanie Laurens.</p>",
