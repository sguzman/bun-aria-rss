Families don’t necessarily know how to help loved ones come out of their dark place. In this episode, Coach Mike Bayer introduces several new concepts from his new book, One Decision. He takes Tom through his journey and reveals his experience with drug abuse, discovering his homosexuality, and what it took to get committed, find a new perspective and create his best self.
