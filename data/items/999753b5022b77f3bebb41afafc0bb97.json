Today, Panera Bread has over 2,000 stores, and $5 billion in annual sales. Plus, for our postscript \"How You Built That,\" how Tyson Walters got so tired of his St. Bernard shedding everywhere that he created the Shed Defender, a zip-up body suit for dogs that captures loose hair.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
