  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the DOJ filing defended their Mar-A-Lago search and the unauthorized removal of former President Trump's passports stating that it was necessary to stop the threat to national security posed by the three classified documents they found in Trump's desk. 'Hiding' documents on one's desk is the best way to hide them and commit obstruction, right? The DOJ and the media are working together to create much ado about nothing. Then, the FBI spied on MLK and threatened him. Yet Democrats say if you don't support the FBI in this unconstitutional raid then your anti-law enforcement. How is it that Hillary Clinton was not charged with violating the Espionage Act yet a former President who had the power to declassify documents should be charged with violating it? Later, China's claim that they own Taiwan is bull. Taiwan was a territory of Japan more than 100 years ago. The communist Chinese must be stopped. Afterward, Dr. Oz joins the show to discuss his U.S Senate race against Pennsylvania's Lt. Governor John Fetterman. Fetterman's far-left radical views are outside of the norm in Pennsylvania in so much as he advocates for public drug use and has bragged about pardoning murderers from prison.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
