  "title": "Ep. 938 - Terrified Leftists Cry Out In Despair As Elon Musk Takes Over Twitter",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftists scream out in abject terror as Elon Musks completes his purchase of Twitter. We will revel in their despair today. Also, as my children’s book Johnny the Walrus is finally released, we’ll take a look at the horrifying children’s book that is currently the best seller in the category. It’s written by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and if you’ve been paying attention, you know that’s a bad sign. Plus, a boy physically assaults a girl at a high school in Atlanta, but the students are taking the boy’s side because the girl used a naughty word. And in our Daily Cancellation, Rolling Stone has a glowing profile of “furries” who are sexually attracted to cartoon animals. \n\nI am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author. Reserve your copy of Johnny The Walrus here: https://utm.io/uevUc.\n\nWhat is a Woman? Help me track down the answer in my new book.
