  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the federal government continues to overstep its bounds flirting with the idea of Red Flag Laws, this needs to be left to the states to decide. Universal background checks would not have stopped a single mass shooting, according to government statistics. This thinking falsely presumes that there currently aren't background checks - which is false.  Less than one percent of guns bought or traded through a gun show have ever been used in mass murder. The media immediately jumps on the gun-banning narrative pushing their one-sided agenda to demonize guns yet, R.I.N.O.'s like Sen. Mitch McConnell are embracing the idea of banning semi-automatic weapons.  Washington can't legislate virtue! Then, while the media paints President Trump as a white supremacist, they forgot to label President Obama as an anti-Semite despite all he did against Israel.  In breaking news, an off-duty firefighter stops a potential mass shooting at a Missouri WalMart by holding a heavily-armed gunman dressed in body armor at gunpoint until police arrived. Afterward, the media continues their unprecedented levels of leftwing bias and their blood lust incessantly reporting on mass murders and racism. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
