  "description": "<p>Several technology and automotive companies are already testing highly automated vehicles on public roads, and many automobiles can be driven with the assistance of semi-automated systems. Through the development of these systems, significant public attention has been placed on the promise of removing drivers from the vehicle; however, more limited focus has been drawn to the role of people in automated vehicle systems. David Friedman discusses how automation inside and outside vehicles may shape the future of self-driving cars.</p> <p>APA is currently seeking proposals for APA 2020, click here to learn more <a href= \"https://convention.apa.org/proposals\">https://convention.apa.org/proposals</a></p>",
