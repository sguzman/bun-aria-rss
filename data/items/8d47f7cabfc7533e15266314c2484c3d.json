  "description": "<p>Few people can explain harm reduction therapy better than Patt Denning. She’s a clinical psychologist who has played a pioneering role in developing the field, teaching and training thousands of health professionals. I talked with Patt about her own evolution in embracing harm reduction and how she teaches those who had been committed to 12-step and abstinence-only approaches. I asked her how she deals with people who have lost control of their drug use – and why a therapeutic session sometimes works better if the client has taken drugs just before the session.</p><p>Listen to this episode and let me know what you think.
