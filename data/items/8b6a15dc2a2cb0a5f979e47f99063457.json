  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Dr. Anthony Fauci and others say to wear a mask and people are complying. Yet, according to the media, infection rates are spiking. Joe Biden never had a coronavirus plan, he pretended to have a plan. President Trump did have a plan to accelerate a vaccine and therapeutics. Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito says the coronavirus is negatively affecting individual liberty by politicians. Alito added that the lockdowns also impact religious liberty. Then, Michigan Assembly Speaker Lee Chatfield joins the show to express why both parties must fulfill their constitutional duty to ensure free and fair elections. He added that there were too many irregularities to 'just move on' so they have subpoenaed some evidence. Later, former President Obama says that Trump is delegitimizing democracy. Yet it was the party of Obama that went into state courts asking to eliminate signature verification on ballots, eliminating the need for postmarks on ballots, and not allowing republicans to cure their ballots while allowing democrats to cure theirs. Afterward, Dominion voting software has been problematic in the past and this is why these various audits and investigations are necessary. Yet the media continue obfuscating from the truth. One media type, CNN's Christiane Amanpour, even went as far as comparing the President to Hitler while discussing Kristallnacht, the pogrom against Jews known as the Night of the Broken Glass. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
