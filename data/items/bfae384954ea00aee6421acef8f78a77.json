In the previous part, James Lindsay presented the ideas in the ninth chapter of that book, where Freire outlines that the purpose of education is to humanize Man and the world, exactly as indicated by Karl Marx.

In this first part of this shocking chapter, before turning to the role he envisions for churches, Freire explains the religious conversion educators must go through in order to be \"true\" educators. He describes it as a process of spiritual death and rebirth, literally an Easter educators and religious leaders must go through to be resurrected on the side of the oppressed. This is the religious heart of the so-called \"pedagogy of the oppressed\" at the center of Freire's entire project and legacy. Join James to understand how Freire enabled the theft of education so that it could be transformed into religious education for the Theology of Marxism (https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/theology-marxism/).\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support/\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
