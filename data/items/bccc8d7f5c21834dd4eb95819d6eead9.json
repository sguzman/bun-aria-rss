  "description": "In this episode we’re talking about our favorite TV and movie sets that are pop culture, and somehow they influence the decisions we make for purchasing. Certain trends that bubble up, whether it be for the home or fashion, or for the way somebody tucks their shirt in, or flips their hair, or whatever else, we are all influenced in some way. There’s an undercurrent going on, sometimes it’s stronger than others, and depending on where we are in the world, we see certain things bubble up that are maybe unnaturally trending because of pop culture, which is so influential. We want to talk about where things come from and have a lot of movies we want to discuss and the things that have come from there and influenced a lot of our clientele. <br /><br />Nancy Meyers 6:48<br />Father of the Bride 11:28<br />The white kitchen 17:54<br />Home Again 22:21<br />The Royal Tenenbaums 28:10<br />Knives Out 31:05<br />The Holiday 34:30<br /><br />“One thing that I really love about it is I love wood, all the finish work in it is wood, it’s dark. I feel like it represents the movie really well because it just sets this very mysterious, very gloomy looking feeling. It just sets the vibe.” “You don’t know who to trust in Knives Out.” “Yeah, ornate finish work, an old person who’s lived a full life, collected a lot of things, tons of books, some art work, and taxidermy. You can almost smell the house from just looking at it.” 31:06<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
