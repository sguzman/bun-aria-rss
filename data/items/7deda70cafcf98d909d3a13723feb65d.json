  "description": "<p>In this paper, we study the capability of different long-baseline experiment\noptions at the KM3NeT facility i.e., P2O, Upgraded P2O and P2SO to probe the\nlight sterile neutrino and compare their sensitivity with DUNE. The option P2O\nwill have neutrinos from a 90 KW beam at Protvino to be detected at the ORCA\ndetector, the Upgraded P2O will have neutrinos from the upgraded 450 KW beam to\nbe detected at the ORCA detector and the option P2SO will have neutrinos from a\n450 KW beam to be detected at the upgraded Super-ORCA detector. All these\noptions will have a baseline around 2595 km. Our results show that the\nexperiments at the KM3NeT (DUNE) would be more sensitive if the value of\n$\\Delta m^2_{41}$ is around 10 (1) eV$^2$. Our results also show that the role\nof near detector is very important for the study of sterile neutrinos and\naddition of near detector improves the sensitivity as compared to only far\ndetector for 3+1 scenario. Among the three options at KM3NeT, the sensitivity\nof P2O and updated P2O is limited and sensitivity of P2SO is either comparable\nor better than DUNE.\n</p>",
