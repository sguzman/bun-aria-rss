  "description": "<p>We present a novel methodology for neural network backdoor attacks. Unlike\nexisting training-time attacks where the Trojaned network would respond to the\nTrojan trigger after training, our approach inserts a Trojan that will remain\ndormant until it is activated. The activation is realized through a specific\nperturbation to the network's weight parameters only known to the attacker. Our\nanalysis and the experimental results demonstrate that dormant Trojaned\nnetworks can effectively evade detection by state-of-the-art backdoor detection\nmethods.\n</p>",
