It is the result of extensive research into attack vectors associated with CI/CD, and the analysis of high-profile breaches and security flaws.\n\nIn this episode, we will discuss the motivation behind the Top 10, The process that led to its creation, and the different ways through which it can be applied to the day-to-day of all parties - breakers, builders, and defenders\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ LINKS ▬▬▬▬▬▬\nhttps://www.cidersecurity.io/top-10-cicd-security-risks/\nhttps://github.com/cider-security-research/cicd-goat\nhttps://www.cidersecurity.io/",
