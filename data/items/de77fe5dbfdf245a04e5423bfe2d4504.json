  "description": "<p>We advance the program of connections between final coalgebras as sources of\ncircularity in mathematics and fractal sets of real numbers. In particular, we\nare interested in the Sierpinski carpet, taking it as a fractal subset of the\nunit square. We construct a category of square sets and an endofunctor on it\nwhich corresponds to the operation of gluing copies of a square set along\nsegments. We show that the initial algebra and final coalgebra exist for our\nfunctor, and that the final coalgebra is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the\nSierpinski carpet. Along the way, we make connections to topics such as the\niterative construction of initial algebras as colimits, corecursive algebras,\nand the classic treatment of fractal sets due to Hutchinson.\n</p>",
