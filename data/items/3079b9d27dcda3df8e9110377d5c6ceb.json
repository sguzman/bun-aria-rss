  "description": "For decades, those on the Left weren't interested in packing the Supreme Court. But that all changed in 2020 when things didn’t go their way for once. Now, with the possible repeal of Roe v. Wade on the horizon, they are getting desperate. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) knows a thing or two about the Supreme Court. As a boy, he used to watch the court in session, he clerked for Justice Samuel Alito (who wrote the leaked draft opinion), and his upcoming book, “Saving Nine: The Fight Against the Left’s Audacious Plan to Pack the Supreme Court and Destroy American Liberty,” has a warning for America: Court packing will end in tyrannical KINGS, not presidents. On this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Glenn and Sen. Lee discuss the last time Democrats tried to pack the court as they search for a solution for the current chaos engulfing America.\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nIf you’re looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then you need to check out Good Ranchers.
