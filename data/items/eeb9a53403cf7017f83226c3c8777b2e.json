The platform unlocks all 195 hours of video lessons, hundreds of practical exercises, career tracks, exams, and the opportunity to earn industry-recognized certificates.\n\n“Starting a career in data science requires devotion and determination. Our mission is to give everyone a chance to get familiar with the field and help them succeed professionally,” says Ned Krastev, CEO of 365 Data Science.\n\nThis isn’t 365’s first free initiative. The idea of providing unlimited access to all courses was born during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\n“We felt it was the right time to open our platform,” adds Ned. “We tried to help people who had lost their jobs or wanted to switch careers to make a transition into data science and analytics.”\n\nThe free access initiative drove unprecedented levels of engagement, which inspired the 365 team to turn it into a yearly endeavor. Their 2021 campaign, in just one month, generated 80,000 new students (aspiring data scientists and analytics specialists) from 200 countries, who viewed 7.5 million minutes of educational content and earned 35,000 certificates.<br />\n<br />\n\n\nWhile 21 days is not enough to become a fully-fledged professional, the #21DaysFREE initiative provides a risk-free way to familiarize yourself with the industry and lay the foundations of a successful career.
