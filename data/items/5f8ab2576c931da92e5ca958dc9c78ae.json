  "description": "<p>In Part II, John Bytheway asks us if we have ever had the nightmare where we wake up rich. The Saints, as they move to \"the Ohio,\" are called to be separate, like leaving Babylon, and many Saints leave farms and, more importantly, family members. They build a thriving area for Saints, including a temple, in five short years, and we learn to follow their example in building a \"great work.\" We also hear Dr. Black's testimony of the Restoration and the Savior.<br/><br/>Shownotes: www.followhim.co<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FollowHimOfficialChannel<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast</p>",
