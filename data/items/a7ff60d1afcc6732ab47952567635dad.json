  "title": "Adriaan C. Neele, \"Before Jonathan Edwards: Sources of New England Theology\" (Oxford UP, 2019)",
  "description": "Jonathan Edwards is by now widely recognised as America’s most important early philosopher and theologian. Much of the scholarship that exegetes his work is content to see it as something innovative, and closely linked to the emerging contexts of enlightenment. But how much did Edwards also depend upon earlier European Reformed sources? In this important new book, Adriaan Neele, a research fellow of the Yale Jonathan Edwards Centre and professor of historical theology at Puritan Reformed Theolgical Seminary in Grand Rapids, explores the world of post-Reformation dogmatics and its influence upon America’s greatest theologian. Before Jonathan Edwards: Sources of New England Theology (Oxford UP, 2019) offers important new arguments about the character of Reformed dogmatics and about their importance to Edwards’ thinking about preaching, exegesis, theology and history. \n \nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016).  \nLearn more about your ad choices.
