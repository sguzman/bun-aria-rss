  "description": "<p>We present PolyBuilding, a fully end-to-end polygon Transformer for building\nextraction. PolyBuilding direct predicts vector representation of buildings\nfrom remote sensing images. It builds upon an encoder-decoder transformer\narchitecture and simultaneously outputs building bounding boxes and polygons.\nGiven a set of polygon queries, the model learns the relations among them and\nencodes context information from the image to predict the final set of building\npolygons with fixed vertex numbers. Corner classification is performed to\ndistinguish the building corners from the sampled points, which can be used to\nremove redundant vertices along the building walls during inference. A 1-d\nnon-maximum suppression (NMS) is further applied to reduce vertex redundancy\nnear the building corners. With the refinement operations, polygons with\nregular shapes and low complexity can be effectively obtained. Comprehensive\nexperiments are conducted on the CrowdAI dataset. Quantitative and qualitative\nresults show that our approach outperforms prior polygonal building extraction\nmethods by a large margin. It also achieves a new state-of-the-art in terms of\npixel-level coverage, instance-level precision and recall, and geometry-level\nproperties (including contour regularity and polygon complexity).\n</p>",
