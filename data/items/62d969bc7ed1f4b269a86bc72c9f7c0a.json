  "description": "<p>In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) framework is employed to\nrealize autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&amp;D) with a tumbling target, using\nthe piecewise affine (PWA) model of the 3-D line-of-sight (LOS) dynamics and\nEuler attitude dynamics. Consider the error between the predictions obtained by\nthe approximate linear model and the actual states of nonlinear dynamics, a\nsampling-based PWA MPC is proposed to sample the predictions in the closer\nneighborhood of the actual states. Besides, novel constructions of constraints\nare presented to reduce the on-board computation cost and time-delay.\nFurthermore, a singularity-free strategy is provided to realize crossing the\nsingularity of angle states smoothly. Then, the mission is achieved by\ncontinuous 6-DOF pose (position and attitude) tracking of the target's docking\nport, with the coupling between the position and attitude of the target's\ndocking port is taken into account. Finally, numerical results are presented to\ndemonstrate the above theories.\n</p>",
