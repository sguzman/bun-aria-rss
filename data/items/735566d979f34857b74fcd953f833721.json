The setup accommodated a pen, which allowed the user to draw intricate spiralling patterns by rotating the gears. The resultant geometric patterns, known as epitrochoids and hypotrochoids, belong to a family of vector-valued functions called roulette curves.\n\nIn this simulation, the underlying concept remains the same; however the gears are instead represented as three connected arms. By adjusting the length and speed of each arm, a multitude of patterns can be produced, each consisting of a single, unbroken line.",
