  "description": "Pitt has long been the darling of the Shutdown Fullcast, and now it's time for that love to bear fruit in the form of PUT PITT IN, our Panther-focused podcast hosted by Jason Kirk (who has never been to Pittsburgh to my knowledge), Jeff Goldblum (or at least a very poor impersonation of him by Ryan), and Alex Kirshner (who does a Yinzer Bane speech and is basically the most important part of this episode). You can also listen if you would like to hear approximately 1.7 things about Miami, Virginia Tech, UNC, and probably fewer things about Georgia Tech and UVA.
