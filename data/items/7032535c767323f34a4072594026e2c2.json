  "description": "There are various different extra spaces found in homes, such as the attic, side rooms, closets, and more, which is what we will be talking about today. Sue tells about when she lived in an attic above her parents and the fun aspects and perks of using vaulted ceilings. We discuss the various options you can consider when designing a home and how most people don’t think to add the fun little spaces that can be used by the kids, like a reading nook, or a music room. We talk about having different closets dedicated to one thing such as candles, or linens, and the benefits that come with having a space specifically for one thing. Bunk rooms and game rooms are perfect to help keep your kids entertained, especially when they bring over their friends or cousins to play and have sleepovers. We also discuss creating a gym, library, prayer room, and massage room for your own luxury.<br /><br />The attic 2:46<br />Homework rooms 9:14<br />Cori’s home 13:04<br />Susan Hable 16:31<br />Bunk rooms 20:40<br /><br />“It’s just so magical to live in those spaces and to occupy those. Anytime you have a space in your home with a vault, you feel kind of like you’re in a tree house. It becomes a magical story book and you should absolutely do something with those spaces, be it for your children–They will love being up there.” 3:29<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
