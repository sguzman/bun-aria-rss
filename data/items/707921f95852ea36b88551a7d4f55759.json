  "description": "We launch full face into a new daily review of PyeongChang 2018 and sadly for both countries involved there are no medals to talk about but that doesn't mean we still can't have some fun and excitement along the way! Jarrod comes in fresh with some research about just how having a Swisse ad campaign actually hurts your chances of success in an Olympics. There is also talk about why Australia should be better in long-track speed skating, why the athletes Channel 7 doesn't care about do better, why we need to interview people who do doubles luge and some of the funniest fan messages you'll hear from the Australian Olympic Team website. Click away and listen away to another exciting day!",
