  "description": "Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm \n\nToday on the Matt Walsh Show, the drag queen grooming events are only getting more outrageous and perverse, as two recent incidents show. So what can be done to put a stop to this? We’ll discuss today. Also, George Floyd’s family threatens to sue Kanye West for saying that Floyd died from an overdose. Someone plastered the gender studies department at the University of Wisconsin with posters advertising my upcoming event on campus. Students in the department say it’s a hate crime. I say if it’s a hate crime, it’s a hilarious one. Stacey Abrams has an idea for fixing the economy: kill more people. And late night host James Corden is exposed as yet another pompous Hollywood jerk. No big surprise there.\n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member to access movies, shows, documentaries and more: https://bit.ly/3dQINt0  \n \nTune into Morning Wire’s Election Wire every Sunday for in depth coverage of the midterm elections.
