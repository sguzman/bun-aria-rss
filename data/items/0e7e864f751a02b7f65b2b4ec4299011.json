  "description": "<p>Alexander the Great, Hannibal, and Julius Caesar. Three of the greatest generals of antiquity. But what made them great and what can we learn from them about leadership? My guest explores those questions in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439164495/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1439164495&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Masters of Command: Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, and the Genius of Leadership</em></a>. His name is Barry Strauss and he’s a classicist and military historian at Cornell University. Today on the show we discuss the traits all three of these men possessed that made them such military geniuses, including audacity, ambition, and a little luck. Barry walks us through the five stages of war that each of these legendary commanders navigated and where each thrived and floundered. </p><p>Barry then makes the case that while Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar each experienced success in the short-term, in the long run all of them failed to achieve their ultimate aims because they became victims of their own success. We end our conversation discussing what these commanders' shortcomings can teach modern leaders in any kind of field, and whether it’s possible to be both a bold visionary leader and a great manager. </p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/mastersofcommand\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/mastersofcommand</a>.</p>\n",
