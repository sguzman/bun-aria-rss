  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hey Wes, I’m Ryan from Indiana. I had an extremely close encounter a number of years ago with these creatures in the Monroe county forest.” Ryan describes being out with his friends in the woods. I spoke to Ryan this afternoon. He had a very close encounter with a Sasquatch. Ryan said “It stepped out in front of me and was rocking from side to side. When we made eye contact its whole attitude changed. I thought this thing was going to kill me. I was so close to this thing when it huffed at me I could smell its breath. When my friend called my name it seemed to interrupt whatever this thing was going to do.”</p> <p>I will also be inviting Shane to the show who had a strange encounter with what he describes as a banshee screaming at him.</p>",
