  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the World Games and how the US is really starting to hit their stride. They also bounce around different training camps in the NFL and how Sean Payton isn't happy with the Michael Thomas situation and how he's going to miss several games with ankle surgery, how Mac Jones looks at training camp so far, Randall Cobb being back on the field in Green Bay, and much more. Joining the program is 8x Olympic Gold Medalist, 11x World Champion, arguably the greatest and most dominant Olympian of all-time, Usain Bolt. Pat and Usain chat about his career as an Olympian, his take on the Simone Biles situation, being one of the few in her position, his love for Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers, racing Tyreek Hill potentially, and whether or not he's still got the juice (25:55-45:13). Next, 2020 Olympic Bronze Medalist in Skateboarding, Jagger Eaton joins the show to chat about his experiences in Tokyo, putting on for skateboarders across the world, competing with a BROKEN ANKLE in the games, meeting Tony Hawk, and his thoughts on skateboard culture dealing with the drug policy for the Olympics (45:17-1:02:40). Later, the Keeper of the Hall of Fame, David Baker joins the show to chat about his life, his job, how Pat is actually in the Hall of Fame, and what it's like being all about the Hall of Fame, all the time (1:04:50-1:30:53).
