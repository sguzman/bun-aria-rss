  "description": "<p>We study truthful mechanisms for welfare maximization in online bipartite\nmatching. In our (multi-parameter) setting, every buyer is associated with a\n(possibly private) desired set of items, and has a private value for being\nassigned an item in her desired set. Unlike most online matching settings,\nwhere agents arrive online, in our setting the items arrive online in an\nadversarial order while the buyers are present for the entire duration of the\nprocess. This poses a significant challenge to the design of truthful\nmechanisms, due to the ability of buyers to strategize over future rounds. We\nprovide an almost full picture of the competitive ratios in different\nscenarios, including myopic vs. non-myopic agents, tardy vs. prompt payments,\nand private vs. public desired sets. Among other results, we identify the\nfrontier for which the celebrated $e/(e-1)$ competitive ratio for the\nvertex-weighted online matching of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani extends to\ntruthful agents and online items.\n</p>",
