  "description": "In Episode #3, I’m joined by Nimai Delgado, a professional men’s physique bodybuilder and vegan athlete from the USA. Raised in Mississippi as a vegetarian from birth, Nimai made the move to a 100% vegan diet in 2015. That’s right, he has never eaten meat in his life. It wasn’t until Nimai won his first bodybuilding competition that he no longer suppressed his identity, began to understand who he was, and learned to own it. \nEnjoy, friends. \nSimon\n\nWant to support the show?\nThe best way to support the show is to use the products and services offered by our sponsors.
