The mood is often light-hearted as people chat and laugh with others across the whole cross-section of society. &#13;\n&#13;\nBut sometimes, often fuelled by drink or drugs, the mood turns sour and can lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. This was the case at a taxi rank in Norwich, Norfolk in 2008. &#13;\n&#13;\nAnd what happened next is covered in this episode of the UK True Crime Weekly Podcast.&#13;\n&#13;\nwww.uktruecrime.com  &#13;\n&#13;\nhttps://m.facebook.com/groups/1479468325433430   &#13;\n&#13;\nwww.patreon.com/uktruecrime",
