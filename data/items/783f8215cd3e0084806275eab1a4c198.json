  "description": "<p>On today's show, The GOAT, 4x Super Bowl Champion, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, the undisputed points king of the NFL, Adam Vinatieri, joins Pat and the guys in studio to chat about his record breaking season. He goes through his thought process before the record breaking kick in Oakland, what the NFLPA has been up to among all the rule change proposals, how many more years he has left in the tank, he tells a couple of stories that define the Adam Vinatieri competitive nature, and he breaks down his plans for the rest of the offseason at his ranch in Missouri (2:21-27:54). The guys also chat about the new commercial they're shooting, dive into a little hockey talk, discuss the return of Game of Thrones and whether or not Pat plans to catch up before the start of the final season, they chat a little more about the Road Hawk Wrestlemania roadtrip, Pat tells a story about one of friends dogs that is half German Shepard half wolf, which spirals into whether or not a human could kill a wolf with his bare hands if he had too, and the guys also discuss the golden days of the internet with dial-up internet, bum fights/the Kimbo era, and AIM. It's a good one, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
