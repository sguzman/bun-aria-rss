  "title": "53: A Civil War Christmas with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
  "description": "“Our dispatches state that Lieut. Longfellow of First Mass. Cavalry was severely wounded.”\nThis is the story of a son nearly lost and a poet in a dark place. \nYoung, idealistic Charley Longfellow loves his country and is ready to fight and die for it. His father—the former Harvard College Professor of English and Literature, celebrated author, and grieving widower, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow—fears losing his son in the Civil War and doesn’t want him to enlist. But Charley does. A bullet rips through the youth soon thereafter.\n1863 has truly been a terrible year for Henry. Mourning the loss of his wife, praying for his son’s recovery, and anxious about the war-torn nation’s future, Christmas feels hollow as he listens to bells ring that day. But he believes better days are to come. He expresses his pain and hope for a future peace by penning a poem future generations of Americans will cherish as the Christmas Carol, “I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
