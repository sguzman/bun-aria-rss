Big spending and state intervention have been the name of the game, as the government scrambled to get to grips with the pandemic. \n\nWhile Boris Johnson gets ready to pack up his things, we still don’t know who will be replacing him in Number 10. The two final contenders, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, have been described in the press as “channelling the blue-suited ghost of Thatcher”.\n\nSo, have the last few years solidified a new kind of economic mainstream?
