  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you suffering from Witzelsucht (an obsession with groan-worthy puns and jokes)? Preschool teacher Mosa Maxwell-Smith tingles with glee when people roll their eyes at her puns, wondering how she might extend that thrill to the bedroom. Driven by loneliness, she bravely attends a live /Augmented reality sex party and meets Van, a thoughtful, compassionate person who helps her explore new territory: flogging, their shared organizational kink, paronomasia-related memes and Mosa’s burgeoning boundaries. #SelfCareIsSoxy #VirtualWorld #Kinkshamed #Brattiness #BestFriendsDay</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Fever Dream’ (mxmtoon)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>When Mosa Maxwell-Smith first discovered storytelling she craved it so much that she started hosting story parties with friends in her living room.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> That was 2011, before the Moth was even in the Bay Area. She is elated by the explosion of storytelling as an art form and connector of humans over the last decade, and has been privileged to perform regularly at a variety of venues, including Story Slam Oakland, the Mill Valley Library, and (always a favorite) Bawdy. She also tells stories on a daily basis in her role as a preschool teacher (though the content is usually slightly different and the audiences smaller). Mosa is a devotee of connection and serendipity and is grateful to Dixie De La Tour for bringing more of both to her life through the gift of Bawdy. She is always delighted to be out past bedtime on a school night, telling stories to someone other than her cats.</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Episode links:</strong></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pun:\"><strong>https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pun:</strong></a></span> <strong>The pun, also known as paronomasia, is a form of wordplay that involves exploiting the ambiguous meanings of words, typically of homophonic (similar sounding), homographic (identically spelled), metonymic (same meaning) or otherwise figurative nature, for humorous or rhetorical effect.</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Are you interested in helping me build a Bawdy Book Club?</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>If so, Email me at</strong> <a href= \"mailto:BawdyStorytelling@gmail.com\"><span class= \"s1\"><strong>BawdyStorytelling@gmail.com</strong></span></a></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Here are the books I talked about in this episode:</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>• Bittersweet: How sorry and longing make us whole - Susan Cain<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://susancain.net/book/bittersweet/\"><strong>https://susancain.net/book/bittersweet/</strong></a></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>• Atlas of the Heart: Mapping Meaningful Connection and the Language of Human Experience - Brené Brown</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"> <strong>https://brenebrown.com/book/atlas-of-the-heart/</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p6\"><span class= \"s1\"><strong>Uberlube</strong></span><strong>: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.
