  "description": "<p>We talk a lot about finding free stuff on the side of the road, in HTM parlance, curb alerts! It’s a great way to reduce waste and save money if you’re able to find something that you’re needing, and it just so happens to be sitting there on the curb for you. But if you find yourself driving around town for a few hours every night after work in hopes that folks have abandoned a neat tchotchke that you may or may not actually need, then you might be dedicating too much time to the pursuit of free stuff. Similarly, streaming subscriptions can be a wonderful thing- they’ve been able to deliver some amazing content to hundreds of millions of people. But if you have too many streaming companies set to autopay, not only is it consistently draining money from your bank account but it’s also stealing your most limited resource- your time. Listen as we tackle why it is we stream in the first place, how to cut the cost of streaming, how to stream for free, and contemplate what else you could be spending your time doing as we challenge ourselves to spend less time on the couch to begin with!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Benevolence by Flying Machine!
