  "description": "<p>Forrest works for Animal Planet as an animal expert. He grew up in Africa and has been on many safaris exploring and learning about different habitats. His conversation with Joe is very enlightening. To see the world through the eyes of an animal biologist is really cool. They had a great conversation and it was a pleasure to review it.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n <p>Â </p>\n",
