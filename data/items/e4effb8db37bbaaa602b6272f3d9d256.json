That is, Lysenko shouldn't be known for his successes, which are none of his legacy, but for his catastrophic failure. He was the agriculturalist of the Soviet Union, first under Stalin, and his ideological biology (Lysenkoism) led directly to the deaths of tens of millions, first in the Soviet Union and then in Maoist China. Lysenkoism implied famine and mass death, and disputing Lysenkoism, despite its catastrophe, meant a trip to the gulag or a bullet in your head.\n\nWe should be aware of Lysenko because it is crucially important to understand how the ideological perversion of science, especially the biological sciences, can lead to catastrophes. In fact, if we were more aware of Trofim Lysenko and his legacy of death, we might be more cognizant of the threat we're currently stumbling our way into under the banners of \"antiracist medicine\" and \"health equity.\" These are the dawn of Medical Lysenkoism, which is a tragedy in the making, potentially on a grand scale, and this is already well underway.\n\nThe threat of Medical Lysenkoism is rapidly growing around us already, and we have to take it seriously and demand it be put to a halt. In this case, Critical Race Theory and its perverse doctrines of \"antiracism\" and \"equity\" are being leveraged to transform healthcare away from a science- and patient-oriented endeavor to an activist opportunity to \"level the playing field.\" Further, under the banner of \"health equity\" and Covid-19, our society's concerning lurch toward medical dictatorship (governed by this new \"equitable\" Medical Lysenkoism) is becoming the standard throughout our medical schools, hospitals, and research universities.
