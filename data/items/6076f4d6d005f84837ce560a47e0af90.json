Sierah Joughin, a 20 year old college student, and her boyfriend, Josh Kolasinski, parted ways at around 6:45pm after spending some time together. She isn't seen alive again. Law enforcement and Sierah's friends and family acted quickly to locate her but three days later the case takes a huge turn when a suspect is arrested and just hours later Sierah's body is located in a shallow grave. While a case was built against the man police believe was responsible, he maintained that he was being framed for a crime he said he did not commit.</p><p>https://justiceforsierah.org/</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
