Exposure to varying temperatures and fumes can be hazardous to employees’ life. Further, any non-compliance with safety standards can cause injuries and heavy penalties. The trained algorithm can analyze and send alerts in case of any deviation and help one stay proactive for the safety and security of employees and plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h4Production\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Production Optimization and Estimation</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since oil prices vary, the industry needs to optimize its production at every step. Factors like flow rates, pressure, etc., affect oil and gas production. With sensor data, AI algorithms can generate real-time updates, which can help maintain favorable operation settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h4Reduce\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Reduce Production and Maintenance Costs</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Different temperatures and weather conditions can lead to corrosion and degradation of oil and gas while being dispersed through pipelines. In combination with the Internet of Things (IoT), AI can use knowledge graphs and predictive intelligence to detect early signs of damage and corrosion. Companies can also plan maintenance activities and avoid downtime due to equipment failure. Moreover, the adoption and integration of AI-powered defect detection solutions are economical, making it worthwhile compared to the existing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few more benefits are shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits-1024x629.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34362\" width=\"700\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png?size=140x90&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 140w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png?size=280x179&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 280w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png?size=420x269&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 420w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png?size=560x358&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 560w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/benefits.png?size=700x448&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Benefits of AI in the Oil and Gas Industry (source: <a href=\"https://www.birlasoft.com/articles/how-is-ai-transforming-upstream-oil-and-gas-top-use-cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Birlasoft</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h3Applications\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Applications</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h4Maintenance\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Maintenance</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h5Predictive\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Predictive Maintenance</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>An average offshore company experiences roughly 27 days of unplanned downtime in a year, costing it a whopping <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/images/downloads/aiandmlintheoilandgasindustry.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$38 million</a>.

Decommissioning them can lead to losing the oil and gas they produce, and upgrading them will need huge investments. Over the years, the sector has relied on digital copies of structures, known as <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33724/digital-twin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital twins</a>, that monitor the health of their physical assets (e.g., pipelines, rigs, valves, etc.). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to generate 3D point clouds and analytics for plant construction, experts can predict the behavior of a structure and assess its maintenance needs, thus prolonging its lifespan by a significant margin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these models do not consider the changes in an asset&#8217;s actual, real-life physical conditions, which may influence its performance. To curb this limitation, <a href=\"https://ramboll.com/ingenuity/digital-twin-based-asset-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ramboll</a> is developing data mining and pattern recognition algorithms to identify the actual needs through structural monitoring and update the digital twin accordingly (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).

Further, it can help firms automate purchase-to-pay, identify critical and noncritical supply chain bottlenecks, and gain visibility into planned and actual figures by the supplier, material, geography, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, AI can augment procurement experts&#8217; decision-making capabilities with additional insights from data crunching and analysis of highly complex and large data sets to solve traditional problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h5Financial\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Optimized Financial Planning</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>A better forecast of demand, sales, and financials can help companies plan their production and distribution supply. For example, AI algorithms can easily predict the demand for a particular product assisting companies in ensuring they have the effect in the right place at the right time to serve customer orders on time and know regions where to focus. Further, companies running gas stations can also benefit from predicting the demand for consumer goods to reduce their inventory capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oil and gas sector has a complex supply chain involved in making decisions like crude purchase, purchase price, transportation to the refinery, refining operations, gantry operations, and retail sale of end products. AI can thus help coordinate the operations team with the warehouse and ensure the availability of crucial parts. In addition, it can support proper planning and execution, optimal route selection, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, AI can aid in predicting the market price of crude oil and finished products, proper planning and scheduling, enabling optimization of the natural basket, creating an intelligent warehouse, maintenance of inventories, handling shipping operations, risk hedging, improving delivery times, and reducing overall costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h4Safety\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Safety and Security</strong></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" id=\"h5Workplace\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Workplace Safety</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The oil and gas industry is vulnerable to theft of valuable equipment on unattended sites, vandalism, and sabotage which can lead to leakage and damages. Groundwater contamination via leakage is a severe and costly problem and leads to fines, criminal charges, and terrible impacts on reputation. Further, because of their economic significance, oil and gas industries can also be a potential target for terrorist attacks and acts of sabotage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can monitor unattended operation sites 24/7 for security concerns like intrusion and send instant alerts to concerned authorities as soon as a security concern occurs, or an unauthorized person enters (e.g., <a href=\"https://chooch.ai/oil-and-gas-ai/#:~:text=Monitor%20remote%20locations%20for%20security,as%20a%20security%20concern%20occurs.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chooch AI</a>). In addition, automation and effective false alarm filtering technology reduce the need to watch multiple screens simultaneously, allowing security officers to focus on real threats (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, due to the harsh weather conditions, extreme operating conditions, and hazardous processes, the oil and gas industry faces the constant risk of fires, explosions, and spills, risking workers&#8217; lives. One such incident happened in the California-based <a href=\"https://www.csb.gov/file.aspx?DocumentId=5999\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tesoro Martinez Refinery plant</a>, where a sulfuric acid spill burned two employees. Hence, they must adhere to extensive regulatory compliance to ensure workplace safety. Computer vision algorithms can assist in site inspections and monitoring in real-time. In addition, video analytics from the camera feed can verify if workers adhere to safety procedures like wearing protective equipment and preventing slip and fall accidents due to slippery surfaces.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/security.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/security.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-34365\" srcset=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/security.png?size=126x170&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 126w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/security-223x300.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 223w, https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/security.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Chooch AI Security and Safety Monitoring Application (source: <a href=\"https://chooch.ai/oil-and-gas-ai/#:~:text=Monitor%20remote%20locations%20for%20security,as%20a%20security%20concern%20occurs.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chooch AI</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" id=\"h5Asset\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"#TOC\"><strong>Defect Detection and Asset Protection</strong></a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Material degradation and corrosion can lead to severe accidents and damages. <a href=\"https://rdcu.be/cTI6S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Popoola et al.

So join <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-university/\">PyImageSearch University</a> today and try it for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"button link\" href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-university/\" style=\"background-color: #6DC713; border-bottom: none;\">Click here to get Jarvislabs credits now</a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"download-the-code\" class=\"post-cta-wrap\">\n<div class=\"gpd-post-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-top\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-top-image\"><img src=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cta-source-guide-1.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cta-source-guide-1.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 410w,https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cta-source-guide-1.png?size=126x174&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 126w,https://929687.smushcdn.com/2633864/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cta-source-guide-1.png?size=252x348&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1 252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-top-title\"><h4>Join the PyImageSearch Newsletter and Grab My FREE 17-page Resource Guide PDF</h4></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-top-desc\"><p>Enter your email address below to <strong>join the PyImageSearch Newsletter</strong> and <strong>download my FREE 17-page Resource Guide PDF</strong> on Computer Vision, OpenCV, and Deep Learning.</p></div>\n\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"gpd-post-cta-bottom\">\n\t\t\t\t<form class=\"footer-cta\" action=\"https://www.getdrip.com/forms/657075648/submissions\" method=\"post\" target=\"_blank\" data-drip-embedded-form=\"657075648\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"fields[email]\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" class=\"form-control\" />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\">Join the Newsletter!</button>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"display: none;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><label for=\"website\">Website</label><br /><input type=\"text\" id=\"website\" name=\"website\" tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"false\" value=\"\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t</form>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t\n\t</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com/2022/09/19/computer-vision-and-deep-learning-for-oil-and-gas/\">Computer Vision and Deep Learning for Oil and Gas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pyimagesearch.com\">PyImageSearch</a>.</p>\n"
