  "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you do when you don’t feel like praying? Like the disciples in the garden with Jesus, you want to do the right thing, but you just can’t stay awake. Or you have the invite to the prayer meeting, but you would rather stay home to watch TV. In the final episode of the Prayer mini-series, Laura and Emily talk about the elephant in the room—sometimes we just don’t want to pray. Listen in as they troubleshoot the various reasons for why we might not feel like it. But they don’t leave us there. You might not feel like praying today, but hopefully this episode will fan a lingering flame in you, sparking a renewed desire for prayer.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">___</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of the ESV audio Bible read by award-winning modern hymn writer, Kristyn Getty.
