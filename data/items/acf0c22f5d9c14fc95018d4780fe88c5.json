  "description": "<div>Sincere Show, best known as Jason Derulo's DJ and a former castmate of Love and Hip Hop, came to this podcast to discuss non-monogamy and why his life of abundance has informed his decision to seek out an open relationship. However, the interview went much deeper and wider covering topics like fear of abandonment, sexual trauma, power dynamics and harmful tropes. <br>\n<br>\nThis episode poses thought starters such as: What does it look like to be healed? Can you know what you want without knowing yourself without the baggage of trauma? How much space should we make for hurt people who hurt people? When are boundaries unhelpful brick walls? Should we prioritize or drive for sex or safety?<br>\n<br>\nThank you to the sponsor of this episode HelloFresh<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Go to </strong><a href=\"http://hellofresh.com/lovers65\"><strong><a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/lovers65\">http://HelloFresh.com/lovers65</a></strong></a><strong> and use code lovers65 for 65% off plus free shipping!</strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow Shan </strong><br>\n<strong><br>\n</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/shanboody\">http://instagram.com/shanboody</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://tiktok.com/shanboody\">http://tiktok.com/shanboody</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://shanboodram.com/\">http://shanboodram.com</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com\">loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com</a><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Follow the guests on this episode </strong><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/sincereshow\">www.instagram.com/sincereshow</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://tiktok.com/sincereshow\">tiktok.com/sincereshow </a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/sincereshow\">www.twitter.com/sincereshow</a>\n</div>\n",
