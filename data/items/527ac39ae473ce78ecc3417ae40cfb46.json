Take some risks with the wallpaper and don't forget to style the space with good looking containers and smells, like Mrs. Meyer’s, to make it comfortable and enjoyable to be in.  We talk about the different options for sorting and drying clothes, whether it be a rod to hang and air dry your clothes or an outside clothes line.  We also talk about laundry chutes we have had in the past, which can be a fun and convenient way to move laundry around the home.<br /><br />Join our email list:  <a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />Can you mix metals with light fixtures? 3:20<br />Drying 12:36<br />The laundry chute 22:05 <br /><br />“Think about your floor because honestly the square footage of a laundry room isn’t that much typically, so I think it’s something worth investing in… And if you’re building, make sure that they give you a window into that room.” 21:08<br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
