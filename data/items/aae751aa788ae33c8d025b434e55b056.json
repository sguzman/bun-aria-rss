  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">If you want to improve your metabolic health, you might turn to common methods like eating enough protein or getting a good night’s rest. I’m a big proponent of both of those strategies, but there’s another key player in this equation that doesn’t get enough attention—brown adipose tissue.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, is a distinct type of body fat that plays multiple roles in the body, including maintaining body temperature, improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function, and more. Specifically, when it comes to metabolic health the function and responsibility of brown fat is often overlooked, but the science is fascinating.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On today’s show, we’re taking you behind the scenes of brown adipose tissue to gain a better understanding of what it is and how it works. You’re also going to learn specific action steps you can take to influence your body’s brown fat ratios and functionality for better metabolic health.
