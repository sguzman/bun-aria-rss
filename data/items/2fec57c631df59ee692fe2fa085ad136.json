  "description": "<p>This is our third Q+R in our God series. Thank you to everyone who sent in questions! Tim and Jon discussed four of the questions we received. Here are the questions and timestamps:</p>\n<p>Q1: (1:05)<br />\nBryce from Chicago<br />\nI'm currently studying in Chicago at the Moody Bible Institute. A bunch of guys from my floor were watching the Season 5 premiere, and we had a specific question for the God series: How does God's interaction with the world, that is, wanting to co-rule with celestial and terrestrial creatures, relate to God's transcendence and sovereignty? And to all of you at The Bible Project, your work is inspiring and helpful every day––thanks so much!</p>\n<p>Q2: (11:42)<br />\nLinda from Portland, Oregon<br />\nI've heard a Tim Keller podcast sermon on Abraham's conversion with the three visitors he entertains in his tent before they go down to bring judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah as being an intercession like the one between Moses and God. Can you comment on how this earlier Abraham story contributes to the intercession paradigm you talk about from the example of Moses?</p>\n<p>Q3: (25:15)<br />\nBrian from Cleveland<br />\nIn God E7, you mentioned Christopher Wright's commentary and explanation of Moses' intercession and the purpose of the narrative. Moses is counting God's consistency despite God's threat. When God relents or changes His mind, He's actually showing Himself to be consistent. My question is this: Is something similar happening in Genesis 22 when Abraham is asked to sacrifice Isaac? There's no explicit mention of Abraham praying or interceding, but his faith in God's consistency is evident. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Q4: (43:45)<br />\nMaggie from Wisconsin<br />\nTim said that people that are interested in the spiritual realm today usually disconnect it from the political power structures, even though the biblical authors saw the two as intertwined/mirrors. However, it seems that the majority of the demons that Jesus was casting out within the New Testament were in individuals that were not politically powerful people.</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nArchie Wright, \"The Origin of Evil Spirits: The Reception of Genesis 6:1-4 in Early Jewish Literature\"<br />\nClinton Wahlen, \"Jesus and the Impurity of Spirits in the Synoptic Gospels\"<br />\nBrian Doak, \"The Last of the Rephaim: Conquest and Cataclysm in the Heroic Ages of Ancient Israel\"<br />\nMichael Heiser, \"The Unseen Realm.\"</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental, Tents</p>\n<p>Show Produced By:<br />\nDan Gummel</p>\n",
