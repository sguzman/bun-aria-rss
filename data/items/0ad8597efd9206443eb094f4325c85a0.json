  "description": "<p>Part 1 - The Answer is Love: Evolving out of \"Bad Other\"(2019-08-07) - These two talks address the inquiry: How do we awaken from the contempt and hatred that causes so much suffering in our world? The first talk looks at how we can use the practices of mindfulness and compassion to decondition our habits of self-blame and self-hatred, as well as the importance of helping each other defuse the trance of unworthiness. The second talk extends the use of these practices to situations where we’ve locked into external “bad othering.” These times need our deepened dedication to love: By intentionally arousing compassion for ourselves and others, we directly contribute to the evolution of consciousness in our world.</p> <p>Join Tara's email community at <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=vr6RcUWppXe40kS0wc62R_8qMz98MTU1OTcwMzIzNEAxNTU5NjE2ODM0&q=http%3A%2F%2Feepurl.com%2F6YfI&v=Q2OuTLK8kKE&event=video_description\"> http://eepurl.com/6YfI</a>, to receive exclusive updates, events, and meditations.<br /> - Get a free download of Tara’s 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease,\"<br /> - plus a bonus gift: \"8 Essential Tips to Nourish Your Meditation Practice.\"</p> <p> </p>",
