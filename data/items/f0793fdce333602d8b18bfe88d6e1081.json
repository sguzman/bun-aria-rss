He is a faculty member of the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, the Stephen Mitchell Center for Relational Studies, the National Institute for the Psychotherapies, and the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy.\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami.
