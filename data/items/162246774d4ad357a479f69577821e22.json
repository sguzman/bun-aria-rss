  "description": "<p>The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast exists is to add value to leaders who multiply value to others. And, this week, we wanted to add value to you by teaching you how to make winning a habit in the new year. So, in this episode John Maxwell is going to talk about the importance of preparation and separation––<em>preparation</em> for the things that increase your chances of winning and <em>separation</em> from the things that hurt your chances of winning.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow talk about the things they do daily to make winning a habit in their own lives. They remind us that the reason many leaders don’t achieve the success they dream of is because they focus too much on <em>winning</em> and not enough on the <em>process</em>.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Make Winning a Habit Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
