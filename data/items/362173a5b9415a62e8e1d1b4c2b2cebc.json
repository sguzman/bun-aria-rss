  "description": "<p>Elton John has called Rufus Wainwright “the greatest songwriter in the world today.” Broken Record’s Bruce Headlam sits down with Rufus in Los Angeles, where Rufus performs breathtaking solo versions of his songs “Poses” and “In My Arms” from his earliest albums. He also offers a new song, a lullaby for his young daughter. In conversation, he frankly discusses his crazy early life and the inspiration for his music, his move into opera and his relationship with Leonard Cohen, who is, among other things, the grandfather to Wainwright’s daughter. He also discusses his newest single, “Sword of Damocles,” which was inspired by Donald Trump and Carrie Fisher, and his upcoming tour, “All These Poses,” featuring songs from his first two albums. And after a four-year break, Rufus and his sister Martha are once again presenting their Christmas show “Noel Nights” at New York City’s Town Hall of December 16th.
