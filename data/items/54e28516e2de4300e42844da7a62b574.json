  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve all been there. We’re innocently scrolling through social media and then we feel a tinge of guilt, anger, or sadness. We get on social media to relax or escape from the world, and find ourselves feeling worse than ever. Cancel culture. Shame. Outrage. Judgement. Where does this all come from? How do we deal with it? In this episode of the podcast, Emily and Laura talk through all the feelings that social media brings up for us and how we process what faithful response looks like online. The only perfect person—Jesus. We won’t feel worse than ever when we spend our days looking at him. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">__</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\">Crossway,</a> publisher of <em>Deeper: Real Change for Real Sinners</em> by Dane Ortlund.
