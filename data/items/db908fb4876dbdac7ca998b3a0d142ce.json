Nicole was co-founder and CEO of Dora, which was acquired by Google in December 2018; she will soon be joining GitHub as VP of Research & Strategy. Jez was CTO at DORA; is currently in Developer Relations at Google Cloud; and is the co-author of the books <i>The DevOps Handbook</i>, <i>Lean Enterprise</i>, and <i>Continuous Delivery</i>.  </p><p> </p>\n",
