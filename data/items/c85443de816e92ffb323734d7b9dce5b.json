  "title": "Do Protests Still Work?",
  "description": "Donald Trump has arrived in England but he's not getting the red carpet treatment a US president might expect. Big protests are planned in London,  featuring a march to Trafalgar Square and a six metre high balloon of Donald Trump as a snarling orange baby. The protests may let people vent their feelings about the US president’s controversial style and policies, but few expect much change as a result. So, while protests still occupy a prominent place in the drama of democracy, do they really achieve anything anymore? \n\nHow have cultural forces and social media changed the way protests are organised? And can non-violent protests still force elected politicians to change?\n\nPresenter: Ritula Shah",
