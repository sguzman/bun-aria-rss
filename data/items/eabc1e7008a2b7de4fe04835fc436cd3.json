You need to put your energy against the things that move you forward, not the things that are shiny in the moment. When I was starting my career, being an entrepreneur wasn’t cool. And sure it's cool now and I’m reaping the benefits but that doesn’t mean you can or should try and become an entrepreneur for those reasons. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5161316.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
