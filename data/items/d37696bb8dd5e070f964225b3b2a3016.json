  "title": "292 - Darkness on the Edge of Town",
  "description": "“Darkness on the Edge of Town.” Gehenna. The “Valley of Hinnom.” The Lake of Fire. The Righteous and the Wicked. What does it all mean? How does the reference to the actual valley play out for those listening to Jesus? What was He talking about and warning us about? What role does this imagery of fire and burning play in the narrative of Jesus? What sense are we supposed to make of judgment and damnation, of the rhetoric of fire and separation? There are so many questions and so much to sort through, both in the text and our own Christian lineage. \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
