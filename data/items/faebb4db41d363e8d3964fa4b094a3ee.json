  "description": "<p>The Ninth Circle Cult! Is there actually a group of \"global elites\" hunting children in private European forests, raping and sacrificing children to Satan?

In addition to exploring Ninth Circle lore we'll also look into the Catholic Church's history of pedophilia and also into the recent Jeffrey Epstein case. Do child sex rings exist?
