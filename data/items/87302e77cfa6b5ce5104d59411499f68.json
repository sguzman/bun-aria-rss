  "description": "WELCOME to Chrissy Chaos! \n \nChrissy Histories is here to start the episode and let us know what NATO is, little histories on the Cold War, Berlin Wall and what Putin is doing today. Chris is having a rant but listen in and learn about Ukraine vs. Russia. We are team Ukraine especially because Putin, if you accidentally hurt someone that is transgendered, that helps boost American morale and then Biden will interfere! Is Putin the richest and strongest man in the world? He records all this content, seems a bit like the Michael Scott of dictators, no?! The Chaos crew takes a break from World War III to talk about what's happening with Kanye and Kim and Pete. Kanye West, well known now as Ye, released a new music video with The Game called Eazy. In the video he kidnaps, decapitates and buries a cremation version of Pete Davidson. But at the end of the video says, JK. Oh okay.. still pretty chilling. Anyways, are mermaids real? Is Mark Cuban a good billionaire? We go back to thinking about Kim's power and let's just be honest, pussy power is real! Happy Women's month guys! Listen just try to be a good person, ignore Trump supporting Putin (yikes) and be happy that one of Chris' friends is growing up! Also Bubbas stop drinking Diet coke as it may tie to ADHD and try to find Chris' dissertation.\n \nRemember to rate us on iTunes and Join our Patreon for a WEEKLY bonus ep!\npatreon.com/chrisdcomedy\n \nFOLLOW THE CLIPS PAGE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbu7rQDxBYMsuKQeX-x4fEQ/videos\n \nCHRISDCOMEDY.COM for all upcoming live comedy show dates\nFOLLOW Chris Distefano On Social Media\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/chrisdcomedy/​\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/chrisdcomedy​\nFollow Chris' podcast with Sal Vulcano called HEY BABE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8I...​\n​\nFilmed and Edited by\nTHEHOMELESSPIMP https://www.instagram.com/thehomeless...\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/homelesspimp?lang=en \n​\nLearn more about your ad choices.
