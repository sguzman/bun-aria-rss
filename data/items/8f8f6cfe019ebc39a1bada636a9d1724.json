    "media:description": "Skip to 9:28 for a typing demonstration. \nGet it here: https://vissles.com/collections/keyboard\nWhen I accepted this keyboard for review I didn't think I'd have quite as much fun filming it as I did, nor how sarcastic it'd make me xD . Still, an interesting project! Hope you enjoy the video! :)\n\n(Sorry for the occasional crackling in the audio. There seems to be some problem with the microphone and I'm not sure what's causing it.)\n\nIntro by Kyle Carter\nOutro by Facundo Cabanne\n\nMy keyboard reviews: http://bit.ly/1TbOtft\nMy switch teardowns: http://bit.ly/2C1QGHz\nMy TOP X videos: http://bit.ly/2FmpZfd\nMy XL typing demos: https://bit.ly/2OoAW3w\nMy tutorials and featurettes: https://bit.ly/2OrkLUh\nMy unboxing videos: https://bit.ly/2TSrr0m\n\nI'm Thomas and I do videos and reviews on mechanical keyboards ranging from the most sickening modern RGB gaming keyboards to vintage hardware relics, or sometimes keycaps or keyswitches ranging from Cherry MX to Alps SKCM to IBM buckling springs and anything in between.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates on my keyboard videos! https://twitter.com/chyrosran22\n\nThe practice sentence was: \"Hello my name is Thomas and I'm typing on a Vissles LP85 keyboard right now. Although I was disappointed by the keyboard itself, the video turned out to be lots of fun to make!\"",
