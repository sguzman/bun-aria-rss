  "description": "<p>The USS Hornet is an aircraft carrier located in Alameda, California. It is named for a previous aircraft carrier that sank in October 1942. This new Hornet joined the rest of the United States fleet in November 1943 and fought in many battles during World War II. She later served during the Vietnam War and then went on to help with the Apollo Program. She was decommissioned in 1970 and has gone on to receive historical designation and to become a museum. There is another designation that the Hornet is known by and that is the most haunted warship in the U.S. Naval Fleet. Join us and our listener Pamela Ennis, who is a docent for the warship, as we explore the history and hauntings of the USS Hornet! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Michael Rogers and features Port Chatham and This Day in History features a man who died from eating too much cheese. Our location was suggested by listeners Angie Reynoso Akbarzad and Pamela Ennis.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be seen here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-169-uss-hornet.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-169-uss-hornet.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
