The discussion, which was facilitated by UW Data Science Academic Program Manager, Jennifer Cox, and Senior Success Coach, Michael Paul, examined the current job market and career outlook for the data science industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel featured experts representing different areas of data science, all of whom were either UW Data Science graduates or <a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/uw-data-science-advisory-board/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advisory Board</a> members for the program:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Missy Wittmann, Data Solution Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.amfam.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Family Insurance</a></strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Brent Ferrier, Principal Data Scientist at <a href=\"https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oshkosh Corporation</a></strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Rebecca Wells, Data and Analytics Catalyst at <a href=\"https://www.tranetechnologies.com/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trane Technologies</a></strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Carolyn Challoner, Information Technology Instructor at <a href=\"https://www.fvtc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox Valley Technical College</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four panelists shared career knowledge on a wide range of topics, including what skills you need to succeed in the field and the importance of companies cultivating an inclusive workplace. </span></p>\n<h2><b>What Employers Expect From Today’s Data Science Professionals</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To work in the data science industry, possessing business knowledge is just as important as having a strong understanding of programming languages and visualization tools. With soft skills like strong communication and collaboration, data scientists can clearly and effectively explain projects to other departments in their organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a data scientist, being able to straddle that line between business and IT is expected,”  Ferrier said. “That’s why communication is so key, because you have to live in two worlds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies are searching for workers who can bring best practices to the current business through real-time analytics and personalization. In fields such as consulting and manufacturing, Ferrier said there has been a sudden rise in companies seeing the value in advanced analytics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are tons of jobs out there for the jack of all trades, the generalist who can go end-to-end on a full project,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry is also beginning to see a specialization of roles in larger companies. Wells predicts a job market where teams consist of “unicorn” employees, or workers who are hard to find but have unique and specialized skills that can greatly improve an organization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of expecting the world out of one person, companies are starting to recognize that it does behoove them to specialize across their roles and build unicorn teams instead of that magical single unicorn,” she said. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Creating An Inclusive Workplace for a Better Tomorrow</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel also discussed the importance of diversity and equity in the workplace. Many companies have made an effort toward inclusivity to ensure everyone has a voice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wittmann said American Family Insurance in particular has an </span><a href=\"https://www.amfam.com/making-a-difference/diversity-and-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusive Excellence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> department, along with employee resource groups to support women in technology, different ethnicities, and veterans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The more diverse your teams are, the stronger the teams will be because you have different perspectives and ways of looking at things,” Wittmann said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies like Trane Technologies have begun to implement anonymous hiring by removing candidates’ names from their applications. This allows hiring managers to make decisions based on an applicant’s skills while avoiding gender bias and other forms of hiring discrimination. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote positions have also created more job opportunities for graduates and working professionals across the country. In the case of Oshkosh Corporation, Ferrier said the company hired remote workers in Arizona who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to join the Wisconsin-based organization. The company has promoted tuition assistance as well for workers in other departments who want to acquire the core knowledge necessary for a data scientist role.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DS_stockimage_blog_March_2022.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7889 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DS_stockimage_blog_March_2022.jpg\" alt=\"Group Of Businesspeople Examining Graph On Computer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DS_stockimage_blog_March_2022.jpg 1000w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DS_stockimage_blog_March_2022-300x187.jpg 300w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DS_stockimage_blog_March_2022-768x478.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Getting Your Foot in the Door</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job market for data science has become an employee’s market in recent years, which makes the career outlook for the field a promising one.</span><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people looking to transition into the field or are searching for their first job after graduation, a solid résumé and proper networking can go a long way to set you apart from other applicants. The panel suggested using </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online job boards such as </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is how Challoner found her current job at Fox Valley Technical College.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because of my background, résumé, and data science degree, my inbox blew up,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel recommended broadening your search when looking for data science openings, since job titles can vary from company to company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations use many different terms,&#8221; Wittmann said. &#8220;You may not necessarily see the words ‘data science.’ They may be looking for some type of data engineer or whatnot.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When searching for jobs, shadowing other employees within your organization or reaching out to a company’s hiring manager for an informational interview can help you find the right fit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How [hiring managers] describe what they want from their employee versus what they put in a job description are often very different things,” Wells said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an online portfolio is another option to demonstrate your data science knowledge and skill set. With the UW Data Science program, students can tailor their </span><a href=\"https://uwex.wisconsin.edu/uwex_capstones_area_study/general-education/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">final capstone project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to showcase a collection of work with potential employers. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Furthering Your Career With a Data Science Degree</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The emergence of online degree programs has given a wider range of students more access to an education. This includes Ferrier’s wife, who went back to school online while she was raising their children as a stay-at-home mother. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I find that a lot with our data science students,” Cox said. “They’re working a job or several jobs, have kids, and are fitting this in with their regular life.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the field of data science constantly evolving, the panel stressed the value of being a lifelong learner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Getting that data literacy can help you in any career, not just one that is a traditional data science career path,” Challoner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While online courses like LinkedIn Learning and Coursera are useful for supplemental learning, a master’s degree program will allow you to establish credibility and fully develop the technical skills </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">needed in data science. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 100% online UW Master of Science in Data Science is a suitable option for those looking to advance their careers while having the flexibility to support any lifestyle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to learn more about the UW Data Science program? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk with an enrollment adviser by emailing </span><a href=\"mailto:learn@uwex.wisconsin.edu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learn@uwex.wisconsin.edu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or calling 608-262-2011.</span></p>\n<p><em>The full webinar is available below:</em></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4P9hLbTYLyA\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<h2><b>About the Panel</b></h2>\n<p><b>Missy Wittmann | Data Solution Engineer at American Family Insurance</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-wp-editing=\"1\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Missy-Photo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-7880 size-medium\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Missy-Photo-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Data science webinar panelist Missy Wittmann\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Missy-Photo.jpg 300w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Missy-Photo-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Over the past 36 years, Missy has worked several positions within the data space at American Family.
