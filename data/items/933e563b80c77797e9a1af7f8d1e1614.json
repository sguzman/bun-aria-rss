  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's episode of Hard Knocks and why it seems like Hard Knocks is losing it's fastball with all these other teams releasing a bunch of content on their social medias that gives us inside looks at the teams daily, Pat gives his take on the JK Scott/Corey Bojorquez situation and why so many people's reaction to the situation shows how misguided they are, and lastly, Pat and the boys chat about the Netflix documentary UNTOLD: Crime & Penalties, and why it might be the greatest documentary of all-time. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk is Pro Bowler, 8th pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, TE for the Detroit Lions, T.J. Hockenson, to chat about his thoughts on Dan Campbell and what he's been like after the coaching staff was overhauled, his relationship with Matthew Stafford and how things are different now with Jared Goff, what Dan Campbell is like on the practice field, what he took from TE U, and why Iowa has become a TE factory (38:05-59:24). Later, after chatting about some of the different roster decisions made around the NFL, Pat and AJ welcome 14 year NHL veteran, Stanley Cup Champion, and member of the Danbury Trashers from the aforementioned UNTOLD: Crime & Penalties doc, Mike Rupp. Pat, Rupper, and AJ chat about all the crazy things surrounding the Danbury Trashers while he was on the team, if he noticed anything odd going on while he was there, he tells some hilarious stories from his time in Danbury, if he likes the direction the NHL is heading, and how different things were in the league when there were several \"heavyweights\" on each team (1:15:30-1:42:24).
