  "description": "<p>You wanted more international guests, and we’ve responded! This week, all the way from somewhere in Scotland, is the REAL Daniel Sloss (not to be confused with his arch nemesis Slaniel Doss). Spending an hour with this fine gent is like washing down a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with a LaPhroaig on the rocks: flavorful and stimulating. He’s got specials on Netflix and HBO, and neither are as good as this episode! (That’s not actually true he’s a brilliant performer). Here are five words to describe this episode: always take the later flight.</p>",
