  "description": "<p><strong>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. But a podcast has at least two thousand words in it so that means it's worth at least two pictures. What's the exchange rate here? What's going on?... This week, Connor and Dan discuss Susan Sontag's collection of essays called On Photography. They explore the idea that photographs convince us that we're expanding our reality when really we're limiting it. They also take a moment to complain about social media and Dan gives his assessment of the entire James Bond franchise.</strong></p>",
