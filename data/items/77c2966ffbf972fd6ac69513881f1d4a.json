  "description": "In Europe, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been slow. The U.S. is doing better — vaccinating as many as 3 million people per day this past weekend. <br/><br/>Some of those people were vaccinated by Chichi Ilonzo Momah, who runs <a href=\"https://myspringfieldpharmacy.com/about/\">Springfield Pharmacy</a> in Springfield, Pa. Momah says local independent pharmacists are trying to make sure no one falls through the cracks. <br/><br/>The rollout is also progressing thanks in part to military personnel stationed at vaccine sites around the country that are run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <a href=\"https://wusf.secureallegiance.com/wusf/WebModule/Donate.aspx?P=SUST897&PAGETYPE=PLG&CHECK=6aiGjWCJvyrrTn%2f81%2bk72%2bzWDeZ%2beA1M\">WUSF's</a> <a href=\"https://wusf.org/meet-the-staff/stephanie-colombini/\">Stephanie Colombini</a> visited one site <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/21/979809508/military-medics-tapped-to-ramp-up-vaccine-rollout\">in Tampa. </a><br/><br/>Additional reporting this episode from NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2100208/allison-aubrey\">Allison Aubrey</a>. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear from local journalists about what's happening in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.",
