  "description": "<p>Australia is a rugged land and due to the fact that much of the country started as a series of penal colonies, it is no wonder that gaols have become an intregral part of its history. Fremantle is a major port city located in Western Australia, which is the biggest territory in Australia at 2,529,875 square km (976,790 sq ml.) Jennilee Watt is a tour guide in Fremantle and she is going to take us on a journey to three key locations in Fremantle: Round House, Fremantle Gaol and the Lunacy Asylum. There is more to these locations than just a long history in Australia. These locations all seem to have supernatural activity. Join us as we explore some of the highlights of Fremantle in Western Australia! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features the beginning and the end of the Civil War happening in two different homes owned by the same man and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features the day Dr. John Snow was born.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-112-fremantle.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-112-fremantle.html</a></p> <p>Become and Executive Producer and help us produce more episodes:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump.com\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
