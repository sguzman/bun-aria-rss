  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt catch up with the latest offering from A24, the post-post-modern murder satire ‘Bodies Bodies Bodies’. Someone turns up dead during a friendly game, but who dun it? And does it even matter? &nbsp;From there it’s on to the Brad Pitt led latest over-saturated action cameo-fest, ‘Bullet Train’. So many stars! So much potential!&nbsp; So much movie!&nbsp; Then Matt and Chris crest the top of the bell curve with our third entry in our Malick Marathon, ‘The New World’. Breathtaking visuals, quiet, contemplatively shots, featuring an expansive story about the birth of America, through the lens of one relationship. &nbsp;There’s the cosmic rundown of the big Physical Media Releases, along with the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week! The supersized episode then closes with Chris and Matt’s favorite Brad Pitt performances, which I assume is just a supercut of Pitt in ‘Thelma & Louise’.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-14:42: <strong>Intro/Bodies, Bodies, Bodies</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">14:43-24:26: <strong>Bullet Train</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">24:27-39:01: <strong>Physical Media Releases</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">39:02-54:36: <strong>The New World</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">54:37-1:08:17: <strong>5 Favorite Brad Pitt Performances</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">1:08:18-1:10:16: <strong>Warp Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
