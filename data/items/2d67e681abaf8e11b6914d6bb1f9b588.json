  "description": "Who is Justin Herbert? Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks take a deep look at the talented Oregon QB ahead of the 2020 NFL Draft in their annual 360 series. The two scouts look past the tape and talk to those closest around Herbert to see what he's like. Is he a leader? How competitive is he? Has football always been his first love? First up is Herbert's high school football coach Lane Johnson (5:00), who talked about Justin's early playing days and how he blossomed into a leader. High school basketball coach Daniel Clark (17:12) shared stories of Herbert's competitiveness in basketball games, while Oregon Strength & Conditioning Coordinator Aaron Feld (23:47) revealed how he had to hold Justin back in the weight room. Justin's Oregon teammate, Brady Aiello (32:09), shed some insight on what it was like to room with Herbert and also how the team received him when he first joined the team. Finally, DJ and Bucky got to sit down and talk to Herbert (36:56) at his pro day. This is Justin Herbert's MTS 360.<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
