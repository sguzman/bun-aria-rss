Adam Ray also tells Adam about the recent acting gigs and Adam teases the opening to another wild 1960s TV show that he wants to show at the end of the show. The guys then turn to the phones and speak to a caller with an intriguing hypothetical question. After paying off his tease, Adam Carolla has his mind blown by his co-host as they examine a 1995 classic yet often forgotten Elijah Wood film. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nMiro.com/ADS\nHeadspace.com/ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM\nPluto TV\n",
