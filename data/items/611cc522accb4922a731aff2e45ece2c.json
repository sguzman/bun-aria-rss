  "description": "<p>In this special episode, we've asked two rock star ornithologists to answer a flock of listener questions about birds. Drew Lanham and Corina Newsome talk flying, feathers, eggs, poop and how we humans can help birds. Plus: we test their ears with the Mystery Sound and their obscure bird knowledge with a game called Real Birds or Just Words.</p>\n<p>And many, many thanks to <a href=\"https://www.macaulaylibrary.org\" class=\"default\">The Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> for providing the bird sounds you hear in this episode.</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Pillsbury Crescent Rolls and iD Tech (idtech.com/brains).
