  "description": "<p>We consider the problem of minimizing a function that is a sum of convex\nagent functions plus a convex common public function that couples them. The\nagent functions can only be accessed via a subgradient oracle; the public\nfunction is assumed to be structured and expressible in a domain specific\nlanguage (DSL) for convex optimization. We focus on the case when the\nevaluation of the agent oracles can require significant effort, which justifies\nthe use of solution methods that carry out significant computation in each\niteration. We propose a cutting-plane or bundle-type method for the distributed\noptimization problem, which has a number of advantages over other methods that\nare compatible with the access methods, such as proximal subgradient methods:\nit has very few parameters that need to be tuned; it often produces a\nreasonable approximate solution in just a few tens of iterations; and it\ntolerates agent failures. This paper is accompanied by an open source package\nthat implements the proposed method, available at\n\\url{https://github.com/cvxgrp/OSBDO}.\n</p>",
