  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a teacher in Washington read a trans indoctrination book to her first grade students. The school board didn’t take any action against her, probably because the board is run by a woman who owns an all ages sex toy shop. This is the state of the modern school system. Also, we’ll discuss the “birth person” controversy, just in time for Birthing Person Day. And in our Five Headlines, Caitlyn Jenner continues to be a train wreck, the jobs report proves that it’s probably not a good idea to pay people to not work, and AOC credits Planned Parenthood with saving babies. Finally our Daily Cancellation deals with the case of a high school girl who faces over a decade in prison for trying to rig her homecoming election. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
