  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the United States, as a constitutional republic, is considered to be a “limited government,” it often doesn’t feel that way. Washington keeps churning out law after law regarding what the state may do and what the individual may not. The fault for this is often laid at the feet of the Founders for including the “Necessary and Proper Clause” in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. But is that blame just? Or have politicians through the years simply used it as an excuse to do what they wanted, regardless of what the Constitution says? Join James Harrigan and Antony Davies as they talk about this and more on this week’s episode of Words and Numbers.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show Notes:</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.democracynow.org/2019/1/22/headlines/judge_convicts_no_more_deaths_volunteers_after_they_left_water_for_migrants?fbclid=IwAR2E_Ck8cx7ANdPWEFH-7X9IWntLGd7EHIHuF80MUgI9OM2sXDCjV49RbVs\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge convicts volunteers</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/12319-5/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Nancy Pelosi on inequality</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foolishness of the week</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/elizabeth-warren-to-propose-new-wealth-tax-economic-advisor.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wealth tax</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Oath_Office.htm\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators’ oath of office</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topic of the week: Diversity Officers and Administrative Bloat in Higher Education</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.mercatus.org/publication/how-much-government-actually-shut-down\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much of government shuts down?</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Article 1, Section 8</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 10th Amendment</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvi\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16th Amendment</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/317/111/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Wickard v.
