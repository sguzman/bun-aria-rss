  "description": "<p>The \"Black Dahlia Murder House\" is actually the John Sowden House. The man I believe killed Elizabeth Short lived here for a time and I believe he murdered her and many other women in this house. The torture and murder that took place here has left a negative spiritual residue that has lead to hauntings. Not only that, but the Black Dahlia herself is not at rest and has been seen in several locations in her spirit form. Join me as I explore the murder of the Black Dahlia, her killer and the history of the house that ties the two together, the Sowden House!
