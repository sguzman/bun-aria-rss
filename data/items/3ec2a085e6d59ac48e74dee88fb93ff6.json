  "description": "<p>We study best-arm identification with a fixed budget and contextual\n(covariate) information in stochastic multi-armed bandit problems. In each\nround, after observing contextual information, we choose a treatment arm using\npast observations and current context. Our goal is to identify the best\ntreatment arm, a treatment arm with the maximal expected reward marginalized\nover the contextual distribution, with a minimal probability of\nmisidentification. First, we derive semiparametric lower bounds of the\nmisidentification probability for this problem, where we regard the gaps\nbetween the expected rewards of the best and suboptimal treatment arms as\nparameters of interest, and all other parameters, such as the expected rewards\nconditioned on contexts, as the nuisance parameters. We then develop the\n``Contextual RS-AIPW strategy,'' which consists of the random sampling (RS)\nrule tracking a target allocation ratio and the recommendation rule using the\naugmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator. Our proposed\nContextual RS-AIPW strategy is optimal because the upper bound for the\nprobability of misidentification by the strategy matches the semiparametric\nlower bound, when the budget goes to infinity and the gaps converge to zero.\n</p>",
