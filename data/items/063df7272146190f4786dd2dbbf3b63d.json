See, not confusing at all.\n\nJoin me as I punch a wolf, clip inside a tree then endure 10 hours of Bless, one of the most mediocre MMO's ever made.\n\nAlso at level 30 there's forced PVP but you can pay real money to not be attacked, so that's nice.\n\nMany thanks to the Patreon supporters and Twitch subs who keep the channel alive!",
