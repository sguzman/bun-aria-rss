  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, its election night in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York. The State of Virginia has passed a law requiring absentee votes to be processed faster so a winner should be known by late tonight or tomorrow morning. Former Governor Terry McAuliffe is looking at a lower turnout than the previous gubernatorial election which benefits the larger-than-normal turnout for Glenn Youngkin who needs 57% of the vote to clinch a win tonight. Then, attorney Marc Elias has a reputation for litigating election challenges and successfully suing to change election outcomes and regulations. In March, Elias and his firm were sanctioned for their practices. Interestingly, vote reporting is late coming out of Fairfax County, this is unusual and problematic. Later, educational bureaucrats like Randi Weingarten and the media are lying about critical race theory and are pushing for Terry McAuliffe and Phil Murphy. Some teachers have admitted that students should be taught many theories and critical race theory is among those. Recent news of a sexual assault in a Loudoun County, VA school may affect swing voters in favor of Youngkin.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
