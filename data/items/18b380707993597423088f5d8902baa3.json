  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys take a look at a couple of crucial moments in world history and do their best to explain things as they know them, covering things like Benedict Arnold, Pocahontas, the Roman Empire, the start of World War 1, and the pilgrims. They also discuss some of the things they've been watching as of late, and realize that Epoch from last episode may in fact be Tony's grandfather. This one goes off the rails a little bit, but you're probably going to learn something. Enjoy.</p>\n",
