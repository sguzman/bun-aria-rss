  "description": "<p><img alt=\"Percentage of job postings on HN that mention a remote \noption\" src=\"https://rinzewind.org/blog_files/pelican_images/2021_10_remote_jobs_hn_01.png\"></p>\n<p>The entire plot is generated by an R script that you can found \n<a href=\"https://github.com/rinze/hn_remote/blob/main/hn_remote_main.R\">here</a>. Any \nsuggestions (you can find my e-mail address <a href=\"https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/pages/about.html\">on the \"about\" \npage</a>) are welcome.</p>\n<p>There's a secondary plot \n<a href=\"https://rinzewind.org/blog_files/pelican_images/2021_10_remote_jobs_hn_02.png\">here</a> \nthat displays the raw number of postings (total and remote).</p>\n<p>Caveats, and why this is just an approximation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The script works by retrieving all first-level comments in the monthly <em>Who's \n  hiring</em> post and assumes that every one is a job offer. That might not be the \n  case.</li>\n<li>These posts should comply with some formatting rules, specially regarding the \n  first line. The script only looks at the first line and checks if the word \n  \"remote\" is present, nothing more sophisticated.</li>\n<li>The script is also not checking if the job specifically says that remote is \n  <em>not</em> an option in the first line, or whether there are geographical / time \n  restrictions (e.g. only Pacific time +/- N hours, etc.)</li>\n</ul>",
