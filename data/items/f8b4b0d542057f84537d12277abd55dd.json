Most of us never learn how to manage our energy and bodies. Instead, we use drugs like sugar, caffeine, and alcohol to self-medicate and manage our energy and moods. We don’t connect our behaviors and choices with how we feel. Many of us get too little good food, nutrients, light, air, water, rest, sleep, rhythm, exercise, community, love, meaning, and purpose. We’re exposed to far too much poor-quality food, stress, toxins, and allergens. But even if you manage all those things correctly, you still might not be getting the right amount of certain nutrients that support your brain and body. That’s where supplements come in.</p><br><p>In today’s episode in my series I’m calling <em>Health Bites</em>, I am talking about how to heal our broken brains with the right nutrients. The brain is resilient and can recover and heal when given the right conditions.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by&nbsp; Beekeeper’s Naturals and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Right now, Beekeeper’s Naturals is giving my community an exclusive offer.
