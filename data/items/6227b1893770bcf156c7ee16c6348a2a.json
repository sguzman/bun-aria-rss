  "description": "<p>Lore, Mythos, and Grandeur — words that come to mind when one thinks of Larry Owens, his talent, and his powerhouse performance on this episode of Las Culturistas. In the words of Matt Rogers, “This episode is wild, crazy, full of thoughtfulness and wild abandon, intellectual, but physical…verbally physical! Getting a little real, getting a little funny, getting a little musical, getting a little rowdy — if that doesn’t make you say yes, then I don’t know what will.” </p><p>Larry discusses the culture that beckoned to him — Black Culture, Church Culture, and TV Culture — and how the inheritance of this culture blessed and shaped him. He performs two songs: “The Ballad Of Oprah”, an incredible Larry Owens original, and a William Finn/Stephen Sondheim medley, arranged and accompanied by the incomparable Henry Koperski. </p><p>And as an added bonus, Matt & Bowen & Larry & Henry participate in an iconic game of DIVA TAG — a queer sport where they all sing a song and tag off on the verses! It’s serious firepower! So much so, that the street light outside LITERALLY TURNS ON during the performance!</p><p>---</p><p>LAS CULTURISTAS HAS A PATREON!
