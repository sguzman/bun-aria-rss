  "description": "Robert Mueller is approaching the Trump investigation as one would approach the wrong-doing of a crime family.  And why not?  Money-laundering, lying to the Feds, and dealing with pretty unsavory characters are par for the course.  What is more, the architects of all this are another crime family, that of Vladimir Putin.  And some of the other regimes the Trumps like the best also seem to have embraced a style of governance that is more \"Sopranos\" than it is \"Hamilton.\"  Is this new or the norm?  And...in a special discussion...we also explore how the abuse of power is especially hurting women in the national security community.  Join Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare and Brookings, and Ed Luce of the Financial Times for this timely discussion.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
