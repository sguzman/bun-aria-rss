  "description": "Just like a pregnant woman’s water breaking indicates that she is about to give birth, when you face difficulties and trials, it's a sign you're about to give birth to something new.Joel will show you in this encouraging message how God uses our trials and difficulties to bring us to a new level. Without the water breaking, we would stay stuck where we are in life. We wouldn’t see the fullness of what God has in store for the future. The process of pain and loss may be uncomfortable, but the purpose is always worth it in the end. What you give birth to will be greater than anything you may lose. Let this message anchor your faith and give you hope during discouragement.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
