  "description": "Is the madness ever going to end? Are those unicorn bottles going to continue to climb in price for the future? How did we end up here? Past guest Chuck Cowdery, a bourbon authority, enlightens us to how the history of bourbon being an unwanted commodity created stocks of well aged whiskey that led us to the market we see today.\nShow Notes:\n\nLet's talk about the past and the bourbon, crisis, was it an overall understanding that bourbon might be extinct?\n\nAt what point did you come in to see some of this first hand?\n\nHow did advertising work for bourbon? How did you get it into the hands of elders?\n\nHow did no one see this coming? Like literally no one.\n\nYou talk about the resurgence of bourbon was partly because of the lack of drinkers because it led to the unintentional benefit of very well-aged whiskey\n\nWhat were distillers doing with this better aged whiskey?\n\nDo you think exports are the biggest benefactor?\n\nWhat were bourbon brands doing at the time to appeal to the Japanese and European markets?\n\nSo people are buying whiskey again, how are distillers ramping up production?\n\nWas there a surge of more NDPs and independent bottlers buying sourced whiskey?\n\nWhy do you call this a “not so attractive” trend?\n\nAt what point did we start seeing the “shortage”? or is there really a shortage?\n\nHave NDPs died off because they can’t source or contract distill now?\n\nWill craft distillers put a dent in the market or are they just looking for their piece of the pie?\n\nDo you think any of these companies will be \"under water\" on their investments when the bourbon matures for sales in 4-12 years? Especially when they have to compete with the big boys as they are expanding.\n\nDo you think we are going to see people drop off because we don’t have a lot of well-aged whiskey now? We have distillers and craft distillers removing age statements. How will that effect the future?\n\nWhat’s the key to making this trend last?",
