  "description": "<p><em><strong>Masters of (Culture) War. </strong></em>Last week, Tim posed a question to Mike on how we respond to an Evangelical culture that seeks power over. It turned into an episode long conversation. Today, Mike and Tim read and interact with listener responses and questions on the topic. How do we avoid all the same trappings of culture warring and empty loving? Is loving your neighbor only within your community, passive? Is advocating a 3rd way just a practice of avoiding what the right and left are up to? How do we avoid rhetoric that is devoid of action, or, worse, rhetoric that removes involvement? What does it mean to turn the other cheek? Mike also brings in ideas from and discusses the book \"American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving,\" by Christian Smith (Found <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo3683361.html\"><em><strong>HERE</strong></em></a>) to further the conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
