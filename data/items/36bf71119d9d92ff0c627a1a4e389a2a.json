Twenty to thirty percent of the population regularly experiences bloating. If you have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, that percentage jumps to 96%. Bloating is a sign of an imbalance in the gut, often caused by dysbiosis, food intolerances, bacterial overgrowth, and stress. While conventional medicine usually treats the symptoms of bloating, Functional Medicine treats the entire ecosystem of the body, including repairing and rebuilding the gut.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman discusses bloating and “food babies” with Dr. Elizabeth Boham. They talk about lactose intolerance as a common cause of bloating and how this uncomfortable condition can be successfully treated. They also share a case study of a 35-year-old man and the protocol that helped him.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.
