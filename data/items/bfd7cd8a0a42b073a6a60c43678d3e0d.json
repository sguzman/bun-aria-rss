Whether it’s a constantly checking social media, binge eating, smoking, excessive drinking, most of us fall prey to&nbsp;compulsions we feel powerless to arrest.</p><p>Why is this? And what can neuroscience teach us about the nature of&nbsp;cravings and how&nbsp;to overcome them?</p><p>Dr. Jud Brewer&nbsp;has devoted his career to answering these questions. His discoveries just might change your life.</p><p>A psychiatrist, neuroscientist, thought leader and scientific researcher in the field of habit change and the&nbsp;“science of self-mastery”,&nbsp;Dr. Brewer&nbsp;is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.claritasmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MindSciences</a> and Director of&nbsp;Research and Innovation at the Brown University&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/research/mindfulness/home\" target=\"_blank\">Mindfulness Center.</a> Formerly, he served as an associate professor in Medicine and&nbsp;Psychiatry at UMass Medical School, an adjunct faculty member at Yale University,&nbsp;and a research affiliate at MIT.</p><p>Dr. Brewer has published numerous peer-reviewed articles&nbsp;and book chapters.

And his&nbsp;TED Talk, A&nbsp;Simple Way To Break A Bad Habit,&nbsp;is the 4th most viewed TED talk of 2016 with over 13 million views to date.</p><br><p>As a long-time recovering alcoholic prone to a myriad of compulsive behaviors, it's fair to say that habit change is an obsession. Always on the hunt to extend my sobriety routine beyond 12-step, I came across Dr. Brewer's book,&nbsp;The Craving Mind.&nbsp;A scientific primer on the mechanisms of habit and addiction formation, it makes the case for how mindfulness can help us transcend cravings, reduce stress, and ultimately live a fuller life.</p><p>I was compelled by Dr. Brewer's findings. I needed to know more. And so here we are.</p><p>This is a powerful and potentially life altering conversation about the psychiatric and neurological nature of addiction. It's a deep dive into the science of habit change. And it's a master class on how meditation and mindfulness can help us finally overcome the unhealthy patterns that live between our reality and the best version of ourselves lurking within.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;As a special thanks for listening, Dr. Brewer was gracious enough to offer my listeners a special discount on his evidence based habit change programs specifically designed to overcome anxiety and cravings.
