  "title": "Joining Netflix",
  "content": "Three weeks ago, I started to work for Netflix. Everything has moved so fast with so many things to do and learn that it seems like I have already been here for a much longer time!<br /><br />I am now working as the manager of a small team working on recommendations &amp; personalization in the company that promoted recommender systems research to major headlines thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.netflixprize.com/\">Netflix Prize</a>. It also feels great to come to the company in an exciting time when it has just reached its 25th million customer and is starting its international expansion to <a href=\"http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-is-coming-to-latin-america.html\">Latin America</a>.<br /><br />All the fuzz created around the Netflix Prize <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20078504-71/mit-prof-netflix-has-its-recommendations-wrong/\">might lead some</a> to believe that rating prediction is all there is to Netflix suggesting a given movie. However, I was happy to find out that rating prediction is only one of the many signals that my team uses in creating the final suggestions.<br /><br />Awesome place, awesome people, and awesome time to be around. And, btw, <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/Jobs?id=7563\">we are hiring</a>, so let me know if you are interested in joining. (<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Update</span>: it seems that the jobs link is currently not active outside US/CA... I'm working on getting this fixed)<br /><br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EU1JNoF8ZXI/TjI9TqhAlmI/AAAAAAAAANQ/WKPl4DaPcds/s1600/2011-07-20%2B08.19.53.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 189px; height: 252px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EU1JNoF8ZXI/TjI9TqhAlmI/AAAAAAAAANQ/WKPl4DaPcds/s320/2011-07-20%2B08.19.53.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5634633491833460322\" border=\"0\" /></a>",
