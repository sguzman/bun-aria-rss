I use the photos I took as they are, and do not modify or change them with processing software such as Photoshop or After Effects.\n\nMask used in this video\nhttps://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%AA%E3%82%AC%E3%83%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AA-Ogawa-Studio-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3/dp/B079TKJ9DQ\nThis is not a request from a company, nor is it an affiliate (Lol)",
