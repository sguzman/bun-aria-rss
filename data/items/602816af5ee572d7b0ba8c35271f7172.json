  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Gregg Rosenthal bring you all the latest news from around the league, starting with a recent article published by the Guardian ranking the NFL's best analysts (3:54). Kyler Murray's \"independent study\" clause has been removed from his contract (12:36), and DK Metcalf signed an extension with Seattle (20:42). We cover a couple of training camp injuries (26:02) and players \"holding in\" (29:33) before wrapping up the news with some Odds and Ends (36:32). Then, the heroes make fearless predictions for how the NFL landscape will change by October 4th (the Tuesday after Week 4) involving Lamar Jackson (41:02), a couple of NFC South teams (45:57), the Houston Texans (57:50), a sampling of Marc's greatest hits (1:00:41), and the Indianapolis Colts (1:03:53). Finally, we close the show with a request for help from the listeners (1:09:25).</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
