  "description": "<div>FAM!! In anticipation of our <a href=\"https://thewilbur.com/artist/true-crime-obsessed/\">LIVE SHOW THIS SATURDAY</a> (July 31st), we are rereleasing our episodes covering \"The Disappearance of Maura Murray.\" Come see us cover this case LIVE on Saturday night at the Wilbur Theater in Boston where we will be joined by Maggie, Lance, and Tim (...and a surprise special guest) who are all featured in the doc! It's a completely different show than you're about to listen to AND WE CAN'T WAIT! <a href=\"https://thewilbur.com/artist/true-crime-obsessed/\">GET YOUR TICKETS HERE!</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>It's the most famous--and most obsessed over--missing person's case of our time: <br>\n</strong>On February 9, 2004, Maura Murray, a promising young nursing student, left her college dorm, emptied her bank account, and drove to a remote New Hampshire town where she didn't know a soul. Just after 7pm, her car crashed into a tree. A witness spoke to her, offering help, which she refused. And then she vanished into thin air. Nobody has seen or heard from her since.  Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </div>\n",
