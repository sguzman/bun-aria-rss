  "description": "<p>The idea for this episode was sparked by the book \"Coaching the Artist Within\" by Eric Maisel which Alice has been revisiting. If you've ever caught yourself thinking you must be 'this' or 'that' in order to be a creative success this might help you shift your ideas.</p>\n<p>We talk about the author's ideas on dualistic thinking. Too often, Maisel suggests, we feel we must choose one way or another, without allowing for the possibility that we could actually be both. &nbsp;In fact, he argues, a truly creative life requires us to allow in one more than one possibility. &nbsp;We discuss this idea in the context of self-judgment, defining our art style, and the rules we place on our work.</p>\n<p>We also debate the idea of doing 'meaningful work' and answer a listener question about selling prints. We both believe that prints can be a valuable addition to your business, but as with anything their success will depend on the time and energy you put into them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coaching-Artist-Within-Eric-Maisel/dp/1577314646\">\"Coaching the Artist Within\" - Eric Maisel</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
