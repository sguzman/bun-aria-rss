  "description": "<p>By the time you listen to this, Kirk Minihane will be Saco-bound, getting ready for the next chapter in the magnificent saga that is the Kirk Minihane Show. For two glorious nights, Podcast Jesus and his band of merry misfits will grace the big screen at the Saco Drive-in Theater. On today's episode, Kirk, Steve, and Mike field calls and make predictions for the weekend. For those who won't be in Saco: An audio version of the Saco shows will be published on this RSS feed; a video version of the Saco shows will be made available to those who have subscribed to the KMS mailing list at KirkMinihaneShow.com.\n\nFor those attending the Saco shows:\n\nMinifans are invited to a special broadcast of Mike and the Minifans at Four Dragonfly Dr. in Scarborough, courtesy of TJ Hubbard & Co. (Look for the gigantic penis...) The drive-in theater gates open Saturday and Sunday at 3:30pm and KMS goes live at 8:30pm. A few food trucks will be onsite and the theater concessions will be open in the evening, but you're encouraged to tailgate. Large vehicles will be parked in the rear, smaller vehicles near the front, so there's no advantage in showing up early. Please don't cause traffic problems. Also, don't come if you have the Wuhan Bat Plague. Please follow all State of Maine CDC guidelines. Be responsible; be Minifans.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
