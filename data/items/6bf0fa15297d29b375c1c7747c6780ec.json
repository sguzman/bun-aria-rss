  "description": "Our audiobook this week is MY EX GIRLFRIEND’S BROTHER by Harlow Layne\n\nFalling for my ex-fiancée’s brother was not the plan when I proposed…\nAfter traveling to Vegas to elope, I ended up leaving with a broken heart.\nI never expected to see my ex-girlfriend, Camilla, again. Or for her older brother to be the one to pick up the shattered pieces and make me feel whole again.\n\nBut I felt more for him from the moment we met than I did for Camilla during our entire relationship.\nAll my life, I’ve liked girls. Then Cash walked in, and all the air was sucked out of the room… or maybe it was just my lungs.\n\nI was confused. Suddenly feeling things I’ve never felt before was messing with my head and my heart.\nShould I give in to my heart or fight what could be the best thing to ever happen to me?\n\nFirst Down by Ella Kade: https://amzn.to/3mkpIRn\nEnter Giveaway: https://bit.ly/3nqkBhy\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
