  "description": "<p>EPISODE 130 - NIALL MORONEY & ELAINE KUSMISHKO - Art Directors</p> <p>Team Deakins talks to Art Directors, Niall Moroney and Elaine Kusmishko (1917, MARY POPPINS RETURNS, BEAUTY & THE BEAST). We start with what an art director does and the difference between a supervising art director and an art director and learn how the art department interacts with all departments on a film. We also break down the challenges of the film 1917 and how they met them. They share how much they had to learn about trenches, how they created them, and reconstruct the original land when the film ended. We also talk about using models on 1917 and why they were so helpful. They also share the way the night town set was envisioned and built. It’s a wonderful examination of the role of the art department in filmmaking as they give specific examples of the issues they face and then solve.</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: 1917</p>",
