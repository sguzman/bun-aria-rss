The course is facilitated by instructor <a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/faculty/jae-choi/\">Jae Hoon Choi</a>. Faculty work with an instructional design team and industry advisory board to ensure that the course remains cutting-edge and aligned with employer needs. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Do students in the course interact? </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Students interact and share ideas through graded discussions in the learning management system. Also, data science students can collaborate, ask questions, and have general, non-assessed discussions through Piazza, a web-based forum.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5833\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image002.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5833\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image002-1024x537.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image002-1024x537.png 1024w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image002-300x157.png 300w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image002-768x402.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click to zoom in on the conversations.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><b>How much do I do in one week?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, you need to complete one lesson per week. You have seven days to complete readings and other learning materials, lectures, assignments, and discussion posts. (If you take the course during summer term, the timeline is accelerated, and you may complete multiple lessons per week.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This <strong><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/data-science-program/data-science-courses/\">data science master’s curriculum</a></strong> is as intensive as any University of Wisconsin program—on campus or otherwise. Some students put 20 hours of work into one course each week. But that number varies widely depending on how much experience they bring to the program. Although the program requires a serious time commitment, the flexible, online format allows you to study early in the morning, late at night, or whenever works best for your schedule, making it ideal for those who work full time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have questions about “DS 700: Foundations of Data Science,” the rest of the curriculum, how to apply, home campuses, and more?
