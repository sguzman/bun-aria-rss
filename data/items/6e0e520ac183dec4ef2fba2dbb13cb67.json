  "description": "<p>Forget those fancy awards shows. This episode of Brains On is exploding with the stars. Find out how each of us is related to these beautifully bright beacons. Plus, we’ll consider what happens when gravity weighs down on a star over millions, and even billions, of years. We’ll also meet a star detective, who was able to witness an exploding star (aka supernova). All that and a stellar, new Mystery Sound to tickle your ears. Now, let’s blast off!!!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"https://Indeed.com/BRAINSON\" class=\"default\">Indeed.com/BRAINSON</a>)</p>\n<p>Interlochen Center for the Arts (<a href=\"https://Interlochen.org/brainson\" class=\"default\">Interlochen.org/brainson</a> Promo code: SAVE10)</p>\n<p>Staples (<a href=\"https://Staplesconnect.com/printbig\" class=\"default\">Staplesconnect.com/printbig</a>)</p>\n<p>Insect Lore (<a href=\"https://Insectlore.com\" class=\"default\">Insectlore.com</a>)</p>\n<p>Shopify (<a href=\"https://Shopify.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">Shopify.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
