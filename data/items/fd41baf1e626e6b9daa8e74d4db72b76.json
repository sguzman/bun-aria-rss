  "description": "Jon Karl's first interview with Donald Trump was 27 years ago. Looking back, he is surprised by how little Trump has changed. It's a striking observation when seen in light of the chaos and controversy of the final year of the Trump presidency. Karl's new book on that final year sheds new, often shocking light, not just on how Team Trump oversaw the mishandling of the COVID epidemic and later the cultivation of the Big Lie and an attempted coup against the United States government. It also, underscores the risks that a second Trump term could have brought with it...and might still bring. We have an in-depth conversation with Karl about the book, its revelations and his sense of whether or not Trump will be a viable candidate in 2024. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
