  "description": "<p>Oakland County Child Killer ////// 28</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.truecrimegarage.com\">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a></p>\n<p>February 15th, 1976 boys and girls started to go missing just north of Detroit in Oakland County Michigan. Police and investigators suspected 7 children and young adults had been abducted and held captive for 4-19 days and then laid out neatly near businesses and houses. The Oakland County Child Killer was also nicknamed the Babysitter because the kids appeared to have been well taken care of and well fed while being held captive. This unknown serial killer even washed and pressed the victim's cloths and bathed them before discarding the bodies. This person was never caught but it goes a lot further than that. Nic & the Captain gather once again in the garage and discuss this tragic case including lots of little known information that may help to shed some light on one of America's most famous cold cases. Beer of the week: Two Hearted Ale by Bell's Brewing Inc. Garage Grade: 4 1/2 bottle caps out of 5 Cheers, Nic & The Captain</p><p><a href=\"https://truecrimegarage.com/home\">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>\n",
