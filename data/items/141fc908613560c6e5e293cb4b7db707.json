  "description": "<p>Barbara Maier Gustern was shoved from behind outside her Chelsea residence. Friends found the well-known and beloved voice coach in the apartment lobby covered in blood. A bicyclist spotted the injured 87-year-old on the street and brought her in. Gustern hit her head during the attack and was taken to a hospital for medical treatment. She ultimately passed away from her injuries after being placed on life support. Now, a New York woman is facing manslaughter charges. Police released security footage of the incident, which showed Lauren Pazienza reportedly shoving Gustern before running away. Police, also say the suspect returned to watch, as the victim was carried away by ambulance. Police had been looking for Pazienza for weeks when she arrived at the police station Tuesday with her lawyer and turned herself in. Pazienza reportedly hid at her parents’ house. So far, no motive for the attack is known.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Troy Slaten - Los Angeles Criminal Defense Attorney, Slaten Lawyers, APC, Twitter @TroySlaten</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, (Atlanta GA) www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Dr. Kendall Crowns – Chief Medical Examiner Tarrant County (Ft Worth), Lecturer: University of Texas and Texas A&M, Affiliated Faculty: University of Texas Medical Branch</li>\n<li>Paul Szych Former Police Commander (Albuquerque, NM), Author: \"StopHimFromKillingThem\" on Amazon Kindle, StopHimFromKillingThem.com, Twitter: @WorkplaceThreat</li>\n<li>Rebecca Rosenberg - Fox News Digital Crime Reporter, Author: \"At Any Cost\", RebeccaFayeRosenberg.com, Twitter: @ReRosenberg</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
