Their conversation was recorded in Florence on the 23rd of June. Michael is a Bruegel Senior Fellow and also Academic Director of the Masters in European Public Policy at the John Hopkins University in Bologna. </div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Michael told him about his experience locally in Bologna and they discussed the impact of the pandemic on various levels of government and the future of Europe. <br>\n<br>\nGiuseppe gave Michael some insight about the journey and reveals which border was the only one on the trip where the crew were asked to produce papers. </div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
