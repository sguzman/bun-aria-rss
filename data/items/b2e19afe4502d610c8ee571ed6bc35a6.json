  "description": "Drew and Mark pickup on their diet discussion from the most recent episode but pivoting slightly to discuss Drew's workout routine and what he's done to recover from his 'incident'. Drew reveals that he has been working out for long periods of time each day with nearly an hour of running and 45 minutes of weights. They also pick up on something Dr. Drew said in a previous show about masks possibly not being effective and they drill down on what that really means in a practical sense for doctors and the public at large. They also review the comments made at a County USC town hall where Paul Holtom was speaking very frankly about his hospital's experience surrounding Covid and potential reinstatement of mask mandates. They also discuss aging and their respective hopes for how long they would like to live.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nBlindsGalore.com let them know we sent you",
