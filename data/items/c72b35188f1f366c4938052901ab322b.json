  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that recovery from Petya/Nyetya/NotPetya proceeds—and it's not ransomware. Ukraine says Russia's responsible. US warnings of cyberattacks on nuclear power plants may have been premature. NATO members consider when to invoke Article 5 in cyberspace. Islamist inspiration and other political discontents continue to prompt content screening in Europe. Europe is also in punitive mood with respect to regulation. Kaspersky says it will show the US its source code if that's the cost of doing business. Markus Rauschecker from UMD CHHS describes a novel use of kidnapping insurance. And, hey, Lords and Commons: that's not really Windows support asking for your password.",
