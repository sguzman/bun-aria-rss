  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we are in the midst of an American cold war, where the forces of tyranny battle with forces of liberty using the legal system, public schools, the government, and the media to advance their agenda. Former President Trump filed a motion against the government citing that politics can't be allowed to influence legal proceedings. It's clear that Trump is being targeted because he is the clear front-runner for the 2024 presidential election. The government's failure to provide a detailed inventory of documents taken in the unconstitutional raid where Trump's fourth amendment rights were violated by a politicized FBI and magistrate judge. Then, the Democrat Party hates this country and full of dirty tricks that they pull off in plain sight via the media. Isn't it strange that some conservatives are more against Oz than they're against radical progressive John Fetterman? Later, Fauci is retiring but will he be taking any documents with him? Of course, leftists within the media like Carl Bernstein won't even ask. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
