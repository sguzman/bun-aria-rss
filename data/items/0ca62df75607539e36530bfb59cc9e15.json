He has a lot to teach us about Hungarian wine – its history, its geography, its grapes, its wines, and its future, which he is helping drive.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.heimann.hu/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/ZOLTAN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"284\" /></a></p> <p> </p> <p>A few things for clarification:</p> <ul> <li>When Zoltán refers to small winemakers, he refers to them as a <em><strong>Hobby Industry.</strong></em> Because of the recording, it’s a bit hard to understand.

It can be like limes and oranges, smoky, even spicy, and quite acidic – the challenge is to tame the acidity through good vineyard practices and proper winemaking that doesn’t cover the essence of the grape (i.e., no oak)<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Hárslevelű (HARSH-levalew):</strong> The name means “linden leaf”, a plant that smells like honey, smoke, and pears. Zoltán explains that Hárslevelű is like a smoother, softer version of Furmint <br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Juhfark (YOU-fark):</strong> A novelty that is made mainly in Somlo (Showm-LO), in the northwestern (ish – kind of central northwestern) area of the country, we’ll see more in export markets than they will in Hungary. The volcanic soil here makes the wines smoky, ash-like, and minerally…with just a little moodiness that only a volcanic soil can express<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Olaszrizling (said how it’s spelled):</strong> Also known as Welshriesling, the grape has traditionally been a neutral, workhorse grape for bulk whites. Zoltán says there are more and more producers getting great flavors from this grape, so it’s one to watch.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul> <li>Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and other international varieties are also cultivated</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Reds: <ul> <li><strong>Kékfrankos (cake-FRAHN-kosh):</strong> Blaufränkish in Austria, this is the main component in Bull’s Blood of Eger and the grape that Heimann is concentrating on as a uniquely Hungarian expression of the grape – spicy, intense and interesting<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Kadarka (said how it’s spelled):</strong> Zoltán explains that this is a very difficult grape to grow. Two in 10 years the harvest will go badly. The grape has big bunches and is prone to rot. It takes so much to grow that most vintners have no use for it. Heimann is one of the premier producers of Kadarka and aim to make an international reputation for this Pinot Noir-like grape</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width= \"357\" height=\"230\" /></p> <p>We move to the major wine regions</p> <ul> <li>In the northeast/Upper Hungary: Tokaj, Eger <ul> <li><strong>Tokaji:</strong> The dry and sweet (Tokaji aszú, Tokaji eszencia) of Furmint, Hárslevelű<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Eger:</strong> Basalt/volcanic soil with loess can create excellent wines. The red blends are called Egri Bikavér or Bull’s Blood, the newer white blends (dreamed up in recent years as a marketing idea in the region) made of muscat and native grapes called Egri Csillag (EGG-ree chee-laug), known as “the Star of Eger”<br /> <br /></li> </ul> </li> <li>Near Lake Balaton: Somló, Badacsony</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Image: Balaton, the largest lake in Europe</span></em></p> <ul> <li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> <ul> <li><strong>Somló (showm-LOW):</strong> Made of the smoky white Juhfark and other native whites<br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Badacsony:</strong> Known for fuller bodied, minerally whites with good acidity.
