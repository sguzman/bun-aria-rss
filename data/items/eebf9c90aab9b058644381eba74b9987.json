He left that day with some of his belongings and then disappeared. Michael’s family became alarmed when they couldn’t reach him. About a week later, Michael’s car was found abandoned at Hueston Woods State Park, a place Michael was known to frequent. Most of Michael’s belongings were left behind. However, his wallet and keys were also missing. Extensive searches of the park have been conducted, but no trace of Michael has ever been found.
