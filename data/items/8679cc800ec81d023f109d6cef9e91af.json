  "description": "<p>As the climate has changed, winegrowers have initiated the hunt for places where natural acidity and lightness can shine in the glass. Warmer years mean we can't always rely on our standbys -- Sancerre, Chablis, Chinon, and other wines from northern climes -- to have a balance of lighter alcohol and excellent acidity. People are seeking answers in many places -- some add artificial acidity or use technology for balance, some seek higher altitudes, and some higher latitudes. In this show we deal with the latter. </p> <p> </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/512px-France_Pays_bretons_map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"362\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><a href= \"%3Chttps:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0%3E\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Map: Mikael Bodlore-Penlaez, CC BY-SA 4.0 , via Wikimedia Commons</a><br /> (notice the Pays Nantais, part of Loire Wine Region, in the lower right...)</span></p> <p> </p> <p>Following a prologue from me about the wines of Scandinavia, which is, in fact<em>, a thing,</em> journalist Barnaby Eales of show <a href= \"https://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/ep-327-wine-ingredient-labeling-pushes-forward-in-the-eu-with-barnaby-eales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">327 (EU Ingredient Labeling)</a> joins again to discuss <a href= \"https://www.wine-business-international.com/wine/styles-regions/cool-breizh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his latest article from Meininger's Wine Business International \"Cool Breizh\", about the new trend towards winegrowing in the northwestern area of Brittany, France.</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Frankly, my introduction and our conversation are a bit surreal to think about, but this is the new reality and we need to be open to what is coming next as traditional regions warm and we seek to maintain food friendly, balanced wines in our fridges.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Scandinavia.jpg\" alt= \"\" width=\"406\" height=\"359\" /></p> <p>In my intro, I discuss wines mainly of Scania, Sweden and I mention the PDO of Dons, Denmark, the EU's northernmost protected wine region.
