If you don’t know what UCLA is, it’s a college here in Los Angeles and one of our subscribers who reached out to us is not only a student at UCLA but is also one of the leaders of a club called Creative labs. His name is Rohan Kumar and he asked us to come speak at creative labs. Creative Labs is an organization that aims to bring students together on collaborative projects, workshops and industry-orientated speakers at the intersection of technology and creativity. This is our first live podcast episode - tweet at us and let us know what you think about the format @colinansamir",
