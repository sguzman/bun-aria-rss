  "description": "The Marginalized Majority: Claiming Our Power in a Post-Truth America (Melville House, 2018) offers a roadmap to reeling progressives, delivers a searing critique of cynical pragmatism and defends identity politics as a galvanizing force for positive social change. Journalist Onnesha Roychoudhuri shares personal stories of how her identity shaped her political perspectives and argues that such experiences are beneficial to building broad and unifying coalitions. She challenges the notion that Democrats should downplay matters involving race in a quest to woo white Donald Trump voters. Roychoudhuri defends the tactics of mass protest against those who think confrontation by the left inadvertently serves the interests on the right. But she also counsels dissidents not to shy away from an embrace of “America,” and instead, take ownership of the nation and the responsibility of defining American ideals.\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News among other publications. He is author of Wait! Don’t Move to Canada, published by Rodale in 2006.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
