  "description": "<p>This episode I talk to the love of my life, comedian and husband Tom Segura. We usually talk about farts while podcasting, so this is a little bit weird. We discuss the idea of the Other and whether or not you can really know another person. I mean, I think I know Tom, but he really enjoys shows about murder...We explore Martin Buber's idea of I-Thou vs I-It relationships. What does it mean to really love someone? Does it mean you love them even when you don't feel like it? Sometimes...You'll just have to listen to find out. </p>\n",
