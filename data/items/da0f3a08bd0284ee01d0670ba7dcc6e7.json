  "description": "<p>Meditation: Inhabiting Our Body, Realizing Wholeness (2018-03-14) - Awakening awareness in the body is the portal to resting in boundless and dynamic presence. This guided practice scans the body from feet up, and helps us inhabit all parts of our body. As we open to the aliveness and space inside the body, we discover a permeability that allows us to inhabit the universe of aliveness and space, form and formlessness. With this homecoming to whole beingness is an intrinsic experience of freedom.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation: \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\" when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
