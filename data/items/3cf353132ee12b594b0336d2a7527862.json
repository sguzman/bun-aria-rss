  "title": "Turning Enneagram Mumbo-Jumbo into insightful leadership at CDIC",
  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we talk to a leader whose innovative thinking has contributed to the Canadian banking system being the envy of the world.  Mike Mercer is the Chief Data and Insurance Officer at the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), a federal crown corporation that provides deposit insurance for potential bank failures. </p><p>In this interview Mike discusses how learning about his Enneagram Type was instrumental in helping him grow as a leader.  </p><p>Mike’s executive coach, Heather Marasse, and her team at Trilogy Effect utilize the Enneagram framework which identifies nine distinct leadership Types. Through this lens, people can become aware of their own automatic patterns of seeing and reacting to situations and are equipped to be more intentional in the way they lead their organizations.</p><p>“I'm an Enneagram Type 5, the Detached Observer,” Mike explains. “I remember the first time I was introduced to it, I thought it was just mumbo-jumbo. My natural reaction was to stand back and analyze it from all angles. I was hesitant at first, but it’s been a very helpful tool for me as a leader, as a professional, and as a person to understand my leadership style, personality and even my blind spots.” </p><h2>Enneagram for team building</h2><p>The Enneagram system allows Mike and his team the opportunity to get to know one another better as each of them explores their own core motivations and inherent gifts as leaders.</p><p>Heather explains: “We work with Mike and his team to initiate important conversations to clarify roles and build relationships. It helps people get to know each other better and learn about how each of them likes to work. They learn how each other tends to operate, what they need, how they work under stress and how to help one another. These sessions are always quite informal, and these days we hold them virtually via Zoom.”</p><p>In this podcast episode Mike shares his leadership journey and talks about CDIC’s unique work culture and how it differs from many financial and banking organizations. He explains how the pandemic is changing the workplace and how it is influencing his leadership style.  Listen and learn about:</p><ul><li>What the future of work post pandemic looks like </li><li>How the Enneagram Type 5s are as leaders</li><li>Why CDIC has so many women in leadership roles</li><li>What is the Enneagram framework’s role in leadership development? </li></ul><p>Links to helpful resources and information about some of the tools and concepts mentioned on the show: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/enneagram5\">Detached and Observant: Meet the Enneagram Type 5 Leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram to become a better leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/the-coach-is-in\">How virtual leadership coaching works</a></li><li><a href=\"https://trilogyeffect.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f3bb4d65509a4554061667986&id=bc6ea99e78\">Trilogy Effect’s free newsletter full of leadership development advice and practical tips.</a></li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
