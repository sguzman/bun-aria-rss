  "description": "<p>Hoda sits down with former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho, creator of Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man. Emmanuel shares how he found his calling – not in his strength on the football field – but with the power of listening and sharing the stories of others, first online and then with a best-selling book. Released by five pro teams in five years, Emmanuel learned the true meaning of perseverance. And just like all of us, he’s faced rejection, criticism, and moments of uncertainty. But as Emmanuel puts it, having a setback isn’t failing, it’s falling: and if you can get back up, you win.</p>\n",
