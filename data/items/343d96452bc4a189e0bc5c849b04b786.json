  "description": "<p>It’s NFL draft week and we have wide receiver standouts Jarvis Landry and Stefon Diggs joining the show to talk everything from growing up as the men of the household to personal draft day experiences to being in the league now.<br /><br />Fred starts the conversation off by asking the guys to share  advice to the young guys going through the draft process this week. Diggs is quick to answer sayings it’s nice to be a first round pick but when the smoke clears, it doesn’t really matter when your name is called, it matters what you do when you are in the league.  <br /><br />Both star wide receivers share their draft experiences which aren’t as joyous as most people think they would be. Diggs recounts how many teams passed him up which gave him a chip on his shoulder that since has motivated him everyday.  Similarly, Landry felt a little slighted too but more embarrassed that he was ready to hear his name called on the first day and felt he did everything right to have that happen. Fred and Brandon run off a list of guys drafted before Jarvis and Diggs many of the names who aren't even in the league anymore, which further proves the point, it doesn't matter how you get there, it matters how you stay there. <br /><br />Going back to earlier years, Diggs opens up and shares the emotional and powerful journey of losing his father at a young age and how he stepped into that father role for his younger siblings. Reading a letter he penned on draft night to his young brother brings the guys to tears and the raw emotion is quickly masked by laughter as Brandon makes the joke how they all like to cry on this show from time to time but Diggs laughs his tears away as he says he can’t let people see him like that. <br /><br />Jarvis paints a picture of what it was like growing up in a small town without a dad and how much his mother sacrificed to make a life for him and his family. Having first generation wealth is not something either one takes lightly and have tried to pave a similar path for their siblings. Jarvis sheds light on starting a family business and keeping everything within the walls of the people he trusts. <br /><br />Chef Nancie comments on how hard she always sees Jarvis and Diggs working out and respects the commitment to their craft and Brandon gifts Chef with some presents from the guys in appreciation of always taking care of them. Ragging on Channing’s fashion sense, Diggs and Brandon have a fun moment of mocking his mulberry colored pants while Fred asks Jarvis how he was feeling when he found out Odell Beckham was joining his team, and the behind the scenes conversations of that transaction. <br /><br />Ending the show on importance of Testicular Cancer Awareness month, Channing catches the two receivers off-guard asking if they Manscape which spirals into a funny moment between the guys on set. <br /><br />I Am Athlete podcast is candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former <b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover. Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.<br /><br /><b>A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.</b><br /><br />I AM ATHLETE is a thought provoking and in-depth podcast that offers multiple perspectives<br />on subjects ranging from sports to controversial topics to fashion to lifestyle covering all cultural conversations and building a platform to educate but encourage viewers to engage.<br /><br />I Am Athlete is filmed at Botaniko Weston.
