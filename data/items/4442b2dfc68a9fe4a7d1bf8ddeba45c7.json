  "description": "<p><em>On Colours</em> (American English: On Colors, Greek: ΠΕΡΙ ΧΡΩΜΑΤΩΝ, Latin: DE COLORIBUS) may not have been written by Aristotle. Theophrastus or Strato who were the second and third scholarchs of the Lyceum (ΛΥΚΕΙΟΝ) may have been the actual author. The writer emphasizes the use of observation to confirm his or her theories regarding the mechanisms causing colour and colour change in elements, plants and animals. Translated by Thomas Loveday & Edward Forster. Read in English for LibriVox by Geoffrey Edwards. Painting: <em>Comtesse d'Haussonville</em> by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.</p>",
