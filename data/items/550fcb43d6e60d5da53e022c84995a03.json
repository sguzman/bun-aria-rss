  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is Burn Down the Night by Molly O’Keefe\n\n Narrated by Lee Samuels & Samantha Brentmoor\n\nThe only thing that matters to me is rescuing my sister from the drug-cooking cult that once enslaved us both. I’ve run cons my whole life, and I’ll use my body to get whatever I need. Max Daniels is the last connection I have to that world, the one person reckless enough to get involved. Besides, now that his brothers have turned on him, he needs me too.\n\nThe deal was supposed to be simple: a place to hide in exchange for rescuing my sister. Now he’s my prisoner. Totally at my mercy. But I’m the one captivated. Enthralled. Doing everything he asks of me until I’m not sure who’s in control.\n\nWe both crave the heat. The more it hurts, the better. But what if Max wants a different life now, to leave the game...to love me? I thought I knew better than to get burned. Now I’m in too deep to pull away. And the crazy thing is...I don’t want to.\n\nBurn Down the Night by Molly O’Keefe\nEbook: https://amzn.to/3oojqiq\nAudio: https://amzn.to/3e0oqFp\n\nKane Christmas Series\nMy Fake Christmas Fiancé: https://amzn.to/2HvpiGe\nSanta Baby Maybe: https://amzn.to/37FGSC1\nHow My Brother&#039;s Best Friend Stole Christmas: https://amzn.to/35uQHzK\n\nAlexa Riley\nHalloween Bites: https://bit.ly/3jWCrpP\nWealthy & Wanted: https://bit.ly/35cSKsf\nNaughty and Notorious: https://bit.ly/3dDx0tr\n\nMentioned Books\nAll Scot and Bothered by Kerrigan Byrne: https://amzn.to/3juaLHt\nFated Royals by Dani Wyatt: https://amzn.to/3kykspE\nO&#039;Connor Family Series Collection by Katie Reus: https://amzn.to/2HFAKhT\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nBook Ads\nStroke of Midnight by K Webster\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/37JrioY\niBooks: https://apple.co/3gRI7yL\nB&N: https://bit.ly/3bk35oN\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3gQXjMO\nGoogle play: https://bit.ly/34UmJ9S\nAdd to Goodreads: https://bit.ly/314XSw\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
