  "description": "<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Handsome Hank in studio and Matt \"Money\" Smith via Skype to get you ready for all the Week 6 games. Money reads two Eddie Spaghetti Tweets in this episode both based on the New York Giants (10:13). Next, Shek decides to start making their Week 6 Red Challenge Flag Picks sporadically starting with the Bengals vs Steelers game (12:22). Kent Brown's mom makes a return as she sent two voicemails reviewing the NBC show <em>Manifest</em> and new movie <em>A Star Is Born</em> (18:55).
