  "description": "<p><p>Our acclaimed intern PMTSportsBiz finally got Rovell to bite so that started the show (2:45 - 5:51). Hank reads all the ads. The Home Run Derby was fucking awesome and of course some no fun baseball writers had terrible takes (5:51 - 19:51). Hot Seat/Cool Throne including NBA reviews and Takies coming Friday (19:51 - 33:03). Former MLB Pitcher and Future Hall of Famer Dan Haren joins the show to talk some baseball, Lakers, intentionally hitting guys, grooving fastballs as an unwritten rule, and not answering our absolute dumbest questions (33:03 - 63:28). Segments include bachelorette talk for guys that don't watch the bachelorette, Mt Rushmore of positions, Floyd Mayweather got crossed up and Jilly Football joins the show for Guys on Chicks.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
