With a glint in his eye, Lewis is warm, incredibly giving, and a stellar example of what life can be like when your heart is open — gratitude in motion.</p><p>After an injury prematurely ended his football career, Lewis was depressed, aimless and broke. Yearning for inspiration as he convalesced on his sister's couch, he&nbsp;arrived at a question:</p><p>What kind of life do I want to lead?</p><p>Then he got to work.
