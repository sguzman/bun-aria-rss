  "description": "<p>WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WIN? We can have our eyes on the prize. We can work every day to accomplish our goal. We can sacrifice and suffer to be the best. But at the end of the day, you can’t define yourself by whether or not you get “first place.” If your identity depends on one thing, you’re bound to fail. You have to free yourself from tying your worth to winning. When you do, you just might see some amazing results. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about faith, family and CrossFit with the “Fittest Man On Earth:” Rich Froning. Rich Froning is a CrossFit athlete known for his achievements participating in the CrossFit Games. He became the first person to win the title of \"Fittest Man on Earth\" four times and has led team CrossFit Mayhem Freedom to the first-place finish three times. Froning owns and operates the affiliate gym CrossFit Mayhem, located in Cookeville, Tennessee, and is a member of the CrossFit Level 1 Seminar Staff. Rich fell off the rope the first time he competed in the CrossFit Games and got second place. He felt like a very public failure. But when he released his need to win, he became unstoppable. So get ready to learn what it takes to be an outstanding competitor, husband and father on Episode 808.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWho did you have a deeper relationship with- mom or dad?
