  "description": "A deadline is approaching! To preview the date (4 pm ET on 7/15) where teams must sign their franchise-tagged players to multi-year deals, Will Brinson welcomes former NFL agent Joel Corry to break it all down. How has this offseason affected potential deals and how will it affect what we see on Wednesday? Will and Joel analyze the likelihood of long-term contracts for Dak Prescott (7:00), Derrick Henry (16:30), Chris Jones (18:30) and a collection of other players on the tag. Plus, the guys dive into Patrick Mahomes' massive extension (28:00). Why did both sides agree to something so long? How much will the contract really dictate the market for others? Joel warns that we shouldn't expect similar deals for Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson.
