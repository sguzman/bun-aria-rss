  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, there was an active shooter in Philadelphia and five Police Officers have been shot with another hurt in an auto accident. In a time such as this with shootings, and our government encroaching on our freedom under the guise of gun control, we must show strength, not weakness.  Also, in our foreign policy, we have to reinforce America's free market.  Other than tariffs on our enemies we should be very cautious about imposing taxes on American citizens for purchasing foreign goods.  Initially, this will help a select few industries temporarily, but will only hurt more industries in the long term. We are witnessing an anti-industrial revolution to de-grow our progress. Yet the progressive propagandists have focused on de-growing our economy in the name of climate change.  Claiming we need to use less of this and less of that and it's destroying us.  Later, the Statue of Liberty is not the Statue of welfare. Public charge rules are exactly how we've been able to add more immigrants into America every year than any other country on the planet.  The poem on Lady Liberty is about the opportunity to make it on your own in this great country, not to get handouts.  After, Bernie Sanders said that US foreign policy should be even-handed when dealing with terrorist organizations just like dealing with sovereign nation-states.   Then, the people of Hong Kong are fighting to maintain their freedom and China is reneging on their agreement.  This is not an internal problem of China's; America must stand up for liberty.  Lastly, Gordon Chang, author of the \"Coming Collapse of China\" joins the program to highlight the need to confront China's malign activity and support the sovereignty that Hong King is standing up for.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
