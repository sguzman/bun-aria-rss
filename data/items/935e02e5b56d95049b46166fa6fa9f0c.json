  "description": "<p>The Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) model, also called Fuzzy, Wave,\nBose-Einstein, Ultra-light Dark Matter, has received a lot of attention because\nit has been able to provide simpler and more natural explanations for various\nfeatures of galaxies, such as the number of satellite galaxies and the\ncusp-core problem. We recently showed that this model is able to explain the\nvast polar orbits of satellite galaxies around their host, the so-called VPO,\nand to explain the X-ray and gamma-ray emissions in the vacuum regions of our\ngalaxy, that is, the Fermi Bubbles. In all these phenomena the quantum\ncharacter of SFDM has been crucial. In this work we study the quantum effects\nof SFDM at the cosmological level, to see these effects not only at the\ngalactic scale, but also at the cosmological scale. Using a convenient ansatz,\nwe were able to integrate the perturbed equations to show that the shape of the\nSFDM halos resembling atoms is a generic result. The main conclusion of this\nwork is that quantum mechanics, the successful microworld theory, could also\nexplain the dark side of the cosmos.\n</p>",
