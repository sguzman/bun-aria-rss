  "description": "It's time to finally bring back a Canadian perspective (given they're wining medals and Australia isn't) and get ourselves worked up over some terrible judging as we recap the 9th day of PyeongChang 2018. Just how much bullshit was coming from the judging of the men's aerials and why is David Morris just such an awesome human for taking it so well? Has Colin recovered from basically being dead and can he survive long enough to survive so much alpine skiing being shown? Can bobsledders actually draw and why do we need to tweet them to work out what it is they're drawing? And how excited is Jarrod about the Norwegian curling team and their pants? It's clicking away and no replays away with another episode of your favourite Olympic podcast!",
