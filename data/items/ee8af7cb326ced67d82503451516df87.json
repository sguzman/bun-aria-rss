  "description": "<p>We celebrated the \"Watch What Crappens\" 7th Anniversary in the most epic way possible: with a packed live show in Charleston, South Carolina. Not only did some of our most die-hard listeners trek across the country to be there, but we were also graced by Ms. Patricia Altschul, Michael the Butler, and Queen Kathryn as well! We were so star struck and excited that we TOTALLY forgot to mention it was our anniversary. That's the Crappens way though, isn't?</p>\n<p>Of course no trip to Charleston would be complete without some Southern Charm discussion, so we dedicated the night to revisiting the show's very first episode. Come join for a trip down a very disturbing memory lane. And thanks for seven great years!!!<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
