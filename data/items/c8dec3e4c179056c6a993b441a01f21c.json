  "description": "<p>One of the more introspective and interesting conversations on the podcast I have ever had with Andy Othling from Lowercase Noises. He is a one man band from Albuquerque, New Mexico and his music is beautiful, haunting and trance inducing. After getting to know him a bit, I knew he’d be a great guest for the show and he did not disappoint. We speak in depth about solitude, computer science and the creative process. I urge you to listen to this episode as we go down roads that I think many people would be able to relate with.
