  "description": "Olympians in Beijing are proudly donning their matching national uniforms from the ice and snow to the dining hall. Despite, or perhaps because of that uniformity, small gestures and equipment choices are speaking volumes about the athletes who populate the results sheet. \n\nOne athlete and one sport seem to be getting their message across quite well: Andrew Blaser in Skeleton. He joins Lauren Shehadi to explain why equipment choice can be so much more. \n\nFollow The Podium now on Spotify to get automatic downloads. And tune into the networks of NBC to watch every moment of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic games. ",
