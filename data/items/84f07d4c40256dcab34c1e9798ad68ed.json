  "description": "<p>We are joined on the show today by Jim Dean, Creative Director of Haunted Walks, Inc. Our research assistant Carbon Lilies helped with the research and shares their experience at the jail. Ottawa in Ontario is the capital of Canada. This city has a high standard of living, low unemployment and a rich history being the historic home of the founding fathers of Canada. Within this city is located the historic jail known in previous years as the Carleton County Gaol. Like so many older jails, treatment here for prisoners was not always humane and men, women and children were housed together. The jail is now a hostel known as the Ottawa Jail Hostel, but something from the past still remains. Spirits still seem to roam the hallways and many of these entities are not happy. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Carleton County Gaol. Moment in Oddity features the Versailles Time Slip and This Day in History features the hijacking and disappearance related to DB Cooper.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-84-carleton-county-gaol.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-84-carleton-county-gaol.html</a></p> <p>Help the show grow by becoming an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a>.
