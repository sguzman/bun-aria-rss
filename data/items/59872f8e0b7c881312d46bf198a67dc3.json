They also hate Catholics, Jews, Muslims, soldiers, America, and more. They hate almost everyone. The Southern Poverty Law Center has called the WBC, “arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America.” Find out why they believe what they do, and a little unexpected inspiration, today, on Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by My West Coast Buds, the podcast! Take an inside look at cannabis, coffee, comedy, and spirits.</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by American Addiction Centers.
