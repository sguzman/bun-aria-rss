  "description": "<p>We analyse the recovery of different roles in a network modelled by a\ndirected graph, based on the so-called Neighbourhood Pattern Similarity\napproach. Our analysis uses results from random matrix theory to show that when\nassuming the graph is generated as a particular Stochastic Block Model with\nBernoulli probability distributions for the different blocks, then the recovery\nis asymptotically correct when the graph has a sufficiently large dimension.\nUnder these assumptions there is a sufficient gap between the dominant and\ndominated eigenvalues of the similarity matrix, which guarantees the asymptotic\ncorrect identification of the number of different roles. We also comment on the\nconnections with the literature on Stochastic Block Models, including the case\nof probabilities of order log(n)/n where n is the graph size. We provide\nnumerical experiments to assess the effectiveness of the method when applied to\npractical networks of finite size.\n</p>",
