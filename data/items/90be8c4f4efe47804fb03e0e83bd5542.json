This infographic visualizes the composition of blood and the <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-relative-size-of-particles/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">microscopic contents</a> in it.</p>\n<h2>What is Blood Made Up Of?</h2>\n<p>There are two main components that comprise blood: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plasma &#8211; 55%</strong><br />\nPlasma is the fluid or aqueous part of blood, making up more than half of blood content.</li>\n<li><strong>Formed elements &#8211; 45%</strong><br />\nFormed elements refer to the cells, platelets, and cell fragments that are suspended in the plasma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Plasma</h4>\n<p>Plasma is primarily made up of water (91%), salts, and enzymes, but it also carries important proteins and components that serve many bodily functions. </p>\n<p>Plasma proteins make up 7% of plasma contents and are created in the liver. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Albumins</em><br />\nThese proteins keep fluids from leaking out of blood vessels into other parts of the body. They also transport important molecules like calcium and help neutralize toxins.</li>\n<li><em>Globulins</em><br />\nThese play an important role in clotting blood and fighting infections and are also transporters of hormones, minerals, and fats.</li>\n<li><em>Fibrinogen and Prothrombin</em><br />\nBoth of these proteins help stop bleeding by facilitating the creation of blood clots during wound-healing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Water and proteins make up <strong>98%</strong> of plasma in blood. The other 2% is made up of small traces of chemical byproducts and cellular waste, including electrolytes, glucose, and other nutrients.</p>\n<h4>Formed Elements</h4>\n<p>There are three categories of formed elements in blood: platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells. Red blood cells make up <strong>99%</strong> of formed elements, with the other 1% comprised of platelets and white blood cells.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platelets (Thrombocytes)</strong><br />\nPlatelets are cells from the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lXfEK8G8CUI\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a> with the primary function of forming clots to reduce bleeding from wounds. This makes them critical not only for small wounds like cuts but also for surgeries and traumatic injuries.</li>\n<li><strong>White blood cells (Leukocytes)</strong><br />\nWhite blood cells protect our bodies from infection. There are five types of white blood cells with different roles in fighting infections: some attack foreign cells and viruses, some produce antibodies, some clean up dead cells, and some respond to allergens.</li>\n<li><strong>Red blood cells (Erythrocytes)</strong><br />\nRed blood cells deliver fresh oxygen and nutrients all over the body. They contain a special protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen and gives blood its bright red color.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lifespan of a typical red blood cell is around 120 days, after which it dies and is replaced by a new cell. Our bodies are constantly producing red blood cells in the bone marrow, at a rate of millions of cells per second.</p>\n<h2>Abnormal Red Blood Cells</h2>\n<p>Normal red blood cells are round, flattened disks that are thinner in the middle. However, certain diseases and medical therapies can change the shape of red blood cells in different ways. </p>\n<p>Here are the types of abnormal red blood cells and their associated diseases:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/red-blood-cells-supplemental.png\" alt=\"composition of blood\" width=\"820\" height=\"2200\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-153155\" srcset=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/red-blood-cells-supplemental.png 820w, https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/red-blood-cells-supplemental-768x2060.png 768w, https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/red-blood-cells-supplemental-573x1536.png 573w, https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/red-blood-cells-supplemental-763x2048.png 763w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sickle cell anemia</a> is a well-known disease that affects the shape of red blood cells. Unlike normal, round red blood cells, cells associated with sickle cell disease are crescent- or sickle-shaped, which can slow and block blood flow. </p>\n<p>Other common causes of abnormally shaped red blood cells are thalassemia, hereditary blood disorders, iron deficiency anemia, and liver disease. Identifying abnormal blood cells plays an important role in diagnosing the underlying causes and in finding treatments. </p>\n<h2>The Functions of Blood</h2>\n<p>We know that blood is vital, but what does it actually do in <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-elemental-composition-of-the-human-body/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the body</a>? </p>\n<p>For starters, here are some of the functions of blood: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood transports oxygen to different parts of the body, providing an energy source. It also delivers carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation.</li>\n<li>The platelets, white blood cells, and plasma proteins in blood play an important role in fighting infections and clotting.</li>\n<li>Blood transports the body’s waste products to the kidneys and liver, which filter it and recirculate clean blood.</li>\n<li>Blood helps regulate the body’s internal temperature by absorbing and distributing heat throughout the body.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we all know that we can’t live without <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-most-widespread-blood-types-in-every-country/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blood</a>, it serves many different functions in the body that we often don’t notice. For humans and many other organisms alike, blood is an integral component that keeps us alive and going.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-composition-of-blood/\">Visualizing the Composition of Blood</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com\">Visual Capitalist</a>.</p>\n",
