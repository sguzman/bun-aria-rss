  "description": "<p>Meditation: Getting Lost and Coming Back Here (2017-03-08) - This meditation establishes a sense of presence, of being Here, through a body scan and awakening the senses. We then notice when we’re lost and relax back into the wakeful stillness - the Hereness - that is our true home. Our practice concludes with the beautiful poem “Lost” by David Wagoner.</p> <p>Free download of Tara’s 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease” when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
