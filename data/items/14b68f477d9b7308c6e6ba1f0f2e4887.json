  "title": "PMS 2.0 280 - MNF Recap, Aaron Rodgers, Michael Lombardi, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Monday Night Football game between the Bears and Rams and try to decide whether or not the Bears stink, how good the Rams are, what makes Johnny Hekker so special (he won the game for the Rams), and why the punt is the most important play in all of football. Later, on another installment of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday, Pat and AJ Hawk are joined by the man, the myth, the legend, the starting Quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, AJ, and Aaron chat about last weekend's game against the Texans and whether or not he knew Davante Adams was going to have a massive game, his thoughts on the local media getting under his skin, if it's true that he stinks at beer pong, the QB exams that give him the most difficulty, and much more in another fantastic conversation (20:31-56:11). Later, former GM of the Cleveland Browns and Special Assistant to the coaches for the New England Patriots, host of the GM Shuffle pod, co-host of HammerDAHN, accomplished author, writer for The Athletic and creator of the Daily Coach, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about last night's game, and his concerns with the Bears and Matt Nagy, his biggest takeaways from the NFL season thus far, what the problem in New England is, and which teams he thinks will make a play for assets at the trade deadline (58:38-1:23:11).
