  "title": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari",
  "description": "This book is a brief history into our development as humans from the plains of Africa to our current place in the animal kingdom. It analyses what steps we took to get there as a species and the challenges we faced along the way. The book highlights the impact that the Agricultural revolution and the Industrial revolution had on technology, business and population growth. It gives the reader an indication of our past whilst also briefly telling what the future may hold for us. I enjoyed reading this book as it gave context for how we have developed exponentially as humans over the last couple hundred of years, and given the current trend how we will continue to do so. The disclaimer in this book is that it refutes the idea of creationism, not really analysing its impact, but on the merits on the book alone I still rate it four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
