  "description": "<p>Tuesday 7/3 - Today on the show we went back to the time one of our listeners tried to shoot their shot at her brothers best friend, but it took a turn for the worst. We also, went back to the time another listener with 3 kids wanted to shoot her shot at a potential father for her kids but apparently the kids didn't even know who he was from the beginning. Charlamagne also gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Michael Rotondo who is a 30 year old man who still stayed at home with his parents. Also we rewound back to the time Nipsey Hussell stopped by and spoke about his album, protocols, Cardi B and more. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
