  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the left's attack on Donald Trump is really an attack on America and each and every one of us. The airwaves are filled with leftwing reporters and former federal prosecutors distorting the notion of what truth really is. The rationale for a surprise emergency January 6 hearing doesn't add up. Cassidy Hutchinson (the J6 Committees witness) claimed that Trump lunged toward the agents driving him on January 6th. But Secret Service agents have come forth and said that Trump never lunged for the steering wheel of the Presidential limo and are prepared to testify under oath. Afterward, former Pentagon Chief of Staff, Kash Patel, calls in to explain that he witnessed Trump, in the presence of the Sec. of Defense, authorized up to 20,000 National Guardsman to the Capitol which was declined by the Mayor of Washington DC and the Capitol Police and reported in the recent timeline released by the DC Metropolitan Police. Patel reiterated that the Oval Office is a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and that Cassidy Hutchinson was not even authorized to attend such a meeting let alone have access to any intelligence coming from it. Patel has submitted his testimony to the committee although the committee was not interested in publicizing his transcripts. Then, 50 people died being smuggled in a tractor near the southern border. How many more people have died crossing the border while Biden has been president? Yet the hellish border remains open and people will continue to enter the country, some dying along the way, while Biden's Administration sits on its hands. Later, Congressman Lee Zeldin calls in with an update on his campaign for Governor of New York. Zeldin reiterated the need to get rid of the Cuomo-Hochul legacy this November. Finally, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem joins the show to discuss her new book, \"Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Not-My-First-Rodeo-Heartland/dp/1538707055/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1X65FSWRY960M&keywords=kristi+noem&qid=1656436125&sprefix=kristi+noem%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-1\nNoem added that her dad was a tough cowboy and taught her the work ethic that she has today.
