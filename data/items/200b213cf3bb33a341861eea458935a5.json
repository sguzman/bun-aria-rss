The cost of cabinetry is speculated to be around 15-20% of the home, which is similar to what we recommend for furniture when people are willing to go all in and style their home to its fullest potential. The cabinet work and finish work are two separate things, which many may assume is the same worker, and then your sizing is typically going to be custom, being what we often push on this podcast. <br /><br />The cost of cabinetry 2:29<br />1960’s Colonial home and cabinet door profiles 5:31<br />Is your cabinet maker also the one to do the moldings? 15:06<br />What to expect from your cabinet maker 18:42<br />Sizing 22:37<br />Dimensions of drawers for pots and pans 26:56<br />Ideal height of sideboard/buffet and barstools 27:48<br />Color 30:34<br />Paint vs stain 33:31<br />Is white out? 37:16<br />Timeless wood stain and grain of wood 40:07<br />Should white cabinets match the trim color? 45:28<br />Backsplash, order of install 46:39<br />Refinishing and filling knots 48:28<br /><br />“Somebody wanted to know, is your cabinet maker also the one to do the moldings?

You do need a finish work budget and you need a cabinet work budget, they’re two different things. Maybe in a small town he does both, but for the most part they’re different specialties.” 15:09<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
