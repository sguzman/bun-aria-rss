  "description": "<ul>\n<li>We continue our discussion on the most shocking moments in Harry Potter fandom history, with some stories you'll remember -- and others you probably forgot!</li>\n<li>In 2012, Micah discovered that JKR had announced she was actively working on a Harry Potter Encyclopedia, but it was <a href=\"https://www.mugglenet.com/2012/05/rowling-has-no-firm-plans-to-publish-potter-encyclopedia/\">quickly retracted</a> once the story got out.</li>\n<li>In 2013, Rowling was outed as male author Robert Galbraith by a lawyer's... wife's... friend... and a British newspaper.</li>\n<li>Later that same year, only a week after MuggleCast \"ended,\" the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film series was announced!</li>\n<li>Years later, can we all agree <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> IS a prequel?</li>\n<li>Dumbledore's appearance in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> and the casting of Jude Law was a delightful surprise.</li>\n<li>In 2016, more Wizarding World schools were announced, and controversy may have prevented us from getting more that were promised.</li>\n<li>The same year, the stage show Cursed Child is announced, and debuts in 2 parts! We revisit the original description of the show, which is very different than the final product.</li>\n<li>Honorable mentions submitted by our listeners include Ron/Hermione regrets, Rowling on Twitter, and the Wizards Unite game.</li>\n<li>We also reflect on the actors we've lost over the years.</li>\n<li>To wrap up our discussion, each of the hosts speculates on which crazy \"impossible\" idea will be the next shocking news story in fandom.</li>\n<li>Quizzitch: Who portrayed the character of Barry Fairbrother on the BBC series adaptation of the Casual Vacancy?
