  "description": "Need some good healthy player debates? This is your episode! As training camps are underway, we begin with some storylines and position battles to track. Is Matt Breida or Jerick McKinnon the #2 RB in San Francisco (2:40)? Which SEA RB has a more enticing ADP (5:52)? We also analyze the GB WRs (8:33) and the potentially awful TB RBs (12:25) ... Ben Gretch gives us a Jarvis Landry stat (19:50) and a Devonta Freeman stat (25:50) to spark some discussion. Does Freeman still have Top 5 upside?

Heath touches on the battle in the DEN backfield (42:00). Dave gets us going on Marvin Jones who might be undervalued (47:30) and Adam gets a Sony Michel debate started (50:00). Shouldn't he be a Top 50 pick in non-PPR? ...
