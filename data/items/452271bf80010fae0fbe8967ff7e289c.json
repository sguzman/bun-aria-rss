  "description": "This just in: being canceled is the new blue checkmark!\nHome is where the heart is, and that’s why Sofia is FINALLY coming at you live from her home base AKA Lola’s house in Utah. Well, for half of the episode at least. Today Sofia is joined by podcasting royalty, Claudia Oshrey of The Morning Toast. Cheers to that! Get? Anyway, together, the two talk about some hard-hitting issues in the world…like how chaotic this season of RHOSLC has been. Get ready for a deep psychoanalysis of ALL of the housewives (when in reality Sofia should probably be doing this on herself). Next, the two shamefully discuss the times they were both canceled, how your embarrassing moment on social media WILL pass, and Claudia’s stint on Say Yes To The Dress. The two also give top tier advice on the reality of being an influencer and content creator, and trust…not all that glitters is gold Sloots. I know, sounds superficial but it’s real. Of course, even though we have a special guest, Sofia needed to talk about herself. She takes us along her NYC trip that she just returned from and explains how it turned into a 3-week bender filled with fireball, Pete Davidson, and a “girl” named Molly. It really never ends with Sofia, but that’s why you’re all still here right? Talk soon Sloots!\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nShip Station: http://www.shipstation.com/SOFIA \nThe Flex Company: http://www.flexfits.com/SOFIA \nZola: http://www.Zola.com/\nOK Cupid: Download OK Cupid from the App Store or Google Play today!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
