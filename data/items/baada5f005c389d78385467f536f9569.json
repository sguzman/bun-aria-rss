We spend over a billion dollars for prescriptions and over-the-counter (OTC) products to cure acne, yet at best these are short-term solutions. Conventional medicine deals with symptoms, so their solutions for acne include lathering on potions and lotions, and taking antibiotics or strong liver-damaging medications.&nbsp;Functional Medicine, on the other hand, addresses the problem’s root cause. From this lens, we can understand that numerous factors contribute to acne, including nutritional status, stress, toxicity, inflammation and hormonal and gut imbalances.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman is joined by Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to treating acne and other skin issues.</p><br><p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine as part of my team at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their wellness goals. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life. Her DVD Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer explores the Functional Medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well, a topic she is passionate about as a breast cancer survivor.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman and Dr. Boham discuss:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Why what you’re eating is so much more important than what you put on your skin</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>How topical skin treatments can work in short term but cause issues in the long term&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Foods that can commonly cause acne, including sugar, starch, dairy, and processed foods</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>How sugar affects our microbiome and immune system</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>How Dr. Boham treated two patients with acne&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>The gut-skin connection</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Nutrients that are really important for skin to turn over, including vitamin A and zinc</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>How toxins such as pesticides and BPA can affect skin and overall health</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Supporting your detoxification system through diet, hydration, sweat, and more</li></ul><p><br></p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://drhyman.com/uwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drhyman.com/uwc</a></p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by AirDoctor.
