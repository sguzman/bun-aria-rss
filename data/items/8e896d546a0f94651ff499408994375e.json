  "description": "We all remember the history lesson about the Wright brothers, but may have forgotten why they are so important. Well, on today’s episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares their key invention that has transformed the way we travel: airplanes. As soon as the airplane was invented, things were looking up (get it?). Our way of transportation has majorly transformed because of the testing the Wright brothers did to ensure long lasting flight abilities; without planes, we would still be on boats traveling from country to country. As for our musical fact of the day, we have a special guest who you should definitely know about. She has co-written a number of incredible songs, including “Back To You” by Selena Gomez and “Adore You” by Harry Styles. Here she is today, talking about her 2018 release with Halsey - give it up for Amy Allen! Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
