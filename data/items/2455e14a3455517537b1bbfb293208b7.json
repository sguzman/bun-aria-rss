  "description": "<p>This week, we are joined by a special guest. Laura Horn is an Australian abstract artist who is also a successful podcaster, teacher and businesswoman. Over the years, she has worked to establish a regular art practice and build a full-time business while also juggling responsibilities as a wife and mother. &nbsp;In this episode, we learn how Laura turned a short sabbatical from her office job into a full-time art career - at first simply as a painter and then later as a creator of online courses. We discuss how important it is to build a business that aligns with your values and share our challenges with balancing work and rest-time. &nbsp;Our conversations also spans blogs, Instagram, social media trolling, podcasts and the challenges (and joys) of working closely with your spouse. &nbsp;In 'what's inspired?' Laura shares her love of mixed media, Alice is thrilled with new frames, and Louise has decided you're never too old for something you really love.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Laura Horn Art: <a href=\"https://www.laurahornart.com/\">https://www.laurahornart.com/</a></p>\n<p>The Laura Horn Podcast: <a href=\"https://www.laurahornart.com/thepodcast\">https://www.laurahornart.com/thepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Your Art Tribe membership site: <a href=\"https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe?preview_token=BAh7CDoMdXNlcl9pZEkiCjYyMDQ1BjoGRUY6D2V4cGlyZXNfYXRVOiBBY3RpdmVTdXBwb3J0OjpUaW1lV2l0aFpvbmVbCEl1OglUaW1lDdEJHsCQtFs3CToJem9uZUkiCFVUQwY7BkY6DW5hbm9fbnVtaQGLOg1uYW5vX2RlbmkGOg1zdWJtaWNybyIHE5BJIg5FZGluYnVyZ2gGOwZUQAs6EnN1cGVyX3VzZXJfaWQw--7aa64a4b19ffa2b3333a9e396432d295137192b2\" target=\"_blank\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
