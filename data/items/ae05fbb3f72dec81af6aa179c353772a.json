Plant-based medicine can help you relax but it can also be a mode to recovery for anyone from athletes to addicts trying to rebuild what is broken. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Roberts is the founder and owner of Pure Body Zen, a firefighter, and the host of the Good Dudes Grow Podcast. After tragically losing his daughter to opioid addiction, Gary discovered the healing nature of cannabis products and set out on a mission to not only educate others about plant-based medicine but also help those struggling with their mental and physical heath find the path to recovery.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, Gary tells Zach about his dream: to build a recovery center that uses plant-based medicine to help those suffering from addiction and trauma. He explains how the facility will embrace scientifically proven therapies, separating it from the experimental nature that is often associated with products like CBD. Listen in for an episode that will educate you on this natural healing process. </span></p> <p> </p> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\">Show Notes:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/plant-based-medicine\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-target-href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison\">https://underdogempowerment.com/plant-based-medicine</a></span></div> <div> </div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <div> </div> <ol class=\"listtype-number listindent1 list-number1\" start=\"1\"> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" data-target-href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol>",
