  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here with one of the most beautifully crafted books we've ever read. YA romance The Sky Is Everywhere by Jandy Nelson is a gorgeous story of grief and young love. It's also time machine that had us reliving all the ridiculousness that is being a teenager. So, set those vague AIM away messages and strap in for a squee session! \n CW: death of a sibling, navigating grief, and loss of a pregnancy. \n Also CW for Erin's SCALDING hot takes on different instrument players. Sorry, French Horns.\n Lady Loves: \n Melody: The strawberries and blueberries I'm currently eating! \n Erin: Gah..... it's hard over here. Sometimes there isn't a lady love.\n Episode Sponsor:\n Penelope's Paths by Isabelle Peterson\n Patreon Shout Out:\n Robin J, you are descended from Fauna, the roman goddess of woodlands, fields, flocks, and... fertility, which makes me think there’s some freak in there, too. Fauna was goddess to all creatures on earth, and if you’ve watched Netflix’s Absurd Planet documentary, you’ll know that’s both awe-inspiring, and truly, hilariously entertaining. Many forget, however, that she was also the goddess of prophecy, and that wisdom has served you and your loved ones well.\n Subscribe! Rate! Review!
