  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, what's wrong with America, when babies that are born can be aborted? We have sitting elected officials that are a disgrace and its applauded as a woman's choice? Future generations will look back and recognize this barbarism. It’s shocking that every religious organization, every politician, and every citizen does not rise up and fight this. We once believed in right versus wrong, good versus evil, and some of us still do but the silence of the majority is deafening. Also, freedom of the press has become dogma; it’s no longer comparable to the brave men that ran printing presses and led the revolution for liberty in America. Today the threat is tyranny but the Marxists have figured out that euphemisms like 'sticking it to the rich' and 'redistributing wealth' work a lot better. Today the press have become the voices of tyranny as they work diligently every day to destroy a sitting president. Afterwards, the State of The Union is just another stage for the lunacy of the left. Trump may in fact have to trigger the National Emergencies Act of 1976 just as previous presidents have. His use of this act is perfectly legitimate and allows for Congress to vote against his use of it. Despite critics claims that this is an effort to circumvent Congress, it was a Democratic Congress that passed this law in 1976. The National Emergencies Act has been used more than 50 times since its inception. Finally, person(s) close to President Trump are trying to destroy him; this time leaking his schedules to the media. President Lincoln warned that America would only be destroyed by itself, from within; so like President Reagan admonished: \"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction..It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
