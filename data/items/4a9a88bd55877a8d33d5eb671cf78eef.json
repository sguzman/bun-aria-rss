  "title": "Path-consistent wrong-way risk",
  "description": "In this paper, Klaus Böcker and Michael Brunnbauer define a general copula wrong-way risk (WWR) model and show how different copulas affect results such as potential future exposure and credit valuation adjustment figures. They present a very general model that respects the pathwise structure of future exposure and reconciles different existing models under the same framework",
