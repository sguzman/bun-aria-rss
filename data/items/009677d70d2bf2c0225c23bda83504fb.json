  "description": "<p>We study the following problem. How many distinct copies of $H$ can an\n$n$-vertex graph $G$ have, if $G$ does not contain a rainbow $F$, that is, a\ncopy of $F$ where each edge is contained in a different copy of $H$? The case\n$H=K_r$ is equivalent to the Tur\\'an problem for Berge hypergraphs, which has\nattracted several researchers recently. We also explore the connection of our\nproblem to the so-called generalized Tur\\'an problems. We obtain several exact\nresults. In the particularly interesting symmetric case where $H=F$, we\ncompletely solve the case $F$ is the 3-edge path, and asymptitically solve the\ncase $F$ is a book graph.\n</p>",
