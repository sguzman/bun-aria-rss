  "itunes:summary": "As a material index of acoustic activity, the term ‘sound fossil’ has gained currency in the fields of paleosonics and contemporary art both as a means of accounting for the appearance of the past in the present, and as an embodiment of cosmic time. Drawing upon audible and not so audible projects, art historian Amelia Barikin presents her lecture: Sound Fossils and Arche-Fossils: Towards a mineral ontology of contemporary art.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/sound-fossils\n\nHistories and Theories of Sound\n22 October, 2015\nGertrude Contemporary, Fitzroy\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Discipline and Gertrude Contemporary.\n\nAudio: Mara Schwerdtfeger\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
