Over the past few years, he has responded to several major crises. After an earthquake devastated Haiti, Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, wildfires scorched Southern California, and a refugee crisis intensified on the Venezuelan border, José quickly mobilized volunteer chefs to prepare meals for thousands of people in need through his non-profit, World Central Kitchen.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I was so happy to sit down and talk with José Andrés, an internationally-recognized culinary innovator, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author, educator, humanitarian, chef, and owner of ThinkFoodGroup, the award-winning collective of nearly 30 restaurants throughout the country and beyond. A naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Spain, Andrés has been a tireless advocate for immigration reform and on July 4, 2014 was named by President Barack Obama as that year’s “Outstanding American by Choice.” José was twice named to <em>Time’s</em> “100 Most Influential People” list and recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Tushy, Thrive Market, and the Pegan Shake.</p><br><p>Right now, Thrive is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.

And it’s really affordable, starting at only $79. Right now Tushy is offering Doctor’s Farmacy listeners 10% off, too, so it’s a better time than ever to make the switch to a bidet. Just go to <a href=\"https://hellotushy.com/pages/mark-hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hellotushy.com/HYMAN</a>.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The Pegan Shake features a combination of collagen, pumpkin, and pea protein with healthy fats from my two favorites: MCT oil which is great for fat burning and brain power as well as avocado oil.
