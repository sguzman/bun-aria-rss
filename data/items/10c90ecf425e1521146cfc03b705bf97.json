  "description": "<p>Boston sports media are upset that Rob Gronkowski, a guy who was never going to play another down of football for the New England Patriots, is now headed to Tampa Bay to play with Tom Brady. A new Youtube show is ruffling some feathers in the Minifan community. ESPN's Mina Kimes and Katie Nolan area struggling to work from home (0:38:10). Boston Mayor Marty Walsh proves he can read (0:43:40).  The Predator Poachers catch another deviant (0:59:00). We analyze another excellent column from the Boston Globe's Shirley Leung and Steve's private call-in line for the OG Minifans is exposed.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
