Thatâ€™s the idea behind mass timber â€” a relatively new construction technique thatâ€™s making its way from Europe to the United States.\n\nIn the above video, you can learn how mass timber changes the construction process. Voxâ€™s Phil Edwards visited Ascent Milwaukee, the tallest mass timber building in the world, to see how it all comes together. Many different partners have to reinvent the construction process to make a building like this a reality.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more.\n\nFurther reading:\nRead Dave Robertâ€™s coverage of mass timber, including the environmental implications.\nhttps://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/15/21058051/climate-change-building-materials-mass-timber-cross-laminated-clt\n\nHereâ€™s some of the USDA coverage of mass timber tests.\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/61076\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/62977\n\nHereâ€™s a map of US mass timber projects:\nhttps://www.woodworksinnovationnetwork.org/projects/?boundingBox%5BnorthEast%5D%5Blat%5D=53.975199732679016&boundingBox%5BnorthEast%5D%5Blng%5D=-74.18212890625&boundingBox%5BsouthWest%5D%5Blat%5D=26.066232843442364&boundingBox%5BsouthWest%5D%5Blng%5D=-125.81787109375&page=1\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
