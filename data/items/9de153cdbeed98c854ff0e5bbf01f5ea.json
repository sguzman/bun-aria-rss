    "media:description": "Australia is the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas or LNG. \n\nIn 2020, the country exported $25 billion worth of natural gas to markets in Asia. \n\nInterestingly enough, the country also occasionally suffers from natural gas shortages in their own markets at home. It is a demonstration of the country's sprawling size, bountiful natural resources, and complicated energy politics. \n\nIn this video, I want to talk about how the land down under became one of the worldâ€™s biggest natural gas exporters.\n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
