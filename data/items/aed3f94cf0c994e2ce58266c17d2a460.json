  "description": "It’s a special live episode of ESPN Daily! This weekend in Boston, some of the brightest minds from across the sports world gathered for the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. One of the panels, led by our own Pablo Torre, focused on the growing concern that many of the major sports' regular seasons feel like they don’t matter as much as they used to, with players and media focused solely on championship rings. The panel entitled “Maximizing Competitive Meaning” featuring the NBA’s Evan Wasch, Brad Pursel of MLS, and Sam Schwartzstein, formerly of the XFL, addressed this very question, and examined how fixing the regular season just may require tinkering with some of sports most sacred traditions. We’re excited to bring you this panel, in podcast form! \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
