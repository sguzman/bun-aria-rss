  "description": "<p>Trust is the foundation of leadership. If people don’t trust their leader, they won’t follow their leader. That’s because trust is the ground upon which relationships are built. This week on The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast, John discusses five trust buster and five trust builders that every leader should know in order to ensure they are building a culture of trust in their organization, family, and relationships.</p> <p>During the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede dive deep into John’s lesson and discuss the importance of trust within their own work relationship and with the people they both lead. They also discuss whether trust is given or if it is earned and how the leader should set the stage for trust for the people they lead.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Trust Buster and Trust Builders Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/BuildTrust and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/john-maxwell-earning-trust\"> Earning Trust Series – The John Maxwell Leadership Podcast</a></p> <p><em><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-Self-Aware-Leader--Play-to-Your-Strengths-and-Unleash-Your-Team-_p_3016.html\"> The Self-Aware Leader by John C.
