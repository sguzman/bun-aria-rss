  "description": "<div>This week, the gals are joined by Dr. Partha Nandi, MD (Verified Non-Murderer & Health Hero) to chat Angels of Death (aka Doctors Who Kill). And bonus! This topic is going to be a Two-Parter! Part 1 dissects the difference between what some might consider \"an act of mercy\" and straight-up homicide, a line that seemed prrrretty blurry pre-WWII. Dr. Nandi also answers some (supes inapprope) fan questions, and we get a glimpse of The Good Doctor from Detroit's musical tastes.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
