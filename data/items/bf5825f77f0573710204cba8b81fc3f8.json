Do you want people to love and adore you?<br />\nThe problem is that you’re focusing in the wrong direction.<br />\nDon’t concentrate on yourself or what you want from other people. Shift your focus to helping others. Make an impact on those who already appreciate you.<br />\nWhen that happens, more people will appreciate you. You’ll make their lives magical, and the success and admiration will come later.<br />\nFor example, when Oprah comes out on stage she doesn’t say “Look at me. I’m great.” She puts her focus on her audience. She zooms in on others and does what she can to help everyone around her.<br />\nFor this episode of 5 Minute Friday, I’m bringing back this segment from Elizabeth Gilbert.<br />\nShe’s an American author, essayist, short story writer, biographer, novelist, and memoirist.<br />\nShe is best known for her 2006 memoir, Eat, Pray, Love, which as of December 2010 had spent 199 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list.<br />\nShe gives her insights on what she’s learned about the power of looking to serve rather than be served.<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 645.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhere most people lie in relation to their greatness (00:45)<br />\nHow to really help others (1:32)<br />\nHow to get a larger platform (3:17)<br />\nWhat makes Oprah so great (3:44)<br />\nPlus much, much more.</p>\n",
