  "title": "Support for gun control is lower among young adults",
  "content": "In current discussions of gun policies, many advocates of gun control talk as if time is on their side; that is, they assume that young people are more likely than old people to support gun control.<br /><br />This <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/letters/21737238-digital-health-migrants-school-shootings-doping-theresa-may-letters-editor\">letter to the editor of the Economist</a> summarizes the argument:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i>It is unlikely that a generation raised on lockdown drills, with access to phone footage of gun rampages and a waning interest in hunting, will grow up parroting the National Rifle Association’s rhetoric as enthusiastically as today's political leaders. Change is coming.</i></blockquote>And in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/florida-shooting-david-hogg-nra-latest-updates-we-will-outlive-you-survivor-student-crisis-actor-a8227501.html\">recent television interview</a>, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting told opponents of gun control:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><i>You might as well stop now, because we are going to outlive you.</i></blockquote>But these assumptions turn out to be false.&nbsp; In fact, <b>young adults are substantially less likely to support gun control than previous generations</b>.<br /><br />The following figure shows results I generated from the General Social Survey (GSS) and the <a href=\"https://heri.ucla.edu/cirp-freshman-survey/\">CIRP Freshman Survey</a>, plotting support for gun control by year of birth.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

among people born after 1980, far fewer support gun control.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://github.com/AllenDowney/GssReligion/blob/master/gss_gun.ipynb\">The code I used to generate this figure is in this Jupyter notebook</a>.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Other studies</h3>I am not the only one to notice these patterns.&nbsp; This <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17029880/gun-control-parkland-shooting-younger-americans\">Vox article from last week</a>&nbsp;reports on similar results from a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/08/13/continued-bipartisan-support-for-expanded-background-checks-on-gun-sales/8-12-2015-3-58-40-pm/\">2015 Pew Survey</a> and a <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/186263/majority-say-concealed-weapons-safer.aspx\">2015 Gallup Poll</a>.<br /><br />The Pew survey found that young adults are less likely than other age groups to support a ban on assault weapons (although they are also more likely to support a federal database of gun sales, and not substantially different from other age groups on some other policy proposals):<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Since then, successive cohorts of young adults have shifted substantially away from gun control.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/186263/majority-say-concealed-weapons-safer.aspx\">This Gallup poll</a> shows that current young adults are more likely than previous generations to believe that more concealed weapons would make the U.S. safer:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wMYZmQmWLYg/WpWL06IVJ7I/AAAAAAAAE04/EQIidfYzLfM3sk08ycrcqvW_ITYiWcdeACLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2Bat%2B2018-02-27%2B11%253A48%253A07.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;\"><br /></div><br />Each of these sources is based on different questions asked of different groups, but they show remarkably consistent results.<br /><br />The GSS is based on a representative sample of the adult U.S. population.&nbsp; It includes people of different ages, so it provides insight into the effect of birth year and age.&nbsp; The Freshman Survey includes only first-year college students, so it is not representative of the general population.&nbsp; But because all respondents are observed at the same age, it gives the clearest picture of generational changes.<br /><br /><h3>The NRA regime</h3>A possible explanation for these changes is that since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association#Political_activity\">NRA created its lobbying branch in 1975 and its political action committee in 1976</a>, it has succeeded in making gun rights (and opposition to gun control) part of the conservative identity.<br /><br />We should expect their efforts to have the biggest effect on the generation raised in the 1980s and 90s, and we should expect them to have a stronger effect on conservatives than liberals.<br /><br />The following figure shows the same data from the GSS, grouped by political self-identification:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zYsFNwqSFaM/WpWmJE_Qc2I/AAAAAAAAE1w/7azs1y0w390soVINQGqERu0jCb15H-N7ACLcBGAs/s1600/permit_cohort_polview.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1100\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zYsFNwqSFaM/WpWmJE_Qc2I/AAAAAAAAE1w/7azs1y0w390soVINQGqERu0jCb15H-N7ACLcBGAs/s640/permit_cohort_polview.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />As expected, support for gun control has dropped most among people who identify as conservative.<br /><br />Among moderates, it might have dropped, but not by as much.&nbsp; The last data point, for people born around 1995, might be back up, but it is based on a small sample, and may not be reliable.<br /><br />Support among liberals has been mostly unchanged, except for the last point in the series which, again, may not be reliable, as indicated by the wide error bars.<br /><br />These results suggest that the decrease in support for gun control has been driven primarily by changing views among young conservatives.<br /><br />UPDATE: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/02/24/588069946/millennials-are-no-more-liberal-on-gun-control-than-elders-polls-show\">NPR has a related story from a few days ago</a>.&nbsp; They report that \"Millennials ar<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">e <span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333;\">no more liberal on gun control than their parents or grandparents — despite diverging from their elders on the legalization of marijuana, same-sex marriage and other social issues.\"</span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><br />",
