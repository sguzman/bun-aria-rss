When we talk about fasting, we are talking about something that's deeply connected to the highest expression of our genes.</p> <p>Fasting, itself, is an epigenetic trigger that \"turns on\" certain programs inciting your DNA to print out better copies of you. To put it simply, fasting can make you sexier, well... fast.</p> <p>You're about to go on a life-changing ride and discover how fasting impacts your brain function, metabolism, aging process, and more. And I guarantee you'll be compelled to make some changes in your life to at least get a slice of what the health benefits of fasting can deliver.</p> <p>There are many different types of fasts, but you can actually get most of the benefits while still being able to eat everyday if you utilize one of the strategies I'm going to share with you.</p> <p>The benefits of fasting are clinically proven in study after study, and they're just too good to pass up.
