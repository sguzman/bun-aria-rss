  "description": "<div>July 22, 2019 / Marilyn Mosby’s handling of the Keith Davis Jr. case was about politics too.  There was no investigation into what really happened during the police involved shooting before her office agreed to prosecute him. Keith was collateral damage from <em>repairing </em>the rift between Mosby’s office and the police department, during a change in leadership. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Episode scoring music by Blue Dot Sessions, Taylor Quimby and Spencer Burdette.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This episode was sponsored by SimpliSafe and FabFitFun.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.SimpliSafeUndisclosed.com\">www.SimpliSafeUndisclosed.com</a> </div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.FabFitFun.com\">www.FabFitFun.com</a> use coupon code UNDISCLOSED</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>#undisclosed  #freekeithdavisjr</div>\n<div> </div>\n",
