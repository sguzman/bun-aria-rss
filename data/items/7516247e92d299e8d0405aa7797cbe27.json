Kate and Sharon ruminate on why the true crime genre is especially appealing to women, and how Kate feels a responsibility to the women in true crime; they are often the victims we leave behind in order to follow the movements of men who make up the majority of the perpetrators and the investigators. Join the conversation to learn more about The Bender Family, Kate’s research process, and what evidence collecting may look like in an all-digital future.
