  "description": "<p>Talking with your parents about their finances might prove to be a very difficult conversation- discussing religion and politics may even seem like a walk in the park compared to breaching the topics of retirement, long term care, and wills. Which is why we’re so thankful to have Cameron Huddleston join us to explain how we can go about having these essential conversations with our parents. She has recently published her book “Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk” and she is here to walk us through initiating and leading these conversations with our parents about their finances. Thank you, Cameron, for breaking this down for us and encouraging us to get started!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Fairy Nectar by Kros Strain Brewing Co- a big thanks to Joey in Omaha for donating this beer to the show!
