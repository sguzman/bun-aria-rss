  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) is a Benedict Arnold and his statements are an abomination. He is no friend of the Constitution if he supports the unconstitutionality of the special counsel. Who was it that put spies in the Trump campaign? Amash has sided with the rogue attack on the presidency yet Amash says that it was President Trump who committed impeachable offenses. U.S District Judge Amit Mehta has sided with House Democrats upholding their subpoena of his personal financial records. Republicans need to respond in kind and subpoena the financial records of every federal court judge and Supreme Court Justice in the Washington DC circuit. If this Judicial tyranny continues Trump's business records will be released to the entire record including competitors to the business that his children still run and have an interest in. Then, former Vice President Joe Biden claims that he handed Trump a stable economy and the leftist media just repeats Mayor Pete Buttigieg propaganda over and over. Trump supporters must unite to defend our right to free speech, this is our protection as individuals.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
