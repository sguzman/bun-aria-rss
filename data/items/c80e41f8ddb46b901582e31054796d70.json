Itâ€™s a way to keep the public safe and prevent environmental disasters too. Corrosion is one of the number one ways that infrastructure deteriorates over time, so cathodic protection systems are an essential tool for keeping the constructed environment safe and sound.\n\nLike the t-shirt? https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
