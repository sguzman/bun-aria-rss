  "title": "#53 - The Heart For Murder - The Gruesomeness of Jarrod Wyatt",
  "description": "<p>This week, we look at one of the craziest, most depraved, and bloodiest stories we've ever heard about. An up and coming MMA fighter begins to unravel, culminating in a brutal murder that is both insanely horrific, and just plain insane. See what happens when things go wrong during a mushroom trip, and a trained fighter, with a sick mind, mistakes you for the devil. It isn't pretty. But we do make it hilarious! Stay tuned for the end of the episode for our 1st Annual CIS Scummy Awards, highlighting the worst of the worst of our first year of the show! Train hard, do drugs, and dismember your sparring partner with Jarrod Wyatt!! Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!</p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br> </p><p>New episodes every Tuesday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Crime in Sports!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Small Town Murder</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/crimeinsports\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/crimeinsports</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CrimeInSports\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: <a href=\"mailto:crimeinsports@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">crimeinsports@gmail.com</a></p><p>Donate on Patreon: patreon.com/crimeinsports</p><p>PayPal: paypal.me/crimeinsports</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
