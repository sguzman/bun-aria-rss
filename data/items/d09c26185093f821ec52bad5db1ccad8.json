His name is Steve Silberman and his book is \"NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and The Future of Neurodiversity.\"<br />Today on the show, Steve and I discuss the forgotten history of autism research, how the popular myths we have about autism got their start, theories as to why autism even exists, how parents should approach raising a child on the spectrum, and advice on how to connect with your autistic friends or colleagues.</p>\n",
