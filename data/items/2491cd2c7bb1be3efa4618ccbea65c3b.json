  "content": "Parents and caretakers, <br /><br />We know this isn’t the easiest time for you. You’re juggling work, life, kids and the state of the world today. The struggle is real. Honestly, there’s an 11-year-old child, asking for my help, as I type this. That’s why we’re hosting <a href=\"https://learnathome.withyoutube.com/camp-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">Camp YouTube</a>: a digital learning experience to help parents recreate the fun of summer camp at home. <br /><br />With <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=virtual%20summer%20camp\" target=\"_blank\">Google searches </a>for “virtual summer camps” spiking over the past few weeks, we want to help parents structure this new normal. Starting today, Camp YouTube will spotlight content on the <a href=\"https://learnathome.withyoutube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn@Home</a> site and <a href=\"https://youtube.com/kids/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Kids</a> across beloved summer camp themes, such as arts, adventure, sports, STEM, and more. We’ll have over 1,200 videos programmed during this two-week period with content refreshed every weekday through Sunday, July 5.<br /><br />We’ve made sure there’s something for everyone.  <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T5Y3OLaCNYE/Xu0OCeXXz-I/AAAAAAAAAzc/krskZBpvowkOT2fR1aXt2BiVxbJBxeaCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/learnAtHome_campScroll_V2.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"479\" data-original-width=\"800\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T5Y3OLaCNYE/Xu0OCeXXz-I/AAAAAAAAAzc/krskZBpvowkOT2fR1aXt2BiVxbJBxeaCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/learnAtHome_campScroll_V2.gif\" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3>FOR THE ADVENTURE LOVER </h3><br />If you’re looking to bring the outside in, we’ll have an adventure camp that will help you explore the world around you and appreciate nature.
