  "description": "<div>It’s the last episode of the year, and Lisa wouldn’t even think of leaving 2019 in the dust without telling you her favorite food finds of the year! There are SPECIAL bars, a mind-blowing almond milk, crazy-good nuts, and more! Plus, her absolute favorite finds from Trader Joe’s! And that’s not all… She’s got a soup hack that will keep you warm during these cold winter months. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. When you’re done, head on over to our <a href=\"http://www.hungry-girl.com/foodcast\">Foodcast</a> page for all the finds mentioned in the episode! Until next year… <em>Chew the Right Thing</em>!!!</div>\n",
