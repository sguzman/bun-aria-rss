  "description": "In all U.S. jurisdictions except Wisconsin, passing a bar exam is a requirement to obtain a license to practice law. However, the Covid-19 pandemic forced some state authorities to adopt alternative paths to licensure for recent law school graduates.\nIn the wake of those changes, criticism of the bar exam has blossomed into a movement to reform or eliminate the test altogether. These critics argue that the bar exam, “is an outmoded, discriminatory, and simply ineffective as a barometer of legal competence,” according to Bloomberg Law’s Sam Skolnik.\nWhile defenders of the status-quo argue that the bar is still the best way to evaluate would-be attorneys on the fundamental legal concepts that every lawyer should know.\nIn this first of a three-part series on the bar exam, the [Un]Common Law podcast will look at the arguments for and against preserving the bar exam.\nIn this episode we speak with:\n\nAlexis Ahlzadeh, recent graduate of Emory Law School, now an associate attorney with the Findling Law Firm based in Atlanta, GA.\n\nJoe Patrice, a senior editor and writer at Above the Law.\n\nRoger Schechter, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.\n\nJohanna Miller, director of the Education Policy Center at the ACLU of New York.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
