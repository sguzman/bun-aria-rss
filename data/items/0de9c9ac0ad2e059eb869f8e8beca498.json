  "description": "It's the kind of captivating, complex story that's hard to forget once you hear it. In 2012, star Notre Dame linebacker Manti T'eo's grandmother died. Just hours later, his girlfriend died of leukemia. Rising above the tragedy he seemed unstoppable on the field as Notre Dame went on to a winning season. <br/><br/>But the girlfriend was a hoax. Te'o was the victim of catfishing. He had fallen in love with a fake Facebook profile. In the media frenzy that followed, he went from the golden boy of Notre Dame football to the target of ridicule and attack. In a new documentary on Netflix, <em>Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn't Exist</em>, Manti Te'o gets the opportunity to tell his full story for the first time in nearly ten years. <br/><br/>Host Michel Martin speaks with Te'o about the scandal and how he overcame it.",
