(copy the link to share with your friends and family via text)\n\n\nActivate the raw power of your subconscious to create the life you've always wanted, using six essential lessons from one of the world’s most renowned hypnotherapists in this “nourishing and healing book” (Michael Bernard Beckwith, author of Spiritual Liberation). \nUnsatisfying careers. Volatile, unhealthy relationships. Unfulfilled dreams. Too many of us are living lives that fall short of what we truly desire. But as celebrity hypnotist Kimberly Friedmutter explains in this life-changing audiobook, not only is it possible to design the life of your dreams, but the power to do so already lies within you, in your subconscious mind.\nThe subconscious is the root of your true power and desire; it's your inner child, your authentic self. It is the honest compass that will lead you to a life of happiness, so long as you are able to follow its direction. We all have the power to access it, but as we grow up, we’re taught to stop daydreaming and to follow society’s rules, which makes us disconnect from our subconscious, often with tragic results.\nIn Subconscious Power, Kimberly guides you through six principles that bring your conscious mind in line with your subconscious desires. She shares practical three-minute exercises that will help you transform your relationships, find true love, lose weight after years of struggling with the scale, overcome addictions, and achieve new career successes and heights. Featuring inspiring success stories and the practical tools you need to make meaningful change, Subconscious Power gives “you a pathway to achieve your goals and dreams in an effective and easily understandable manner. This book will improve your life in ways you never thought of” (David Zelon, producer of Soul Surfer). \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
