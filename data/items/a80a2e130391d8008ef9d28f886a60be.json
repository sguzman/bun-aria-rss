  "description": "In Episode #216, I sit down with Dr David Jenkins to discuss the relationship between cholesterol and health.\n\nCholesterol levels are concerningly high among populations consuming a standard Western diet. On the flip side, plant-based diets are often criticised for their lack of cholesterol. We know that cholesterol is an essential component of the human body — but is it necessary to consume it, and is this a concern for plant-based eaters? Dr David Jenkins answers this question and much more in today’s episode.\n\nIn this episode, we dig into cholesterol and the health implications of sub-optimal levels. We discuss the Portfolio Diet, weight loss, and the current research on cholesterol. Dr Jenkins also shares his recommendations on how and what to eat for optimal cholesterol levels, as well as how medication compares to a lifestyle approach.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nResearching Cholesterol & Diet (2:35)\n\nWhat this means for you (15:00)\n\nWeight Loss Factor (17:23)\n\nThe Portfolio Diet Explained (20:14)\n\nNuts & Seeds (30:37)\n\nWeight (39:45)\n\nRaising HDL (44:45)\n\nPlant Sterols (50:51)\n\nShould We Eat Fish? (58:52)\n\nStatins (1:07:49)\n\nOutro (1:11:22)\n\n\nYou can learn more about Dr Jenkins and discover his publications on his University of Toronto profile.
