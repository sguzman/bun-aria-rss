  "description": "<p>We study the fixed-parameter tractability of the following fundamental\nproblem: given two directed graphs $\\vec H$ and $\\vec G$, count the number of\ncopies of $\\vec H$ in $\\vec G$. The standard setting, where the tractability is\nwell understood, uses only $|\\vec H|$ as a parameter. In this paper we take a\nstep forward, and adopt as a parameter $|\\vec H|+d(\\vec G)$, where $d(\\vec G)$\nis the maximum outdegree of $|\\vec G|$. Under this parameterization, we\ncompletely characterize the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem in both\nits non-induced and induced versions through two novel structural parameters,\nthe fractional cover number $\\rho^*$ and the source number $\\alpha_s$. On the\none hand we give algorithms with running time $f(|\\vec H|,d(\\vec G)) \\cdot\n|\\vec G|^{\\rho^*\\!(\\vec H)+O(1)}$ and $f(|\\vec H|,d(\\vec G)) \\cdot |\\vec\nG|^{\\alpha_s(\\vec H)+O(1)}$ for counting respectively the copies and induced\ncopies of $\\vec H$ in $\\vec G$; on the other hand we show that, unless the\nExponential Time Hypothesis fails, for any class $\\vec C$ of directed graphs\nthe (induced) counting problem is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if\n$\\rho^*(\\vec C)$ ($\\alpha_s(\\vec C)$) is bounded. These results explain how the\norientation of the pattern can make counting easy or hard, and prove that a\nclassic algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki and its extensions (Chiba, Nishizeki\nSICOMP 85; Bressan Algorithmica 21) are optimal unless ETH fails.\n</p>",
