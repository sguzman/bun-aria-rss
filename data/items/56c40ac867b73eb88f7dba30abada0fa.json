Machine Gun Kelly broke a glass on his face. Kim K is being sued for her \"SKKN\" skin care name. Did Travis Barker have a bad colonoscopy? Wendy Williams' interview about her possible podcast was disturbing. Meghan and Harry are set to do their reality show, and she wants her sister's suit against her dropped. Nene Leakes' lawsuit might get settled. Real Housewives Ultimate Girls' Trip Ex-Wives is so good! I tell a story about when Brandi Glanville made me cry at a dinner party at Craig's.
