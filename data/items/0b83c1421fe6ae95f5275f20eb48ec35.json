The main conversation is with Coady Willis from Big Business/The Murder City Devils as we continue our discussion about Seattle and figures from that music scene. He gets in depth with us on surreal moments, sarcasm and life as a drummer. Secondly, we have my friend Aymen from the band Holy Pinto that has a unique story in DIY music relocating from the UK to Milwaukee (?!).
