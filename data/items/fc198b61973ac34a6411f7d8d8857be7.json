I was\nreally excited to share some of the new stuff I've built lately in <a\ntitle=\"pandas\" href=\"http://pandas.sourceforge.net\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">pandas</a>, though I didn't have enough time to demo\nfeatures as I would have liked. I also ran out of time to talk about\n<a title=\"statsmodels\" href=\"https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">statsmodels</a>, but I'll post some materials here for\nthose who are interested.</p>\n<p>One thing I showed off which a lot of people have been asking me about is the totally awesome new <a title=\"IPython HTML notebook\" href=\"http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html\" target=\"_blank\">IPython HTML notebook</a>. I don't think I'll ever do a Python demo in anything else, it's just that good for teaching and doing interactive demos. Brian Granger, Fernando Perez, and crew have developed a notebook file format (.ipynb) for saving and sharing these interactive notebooks. I'll post links to my IPython notebooks for the pandas demo and the statsmodels demo I didn't have time for at the end, along with instructions for running them.</p>\n<p>Here are my slides from the talk:</p>\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/9AUCsUdsFs57Vo\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/wesm/data-analysis-and-statistics-in-python-using-pandas-and-statsmodels\" title=\"Data Analysis and Statistics in Python using pandas and statsmodels\" target=\"_blank\">Data Analysis and Statistics in Python using pandas and statsmodels</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/wesm\" target=\"_blank\">Wes McKinney</a></strong> </div>\n\n<p>Now, here's the exciting part: the IPython notebooks. You'll need to install the latest development version of <a title=\"IPython\" href=\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython\" target=\"_blank\">IPython</a> from GitHub. Make sure you have the Python <a title=\"pyzmq\" href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq/2.1.9\" target=\"_blank\">ZeroMQ bindings</a> and install the <a title=\"tornado\" href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tornado\" target=\"_blank\">tornado web server</a>. This ought to work for those (using setuptools):</p>\n<div class=\"github\"><pre><span></span><code>easy_install pyzmq\neasy_install tornado\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Once you've done all that, fire up a terminal and run:</p>\n<div class=\"github\"><pre><span></span><code>ipython notebook --pylab=inline\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>You should see the server fire up and give you a web address like <code>127.0.0.1:8888</code>. Now, you need my demo workbooks. Here is a zip file with everything you need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wesmckinney.com/files/20110915/statmeetup_notebooks.zip\" title=\"Notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Notebooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wesmckinney.com/files/20110915/PandasDemoOutput.pdf\" title=\"PDF of pandas demo\" target=\"_blank\">PDF of pandas demo notebook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wesmckinney.com/files/20110915/StatsmodelsDemoOutput.pdf\" title=\"PDF of statsmodels demo\" target=\"_blank\">PDF of statsmodels demo notebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expand this zip file and launch the IPython notebook in the <strong>same directory</strong> where the <code>.ipynb</code> live. You should be able to run all the code in the pandas demo workbook yourself if you have pandas 0.4 (click \"Run All\"), but the statsmodels notebook uses some very new code from the pandas-integration branch on GitHub and some formula code that is not part of the statsmodels repo. So you can see all the code and output, but if you want to know more, I encourage you to get involved in the project!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"IPython HTML Notebook\" src=\"https://wesmckinney.com/images/ipynb_screenshot.png\"></p>"
