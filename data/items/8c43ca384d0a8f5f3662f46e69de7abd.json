  "title": "Breaking down Dak Prescott's recovery and Matt Ryan's future with the Falcons (Football 10/14)",
  "description": "For one day a week, we transfer from being the Will Brinson Show to the Brady Quinn Football Show and that day is today. On the BQFS (as we like to abbreviate it) the guys discuss the perks of Tuesday Night Football and more scheduling opportunities during this unique COVID-19 impacted season. Next up Will and Brady cover Dak Prescott's road to recovery and how the Cowboys could handle the situation this offseason (6:20). Dallas isn't the only team with an uncertain future. The Falcons are currently in disarray after firing their coach and GM (and others) this week but what does that mean for quarterback Matt Ryan (17:45)? Cutting him isn't really feasible, and a trade might not be super likely either. So what's next for Atlanta? Lastly, the Browns are good (30:00). It's not often we get to say that, but it really seems to be true. Let's enjoy that statement while we can. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @Brady_Quinn, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
