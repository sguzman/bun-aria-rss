  "itunes:summary": "I remember it as if it were yesterday. I got up out of my seat and went forward. I had only been a Christian for a few months. The message I responded to was to be fully, wholeheartedly committed to the Lord and to follow him with all my heart – wherever that might take me.\nOf course, I have had my ups and downs since then, and my fair share of failures. All of us are far from perfect. I still do things that I wish I did not do. But I have been determined to try and follow the Lord with all my heart and be fully committed to him.\nTo be ‘fully committed’ with ‘all your heart’ means 100% commitment. It means seeking to do what the Lord calls you to do. It means rooting out anything that is bad – ruthlessly tearing down the high places and getting rid of the other gods in the midst of life.\nThe Lord is looking for those whose ‘hearts are fully committed’ to him (2 Chronicles 16:9). The psalmist prayed, ‘Give me an undivided heart’ (Psalm 86:11). The expression ‘all your heart’ appears many times throughout the Bible. For example, you are to do the following things ‘with all your heart’:\n\n\nLove the Lord (Deuteronomy 6:4–5; Matthew 22:36–38)\n\nTrust in the Lord (Proverbs 3:5)\n\nObey the Lord (Psalm 119:34,69; 1 Chronicles 29:19)\n\nPraise the Lord (Psalm 111:1; 138:1)\n\nWork for the Lord (Nehemiah 4:6; Colossians 3:23).\n\nThis is how to enjoy life and life in all its fullness (John 10:10). It’s a life of love, trust, gratitude, joy and meaningful work. In the passages for today we see why and how we should live wholeheartedly.",
