  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the powerful and brilliant comedian KIRI PRITCHARD-McLEAN!</p><br><p>A very timely episode, this one, probably one of the most timely of them all so far, short of doing and entirely live and in real time one… The first Films To Be Buried With to be recorded remotely, Brett is joined online by Kiri to get into this whole ever-fascinating cinema and life thing. And get into they very much do, while certainly not avoiding the subject at hand and the reason for the isolation… Do I need to mention it? I think you understand. It came out lovely though, and it’s a really interesting energy which you’ll certainly enjoy when compared to the regular face to face episodes. It’s really unique. So please do expect to hear about “that thing” (to invoke Lauryn Hill), tour cancellations, social media usage in times of quarantine, the Caroline Aherne bursary, dealing with parents / parental management, techniques for hiding tears, not being good with scary films, the joy of Christmas and why it remains within her, and her folks over in Wales. Oh but come on you KNOW that’s the tip of the iceberg. Whatever your current situation, from all of us here at Films To Be Buried With, we wish you nothing but the best of health and sanity in the current environment. I mean, we do anyway. But especially now.
