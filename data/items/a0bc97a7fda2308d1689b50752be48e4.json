These articles (here&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-open-mind-common-sense-project\" target=\"_self\">an example</a>) often include some discussion of a task that even a very young human can perform - e.g. look at an image and describe what objects are in it (though personally I don&#39;t believe this is an indication of intelligence).</p>\n<p>I believe that one of the key reasons that we can produce algorithms that can design super efficient jet engines, but not systems with the rudimentary common sense reasoning capabilities of a 3 year old is the economic context that drives innovation. The airline industry has an annual revenue of 700 billion dollars. No one has (yet) articulated the revenue potential of a technology that can look at a photograph and tell you what is in it.</p>\n<p>The most important (and possibly last) step in the development of artificial intelligence is to create the economic engine that will require and motivate it.</p>",
