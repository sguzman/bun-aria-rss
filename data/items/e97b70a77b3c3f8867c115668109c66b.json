  "description": "It's the one-year anniversary celebration after today's program of The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show. Clay is in NYC and dined with Buck and saw his \"Buck Cave,\" the tiny bachelor pad he had heard about, as well as Buck's scooter. A minute into the show, C&B got serious to answer Jen Psaki's old question regarding, \"What does soft on crime mean?\" Clay addressed \"Jen\" directly and said it means two police officers killed by a gang member let free by Los Angeles DA Gascon. Sen. Rand Paul joins Clay and Buck and reacts to Dr. Fauci’s covid diagnosis, testimony. The Bidas Touch: $100 to fill up your gas tank. Jean-Pierre blames oil companies for high prices -- is it ignorance or dishonesty? Flashback to Ronald Reagan on Jimmy Carter. The new Reagan Democrats are Sanity Democrats. Emailer corrects C&B on Top Gun reference.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
