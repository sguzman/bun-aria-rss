  "description": "Rob Lowe had several revelations over the course of his life. One is that there’s more fun in sobriety than in being under the influence. Another is that he should have had a sex tape scandal later in life when it actually would have helped his career instead of nearly killing it. And the latest is that he needs to keep doing different things to keep from getting bored, including hosting a game show alongside a giant robotic arm. Rob talks with Marc about these discoveries and the moments that led to them, including his early Brat Pack movies, his turn to comedic roles, and his three recurring nightmares, one of which came true. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.trutv.com/shows/tacoma-fd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tacoma FD on TruTV</a>, <a href=\"http://stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stamps.com</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/51evn6HmX9KhCwJA2MAuYx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stay Free: The Story of The Clash on Spotify</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/happy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Happy on SyFy</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
