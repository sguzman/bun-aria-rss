  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about everyone being pissed Tim Tebow for potentially signing with the Jags, the latest update in the Aaron Rodgers drama, Vladimir Putin putting on an absolute show on the ice last night in Russia, and everything else going on around the NFL. Joining the show is 9 year NFL veteran at DB, host of the Man-To-Man Podcast, Everything DB, friend of the program, Darius Butler to chat about why he thinks the country of the NFL wouldn't stand a chance in the Olympics, his thoughts on Tebow going to Jacksonville and why he thinks it could actually work out, and much more (21:31-46:40). Later, Pat and AJ chat more about Tebow going to Jacksonville, reports coming out that people within the Jaguars building aren't happy about the move, Pat and AJ up their bet to $20 million if Pat finishes top 40 of a Champions Tour event before he turns 65, and everything else going on in the sports world (48:12-1:43:34).
