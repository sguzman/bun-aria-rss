  "description": "<p>Economist Paul Krugman is well-known for his pro-Democrat stances. Recently, he's claimed that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has said that if the Individual Mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, is repealed, 22 million Americans will \"lose\" their health insurance. What he doesn't say is that the vast majority of those 22 million people are simply opting out. They are _choosing_ not to have health insurance. But here's the problem with CBO forecasts: they're usually wrong. And they're wrong in almost the exact same way. Why are the CBO forecasts so bad? Why do they consistently get it wrong in such a consistent way? And what does this mean for our economy? James Harrigan and Antony Davies discuss this and more in this week's episode of Words and Numbers.</p> <p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Emirates’ new 777</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/2017/11/13/new-emirates-first-class-suites-on-777-300er-revealed-at-the-dubai-air-show/#13ce46a256b8\"> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/2017/11/13/new-emirates-first-class-suites-on-777-300er-revealed-at-the-dubai-air-show/#13ce46a256b8</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curing disease by rewriting our DNA</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-scientists-try-edit-faulty-dna-inside-patients-body-cure-genetic-disease/\"> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-scientists-try-edit-faulty-dna-inside-patients-body-cure-genetic-disease/</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iHeart Radio:</span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iheart-creditors-reject-another-offer-from-company-as-they-push-for-chapter-11-1512090362\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/iheart-creditors-reject-another-offer-from-company-as-they-push-for-chapter-11-1512090362</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Jeff Sessions on marijuana:</span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/sessions-hints-at-a-coming-crackdown-on-recreational-weed.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/sessions-hints-at-a-coming-crackdown-on-recreational-weed.html</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/sessions-opioid-news-conference-marijuana/index.html\"> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/sessions-opioid-news-conference-marijuana/index.html</span></a></p> <p><a href= \"http://reason.com/blog/2017/10/26/sessions-continues-to-push-gateway-drug\"> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">http://reason.com/blog/2017/10/26/sessions-continues-to-push-gateway-drug</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><strong>Foolishness of the week</strong><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/politics/republican-tax-bill-moves-closer-to-senate-passage.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/politics/republican-tax-bill-moves-closer-to-senate-passage.html</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><strong>The CBO</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/07/22/cbo-three-fourths-of-coverage-difference-between-obamacare-gop-bills-driven-by-individual-mandate/#327a3b9e3627\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/07/22/cbo-three-fourths-of-coverage-difference-between-obamacare-gop-bills-driven-by-individual-mandate/#327a3b9e3627</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><strong>Follow us on Twitter</strong><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntonyDavies\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://twitter.com/AntonyDavies</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><strong>Join the Words and Numbers Backstage FB group, where the conversation continues</strong><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/</span></a></p>",
