  "description": "<p>Recent experimental advances have inspired the development of theoretical\ntools to describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems. Among them\nan exact representation of quantum spin systems in terms of classical\nstochastic processes has been proposed. Here we provide first steps towards the\nextension of this stochastic approach to bosonic systems by considering the\none-dimensional quantum quartic oscillator. We show how to exactly parameterize\nthe time evolution of this prototypical model via the dynamics of a set of\nclassical variables. We interpret these variables as stochastic processes,\nwhich allows us to propose a novel way to numerically simulate the time\nevolution of the system. We benchmark our findings by considering analytically\nsolvable limits and providing alternative derivations of known results.\n</p>",
