CrySis ransomware is decrypted. SpamTorte 2.0 is out, and it's thinking big. A Trojan may be implicated in the Tesco fraud campaign, and it may have more banks in its crosshairs. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs shares the findings of their latest report on the Dark Web, and Ping Identity's Pamela Dingle explains the Digital Transformation Journey. And watch out for the AdultFriendFinder-themed spam that will follow in the breach's wake.",
