  "description": "<p>Director X is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, he’s also a social activist and a voice for change. His catalog of music videos reads like a who’s who of Hall of Fame musicians. Some notable artists that he’s directed for are: Future, Drake, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Busta Rhymes, T.I., 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, The-Dream, and Usher. In addition to being a music director, he also is an established movie director. He directed the 2018 remake of Superfly along with several other films. Director X is focusing a large portion of his energy these days on social justice and stopping the rapid gun violence issue happening in Toronto. In episode 90, he went over his historic career with us and talked about his journey in the industry. He also gave us an inside look on what's going on in Toronto and the work being done to help young people deal with conflict resolution. #videodirector #directorx #littlex EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com EYL University 40% off Annual Tuition Code: EARNERS Guest IG: @directorx --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
