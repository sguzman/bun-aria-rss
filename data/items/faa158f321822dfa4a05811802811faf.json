  "description": "<p>Our episode with Justin Townes Earle was scheduled to run next month. But after we heard about Earle's passing over the weekend, we decided to put it out sooner. It's a deeply sad conversation in some places. Especially given his passing. However, it's also incredibly soulful, funny and searching. And the performances, culled from Earle's last release, <em>The Saint of Lost Causes</em>, are brilliant. Bruce Headlam takes the reigns this episode for what's turned out to be a fitting tribute to one of the great, dynamic young performers and songwriters that's now gone way too soon. Rest in peace, Justin Townes Earle [1982-2020].</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record's YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here: <a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
