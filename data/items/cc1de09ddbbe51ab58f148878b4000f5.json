Now he’s wondering if he should continue the car seat battle or if there’s a happy medium where the kids are safe and he’s calm enough to pilot the car. \nThen on Slate Plus, they discuss the latest automated baby gear: strollers! \nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
