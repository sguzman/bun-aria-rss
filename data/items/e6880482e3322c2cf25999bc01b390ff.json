  "description": "NFL ownership is one of the most exclusive, fiercely protected clubs imaginable.

Which means that entering this club requires another powerful person to want to leave. Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder, you may have noticed, does not want to go anywhere. But, today, ESPN’s Don Van Natta breaks news about how the most controversial owner in football has been fighting, in secret, to keep his Washington Commanders. And he brings us deep inside the viciously guarded club that may finally want him out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
