And Al makes a great point about how the scriptures that people choose to quarrel over are the very ones that urge believers to be united in Christ.\n\nWatch the Unashamed overtime show, only on BlazeTV: https://BlazeTV.com/Unashamed\n\nGet Uncanceled by Phil Robertson, available now: https://www.amazon.com/Uncanceled-Finding-Meaning-Accusations-Condemnation/dp/1400230179\n\nVisit http://BoxofAwesome.com and use the code: PHIL for 20% off your first box\n\nVisit https://FastGrowingTrees.com/Robertson and get 15% off your entire order\nLearn more about your ad choices.
