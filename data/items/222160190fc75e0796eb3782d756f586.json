  "description": "<p>In this interview, Helen Appleby shares the top <a href=\"https://www.theunwrittenrules.com/\" target=\"_blank\">‘unwritten rules</a>’ and her own leadership journey. </p><p>“As a little girl, my dad told me that girls could do anything that boys can do, and I believed him.But what he didn’t tell me was things can be a lot harder for girls,” explains Helen. “He didn’t tell me the world of work is different for women, and I had to discover for myself and learn how to navigate the many ‘unwritten rules’ for women at work.” </p><p>In her book, Helen has included everything she knows now, that she wishes she had known earlier in her career.  Things like how to</p><ul><li>make your invisible work visible</li><li>build self confidence</li><li>find mentors and sponsor that will accelerate your career</li><li>have difficult conversations and resolve conflict </li><li>manage up…so that you can advance your career and contribution. </li></ul><p>Trilogy Effect’s Managing Director Heather Marasse agrees that, for women, often a lot of their important work remains invisible.  She says, “Sometimes the work women do remains invisible because they do it so well. It doesn’t get noticed because leadership is more focused on exceptions and variances in performance. Women are reluctant to promote their own successes and instead can develop a creeping resentment that their efforts go unrecognized.” </p><p>In this podcast, Helen and Heather provide real life examples and practical tips for women leaders as they share their own experiences and leadership development expertise.</p><p>Links to helpful resources and information about some of the tools and concepts mentioned on the show:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram to become a better leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/2017/3/30/boss-like-a-mentor-1-4yrry?rq=mentor\">How to boss like a mentor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://trilogyeffect.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f3bb4d65509a4554061667986&id=bc6ea99e78\">Trilogy Effect’s free newsletter full of leadership advice and practical tips.</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
