  "description": "<p>“It’s the most important election in history.” That’s the rhetoric you see plastered across the news and social media. Perhaps, people view this election as such because they believe it to be the government’s job to provide things for them. This is apparent on both sides of the aisle. Democrats want free health care and education. Republicans want a border wall and tariffs on imported goods. But, is it the government’s job to provide services that Democrats want? Is the government a tool of protection for American businesses that Republicans view it as? Join hosts Antony Davies and James R. Harrigan as they discuss the proper role of government and more on this episode of Words & Numbers.</p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Show Notes:</span></h2> <p>Foolishness of the week.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-10/54551-MBR.pdf\"><u>CBO reports $782 billion deficit for fiscal year ending 9/30/2018</u></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/11/02/thanks-to-obamacare-government-debt-is-worse-than-you-think/#31c5bb2115f9\"> <u>Why does the deficit not match the increase in the debt?</u></a></p> <p>Topic of the week: The midterm elections.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.insidesources.com/the-most-important-election-ever-no/?fbclid=IwAR3TEeuxBcT37Y1BXfhOutX6LsoE1c4k2234SDXZ2SaXNwKJWmdBvp9ElFA\"> <u>Is this the most important election ever?</u></a></p> <p><a href= \"https://reason.com/archives/2018/10/26/this-isnt-the-most-important-election-of\"> <u>This isn’t the most important election ever!</u></a></p> <p>Join the conversation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\"><u>Antony Davies on Twitter</u></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesRHarrigan\"><u>James R.
