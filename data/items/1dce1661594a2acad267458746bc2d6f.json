  "title": "PMS 2.0 158 - Feel Good Friday. Welcome To The Zion Era & Darius Butler Stops By",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys do a full break down of Zion Williamson’s NBA debut and Pat explains why he doesn’t think Pelicans Head Coach Alvin Gentry handled the situation correctly and why Zion looked so lost at the start of the game, when he looked like the most unstoppable player on the court in the 4th quarter. Pat and the boys also cover whether or not Eli Manning will be inducted in the Hall of Fame once he becomes eligible, and give some key stats to help his claim. Also joining the program is former Defensive Back for the New England Patriots, Carolina Panthers, and Indianapolis Colts, one of the smoothest athletes on the planet, and friend of the show, Darius Butler. Darius and Pat chat about the Super Bowl matchup and Darius explains why he thinks the 49ers defense might be too much for the Chiefs offense to handle, gives his take on the Aaron Hernandez documentary as a guy who knew him for a long time and was also a teammate with him on the Patriots, and chats with Pat about the Antonio Brown situation and how he hopes he will soon get help as more drama continues to surround him. Darius also gives his Super Bowl LIV prediction (30:07-43:45). Pat also gives his thoughts on Donovan McNabb’s recent comments about Terrell Owens being the reason that their Eagles team broke up after the 2005 Super Bowl loss, and Pat reads a statement sent to him by TO regarding the situation. Pat and the guys also go through a few different scenarios in which the Bengals may give up the #1 pick in this years NFL draft. Don’t forget to send your Super Bowl picks in with the hashtag #PatIPredict, and if you’re correct, you’ll be entered in for a chance to win $1,000. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
