  "description": "It was revealed that several terrorists from the watchlist have entered the United States undetected through our southern border. President Biden and the left don't care about human life, they just want to control it. While they claim to care about human life their policies on abortion, national security, and science prove the contrary. Will Americans actually vote for someone that doesn't care about what happens outside of the United States? Imagine taking that approach with Germany in WWII. After two years Americans can now fly without wearing a mask. No more getting arrested or thrown off airplanes because your 3-year-old won't keep their mask on. Yet our federal government resisted letting go of this power until a judge struck it down. Then, the same Administration that is still holding January 6th prisoners, and used the DOJ against concerned parents, and attacks capitalism through the degrowth climate change movement is now enacting a self-imposed ban on defending ourselves against satellite weapons in space. United Airlines claims to be committed to a \"carbon-free future\" however such a future would kill us. Plants process carbon dioxide to create the air we breathe. It's simply not the job of an airline CEO to be woke. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
