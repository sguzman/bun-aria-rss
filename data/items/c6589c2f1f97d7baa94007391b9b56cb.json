  "description": "It's officially May, but it's never too early to take a look at next year's draft class. On this Pick Six-Cover 3 crossover podcast, we take a look at the 2021 NFL Draft and the prospects we'll be watching all year (3:30). How close is Justin Fields to Trevor Lawrence for the claim as the nation's best QB? The top two quarterbacks are pretty evident at this point but names like Jamie Newman, Brock Purdy and Trey Lance are all ones to monitor (20:20). Could next year's receiving class match 2020's (29:15)? With names like Ja'Marr Chase, Justyn Ross and Devonta Smith, 2021 might just have a chance. We know all about Clemson's Travis Etienne but a few other running backs could creep into the first round conversation as well (36:30). And finally, why we should all take notice of Penei Sewell out at Oregon (41:45).\nFor top notch college football coverage, make sure to download and subscribe to the 'Cover 3 college football' podcast.
