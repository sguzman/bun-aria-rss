  "description": "<p>If time feels weird to you lately, you’re not alone. The pandemic has changed the pace of life for people around the world. We’ll talk to a psychologist about how our sense of time works. We’ll look back into the past to see how a similar pandemic played out 100 years ago. Plus, we’ll ask experts to tell us what they think life will be like six months from now. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and virus podcasters Kara and Gilly are back to tell you how you can be a part of history! Warning: Boogers are involved. Our Moment of Um answers the question: why do your arms move when you walk?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Stop Bullying Speak Up (<a href=\"http://includesomeone.com\" class=\"default\">http://includesomeone.com</a>)</p>\n<p>KiwiCo (<a href=\"https://kiwico.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">https://kiwico.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Laurel Springs Online School (<a href=\"https://laurelsprings.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">https://laurelsprings.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>AncestryHealth (<a href=\"http://ancestry.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">https://ancestryhealth.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Daily Harvest (<a href=\"https://dailyharvest.com\" class=\"default\">https://dailyharvest.com</a>)</p>\n<p>General Mills Pillsbury (<a href=\"https://www.pillsbury.com/products/cinnamon-rolls\" class=\"default\">https://www.pillsbury.com/products/cinnamon-rolls</a>)</p>\n",
