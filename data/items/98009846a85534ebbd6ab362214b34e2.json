  "description": "On today's show, Pat recaps his in-ring promo debut on NXT with AJ and Darius, and looks ahead to his fight on Saturday night with Adam Cole which will be live on the WWE Network starting at 7 PM EST. Joining the show is Indianapolis Colts General Manager and friend of the program, Chris Ballard. Pat, AJ, Darius, and Chris discuss how Covid has changed the day to day operations of the start of the football season, how they plan on having the locker room hold each other accountable, why the Colts ultimately chose to go with Phil Rivers and how he's looked so far, and what Chris has heard regarding the NFL considering a bubble atmosphere for the NFL Playoffs (4:53-22:37). Next, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero joins the show to chat about everything happening in the NFL with the start of training camp. They discuss the league's testing protocols and how very few players are on the inactive/Covid list right now, where he expects some of the marquee free agents left to wind up, how teams are planning on preparing for players to be missing time with Covid, if the NFL has discussed certain teams being able to have fan's in the stands and whether or not that will create a competitive advantage, and how the media's relationship with players is bound to change in interviews with everything being over zoom this season (24:51-49:28). Later, WWE Superstar, color commentator of Friday Night Smackdown, and friend of the program, Corey Graves joins the show. Pat and Corey chat about the match on Saturday night and what tips or pieces of advice he would give Pat to secure a victory, how long he's been in the wrestling business, if there have ever been times that he hasn't been comfortable calling something that happened in a match, and what he's looking forward to the most at NXT Takeover and Summerslam (52:06-1:09:35). Don't forget to watch NXT Takeover tomorrow night (8/22) at 7 PM EST to see Pat send a man's soul into outer space, subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow as we close in on a MASSIVE giveaway once we reach 1 million subscribers, and send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch.
