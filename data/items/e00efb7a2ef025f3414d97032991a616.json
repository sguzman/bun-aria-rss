  "description": "<p>Most parents want to raise their children to be honest adults, so the first time that they catch their child in a lie it may come as an unpleasant surprise. But psychologists’ research has found that lying is a normal part of childhood. In fact, it’s a developmental milestone. Victoria Talwar, PhD, of McGill University, talks about why kids lie, how lying is tied to cognitive development, how children understand the morality of lying (including the “gray areas” of keeping secrets and tattling), and how parents can encourage truth-telling and honesty in their children. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"http://talwarresearch.com/staff/victoria-talwar-ph-d/\">Victoria Talwar, PhD</a></p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.speakingofpsychology.org\">Speaking of Psychology Home Page</a></p>",
