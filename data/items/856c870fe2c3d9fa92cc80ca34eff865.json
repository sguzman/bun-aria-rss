  "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Elisabeth and Melissa are good friends and enthusiastic travelers, who often journey together on planes and in cars across the country. While their traveling styles mesh for the most part, they are divided on a hot-button issue: the correct way to de-plane once you've arrived at your destination. Elisabeth, who prefers to take the aisle seat, believes that the aisle-sitter bears some burden of judgment, and may choose to wait a reasonable amount of time before stepping into the aisle, without asking permission of his or her seatmates. Melissa, on the other hand, is frequently a window-seater, and believes that people should abide by the \"row by row\" rule as a general rule. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>WHO IS RIGHT, and WHO IS WRONG?
