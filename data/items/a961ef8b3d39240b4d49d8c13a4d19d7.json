  "description": "The gang is back for an epic 2022! This week, Jackson steps off his soap box and takes a seat to join the conversation. (Don’t worry…ranting to follow). Everyone puts their heads together to try and make certain rap songs family friendly, Livy educates everyone on the art of the fitted sheet, and Jackson goes full-on Scottish. A sprawling fast food discussion ensues that will surely be referenced in academic papers. Plus, Omicron itself calls in to profess both its iron-fist rule and its fandom of the show...so sweet! \n A big thanks to our sponsors! \n Athletic Greens: Get a free 1 year supply of Vitamin D and 5 free travel packs with your first purchase!
