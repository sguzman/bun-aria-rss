  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden's speech had the worst ratings in recent history. Biden's senseless rhetoric claimed that January 6th, 2021 was the worst attack on American democracy since the Civil war. What about the Pearl Harbor attack, or the 9-11 attacks? Then, in chapter one of \"American Marxism\" Mark breakdowns how the dire growth of Marx's philosophy has taken root within U.S. culture. This is a movement that infiltrates institutions through propaganda and by dispiriting the public. That is their goal and death by a thousand cuts is their plan. Later, Critical Race Theory is spreading like cancer throughout all of America. When Biden says he wants to reimagine the economy he means destroying American businesses, and the people that support them, are the greatest threat to capitalism. Afterward, fuel prices are surging at the pump following John Kerry's reckless pseudo diplomacy. Biden won't stop until we live in a country that has to ration high-priced fuel and depend on electric cars.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
