These two guests are hilarious and when you bring them together on this podcast, THEY ARE FIRE. You'd think that leading GOP strategist RickWilson and liberal writer Molly Jong-Fast would have nothing in common, but you're wrong. They have two very important things in common; they hate Trump and they love our country.
