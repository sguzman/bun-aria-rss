  "description": "<p>Ari Eldjarn and I drove around in Iceland and did a podcast about that beautiful country while we did. Ari is a comedian in Reykjavik. One of the first comedians, to be more precise. He and I hung out for 3 days while I was there and so we got on the mics in his car and I just asked him questions about his country for a while. It's one of those road trip episodes I do sometimes. So, come sit in the back, don't interrupt us, and eavesdrop  on our conversation. Don't forget to watch a new This Is Not Happening this Thursday night at 12am eastern, 11pm Central on Comedy Central.</p>",
