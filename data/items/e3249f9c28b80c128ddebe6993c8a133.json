While he made a few deals this year as the Covid-19 pandemic roiled markets, he hasn’t been quite as active as he was during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.</p><p>Why is that? Joining this week to discuss why is Larry Pitkowsky, co-managing partner at GoodHaven Capital Management. His GoodHaven Fund counts Berkshire Hathaway as its top holding.
