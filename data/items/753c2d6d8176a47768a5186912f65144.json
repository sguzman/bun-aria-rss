  "description": "In this week’s podcast, we hear from an author and an editor. First, Louis DeSipio and Rodolfo de la Garza are authors of U.S. Immigration in the Twenty-First Century: Making Americans, Remaking America (Westview Press, 2015). DeSipio is professor of political science and Chicano/Latino studies at University of California, Irvine; de la Garza is Eaton Professor of Administrative Law and Municipal Science in the Department of Political Science, Columbia University.\n\nDeSipio and Garza’s book covers a lot of ground, including demographic research on immigration patterns in the US as well as a detailed account of immigration policy change in the US. The book is deep in social science research, but also written in a way that makes it accessible to a wider audience, and would make a great addition to an under graduate syllabus.\n\nLater, we hear from Deana Rohlinger the book reviews editor for Mobilization. Deana tells us about the books reviewed in the latest issue.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
