  "description": "Whether we like it or not, the zombies are coming for us all. Films, books, computer games, comics and TV shows. From historical and mythical zombies to claims to have proven the scientific truth behind zombification. From the gruesome, cannibalistic monsters of horror, to the harmless creatures of children’s playground games. There are zombie flash mobs and parades, zombie cocktails and drinks. There’s zombie capitalism and zombie corporations. And, of course, the zombie apocalypse.\n\nEpisode 12 of Words To That Effect explores the complex cultural history of zombies, from the cane fields of Haiti to the Hollywood screen, from the mindless, shuffling undead to the concept of zombie consciousness. I am joined by Prof Roger Luckhurst, author of Zombies: A Cultural History.",
