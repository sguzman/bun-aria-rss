And most dangerously, it has wormed its way like a parasite into the psyche of much of Black America. So what do you do when the killer's inside the house? Black psychologist Dr. Kevin Cokley takes us deep within to understand the psychological harm of white supremacy - and how to heal from the generational wounds it's inflicted.
