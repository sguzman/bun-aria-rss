  "description": "Lilian is suffering from a nasty cold.  Lynda persuades her that she can’t possibly be a witch in the rewilding woods. Faced with the possibility of disappointed children, Lynda volunteers.  Lilian shows her the rather haphazard ropes, and Lynda quails a little.  Nervously, she awaits the children and her cue to flit through the woods.  Once they arrive, she is swept up in it all.  Her performance is lovely.  She accepts congratulations with great relief. \nDavid and Ruth have brought Pip and Rosie to the Halloween in the woods.  But David is still bitter and angry.  Ruth tries to help him understand, but he blames Ben for what he’s done.  While the others are enjoying the Halloween Trail, he phones Ben, but gets no reply.  Ruth is thinking how awful it must be for Chelsea and Tracy.  She gives Tracy a call.  Words are hard to find, but she wants them to know she’s thinking of them.  Focussed on Chelsea, Tracy finds it hard to respond. \nChelsea is hiding away in her room, pleading college work, but worrying about the procedure she faces tomorrow.  Tracy and the whole family are caring and want to help. Tracy brings her specially chosen food, all her favourites, which she doesn’t really want. She tells her mum to thank Brad for the chocolate he’d given her, and thanks her mum for being there. She might just eat a little.  She doesn’t think she’ll sleep tonight. Tracy comforts her daughter.",
