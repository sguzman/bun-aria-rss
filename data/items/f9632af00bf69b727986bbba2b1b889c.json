  "description": "<p>In this episode of Architecture, Design & Photography we sit down with Gabriel Keith Sutton, Furnituremaker, Designer and Craftsman located in Biddeford, ME.   Gabe is a  self-taught furniture maker and designer that hails from a long line of craftsmen. His great grandfather was a gunsmith and furniture maker in Southern Ohio, his grandfather was the head of Industrial Technology at Kent State University, and his father was a cabinetmaker.   Gabe began building furniture in a small shop 19 years ago with a  passion to create unique furniture that lasts for generations. A lot of Gabe's early work and current inspiration comes from the clean lines and elegant proportions of antique Danish furniture and the simple beauty of Japanese architecture. </p>\n",
