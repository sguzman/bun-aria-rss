  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, What Omarosa is doing is the equivalent of political blackmail and the media loves it. The media covered the story with little regard for the legality or security implications of what had been recorded and released. Their goal is just like it was with the media’s never-ending coverage of the Stormy Daniels drama — get someone on camera willing to bash the president at all costs and worry about the implications later. Also, Omarosa’s book is #6 on amazon’s top 100, beating her at #5 is Dr. Michael Pillsbury. Pillsbury appeared on Life, Liberty and Levin Sunday night to discuss the China threat. Why does the media promote Omarosa and ignore Pillsbury? Because the media manipulates what you hear and read. Later, more than 100 newspapers will publish editorials complaining about Trump’s “anti-press” rhetoric. Do we really need newspapers or TV networks who say the same thing? That’s just like Russia TV. Then, in today's Manafort trial the Special Counsel called its last witness today resting their case and the defense requested an acquittal. Judge T.S. Ellis ruled that the verdict will not be sealed. Collusion and conspiracy to defraud in an election are conspicuously absent in this trial as are any Russian agents attempting the interfere. Rudy Giuliani speculates that Mueller will be done with investigation by September. Robert Mueller is a greater danger to this country than Vladimir Putin in terms of our Constitutional order. We cannot allow a rogue prosecutor to violate the Constitution.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
