  "description": "Kane continues to push the envelope of Hip Hop by merging it with R&B and working with the legendary Patti LaBelle.  After touring with Patti, Kane took notes of what he could incorporate within his show once again proving he was more than a Hip Hop artist, he was an artist period.  He goes out on his 1st headlining tour with Digital Underground, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte & 3rd Bass.  Memories of backstage water gun fights and building with a young Tupac Shakur are takeaways from these more innocent times.
