  "description": "<p>Comedy can be a tough business, and there are so many great comedians who go unnoticed for far too long. They keep grinding and get so good that when their time comes, they leave quite an impression. This week&rsquo;s guest has done just that. She&rsquo;s toured clubs, colleges, cruise ships, and now she will be making her Netflix debut on <em>Tiffany Haddish Presents:</em> <em>They Ready. </em>It&rsquo;s Erin Jackson! I have admired Erin for years now, and you&rsquo;ll definitely be able to tell by how much of a stumble-mumbling buffoon I am for most of this conversation. Erin has been everywhere from interning at CNN during George W. Bush&rsquo;s inauguration to now performing on the largest streaming platform on the planet. Here are five words to describe this episode: Josh Harnett pays your rent.&nbsp;</p>",
