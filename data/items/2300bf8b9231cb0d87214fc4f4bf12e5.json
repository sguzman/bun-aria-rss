  "description": "Faced with a major terrorist threat, states seem to reach instinctively for the most coercive tools in their arsenal and, in doing so, risk exacerbating the situation. This policy response seems to be driven in equal parts by a lack of understanding of the true nature of the threat, an exaggerated faith in the use of force, and a lack of faith that democratic values are sufficiently flexible to allow for an effective counter-terrorism response.\nDrawing on a wealth of data from both historical and contemporary sources, Thomas David Parker's Avoiding the Terrorist Trap: Why Respect for Human Rights is the Key to Defeating Terrorism (World Scientific, 2019) addresses common misconceptions underpinning flawed counter-terrorist policies, identifies the core strategies that guide terrorist operations, consolidates the latest research on the underlying drivers of terrorist violence, and demonstrates how a comprehensive and coherent counter-terrorism strategy grounded in respect for human rights and the rule of law is the only truly effective approach to defeating terrorism.\nWorld Scientific is offering NBN's listeners a discount on this book:\n-55% discount code (Hardback): P995PARKERHC\n-30% discount code (E-Book): P995PARKEREB\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
