  "title": "Ep. 674 - Super Straight Pride",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a new online trend has some people declaring themselves “superstraight.” The Left has condemned it as transphobic, but then again they condemn everything as transphobic. Also five headlines including BLM protesters fighting against racism by harassing little girls on their way to a cheerleading competition, Minneapolis braces for rioting as the Derek Chauvin trial begins, and lonely people have given rise to a new trend: cow cuddling. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss a pastor who got himself fired after he gave a sermon telling women that they have a responsibility to look attractive to their husbands. Did he have a point? I’ll see how many people I can tick off when we discuss that.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
