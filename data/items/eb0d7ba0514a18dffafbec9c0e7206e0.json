  "description": "The Conclusion of the \"Story of Hong Gildong\" takes us from the household drama of last episode to a story that spans the entirety of the Korean peninsula, with Gildong earning his title of the Korean Robin Hood. It then moves beyond Korea to mythical lands, where Gildong battles demons and becomes a doctor. Or pretends to be a doctor. I mean, it's a frontier setting in the 1600s, let's not split hairs. It's basically the same thing. The creature this time, is cactus cat. It's a cat who wants to get drunk and party like it's 1910.
