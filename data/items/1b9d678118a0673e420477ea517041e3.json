  "title": "WHY JOSH PECK DOESN'T SPEAK TO DRAKE BELL ANYMORE â€” BFFs EP. 74",
  "description": "<p>The BFFs are in Fort Lauderdale for an impromptu in person episode. Dave kicks off the show announcing Karim has been fired and what happened. We discuss David Dobrik vs Jeff Wittek and the fallout after David finally spoke out about the crane incident. We also talk about Casey Neistat's documentary about Dobrik that has been years in the making, and does not paint David in the best light. We talk Bri's new boobs reveal and Josh's relationship with Mads Lewis, and an update on Josh's date with Corinna Kopf. \n\nJosh Peck also joins the program to talk all things Drake and Josh, his fractured relationship with Drake since the show ended, his time as a member of the Vlog Squad, and the start of his standup comedy career. \n\nSupport Our Sponsors!\n\nCoinBase: Sign up at https://barstool.link/CoinbaseBFF for $10 in free Bitcoin.\n\nGetUpside: Download the FREE GetUpside App Now!
