This week, they're discussing the complex postmodernist theories of Jean Boudrillard. You'll find our what a simulacrum is, you'll find out if you live in a hyperreality, and you'll find out what kind of stapler Dan uses (Fair warning: you'll probably only find out that last thing). Also, Connor gripes about Best Buy and blacks out at Star Wars.</strong></p>",
