  "description": "<p>This week we’re taking a Second Drink of the second half of Season 3. To kick off this Revisited, we are joined by cinematographer and director, Randall Einhorn! Randall discusses what it was like to shoot The Office, direct episodes and the invention of the pooty scooty. Afterwards, Jenna and Angela answer more fan questions and go over everything we missed from Back from Vacation to The Job. We learn about a Spam museum, we hear from Jackie Debatin who played Elizabeth the Stripper, and we have some Keanu Reeves crossover with The Office. This second drink is so good, you won’t want to miss out.</p>\n",
