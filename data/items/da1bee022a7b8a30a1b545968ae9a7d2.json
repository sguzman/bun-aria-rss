  "description": "<p>You'll feel truly ~vaccinated~ after this ep of Las Cultch, in which the boys and the volcanically talented/criminally insane Sarah Squirm discuss literally the funniest things they've ever seen (Reno 911: Miami, some shit from Shrek, news anchor fails, etc.), the power of identifying as annoying, epic fails!!!! (our thoughts are with the grape stomping lady, Scarlet who took a tumble and the two girls who got involved with the shit in a cup), practical special effects, sci-fi make-up and creating body horror, how The Wizard of Oz is the greatest and perhaps only film of all time, the influence of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, the crossroads where RHONY currently finds itself (is this now a Bravo podcast?), flops named Dababy and Matt Damon, how a certain show in the zeitgeist (sorry!) maybe did not necessarily nail a depiction of ass-eating and Edward Scissorhands. Also, is Donald Trump's hair.... kinda cool?! Something to think about.
