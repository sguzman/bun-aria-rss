Brandon, Chad, Fred and Channing open up the discussion talking about the sudden loss of friend and former NFL player Vincent Jackson and how he was found days after passing away. \"Did anyone check on him?\" Brandon poses the question which leads him into doing a mental check-in with all the guys. </p><p>In a special moment of vulnerability and raw emotion, the guys are brought to tears as they sit and talk about deep life discussions.
