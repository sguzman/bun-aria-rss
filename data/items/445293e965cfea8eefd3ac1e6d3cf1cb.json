  "description": "Hello! My name is Karin and I'd like to welcome you to One Minute Danish from the Radio Lingua Network. In this podcast I'm going to be teaching you the basics of Danish. The great thing about this language course is that you'll be learning all you need to know in just 60 seconds - or thereabouts! Each one minute language lesson will equip you with just enough Danish to help you get by in lots of situations, either on holiday, or on a business trip to Denmark, or just to impress your Danish-speaking friends or colleagues. Our course will be starting very soon. In the meantime, visit our website on http://www.oneminutelanguages.com",
