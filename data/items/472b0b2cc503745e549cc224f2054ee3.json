  "description": "<p>It's episode 260 and the human race is in peril once again! Please welcome the closer of our Wine and Crime guest host series, Amanda! First, Em covers a story close to Minnesota (but not quite close enough) with the story of Wisconsin's Old Baraboo Inn, not to be confused with Caribou Coffee. But if anyone out there is at a Caribou in Baraboo right now, please let us know. Then Amanda covers the case of Teresita Basa, a story that's part true crime, part paranormal, and totally right up our alley aka none of us would have any qualms haunting anyone's partner to solve a murder. And did Hannah Montana set unreasonable expectations for what touring looks like? ...and that's why we drink!</p>\n",
