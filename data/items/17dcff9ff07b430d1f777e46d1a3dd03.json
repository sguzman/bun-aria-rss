  "description": "Two stories from Japanese folklore today dealing with the consequences of our actions. The first has a woman chasing a dumpling across her floor…and into a mysterious, far-away land. The second is what happens when a horrible tragedy brings two people together…only to have their fates tear them apart. The creature is the Peluda, a vicious turtle dragon (not Bowser, though) who’s mad about not being allowed on Noah’s ark. He’s working out his emotions in…less than healthy ways (by killing everything). — Sponsors: Handy! Get your first 3-hour learning for only $29 when you sign up for a cleaning plan.
