  "description": "<p>r/Storiesaboutkevin In today's episode, OP lives in South Africa and goes on a Jeep safari with a female Kevin (a Kevina). This woman is beyond stupid! She's so stupid that when their Jeep comes across a wild lion... she tries to pet it! And it's not like this lion was asleep or something -- it was actively hunting prey. Luckily, the safari leader wouldn't let the Kevina exit the vehicle and approach the feral, hunting lion to give it some cuddles.
