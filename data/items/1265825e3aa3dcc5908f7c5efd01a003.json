  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, online application forms now provide dozens of gender options and sometimes “man” or “woman” don’t even make the list. And speaking of made up terms, a new poll shows that almost no Hispanic people use the term “Latinx,” and yet the Left continues to push it. We’ll talk about all of that today. Plus, Bill De Blasio bans young children from public accommodations if they don’t show their vaccine papers. The evil is so absurd and over the top at this point as to almost be cartoonish. And salacious new details emerge in the Jussie Smollett trial. Also, a company produces a “suicide pod” to help people kill themselves. And in our daily cancellation, we’ll ask the question: why is everyone so ugly these days? \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
