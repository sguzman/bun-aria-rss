    "media:description": "Do the benefits of zoos justify the fact that some animals are clearly stressed out?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications üîî  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nMany of us have fond memories of visiting the zoo as a child (or at any age), and more than a few of us probably credit those visits with turning us into animal-lovers. So, how should we square those warm fuzzy feelings with research that shows the psychological harms of captivity for some animals? \n\nThat‚Äôs what Vox subscriber Gaurav Patil wanted to know, so producer Liz Scheltens started digging in. One way that zoos maintain their social license to operate despite our growing understanding of the harms to certain species is by marketing themselves as beacons of conservation. \n\nProponents argue that not only do zoos help preserve endangered wild populations, they also help make humans better conservationists. But when you look at the research, a different picture starts to emerge. \n\nCheck out the video above to learn more.\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: Are zoos... bad?\n\nTo submit your on-video question like Gaurav‚Äôs follow this link to our submissions form: https://forms.gle/ATu6kYgKNaEXSr3UA \n\nThanks so much to Gaurav for his thoughtful question.
