  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, even in their reporting, the New York Times reports that President Trump has paid more than $24 million in taxes through the alternative minimum tax, not just $750. Joe Biden benefitted from tax laws that he passed in the senate to avoid payroll taxes like the Medicare tax. Joe Biden is more concerned with the President's taxes than he is with your taxes. Biden will raise your taxes if he wins in November. Later, newly declassified information provided to Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham indicates that in late July of 2016 US intelligence agencies obtained information that then-candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was planning to embroil the campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump in a scandal with Russia. This information was presented to then-President Obama by CIA Director John Brennan. It was also revealed that the FBI knew back then that this unverified information was prepared by a former Russian spy. Finally, Dr Rich McCormick calls in to discuss his campaign for Georgia’s 7th Congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
