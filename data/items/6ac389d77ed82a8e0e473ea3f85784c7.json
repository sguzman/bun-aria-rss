  "description": "<p>I am thinking of taking up a project on ‘Visual Odometry’ as UGP-1 (Undergraduate Project) here in my fifth semester at IIT-Kanpur.\nThis post is primarily a list of some useful links which will get one acquainted with the basics of Visual Odometry.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing that anyone should read is this wonderful two-part review by Davide Scaramuzza and Friedrich Fraundorfer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.roboticsschool.ethz.ch/airobots/programme/presentations/VO_part_I.pdf\">Visual Odometry Tutorial Part 1</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/VO_Part_II_Scaramuzza.pdf\">Visual Odometry Tutorial Part 2</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One thing that I did not understand from the above tutorials was the ‘5-point algorithm’ by Nister in 2003. The original paper is <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288525\">here</a>. But, this paper also seemed quite complicated for me to implement without any background, so I moved onto a simpler algorithm, called the ‘8-point algorithm’, which was published a long time ago by Longuet-Higgins. You can find it <a href=\"http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~aleix/Longuet-Higgins.pdf\">here</a>. There are some lecture slides which explain this in a simple manner, and you can find them <a href=\"http://www.cse.psu.edu/~rcollins/CSE486/lecture20_6pp.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Note, there are more papers that one should read regarding this, most notably:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.cse.unr.edu/~bebis/CS485/Handouts/hartley.pdf\">In Defense of the 8-point Algorithmm</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/new5pt_cameraREady_ver_1.pdf\">5-point Motion Estimation Made Easy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my next post, I will hopefully start working on my implementation.</p>",
