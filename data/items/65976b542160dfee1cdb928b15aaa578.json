Exude the change you want to see in this complicated, divided world.”</p><p>Rich Roll</p><br><p>I have endeavored to keep politics out of this podcast. A podcast proudly built on radical inclusivity that transcends political ideology and affiliation.</p><br><p>That said, in the wake of last week, many have solicited my perspective on&nbsp;what I think we can all agree is a historic election — perhaps the most jolting and important political event of our lifetimes.</p><p>So today, I officially go on record.</p><p>I'm nervous. Because my truth may not be your truth. But know that I welcome our differences.</p><p>I do this because I stand for fidelity to authenticity. And authenticity requires I give voice to my truth.</p><p>I do this with eyes wide open. I understand and accept that I very well may be committing social media suicide.</p><p>I do this because I am dismayed by the extent to which we are divided as a people.</p><p>I do this because fear runs rampant. Because discord rules the conversation. Because facts have been rendered irrelevant. Because fundamental rights are being threatened. Because dignity is being trampled. Because science is under siege. And because precious environmental protections are imperiled.</p><p>I do this to provide counsel for those suffering.</p><p>I do this to build a bridge to those celebrating.</p><p>I do this from a desire to better understand.</p><p>I do this from a place of love.</p><p>So let's have a conversation about it. About all of it. A real conversation.</p><br><p>Today I convene with <a href=\"http://www.srimati.com\" target=\"_blank\">Julie Piatt</a> and activist filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.darylwein.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Darly Wein</a> for a raw and candid roundtable discourse on how to best process, move forward and come together in this most divisive, uncertain time.</p><p>The answer to what ails us transcends politics. It lives beyond our respective idealogical bubbles. It's an answer that will only be found in the desire to better understand ourselves and each other. In the search for unity. In self-governance and taking responsibility for our actions, our words, and our behavior. Beyond the fear that blinds us, it will be discovered only when we learn to walk with integrity, stop fighting and listen — really listen — with compassion. With empathy. And love.</p><p>Always love.</p><p>I sincerely hope you find this conversation helpful.
