  "itunes:summary": "Nobody is perfect.  Let us support you in doing something you KNOW you need to do but may not know how. For 30 days, choose ONE old habit you want to let go of, focus on understanding where it comes from, challenge tired old troublesome beliefs, risk learning something new and updating your old map.  Change can look like: insight, more compassion, new behavior, it can be small or large, but it&apos;s gotta change.  We discuss examples and tie this into the Modern Attachment-Regulation Spectrum and the colors you may lean toward to help you pick something.",
