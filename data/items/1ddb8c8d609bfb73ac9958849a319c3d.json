It’s easy enough to order a coffee, or book into a hotel, and saying the words and phrases you’ve learned at the appropriate time is great, but sometimes it’s not enough. What happens when you ask a question and you receive 30 seconds of solid French in return? In the final ten lessons of Coffee Break French we’ve created something which we think will help you develop your range of language, and allow you to get more used to picking out the key words and phrases as you listen. We’re delighted to introduce this first episode in a series of ten shows which introduce a ‘radio play’, featuring Scottish couple “David” and “Christina”, who are on holiday in Villefranche, who meet up with Jean-Jacques and his wife Sophie. Each lesson will feature excerpts from the long conversation in which David and Christina get to know their new friends.</p><br><p>In this first episode, David and Christina get lost on the way to the<em> Lion D’Or</em>, a restaurant in Villefranche. They bump into Jean-Jacques who happens to be heading the same way and they end up going to the restaurant together. They chat on the way to the restaurant. Please note that lesson 31 of Season 2 was originally known as lesson 71 of Coffee Break French.
