  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the final weekend of the National Football League’s regular season. The New England Patriots loss to the Miami Dolphins means their Super Bowl title defense will begin on wild-card weekend. And San Francisco’s win over Seattle gives the 49ers home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. Also discussed is the college football championship game between Clemson and Louisiana State. Surprisingly, Clemson makes far less money than the other teams that qualified for the playoff -- LSU, Ohio State and Oklahoma. There are a number of reasons for the shortfall, including ticket sales, media money and higher expenses. The title game in New Orleans features two star quarterbacks: Joe Burrow at LSU and Trevor Lawrence of Clemson. Also discussed is whether Lawrence should play next season and risk injury or sit out and prepare for the 2021 NFL draft.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
