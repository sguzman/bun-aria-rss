This is the first post in a new series from UW Master of Science in Data Science to highlight the importance and need for women in the data science industry. The Women in Data Science series will feature the crucial roles women take on within the computing field. Additionally, the series will highlight students, faculty, and program leaders of the UW Master of Science in Data Science program who share their experiences as women in the data science industry, and offer advice for breaking into the male-dominated profession. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there is a lot of work yet to be done for women’s inclusivity in data science, there are a few statistics that are worth celebrating. In this first blog post, we take a look at hiring trends, strengths women bring to data science roles, and how women can stay competitive in the industry.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Positive job growth for women in data science</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, let’s break down the percentage of women in computing occupations. A </span><a href=\"https://www.burtchworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Burtch-Works-Study_DS-PAP-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Burtch-Works</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study found that the </span>number of women in data scientist roles is on a<b> steady, albeit slow, rise</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2018, just 15 percent of data scientists were women. However, in 2019, that number rose to 17 percent, and in 2020, it rose to 18 percent. The same study also found that the largest percentage of women in data science roles are in the entry-level individual contributor category, followed by the managerial level one category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These numbers indicate a possible increased presence of women in the field, along with the beginning of women-led leadership. However, there is still a great need for growth in the computing field for women and other minority groups, especially in the mid-to-senior level leadership roles historically held by men.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Diversity reduces bias and improves work quality in organizations</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2020 NCWIT report also found that </span>women in the computing workforce are<b> more racially and ethnically diverse</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than men in the field. As shown in the graphic below, there is a higher percentage of women with African American, Black, and Asian descent who hold computing roles than men. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7131\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7131\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7131\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM-1024x918.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM-1024x918.png 1024w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM-300x269.png 300w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM-768x689.png 768w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-11.57.34-AM.png 1084w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7131\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Graphic from the <a href=\"https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/ncwit_scorecard_data_highlights_10082020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) report</span></a> showing the racial composition between women and men with computer and information sciences (CIS) bachelor degrees in 2019.

Innovation revenue is identified as the “share of revenues that companies have generated from enhanced or entirely new products or services in the most recent three-year period.”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because people with different backgrounds and experiences often work through problems in different ways to come up with a variety of solutions, the odds that one of the solutions will be a financial success increases.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A chance to make a difference in the world</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of ways that data science impacts the world, and according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/what-keeps-women-out-data-science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 BCG study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this is important to women. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The study found that 73 percent of women </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entering the data science and machine learning field</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> prioritize tangible impact in their career choice, compared to 50 percent of men.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7132\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7132\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7132\" src=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM-1024x509.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM-1024x509.png 1024w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM-300x149.png 300w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM-768x382.png 768w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM-1536x764.png 1536w, https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-12.06.54-PM.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Graphic from <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the </span><a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/what-keeps-women-out-data-science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 BCG study</span></a> comparing the percentage of women and men STEM students who have a preference for working on applied problems with tangible impact. On average, the results show that women, including data science majors, place a higher emphasis on applied, impact-driven work than men do.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many women do not see data science roles as fulfilling their career goals. According to the same study, half of women instead see the data science field as “theoretical and abstract, focused on manipulating code and data with low impact and, by implication, low purpose.” Although there are probably many factors that contribute to this negative perception, the study cites the largest is the companies themselves. It is argued that companies are not communicating the important and meaningful role that data scientists play within their business, deterring applicants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data science is utilized in all industries, ranging from renewable energy, to healthcare, to public safety. Within these industries, the work of data scientists often has a tangible impact on the technology that will shape our future. In order to recruit women to data science roles, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">companies should </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">showcase how data science is at the heart of effective decision making by highlighting the specific problems that data scientists solve in their organization. Bottom line, all i</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ndustries </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stand to benefit from the experiences, perspectives, and skills that women in the field have to offer, and they must work toward better communicating with women in data science.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How to stand out in a competitive industry</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you have an interest in data science and want to stay competitive, enrolling in a data science master’s degree program may be the right next move for your career. You can start by asking yourself a </span><a href=\"https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/6-questions-to-ask-before-pursuing-a-masters-degree-in-data-science/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">few important questions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before taking the leap, including which program is the right fit. </span><b>Diversity in faculty expertise and perspectives </b>is a critical component<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to consider before applying to a program. It’s important that you can relate to and feel supported by program faculty and staff.</span></p>\n<h2><b>UW Data Science strives to be inclusive</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gender gap within data science roles and leadership positions continues to be a pressing issue. Every organization can benefit from prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within their internal culture and hiring processes. This requires conversations at all employment levels, from institutions granting degrees to CEOs discussing promotions to leadership positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UW Master of Science in Data Science program aims to create an inclusive environment for all.
