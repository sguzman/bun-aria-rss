  "description": "<p>Nicole and Sasheer go in depth on their Emmy night, talking gowns, the food, and seeing Nicole’s face so big on the screen. Then, they interview Drag Queens Katya & Trixie Mattel on their friendship! We learn about their time on Drag Race, how they were deported from Australia together, the logic behind IT. With Trixie they choose their celeb alter ego’s (Howie Mandel, Issa Rae, and Lizzo), and with Katya they discuss how painful the writing process is. Brought back together, they laugh over their different styles, being called “derpy,” interrupting to apologize for interrupting, and the masochism of waist-training. </p><p><br /></p><p>Email or call Nicole & Sasheer with your friendship questions at:</p><p><a href=\"mailto:nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">nicoleandsasheer@gmail.com</a></p><p>(424) 645-7003‬</p><p><br /></p><p>This episode is sponsored by Lightbox Jewelry (<a href=\"http://www.lightboxjewelry.com/bestfriends\" target=\"_blank\">www.lightboxjewelry.com/bestfriends</a> code: BESTFRIENDS), MeUndies (<a href=\"http://www.meundies.com/bestfriends\" target=\"_blank\">www.meundies.com/bestfriends</a>), and High & Mighty.</p>\n",
