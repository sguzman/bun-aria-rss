  "description": "Somehow, a 4-12 team has captured more offseason headlines than any other. The Texans remain a talking point in NFL circles and not for the right reasons. While they probably pulled their best PR move in a while with the amicable release of JJ Watt, they showcased a double standard when it comes to how they've handled Deshaun Watson. On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Jonathan Jones to break down what's happening in Houston. And now that Watt is a free agent, where could he end up? The bigger prize is Watson, as the guys suggest more teams that could be in the mix, highlighted by the Carolina Panthers. And what happens if Watson isn't dealt? JJ thinks he better be prepared to hold out or skip games after taking this stand. The conversation extends into this current era of playerment empowerment, specifically for star quarterbacks. But don't get it twisted, this doesn't have much to do with Tom Brady's switch last year. This movement has been building for some time now. Carson Wentz was horrible in 2020 and is still likely going to get his trade wish granted, so that tells you all you need to know!\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
