Jeans and Jean Jacket start the show talking about celebrity best friends - for instance, Tom Segura and Brad Pitt, Bert Kreischer and Jimmy Buffett, Christina P and Paula Abdul… speaking of Jimmy Buffett, Tim and Christine discuss Margaritaville Resorts and other severely alcoholic destinations. Then, we’re joined by Tom’s mom aka Charo and her sister Blanca! Immediately, Charo comes in hot with her classic gaslighting and extortion skills, asking Tom to give her $500 and other various gifts for basically no reason. Tom and Christina remind her about the gifts they already got on this trip, including a manicure, a pedicure, gourmet coffee and cookies, a shopping spree… but Charo saved Tom $500? What is going on?!? As usual, Tom gets Charo and Blanca to watch Horrible or Hilarious clips, TikToks, and Fedsmoker videos. Can they handle the trauma? Can Tom and Christina handle the guests? And who won the bet anyway??? Watch and find out!</p>\n",
