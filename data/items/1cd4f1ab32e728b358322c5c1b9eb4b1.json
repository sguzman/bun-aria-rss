  "description": "<p>By utilizing the thin shell approximation, we investigate the behavior of\nradial timelike geodesics in a black hole to white hole bouncing scenario with\na mass (de-)amplification relation. We show that those geodesics lose energy\nafter crossing the transition surface if the white hole mass is less than the\nblack hole mass and vice versa. That is, the bounded timelike radial geodesics\nbecome closer to the event horizon in the mass decreasing direction. We then\nshow that by tracing a finite amount of bouncing cycles along the mass\ndecreasing direction, all bounded radial geodesics can be squeezed into the\nrange of the stretched horizon while the black hole and white hole are still\nmassive. Those highly squeezed geodesics are problematic since there exists a\nPlanck-scale blueshift between them and the regular infalling trajectories. We\nalso discuss the possible implication and rescues.\n</p>",
