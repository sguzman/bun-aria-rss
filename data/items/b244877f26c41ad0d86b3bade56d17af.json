A lot of my pillar messaging still holds true today but of course the context of the conversation (and the world) has changed. A really important anecdote from this talk was how the self-esteem I had for myself helped trigger me to bring that same level confidence to people curious about the wine world. This talk was given back when I was promoting my first book, 'Crush It,' and I figured it would be appropriate to share now that the 2.0 version, 'Crushed It' is on its way :) </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5280448.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
