  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, we don't know if the polls being released every day are accurate, but we do know that the race is tightening and that is because of you Levinites. Then, why doesn't anyone ask Joe Biden why he's dodging Obamacare taxes? The Federalists' Christopher Jacobs digs deeper. Contrary to The Federalist, the New York Times is a soviet-type media. If we only had an honest press, this country would be so much better off. Next, Kristen Welker is not fit to moderate Thursday's presidential debate, as she is clearly in Joe Biden's corner. Also, Biden has an extensive history of racially charged conduct and comments, even having past ties with known segregationists. Lying to the American people has always come easy to Joe Biden, and he continues to do so regarding the legitimacy of the Hunter Biden Laptop Scandal. Afterward, Senator Thom Tillis joins the program to discuss his Senate race in North Carolina. Finally, Nick Freitas calls in to discuss his Congressional race in Virginia.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
