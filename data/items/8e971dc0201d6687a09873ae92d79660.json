  "description": "Si is looking GOOD after getting talked into a salon makeover by a Paula Deen lookalike. Willie has finally turned into Phil Robertson. Si asks for your help after he visits an inmate who isn't quite ready to hear what he has to say. Phillip relives getting his tail whupped by a girl at the children's home where he works, and Si reminisces about breaking a guy's hand with his hard head. John-David can't get enough of permed mullets, but can he get Martin on board with the trend? President Si announces the first thing he'll do as leader of the free world. And the boys extend a heartfelt apology to their truck-driving listeners.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
