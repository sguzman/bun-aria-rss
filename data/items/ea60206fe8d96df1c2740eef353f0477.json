  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Memcrash threatens big DDoS events. Problems with single-sign-on solutions.

A new variant of Petya ransomware may be in circulation. What's the point of a false flag if no one's fooled? Dale Drew from CenturyLink on collaboration trends. Guest is Eric Cole, author of Online Danger. And the US Senate asks, how do you solve a problem like Vladimir?",
