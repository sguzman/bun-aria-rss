  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, if invaded by China, Taiwan must launch a retaliatory attack on China's mainland. Unlike the United States, Taiwan is preparing for China's attack. The Biden Administration is too focused on chasing Donald Trump, destroying fossil fuels, debating how open the border should be, and how to redefine a recession when they can't even define what a woman is. Then, the same idiots that caused shortages of gasoline, shortages of food, and inflation claim they have the cure for the environment. They suggest all vehicles be electric even though our electric grid cannot support that type of output. Later, The New York Times has smeared this program again with an article besmirching Mark. As Democrats further criminalize dissent, this program continues to condemn the violence of January 6th and defend the Constitution. If the leftwing media weren't afraid of the truth, they wouldn't try to spin what this program says. Afterward, Charlie Kirk joins the show to discuss his new book \"The College Scam.\"\nhttps://45books.com/products/the-college-scam\nKirk argues that most kids should reconsider even attending college unless they are necessary for an advanced degree or professional license in nursing, engineering, or the legal and medical fields. Sadly, too many students are left with huge loans and values that are inconsistent with Americanism. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
