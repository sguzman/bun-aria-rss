A vegan chef for almost 40 years, she nonetheless struggled mightily with obesity for decades — prisoner to an addiction to processed snacks, refined sugar desserts, and an array of vegan junk foods that left her not only chronically overweight, but seriously unwell.</p><p>AJ's salvation came only when she finally became willing to&nbsp;confront her unhealthy relationship with food as a true addiction. It's a journey that&nbsp;required her to completely let go of habits that no longer served her, accept help, and embrace an entirely new relationship with food in the form of a whole foods, plant-based lifestyle.</p><p>This is her story — an inspiring tale of triumph and personal transformation that will leave you rethinking your own habits.
