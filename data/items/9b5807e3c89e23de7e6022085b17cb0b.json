  "description": "<p>New York Times best-selling author Elizabeth Gilbert is known for following her passion, but says she no longer advises others to do the same. Instead, Elizabeth makes the case to follow your curiosity. Elizabeth says she believes the word \"passion\" can trigger feelings of stress and pressure, and doesn't even know if she believes in following it anymore. “At some point in your life, you were told, ‘Chase your passion,’” she says. “Not everyone knows how to answer that command.”</p>\n",
