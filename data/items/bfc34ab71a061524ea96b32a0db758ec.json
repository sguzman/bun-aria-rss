  "description": "<p>On this solo episode of Battles & Banter, Avery takes on one of the most important engagements to come out of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Fought on March 7-8, 1862, the Battle of Pea Ridge would end in a major Union victory that would secure the border state of Missouri as a bastion for Federal forces against Confederates in the area for the rest of the war. Avery would also like to take this time to send kind regards to any listeners in Ukraine who are living through the current conflict. We here at Battles & Banter Podcast stand with Ukraine and will be covering the conflict at a later date to be decided. In the meantime, enjoy this episode on the 160th Anniversary of Pea Ridge!</p>",
