  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Brady Quinn to dish out midseason awards as we're just about at the midway point of the 2020 NFL season. Russell Wilson was the clear MVP candidate when we delivered quarter-season awards, but that lead has shrunk with other names, mainly Patrick Mahomes, entering the mix (12:30). Will Russ hold on? Brinson and BQ also evaluate the Defensive Player of the Year race (28:30) Ultimately, it's hard to find a better defender than Aaron Donald, but does that mean he'll be properly awarded? The Rookie of the Year race is between two quarterbacks: Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert and Brady thinks Herbert has the slight edge at this point (30:30). Coach of the Year (38:45) and midseason Super Bowl selections wrap up this episode (42:00).\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @Brady_Quinn, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
