  "description": "<p>Charlie is first joined by Salem Radio colleague, TPUSA alum, and host of The Officer Tatum Show, Brandon Tatum, to discuss the powerful new film, ‘Uncle Tom 2.’ They have an honest and jarring conversation on the true history of Black America, and the Marxists who infiltrated that community, to degrade and ultimately undermine the prosperity of Black Americans. Charlie and Brandon also explore a controversial but illuminating discussion on mass desegregation, and how the unintended consequences of of it, impacted the Black community, both negatively and positively, as well as how it informs the trajectory of the BLM movement. Next up, Charlie welcomes Dave Brat, Dean of Liberty University’s School of Business, to break down the state of the economy and why American's sovereign debt threatens to destroy America's remaining middle-class. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
