  "title": "Interest rate models enhanced with local volatility",
  "description": "In this paper, Lingling Cao and Pierre Henry-Labordère complement generic interest rate models with local volatility. They derive an exact Dupire-like formula for the local volatility. An efficient calibration scheme is then achieved with the particle method as introduced in Guyon & Henry-Labordère (2012)",
