  "description": "A look back at our origins, plus the usual mix of numerical nous and statistical savvy.\n\nIt’s two decades since More or Less first beamed arithmetic into the unsuspecting ears of Radio 4 listeners. We revisit the show’s genesis with the original presenter and producer.\n\nWhy are there two different figures about our vaccination rate doing the rounds and how does the UK now compare internationally?\n\nPlus listener questions on how the colour of your front door affects your house price, TVs on standby mode, and more. And we try to respond to a meteor storm of complaints about our earlier item asserting that Star Trek’s Mr Spock is in fact highly illogical.",
