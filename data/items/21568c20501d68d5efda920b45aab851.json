  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, Sam's guest is Caroline Frost, author of the new <em>Carry On Regardless: Getting to the Bottom of Britain's Favourite Comedy Films. </em>She tells Sam what those movies tell us about British social history, makes the case for their feminism, argues that their special magic belongs to a British sensibility that no longer exists – and explains why it took twenty or more attempts to get Barbara Windsor out of her bra. </div>\n",
