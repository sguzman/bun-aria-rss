Yes, we are reacting to football, and it's very exciting. Let's start with some preseason winners (1:40) as Jamey was impressed by a few rookie WRs, but does Amon-ra St. Brown have enough of a role to be successful? The rookie QBs flashed in their debuts and Phillip Lindsay (8:15) might be a Top 100 pick now. Meanwhile, our list of preseason losers (9:30) is headlined by Myles Gaskin. How far down the rankings is he moving? We also tell you why Adam Trautman was a loser and we discuss other rookie RBs (some good, some bad) as well ... We'll update you on the latest NFL news and notes (18:45). Curtis Samuel is off the PUP list and looks like a draft bargain right now ... It's Mock Draft Monday (22:00) and we'll review our 12-team, 3-WR PPR draft. One drafter's entire team is from the NFC East! And it's good! Jamey made it a point to draft WRs early. Adam laments his lack of upside. Chris is very happy with his team even though his QB situation is a little weak. Find out why Chris doesn't think that's an issue. And we also discuss the Round 6/7 RBs (45:30) and rank Michael Carter, Chase Edmonds, Javonte Williams and Kareem Hunt ...
