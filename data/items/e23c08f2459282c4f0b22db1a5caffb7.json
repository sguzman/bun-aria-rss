  "description": "<p><b>For the third and final week of our Kingdom of God series, we hear from Amanda and Raechel’s guest Lysa TerKeurst—an author, speaker, and Bible teacher. Together, they untangle topics like pursuing holiness and how to think biblically about the inclusive and exclusive nature of the gospel. Lysa shares her personal journey with forgiveness and how the act of forgiving those who’ve hurt us is “one of the most beautiful evidences of being a citizen of the kingdom of heaven.” During this hour, we learn about the true meaning of the gospel: it is an invitation into a new way of being and a new God-given identity.   </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 3 of the She Reads Truth The Kingdom of God reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop The Kingdom of God collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='http://shereadstruth.com/podcast/the-kingdom-of-god-week-3-with-lysa-terkeurst'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/the-kingdom-of-god-week-3-with-lysa-terkeurst</b></a></p>",
