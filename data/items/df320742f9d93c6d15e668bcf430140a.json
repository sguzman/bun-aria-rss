  "title": "Ep 119: The Horrors of  Approval Seeking and Perfectionism",
  "description": "<p>I watched 13 Reasons Why and loved it almost as much as my beloved BH90210.  High school sucks donkey dicks and in this episode I uncover why. The compelling reasons to attend college (to become interesting and drink Zima). My favorite new British Baking Show contestant and the deepness of her victory. It's not just about avoiding a soggy bottom! Why you can't necessarily DO everything. I mean you can, just not perfectly. How do we make peace with doing things imperfectly. Also, what are our limits and who defines them? A 34 year-old single woman writes in feeling the panic of her biological clock ticking away. She's newly single and wants to find her forever jeans! The horrors of modern-day dating. A Mormon girl writes in and asks how she can get over her competitiveness. She hates games! It may have something to do with approval seeking...and the good opinion of others...The book I recommend is by Wayne Dyer, Your Erroneous Zones.</p>\n",
