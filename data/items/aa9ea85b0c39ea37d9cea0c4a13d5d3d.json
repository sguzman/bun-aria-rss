The second is several times it has come up in reference to western medicine's ability to treat chronic health concerns. It came up recently when you spoke on ADHD. So if there are people who are simply genetically predestined to be superior in certain aspects, why would someone not simply be genetically predestined to be much weaker in a certain function such as focus? Is it realistic to think that there are people who will simply never be “normal” without some sort of daily pharmaceutical intervention? Does this represent a true belief for any of you or is it just a result of interpretation? (53:26)</li> <li>Quah question #3 – Any tips for an adult male with acne?
