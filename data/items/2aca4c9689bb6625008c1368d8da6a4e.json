  "description": "<p>You don't have to be an avid fly fisher to appreciate John Maclean's beautiful new book HOME WATERS, but it will certainly inspire you to spend more time outside. A former Washington correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, with a second career writing books about wildfire, John now splits his time between DC and his family’s cabin on Seeley Lake in Montana. And if you’ve read John’s father’s book, A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, you know that cabin, and the Blackfoot River, and John’s Uncle Paul — though you won’t know Uncle Paul’s whole story, until you read HOME WATERS.<br /> Featured books: Home Waters by John Maclean, A River Runs Through It by Norman Maclean, Ernest Hemingway's short story, The Big Two-Hearted River (included in his collection In Our Time), and a Sherlock Holmes omnibus. <span style= \"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\"> Produced/Hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</span><br /> <br /> Follow us here for new episodes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
