  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s “travel ban” executive order was constitutional. Trump had every right to list the countries in the immigration pause for national security purposes. And the Muslim countries with the largest Muslim populations weren’t even on the list. It left out 92 percent of the world’s Muslims, which rejects the Left’s arguments about racism. Trump was right about the power of the presidency and about the constitution despite the attacks he endured for months. It’s unlikely that the media will apologize to him for such treatment. Then, Supreme court decision on pro-life crisis pregnancy centers free speech case. The left claims to defend free speech yet opposes today's decision. California mandates that these religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy centers prominently post information on how abortions could be obtained or face a fine. Pro-life groups opposed the law and won a victory today when the Supreme Court found that this violates the centers' rights to free speech. People of faith would have no rights if the left used their interpretation of the Constitution on each of these cases. To the left individual liberty is defiance. Later, protectionism redistributes income from the to the consumer to the government. These tariffs will eventually lead us to a recession. Ronald Reagan imposed tariffs sparingly but was no protectionist. Herbert Hoover turned a recession into a depression in part because of protectionism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
