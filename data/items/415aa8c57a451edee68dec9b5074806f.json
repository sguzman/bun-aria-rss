  "description": "<p>We love our cemeteries around here. They are places of such peace and for many of us, strangely, a place of comfort. And as we have found, many have a spirit or two unable to let go of their terrestrial bonds. On this episode, we are going to share some of the burial practices of rural families at the turn-of-the-twentieth-century and some of the traditions that are still carried on in cemeteries today. We also have several more haunted cemeteries to share from Ohio, Oregon, California and Indiana. Join us as we share Haunted Cemeteries 21! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jim Featherstone and features The Italian Bride, Julia Buccola Petta and This Month in History features Francis Salvador becoming first elected Jew in the Americas.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
