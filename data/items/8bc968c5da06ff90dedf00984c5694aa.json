  "description": "There is a complexity paradox that we all need to understand. We humans have a natural inclination towards connection, engagement, and creativity – all necessary skills to thrive in complexity. The problem is that the stress caused by uncertainty and ambiguity makes it difficult to tap into this inclination when we need it the most. Unleash Your Complexity Genius: Growing Your Inner Capacity to Lead (Stanford UP, 2022) offers a set of practices that help you not only understand complexity but actually hack into your own nervous system to bring your natural capacities back online. By paying close attention to your body, redefining your emotional experiences, and connecting more deeply to others, you can transform the anxiety, exhaustion, and overwhelm that complexity creates. Better still, as you unleash your natural complexity genius, you create the conditions for those around you to flourish in an uncertain world.\nJennifer Garvey Berger is the Founder and CEO of Cultivating Leadership where, with her co-author Carolyn Coughlin, she has helped thousands of leaders around the world thrive in complexity.\nJohn Emrich has worked for decades years in corporate finance, business valuation and fund management. He has a podcast about the investment space called Kick the Dogma.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
