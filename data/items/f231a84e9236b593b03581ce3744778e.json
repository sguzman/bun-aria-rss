  "description": "<p>This week, we explore someone who fell from the highest of mountains, and ended up in the lowest of depths. He was \"The Fastest Man In The World\", an Olympic gold medalist, had a rich, famous, talented wife, his own Nike commercial, and was even touted by Oprah as a national hero. That was before he decided to be involved in a giant criminal conspiracy, resulting in a huge federal sting, and tons of jail time for all. To try to get out of that hole, he decided that committing even worse crimes were the only answer. This is truly a man who saw no opportunity too small, or great to throw away. Our kinda guy!Win a gold medal, become a national embarrassment, and do a bunch of time in federal prison with Tim Montgomery!!Check us out, every Tuesday.
