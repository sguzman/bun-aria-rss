  "description": "<p>When you understand motivation, you finally take the training wheels off on your ride to success.</p> <p>If you can actually hone in on why we do the things that we do, there’s no limit to what you can achieve. Without motivation, even the smallest tasks feel gargantuan. But, with motivation, there comes an overflow of focus and energy that puts conquering great feats on automatic.</p> <p>We’ve all done it. There’s something we say we want to accomplish… something with our fitness, our career, our relationship, etc… but our actions don’t really match up to the result we say we want. Maybe we started with ample motivation in the beginning, but it has shriveled up like it’s too cold outside. We typically try again with similar results, or just give up and tell ourselves that the goal wasn’t that important to begin with. Motivation wains, and with it, so does our results.</p> <p>Today you’re going to learn the science of motivation. We’re going to take a peek behind the curtain of your psyche and help you to do more of the things that you really want to do in your life. We should all be better able to understand what makes us tick, and that’s what this episode is all about. Being fit and healthy long-term boils down to applying specific mechanics. But you won’t do those mechanics if your motivation decides to bail on you when you need it most. The tips and insights you’ll learn today will definitely be valuable for a lifetime. So, click play, listen in, and let your motivation light you on fire!</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>Why the mechanics of getting fit are easy, but it can still be difficult to do them.</li> <li>The surprising way that caffeine functions in the human body (and how it affects body fat).</li> <li>The critical difference between motivation and inspiration.</li> <li>How leveraging the mirror neurons in your brain can help you to stay motivated.</li> <li>Why we get emotional watching other people go through things (even though it’s not happening to us).</li> <li>Why creating positive habits is still a stress on your brain.</li> <li>The shocking way that music affects your performance during a workout.</li> <li>How music influences our perception of pain.</li> <li>Why peeling-the-onion and getting to the core of your desire to be fit can be game-changing.</li> <li>What the observer effect is and how it impacts our behavior.</li> <li>How to use social media to keep yourself accountable.</li> <li>What social comparison theory is.</li> <li>The most important things to know when selecting a workout partner.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audible.com/model\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">AUDIBLE</a> <== Get your free audiobook & 30-day free membership!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/foursigmatic\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foursigmatic.com/model</a> ⇐ Get 15% off your daily health elixirs and coffee!</li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/post-workout-nutrition/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Best Pre- & Post-Workout Nutrition - Episode 183</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/daniel-goleman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emotional Intelligence & Altered Traits - With Dr. Daniel Goleman - Episode 237</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shawnmodel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connect with Shawn on Instagram!</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/how-to-create-healthy-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How To Create Healthy Habits For A Lifetime - Episode 141</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/dan-millman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everyday Enlightenment - With Dan Millman - Episode 239</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/wendy-suzuki/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthy Brain, Happy Life - With Dr. Wendy Suzuki - Episode 186</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/daniel-amen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Change Your Brain & Change Your Life - With Dr. Daniel Amen - Episode 165</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://themodelhealthshow.com/finishstrong\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fat Loss Masterclass</a> ⇐ Join the LIVE masterclass coming soon!</li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+242.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong><span style= \"text-decoration: underline;\">Download The Transcript</span></strong></em></a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
