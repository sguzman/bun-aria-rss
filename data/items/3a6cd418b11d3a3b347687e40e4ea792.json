  "description": "<p>In this paper we study the non-unitary deformations of the two-dimensional\nTricritical Ising Model obtained by coupling its two spin \\mathbb {Z}_2 odd\noperators to imaginary magnetic fields. Varying the strengths of these\nimaginary magnetic fields and adjusting correspondingly the coupling constants\nof the two spin Z2 even fields, we establish the presence of two universality\nclasses of infrared fixed points on the critical surface. The first class\ncorresponds to the familiar Yang-Lee edge singularity, while the second class\nto its tricritical version. We argue that these two universality classes are\ncontrolled by the conformal non-unitary minimal models M(2,5) and M(2,7)\nrespectively, which is supported by considerations based on PT symmetry and the\ncorresponding extension of Zamolodchikov's c-theorem, and also verified\nnumerically using the truncated conformal space approach. Our results are in\nagreement with a previous numerical study of the lattice version of the\nTricritical Ising Model [1]. We also conjecture the classes of universality\ncorresponding to higher non-unitary multicritical points obtained by perturbing\nthe conformal unitary models with imaginary coupling magnetic fields.\n</p>",
