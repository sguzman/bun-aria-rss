  "description": "<p>Vector autoregressions (VARs) are popular in analyzing economic time series.\nHowever, VARs can be over-parameterized if the numbers of variables and lags\nare moderately large. Tensor VAR, a recent solution to overparameterization,\ntreats the coefficient matrix as a third-order tensor and estimates the\ncorresponding tensor decomposition to achieve parsimony. In this paper, the\ninference of Tensor VARs is inspired by the literature on factor models.\nFirstly, we determine the rank by imposing the Multiplicative Gamma Prior to\nmargins, i.e. elements in the decomposition, and accelerate the computation\nwith an adaptive inferential scheme. Secondly, to obtain interpretable margins,\nwe propose an interweaving algorithm to improve the mixing of margins and\nintroduce a post-processing procedure to solve column permutations and\nsign-switching issues. In the application of the US macroeconomic data, our\nmodels outperform standard VARs in point and density forecasting and yield\ninterpretable results consistent with the US economic history.\n</p>",
