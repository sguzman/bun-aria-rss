    "media:description": "In honour of our wonderful fungal comrades and the fact that 9/20 was this past weekend (9/20 is the magic mushroom version of cannabis' 4/20), here's a video going over all the main brain imaging findings with psilocybin (the active compound in magic mushrooms) over the past decade.\n\nThe video should be accessible to all, but if you have zero background in brain networks or the default mode network, I highly recommend watching my video 'fMRI Brain Networks in 10 minutes' prior to this one.
