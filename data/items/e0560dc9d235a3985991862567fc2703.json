Bromberg, is back with a heartfelt, standalone romance and a new hero to steal your heart . . .\n\nThe contract with Major League Soccer was supposed to help repair my damaged reputation.\n\nThen I discovered that I’d made a deal with the devil: the player I’m supposed to recruit is none other than the bad boy, star Premier League footballer, Rush McKenzie.\n\nBritish. Tattooed. Sexy. A man currently at the center of a huge scandal.\n\nThe goal? To convince him to stay in the States.\n\nBut what’s wrong with a little fun in the meantime? No strings. No sweet nothings. Just a way to pass the time while we’re both struggling to prove our true selves to the world.\n\nIf someone found out our relationship was anything more than professional, it would only serve to prove all our critics right.\n\n***\n\nI never should have agreed to take the fall.\n\nBut I did and I’m a man of my word.\n\nEven if it means risking everything I’ve worked for.\n\nThe only bright side is Lennox Kincade.\n\nGorgeous. Defiant. Rumor-tainted. Totally off-limits.\n\nSharing a house with the gorgeous sports agent should have been a fun distraction from the turmoil.
