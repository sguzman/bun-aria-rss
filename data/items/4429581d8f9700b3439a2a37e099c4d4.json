  "description": "BANKSY! Love him or loathe him, he’s a contemporary art dynamo, an icon of street art success. He’s also an enigma, a playful mystery. Last week-- on April 30, 2019-- I was asked to participate in a special screening of the 2010 Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop at the Alamo Drafthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina. Exit was part of Alamo’s Film Club series, curated by Jackson Cooper, and after the film I sat down with Jackson to record a special conversation/Q&A about the film, Banksy, and the legacy of street art. Enjoy— and we’ll be back next week with an all-new episode of ArtCurious.\nJust a note that there are some spoilers in terms of the fact that we talk about the documentary in general, as well as Banksy himself and the other artist profiled in the doc, a man called Mr. Brainwash.\n\n \nSPONSOR\nMyro (use promo code ARTCURIOUS at checkout for 50% off and to get started for just $5)\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
