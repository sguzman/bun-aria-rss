  "description": "<div>Today on a horrifying episode of real ghost stories online that some claim was the inspiration for the hit cartoon, Muppet Babies, and the unreleased episode where Kermit and Fozzy play with a wee-gee board, summon a demon, gonzo becomes possessed and carries out a mass murder of nanny, ralph, scooter and miss piggy. For some reason that episode never aired, despite the desperate cries of children to see the truth, behind the Muppet babies.Â <br>\n<br>\nWhat happens late at night inside the bathroom of an old soup kitchen?Â <br>\n<br>\nSomething that doesnâ€™t involve the living, but rather, the dead.Â <br>\n<br>\nWaiting for their next time to strike and unsuspecting soul.Â <br>\n<br>\nThat story, and much more, today, on Real Ghost Stories Online.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!</strong><br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
