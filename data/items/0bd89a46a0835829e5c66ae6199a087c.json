  "description": "<p>On this very special episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Codie and regular recurring guest Julia Wall to pay tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away on August 28, 2020. Boseman was most famously known for portraying T'challa aka Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also portrayed famously historic Black American figures such as Thurgood Marshall, Jackie Robinson, and James Brown. Avery, Julia & Codie highlight Boseman's career and then dive into the MCU headfirst to take on the climax of 'Black Panther': the clash between T'Challa and Erik Killmonger, as well as their forces, at the top of Mount Bashenga aka the Great Mound. It's a more somber episode, but a great one at that! Chadwick, this one is for you.</p>",
