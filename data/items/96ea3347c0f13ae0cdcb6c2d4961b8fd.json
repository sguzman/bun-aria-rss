  "description": "It is impossible to prove that Trump role model Tony Montana was actually speaking about former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort when he said, \"this country was built on laundered money\" but he might as well have been.  And it may be that the money laundered by Manafort ultimately brings him down...and possibly turns the tide against the president and his family.  Or perhaps they did their own money laundering.  It's too early to tell.  But that doesn't stop our experts Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University from trying to figure out where we are in this mess with the latest indictments and maneuverings.
