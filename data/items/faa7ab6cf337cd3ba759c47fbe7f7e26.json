  "description": "The Federal Reserve is driving me crazy… A week after raising interest rates for the first time since 2018 by a measly 0.25%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is trying to sound tough on inflation. But Daniel offers a different perspective… [0:35] The Fed needs to get its act together right away. I explain what it must do to keep inflation from getting completely out of hand. [7:40] Large-cap China stocks have rallied hard off their lows over the last week. Daniel highlights what’s behind the move… and why it’s a great trading opportunity. [9:25] Next, we review a Bloomberg article on how to deal with inflation—and poke fun at some of the truly ridiculous suggestions—like getting rid of your pets. [12:10] Nike (NKE) reported solid earrings this week, displaying its pricing power amid rising costs. But I still wouldn’t buy this stock right now. I explain why the difference between growth stocks and tech stocks is key to making big gains in this market… tell you about a few tech stocks I’m watching right now… and one sector I’m particularly bullish on as rates rise. [21:10] Big news in the world of crypto: Goldman Sachs (GS) recently made a first-of-its-kind Bitcoin trade with the help of Galaxy Digital (BRPHF) (one of our  portfolio assets). Daniel shares why this is a major event… and why he’s bullish on all parties involved. [26:30] Enjoyed this episode?
