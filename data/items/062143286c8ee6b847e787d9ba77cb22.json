    "media:description": "Well kids, I finally came back out with the milk. Thank you all for your glorious patience and fortitude during these tough times and let's take a look at the Masamap for Eastern Asia and Oceania, 2 geographically close, but demographically diverse regions that stretches from Mongolia to New Zealand.\n\nThere are thousands of different people groups throughout this region, but I did my best to map them out in a way that made sense for the various demographic parameters of each country. More improvements will be made before the release of the final map. Thanks for watching!",
