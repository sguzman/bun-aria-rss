  "description": "<p><p>Erika Nardini is thrilled with Kirk Minihane. So thrilled, in fact, that she's asked him to attend the 2020 Barstool Pond Hockey tournament in February. No surprise considering Minihane has shown his keen interest in winter sports activities like ice fishing. Speaking of which: The Kirk Minihane Ice Fishing Expedition has been indefinitely postponed because Minihane is not happy with the fat and happy Minifans.
