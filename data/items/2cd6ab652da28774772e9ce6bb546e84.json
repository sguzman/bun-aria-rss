  "description": "It’s beginning to look a lot like Slootmas\nAfter some much needed TLC, Sofia is BACK from Hawaii and ready to celebrate Slootmas with her favorite people…THE SLOOTS! Today Sofia dives into the painfully stressful topic of in-laws, specifically for those that are lucky enough to have to spend the holidays with them! I know Sloots, it’s REALLY exhausting pretending that your boyfriend's mom's cooking is good and having to make fake conversation for three days but YOU GOT THIS. Mainly because Sofia is here to endure the pain with you. Listen along as you learn all the quick tips and tricks to survive the holiday break with your S/O’s wonderful family. In other more important news, the Kardashian kids are on Tik Tok! Naturally, Sofia had a ton to say about this - specifically Mason Disick, who is currently Sloot Media’s favorite star-child. Lastly, we cover aux cord etiquette, including all the do’s and dont’s of being the DJ of your friend group - an honor you TRULY don’t wanna mess up. \nHappy Holidays Sloots, without you guys none of this would be possible. Be kind to yourselves and those around you this holiday season. Don’t forget to take care of yourselves.
