  "summary": "<p>Regardless of what you might think of the ubiquity of the \"Big Data\" meme, it's clear that the growing size of datasets is changing the way we approach the world around us.  This is true in fields from industry to government to media to academia and virtually everywhere in between. Our increasing abilities to gather, process, visualize, and learn from large datasets is helping to push the boundaries of our knowledge.</p>\n<p>But where scientific research is concerned, this recently accelerated shift to data-centric science has a dark side, which boils down to this: <strong>the skills required to be a successful scientific researcher are increasingly indistinguishable from the skills required to be successful in industry.</strong> While academia, with typical inertia, gradually shifts to accommodate this, the rest of the world has already begun to embrace and reward these skills to a much greater degree. <em>The unfortunate result is that some of the most promising upcoming researchers are finding no place for themselves in the academic community, while the for-profit world of industry stands by with deep pockets and open arms.</em>",
