Clay is wearing his OutKick \"Fund the Police\" T-shirt since Defund the Police is \"fundamentally the dumbest slogan in the history of modern American politics.\" Media ignores the Brooklyn subway shooter story. Elizabeth Warren has a plan for how Democrats can avoid disaster in November. As for 2024, Clay says: \"If Trump is on the ballot, does Trump become the story as opposed to Biden failures? Because, if it's Biden failures, Republicans win.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
