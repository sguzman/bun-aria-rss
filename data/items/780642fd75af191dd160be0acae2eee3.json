  "description": "The forest is a place we have very mixed feelings about. Forests can be calm and peaceful, full of ancient and natural beauty.  \n\n\n\nUntil they’re not. \n\nThe forest, in so many ways, is a place we fear. They are dark and dense and overgrown, all too easy to get lost in. They hold secrets and mysteries, and creatures we’d rather not meet alone, far from home. \n\n\n\nAnd if the monsters of the forest don’t get us, then the forest itself will. The strange, malevolent powers of the trees themselves. \n\n\n\nThe forest can be a terrifying place. \n\nOn this week's episode I'm joined by Dr Elizabeth Parker, who guides us through the deep dark woods.",
