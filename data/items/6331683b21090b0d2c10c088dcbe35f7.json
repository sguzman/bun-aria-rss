  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by 16 year NFL vet, 2x Pro Bowler, ambassador For the Brand, and now a world renowned magician of <em>America's Got Talent</em> fame, Jon Dorenbos, joins the show. Pat and Jon have an incredibly entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring conversation that covers Jon's hardships growing up, his journey from junior college to being one of the most respected long snappers in the NFL, to his career after football being an accomplished magician. Jon leaves no page unturned, all while doing a couple of magic tricks along the way (2:44-57:15). Next, &nbsp;Pat's former teammate, 2nd round pick of the New England Patriots, and one of the smoothest athletes of all-time, Darius Butler, joins the show to give his reaction to the insanity of the last few days in the NBA playoffs. He recaps the games from this weekend, looks ahead to the Conference Finals, and gives his prediction for the NBA finals. He also gives his pick for a team to watch in the NFL this year, and talks about what he's been up to recently (1:02:12-1:18:21). We also have a NEW SEGMENT ALERT called, \"I Have Some Thoughts.\" The guys also dive into a SPOILER HEAVY discussion about everything that happened on Sunday's penultimate episode of Game of Thrones, and try to make sense of it all &nbsp;while looking ahead to next week's series finale (1:37:01-1:52:34). Today's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
