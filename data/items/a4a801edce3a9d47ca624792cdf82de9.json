She has 3 kids: a 17-year-old girl, another daughter is recovering from surgery, and her youngest is a special needs child. OP wants to go off TO ANOTHER STATE to party with her sisters, leaving her 17-year-old in charge of her younger siblings. The 17-year-old is upset because this means that she will miss out on a school dance. OP basically says, \"Sorry sweetie, but mommy's party time is more important than your party time.\" Is OP the butthole?</p>\n",
