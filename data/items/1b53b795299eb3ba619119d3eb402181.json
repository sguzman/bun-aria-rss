  "description": "Today's History Story: Black Barber Shops\nThe Black barbershop is a cultural institution. It's a place where you can get much more than a haircut. You get community. You get jokes. You might get politicized. And you will get the straight talk that we often hold back when navigating a larger public that's committed to white supremacist systems. What we don't often talk about when thinking of the barbershop is it's vital role in the Black economy.\nTo help us understand both the politics and economics of Black barber shops, we’re sitting down with Quincy Mills. Quincy is an associate professor of history at the University of Maine and College Park. He teaches courses in 20th century African-American history, particularly business and political history. He's authored, \"Cutting Along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America,” and is working on a new book called “The Wages of Resistance: Financing the Black Freedom Movement.\"\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!
