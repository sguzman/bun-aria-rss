  "description": "<p>June 28th, 2015. Bonita Springs, Florida. When Mark Sievers was informed that his wife hadn't shown up for work he phoned a neighbor to see if he would walk to the Siever home to check on his wife Teresa. What he found was Dr. Sievers' lifeless body on the floor. She had been the victim of a vicious attack. With Teresa's husband and two daughters one thousand miles away there were no obvious leads.
