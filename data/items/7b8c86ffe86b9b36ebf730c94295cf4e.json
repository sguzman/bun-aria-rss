  "title": "307 - Crikey! The Croc Hunter Steve Irwin",
  "description": "<p>Steve Irwin, better known as the Crocodile Hunter, was a wildlife enthusiast and conservationist, owner of the Australia zoo, and a TV icon loved all over the world. Known for his signature catchphrase, <i>“Crikey!,”</i>  and his classic khaki uniform, and a LOT of personality, Steve Irwin became a household name. A brand, actually. He also seemed like a huge nut to many. More akin to a reckless Circus Ringmaster than a dedicated conservationist.  But behind the fun and adventurous image full of manic enthusiasm, khaki shorts, and catch phrases, was an intelligent and driven man who was deeply passionate about wildlife conservation and had a sensitive and huge heart for all animals. Especially the ones feared by most of us. Steve was fascinated by wildlife from a young age. He was gifted a twelve-foot python at age six, caught his first crocodile at age nine, and spent his time exploring nature instead of playing games with his friends. Today we talk about his life, death, and legacy, the incredible biodiversity he fought to preserve, and so much more, on this RIPPER!
