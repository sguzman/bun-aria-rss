  "description": "This weekend is Mother's Day, a good occasion to reflect on the art of parenting. First, comedian Glenn Boozan speaks to Celeste Headlee on Here and Now about her book <em>There Are Moms Way Worse Than You</em>, a joke-book that uses examples of bad parenting from the animal kingdom to soothe those who might be worried about their own child-raising skills. Then, an interview from our archives: a 1989 chat with Amy Tan on All Things Considered about her novel <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, the story of four Chinese American families living in San Francisco inspired by Tan's experience as a child of immigrants.
