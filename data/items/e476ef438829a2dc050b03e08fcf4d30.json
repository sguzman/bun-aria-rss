  "description": "<p>In her new memoir, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/books/review-going-there-katie-couric.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Going There,”</a> Katie Couric writes about her career as a host of “Today and the first woman to anchor the “CBS Evening News” solo. She also, as the title suggests, writes about difficult personal subjects, including the deaths of her father and of her first husband. On this week’s podcast, she says the most difficult part of the book to write was about her former “Today” colleague Matt Lauer and his downfall over allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>“My feelings were so complicated, and they definitely evolved over time,” Couric says. “I felt like I was almost doing my own therapy sessions. I did original reporting — which sounds so pretentious — but I actually revisited some people who were affected by his behavior, and it was really, really helpful. And I talked to a lot of experts about this. I reached out to people who had written extensively about men in power. This was at the time it happened, because I was really trying to make sense of it in my head. I talked to gender studies people, I talked to lawyers who have represented victims. It was a real mission for me, and a lot of soul-searching honestly.”</p><p>John McWhorter visits the podcast to discuss his new book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/books/review/john-mcwhorter-woke-racism.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America.”</a></p><p>“I think that there is a certain kind of woke person who is caught in a frame of mind where the idea is that how you show that you’re a good person is by showing that you are woke — that you’re aware, for example, that racism exists, and it’s not just the N-word and people burning crosses on people’s lawns,” McWhorter says. “You want to show that you’re aware of this. But it’s narrowed to the point where a certain kind of person thinks that showing one’s awareness of that is the key, regardless of what you prescribe’s effects upon actual Black people. So although it’s the last thing these people would suspect about themselves, They do not think of Black people as more important than their own showing that they are not racist. That is a woke racist, as far as I’m concerned.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Dwight Garner and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed this week by The Times’s critics:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/books/review-end-of-bias-jessica-nordell.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The End of Bias”</a> by Jessica Nordell</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/books/review-colorization-100-years-black-filmmaking-wil-haygood.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Colorization”</a> by Wil Haygood</p>\n",
