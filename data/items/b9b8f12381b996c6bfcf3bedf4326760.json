  "description": "Last week, I gave a talk at the Data Science Sydney Meetup group about some of the lessons I learned through almost winning five Kaggle competitions. The core of the talk was ten tips, which I think are worth putting in a post (the original slides are here). Some of these tips were covered in my beginner tips post from a few months ago. Similar advice was also recently published on the Kaggle blog â€“ it&rsquo;s great to see that my tips are in line with the thoughts of other prolific kagglers."
