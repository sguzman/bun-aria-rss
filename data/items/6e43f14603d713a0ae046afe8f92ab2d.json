  "description": "<p>This week, we launch a new mini-series: The Resties Required Reading List.  Our goal is to curate and contextualize a \"must play\" list of 25 games released between 1980 to 2020. These aren’t the best games or even our favorite games. They’re the games that should be experienced by everyone who wants a fundamental appreciation of the medium. They’re the games that will give you a richer connection with every other game you play.  Throughout 2022 and 2023 we'll publish new entries in the series, each episode focusing on a five-year period. Episodes will be sporadic and non-chronological. To kick things off, we've selected 2005-2009. Let us know what you think of the series and your personal reading list at @thebestiespod on Twitter.</p>\n",
