  "description": "After Democrats won the 2020 presidential election, Republicans responded by proposing a series of new voting laws in red states — designed, they say, to protect future elections. But the U.S. government says last year saw some of the safest elections in American history. Ari Berman is a senior reporter at Mother Jones, and he sees these new laws as an effort to disenfranchise newly mobilized Black voters — a pattern that can be charted from Jim Crow to today. Berman’s story is available to read (and listen to) in Apple News+.",
