Maybe it was drug induced or simply a dream. Either way, how is it that you can have vivid imagery about what feels like reality in the moment? Dr. Jonas Kaplan joins Tom in this conversation to discuss all the ways your brain is filling in the gaps of its own break in knowledge. The brain is truly fascinating to study and so important to understand when you want to be more open-minded and question your beliefs or get a better perception of and understanding of what reality truly is. Part of seeing reality as it really is versus how your brain predicts it to be is coming face to face with information that challenges the beliefs you hold. Jonas and Tom explore research studies that reveal the freaky nature of how our brains really work and ways you can hack your way past the overprotective nature of your brain.
