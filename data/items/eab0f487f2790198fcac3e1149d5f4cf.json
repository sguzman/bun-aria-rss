  "description": "On today’s show, Pat reacts to the news that the Washington football team will officially “retire” the name and logo of the Redskins and move on to something else and what that potentially means moving forward for sponsors, fans, and the NFL in general. Pat and the boys also react to everything going on between Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, and why Nick will not take shots at him while everyone else is. Also joining the show is ESPN MMA analyst, the last Bantamweight Champion of the WEC, 2x UFC Bantamweight Champion, The Dominator, Dominick Cruz. Pat and Dom chat about this past weekend’s fights on Fight Island in Abu Dhabi, whether or not he’s gearing up for another title run, the importance of having a knowledgeable referee with big fight experience, why the judging is so hit or miss, how difficult it is taking a fight on 6 days rest, what the day of the fight is like for him, his strategy for assessing bouncers once getting into a bar, and if he ever goes into the Octagon thinking that he just doesn’t have it (10:00-35:51). Next, former 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, AL Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Winner, 2005 AL Manager of the Year, former manager of the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins, Ozzie Guillen joins the program. Pat and Ozzie discuss his disdain for the media while in Chicago and what he thinks the problem is, his thoughts on the upcoming shortened MLB season, how he would manage differently this year and what he would do strategically, his thoughts on how to handle umpires (he’s not a big fan), whether he thinks more players will be prone to using steroids this year, and why his attitude and mindset wouldn’t change regardless of the number of games being played (37:58-58:17). Lastly, NBC Sports Hockey Analyst and friend of the program, Pierre McGuire joins the show. Pat and Pierre discuss the NHL gearing up to return to play as training camps are starting to begin, how the NHL has been the benchmark of good faith negotiating throughout this whole ordeal, what he’s hearing about the intensity of the lockdown in the NHL bubble, what the Canadian government is doing to help the situation, and whether or not Pierre himself will be traveling to one of the two bubble cities for the duration of the playoffs (1:04:27-1:19:29). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We thank you all for listening. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
