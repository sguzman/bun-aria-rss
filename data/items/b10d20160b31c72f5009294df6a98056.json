  "description": "<p>An analytic theory for the spectral function for electrons coupled with\nphonons is formulated in the adiabatic limit. In the case when the chemical\npotential is large and negative $\\mu \\to -\\infty$ the ground state does not\nhave the adiabatic deformation and the spectral function is defined by the\nstandard perturbation theory. In this limit we present the spectral function\ncalculated up to fourth order in the electron-phonon coupling constant which\nsatisfies the sum rules up to the 5th moment. In the case when the chemical\npotential is pinned at the polaron binding energy the spectral function is\ndefined by the ground state with a nonzero adiabatic deformation. We calculate\nthe spectral function with the finite polaron density in the adiabatic limit.\nWe also demonstrate how the sum rules for higher moments may be evaluated in\nthe adiabatic limit. Contrary to the case of zero polaron density the spectral\nfunction with the finite polaron concentration has some contributions which are\ncharacteristic for polarons.\n</p>",
