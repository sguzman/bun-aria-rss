  "title": "Who Do You Think You Are? Imposter Syndrome with Rachel Davis [47]",
  "description": "<p>Rachel Davis joins Louise as a special guest this week for a fascinating mindset discussion.. Rachel is an artist, a practicing psychologist, and a creativity coach, making her especially qualified to discuss this week's topic - imposter syndrome. First identified in 1978, this is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a fear of being exposed as a \"fraud.\" &nbsp;Imposter syndrome can be pervasive (affecting all areas of your life) or situational (for example, only arising when you have your own gallery show or the first time you book a stand at an art fair) but it is estimated that 70% of the population has experienced it at some time. Rachel and I discuss our own experiences with imposter syndrome, debate whether artists are especially vulnerable to it, and share our strategies for overcoming the issue when it arises for you. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Rachel Davis art and creativity coaching:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/\">https://www.racheldavisstudio.com/</a></p>\n<p>Rachel's psychology website: <a href=\"http://www.drruthkalb.com/\">http://www.drruthkalb.com/</a></p>\n<p>ICB Building (regular open studio events): <a href=\"http://icbbuilding.com/\">http://icbbuilding.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
