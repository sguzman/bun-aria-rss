Janet's guest is early childhood specialist Erica Orosco Cruz, a mother of 4 and the founder/director of Homeschool Garden, a childcare center and preschool/kindergarten for children ages 1-6.

But when we have a love and a curiosity for it, it gives us a lot of opportunities to shift, to try different things.”\n\nYou can learn more about Erica's incredible work, her school, and about her online and in-person workshops at www.homeschoolgardensite.com.\n\nThanks again to Splendid Spoon for sponsoring this episode.
