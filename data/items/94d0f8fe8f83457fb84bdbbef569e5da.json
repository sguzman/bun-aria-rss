  "description": "Today we talk to Allison Baddeley, the founder of La Fete Florals, an all Inclusive event production and floral design company, creating artistically designed and flawlessly executed local Utah and destination weddings and events since 2012. Greens in florals are no longer really in style, but we are now in a trend where anything goes and people have become more individualistic in what they want, so you won’t see a lot of the same style choices when going from one event to another. A lot of flowers that are used right now are from Japan, as the US doesn’t grow much during the Winter season, but Allison says you can get some of the most beautiful flower options during February-March and she says even some flowers are as big as your face. <br /><br />How Alison got into florals 2:41<br />Hanging flowers from the ceiling 8:35<br />Greenery is not in style for florals 9:57<br />What else is in style right now? 12:17<br />Ikebana 16:43<br />How soon should you start thinking about flowers for an event? 21:17<br />Making florals last longer 26:39<br />Foraging and snipping 30:30<br />What to plant to create a bouquet 35:53<br /><br />“That style of not having any greens and any filler in your flowers is a huge trend right now. Some of you might think, ‘OK, well that’s just a bunch of roses.’ No. I still want to create texture and depth, and places for that little butterfly to fly through your centerpiece, and I want to create something that’s interesting for your eye. So I think doing that, making these all flower, or all non green centerpieces has been really fun. It’s almost like painting a painting.” 10:46<br /><br /><a href=\"https://lafetefloral.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://lafetefloral.com/</a>",
