  "title": "How to 'Make Me Feel' with Lizzo",
  "description": "\"Make Me Feel,\" is the first hit from Janelle Monáe's upcoming album Dirty Computer. It is a sensual song about the fluidity of desire. In the pre-chorus, the singer proudly expresses that she is a \"sexual bender.\" Fans have embraced the song for breaking free of normative sexual expectations. But these non-binary statements aren't limited to the lyrics. The message is reinforced with musical concepts drawn from the blues, Prince and Michael Jackson. To help break down this track, Nate and Charlie are joined by singer/rapper Lizzo. She and Monáe both collaborated with Prince, making Lizzo uniquely qualified to unwind his influence on the song (Prince was recently named as a collaborator on the track). We also discuss Lizzo's song \"Truth Hurts\" and her podcast \"Good As Hell\" where she talks to the queens of hip hop. Hands down, Lizzo is one of the most talented, knowledgeable and fun guests.
