  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We are talking about Naima Simone this week — and honestly, we could have picked any of Naima’s series to read because she’s just. that. good. We chose the whole series so we could talk more about the complexities of category romances, about wild plots, about alpha heroes, and about how Sarah is absolute trash for a rich hero and the working class girl on the other side of the tracks. Don’t @ her. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we’re back with an interstitial, and in two weeks, we’ve got Kate Clayborn joining us to talk about her upcoming book, Love at First! After that, we’re back to read alongs, but we’ll announce our next read on next week’s episode<em>…</em>see you then. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you, as always, for listening!
