  "description": "A little over 75 years ago World powers signed the Bretton Woods agreement, that saw the US dollar as the planet’s reserve currency, tied to reserves of Gold. In this week’s podcast Phil Dobbie talks to Prof Steve Keen about how the agreement missed the opportunity to create a separate reserve currency, the approach preferred by John Maynard Keynes. They also discuss why the link to Gold reserves was eventually removed, the role of the IMF and World Bank, both born out of Bretton Woods, and whether now is the right time for another get together to sort out the world’s money system. With President Trump complaining a lot about currency manipulation lately, now seems as good a time as ever.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
