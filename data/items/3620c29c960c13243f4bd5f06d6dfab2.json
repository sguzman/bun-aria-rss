  "title": "How Instacart’s harsh ratings system hurts grocery deliverers",
  "description": "From the Recode Daily archives (March 25 2021): Instacart is a gig economy app, similar to Uber or Airbnb, but for grocery deliveries. It has two sets of users: the people who order groceries, and the people who shop for them, deliver them and hope for a five-star rating in return. \nRecode’s Peter Kafka talks with Ehud Sopher, a New York filmmaker who works full-time for Instacart and earns a commission for every completed order. Sopher recently wrote a first-person essay for Vox.com about a four-star rating he received, which in the world of Instacart shoppers, meant that he was effectively facing a massive pay cut. He explains why customers deserve more transparency from Instacart about the financial repercussions of how they rate shoppers and drivers. \n\nReferences: You can read Sopher's story on Vox.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
