  "description": "Christine M. DeLucia is the author of Memory Lands: King Philip’s War and the Place of Violence in the Northeast, published by Yale University Press in 2018. Memory Lands provides a much needed new account of King Philip’s War which centers the Natives of the Northeast, instead of the English colonizers. Weaving together the history of King Philip’s War and the history of Northeast Native people to the modern day, DeLucia illustrates the many, complex, ways in which history and historical violence are intimately connected to the present day, and rarely ever just part of the past.\nChristine M. DeLucia is an Assistant Professor of History at Williams College. Her areas of research include Early American history, Native American and Indigenous Studies, material culture, cross-cultural communications, and violence.\nDerek Litvak is a Ph.D. student in the department of history at the University of Maryland.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
