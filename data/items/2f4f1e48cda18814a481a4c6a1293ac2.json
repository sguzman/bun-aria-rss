  "description": "On today's show, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x Pro Bowler, and friend of the program, Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman joins the guys via FaceTime. They discuss how Shawne thinks the Bucs made a mistake signing Tom Brady, why he thinks Phil Rivers is physically in better shape than Tom Brady and primed to have a better season, and what he thinks the Chargers are going to do to address Quarterback before the start of the season (3:58-17:04). Next, AJ Hawk is back for another episode of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk. They chat about the Colts choosing not to go after Tom Brady, his future in Tampa Bay next season and the reports coming out about Brady and Belichick’s relationship. Pat and AJ also talk about times playing in the NFL, answer some YouTube Questions, and discuss the future of the New England Patriots without Tom Brady. (18:31-1:33:38). Lastly, NFL Insider and NFL Network reporter Tom Pelissero joins the show to discuss everything that has been happening in free agency including why he thinks Bill Belichick wanted Brady out of New England, whether or not Jadeveon Clowney will really get upwards of 20 million dollars from a team, where he thinks Jameis Winston will wind up, and what that means for guys like Andy Dalton, Cam Newton, and some of the other quarterbacks left on the market (1:36:06-1:56:06). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for a chance to win some free merch. Stay safe out there, and come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
