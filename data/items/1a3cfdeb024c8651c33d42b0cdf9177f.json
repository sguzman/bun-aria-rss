  "itunes:subtitle": "Audible Edge",
  "itunes:summary": "Thinking and listening to place emerges as a thematic of Where and how to gather - a collection of texts published on Disclaimer and edited by Josten Myburgh. These works consider technology and humanity as being in the world, rather than as tacet mediators or observers of it, with the writing investigating the processes by which meditation is obscured, or how presence is made difficult.\n\nJim Denley, as part of the group Sounding Together, and Jasmine Guffond talk through the ideas and processes behind their respective pieces, ‘Meelup (Moonrise), Boranup (Sunrise)’ and ‘Surveillance Lifestyles’.\n\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/where-and-how-to-gather\n\nJasmine Guffond quotes Greg Barns via Michael West Media: https://www.michaelwest.com.au/privacy-in-jeopardy-with-covid-apps-tracking-every-move/\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
