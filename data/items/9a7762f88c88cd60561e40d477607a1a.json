  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, while Hitler burned through Europe and Tojo took over Japan and Mussolini controlled Italy and North Africa, world leaders from all over the globe urged the United States to not get involved. It was only after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor everyone stopped with the isolationist nonsense, but America started from behind. It took time to rev up our industry to create the weapons and equipment needed. As much as the US didn't want to get involved, we had no choice once we were attacked. We are following down this same path today with the appeasement towards Russia, China, and Iran. China and Russia combined to spend more than the US does on their national defense. These countries conceal their spending and growth so that they can criticize the US for warmongering. \nAlso, Democrats won’t get rid of Joe Biden until they have a replacement lined up, and it isn’t Kamala Harris. We have endless made up success stories about the Biden Administration, the latest being the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which does nothing to lower inflation but imposes the Democrat’s green energy demands on us. Democrats are playing with fire when it comes to the economy. Later, Isaiah Berlin's thoughts on liberty are staples that must not be forgotten. Berlin's concept of positive and negative liberty is that negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers, or constraints. Positive liberty is the possibility of acting — or the fact of acting — in such a way as to take control of one's life and realize one's fundamental purposes.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
