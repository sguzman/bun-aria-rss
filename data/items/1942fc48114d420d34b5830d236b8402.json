First, Super Bowl Champion, 7x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade team, one of the greatest Cornerbacks of all-time, Darrelle Revis joins the show to chat about his career as a whole, getting his funk back, his relationship with the Jets, and much more in an incredible conversation (19:51-56:20). Next, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport joins the progrum to give us updates on everything going on around the league as 12 teams have officially reported (57:02-1:13:18). Later, Senior NFL reporter and author of The Monday Morning Quarterback, Albert Breer joins the show to chat about how he compiles everything for MMQB, when he thinks a punishment for Deshaun Watson is coming, when he thinks we might get some movement on Baker Mayfield and Jimmy Garoppolo, being a direct competitor with Peter King after being hand picked to replace him at MMQB, and much more (1:13:56-1:45:29). Lastly, friend of the progrum, President of the UFC, Dana White joins the show to chat about this weekend's UFC 275 card and what we can expect, his thoughts on the PGA Tour/LIV Golf and how it's similar to what he has to deal with with other fight leagues, the possibility of Jon Jones vs. Stipe Miocic in the future, and much more (1:45:31-2:04:09).</p>\n",
