  "description": "<p>It's great if you are out there trying to build a business and life of value. But too many people out there are complaining that they have \"haters.\" According to The MFCEO Andy Frisella, very few people have accomplished anything significant enough to have haters. The haters are imaginary; they exist in the minds of people who want to create excuses for their lack of progress. In reality, you might be on the receiving end of legitimate criticism. If that's the case, don't call it \"hate.\" Accept it humbly. Learn from it. And use it to truly accomplish great things.</p>",
