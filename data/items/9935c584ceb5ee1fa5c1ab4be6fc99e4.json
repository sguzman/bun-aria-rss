  "description": "<p>Back again this week with what is quickly becoming a fan favorite, the Bevisode! In this third installment we go a little meta with Bev breaking down her own episode... breaking down other guests’ episodes. Bev goes on to share her admiration for us getting a ‘down to earth’ millennial like Sofia Franklyn on the show along with her lack of enthusiasm for the mindful, philosophical conversation we had with Sam Harris. Later Bev reflects on the sadness she felt during Jaleel White’s openness about the realities of being a child star and the similarities she saw in Mayim. And finally, we breakdown her thoughts on male nail polish in AJ McLean’s episode, plus the correlations around the idea of ‘chaos’ that she experienced in her life.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
