  "title": "Bob Odenkirk | Kyiv Hope Alive",
  "description": "The world has been gripped by the dramatic images of heroism and heartbreak coming out of Ukraine, where things do not appear to be playing out according to Putin’s plan and a comedian-turned-president has emerged as a national hero. Next, Stephen's back with more monologue to talk about how the world is so united in opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that even famously-neutral Switzerland joined the effort to block access to crucial financial systems like SWIFT. And Stephen wishes a fond farewell to The Late Show’s executive producer and showrunner Chris Licht, who is leaving to run CNN. Then, friend of the show Bob Odenkirk stops by and talks about bidding farewell to his character Saul Goodman after more than a decade portraying the corrupt lawyer in “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul.” Stick around for more from Bob Odenkirk, and check out his new memoir, “Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama,” available everywhere now. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
