  "description": "<p>Like naïve little kids at Christmas, the average person thinks success is magical.  They think that achieving your goals, fulfilling your dreams, and living a life of health, wealth, and happiness happens when somewhere, in Never Never Land, the stars align, the Success Fairy waves her Magical One Hundred Percent Guaranteed Success Wand, and everything in your life miraculously turns to glitter and gold. But people who are destined to succeed know better. They <em>know</em> they are destined to succeed because they know that success is not magic. It comes from busting one’s ass.  It is the <em>inevitable</em> result of hard work. </p>",
