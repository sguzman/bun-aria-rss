The Texas Republican also discussed his recent meeting with Donald Trump, who might find Hensarling a good match for his cabinet should the Republican real-estate mogul become president.      The Exchange is a regular conversation with influential and interesting people hosted by Rob Cox, global editor of Breakingviews, the financial commentary publication of Thomson Reuters.
