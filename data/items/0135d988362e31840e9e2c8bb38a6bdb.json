  "description": "Death of Diren Dede. April 27, 2014. Missoula, Montana. When homeowners are burglarized multiple times and the police seem to be able to offer little to no support, they choose to take other measures. They set up a camera and motion sensors in their open garage and wait for another burglar. A high school student named Diren Dede enters the open garage within a few days and the homeowner, Marcus Kaarma, heads outside armed with his shotgun. Diren is shot and killed. Kaarma feels he acted within his rights as defined by Montana's 'castle law'. Police and prosecutors disagreed.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
