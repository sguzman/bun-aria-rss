  "description": "<p>Alastair Humphreys is a real-life adventurer. He's biked around the world and has even been named Adventurer of the Year by National Geographic. But Alastair wanted to show people that you didn't need to travel halfway across the world or spend a lot of money or time to find adventure. So for a year, he did what he called \"Microadventures\" in his native England. They're small things he could do in an evening after work or on a weekend. He cataloged all of his adventures in a book called \"Microadventures\" and today on the podcast Alastair and I discuss how the average Joe can find more adventure in his life by going on microadventures.</p>\n",
