  "description": "<p>ROUND 1: There are about 27 Fast & Furious movies now, but we’re especially excited for the next one - Fast & Furious, Syria Drift which is inspired by true events this week as a Russian vehicle tried to go full Vin Diesel against a convoy of US MRAPs.\n\nROUND 2: How do you guys like your coffee? With piss? Well that’s super weird. But if true, you guys are gonna love what a disgruntled Airman is in trouble for.  \n\nROUND 3: A survey has come out telling us what states have the most folks enlisting. Is YOUR state one of the most patriotic? \n\nROUND 4: We all know bureaucratic red tape & the military go together like peas & carrots, and that’s especially true for a Marine Recruit who has been in the brig for almost 2 years now, but… without any charges or trial thus far???\n\nROUND 5: We’ll close out the show with some final thoughts on Iwo Jima and what the legacy means to us..</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
