  "description": "<p>For the next fictional installment of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Justin & Jeff to talk about one of the most famous battles in the Star Wars franchise: The Battle of Hoth. Otherwise known as the Evacuation of Echo Base, the battle on the arctic planet featured the soldiers of the Rebel Alliance fighting a delaying action against the better equipped Galactic Imperial forces, which included the infamous All-Terrain Armored Transports (AT-ATs). In this episode, Avery gets a little crazy about Star Wars lore again, Jeff gets concerned for Avery's mental health, and Justin proposes opening a Committee on the Conduct of War in the Star Wars universe. Enjoy!</p>",
