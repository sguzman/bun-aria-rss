  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Anne-Marie Slaughter | Join us for this event discussing Anne-Marie Slaughter's new book, Renewal: From Crisis to Transformation in Our Lives, Work, and Politics.\nLike much of the world, America is deeply divided over identity, equality, and history. Renewal is Anne-Marie Slaughter’s candid and deeply personal account of how her own odyssey opened the door to an important new understanding of how we as individuals, organisations, and nations can move backward and forward at the same time, facing the past and embracing a new future.Weaving together personal stories and reflections with insights from the latest research in the social sciences, Slaughter recounts a difficult time of self‐examination and growth in the wake of a crisis that changed the way she lives, leads, and learns. She connects her experience to her nation's crisis of identity and values as the country looks into a four-hundred-year-old mirror and tries to confront and accept its full reflection.\nMeet our speaker and chair\nAnne-Marie Slaughter (@SlaughterAM) is CEO of New America and the Bert G.
