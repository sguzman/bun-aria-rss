  "description": "Elizabeth Bathory. The infamous Hungarian countess was born in 1560. She would grow up to be a highly educated and powerful figure. By 1610, though, she would find herself accused of heinous crimes, investigated, & arrested. The accusations had begun soon after the death of her husband, Ferenc Nadasdy in 1604. Her supposed crimes included the murders of hundreds of servant girls, involving torture and bloodletting to allow the countess to bathe in their blood. For much of history these allegations against her widely accepted. In more recent years, research done on her life and her supposed criminal history seems to suggest a completely different history for Elizabeth Bathory. Was she a deadly serial murderer? Or was the countess the victim of a political plot to seize power away from her?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
