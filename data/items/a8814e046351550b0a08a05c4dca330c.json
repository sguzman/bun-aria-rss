We reached out to this episode's director, Jeffrey Blitz, and actor Wayne Wilderson, to get their memories and insights of this episode. We start with a haunted hotel story, the ladies discuss Pig Latin and Jenna explains the language of Ab. Then we get the origins of Prison Mike, and the scoop on how hard it was to get through those conference room scenes without breaking or sweating. To wrap it up, we discuss the scene with Andy singing Rainbow Connection and get some final insights from Jeffrey Blitz. Tanks for listening! It’s been a good life!</p>\n",
