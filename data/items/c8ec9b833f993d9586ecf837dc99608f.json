  "description": "While there’s little more satisfying than watching a socialist lose big in America, it’s much less satisfying to the socialists. The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur declared war on the Democratic establishment for what he saw as a rigged election. And Ilhan Omar hated that her state went to Biden as well. But Biden’s night wasn’t without its mishaps: Protesters rushed the stage, and he mistook his wife for his sister. Once again, the real winner was Donald Trump.
