  "description": "Brandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Chad Johnson sit down Frank and Warrick Scott of the Wendell Scott family and discuss the legacy of Wendell Scott and his impact on NASCAR and his community. \n \nStarting off, Frank discusses the making of the 1977 film Greased Lighting that tells the story of his father and stock car racer Wendell Scott. Frank shares that the movie has several deleted scenes in efforts to reach a broader audience. Because of this, Frank believes that the movie doesn’t depict the true Wendell Scott Story and he and his son Warrick vow to tell their father’s uncut story to the world. \n \nFrank goes on to share a quote he father shared with him as a young boy “Just because I lose a race, doesn’t mean that I’m defeated”. Frank shares that he has always wanted to be a boxer and he uses this quote to share with Ocho to encourage him to keep training and fighting.\n \nChanning prompts the question of the pressures of upholding the legacy and name of their father Wendell. Warrick responded that there isn’t any pressure because he grew up in a “pressure cooker” experiencing and hearing the hardships that his grandfather endured while still being successful. He goes on to share that his life work is solely dedicated to liberating his grandfather’s legacy. \n \nWarrick and Frank go on to share untold stories of Wendell Scott and the hardships he endured during the civil rights movement as his career began to blossom. They shared how he often feared for his life before and after races and how he navigated a sport that didn’t embrace people who looked like him. \n \nWarrick and Frank share their father’s dream and how the birth of the Wendell Scott Foundation came to life. Warrick lays out the purpose and goals of the foundation to advocate and broker for young black kids going to college. Frank gets emotional after seeing his father’s vision being manifested through his son Warrick after over 50 years. \n\n\nI AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletepodcast/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast?\n\nHOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/?utm_medium=copy_link\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete \nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/?utm_medium=copy_link\nHoA Supplements on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/houseofathlete\n\n#IAANascar\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChadJohnson\n#ChanningCrowder\n#FrankScott\n#WarrickScott\n#WendellScott\n#MoreThanAPodcast\n\n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL).\n\nGambling problem?
