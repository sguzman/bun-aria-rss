  "description": "In today's CyberWire, we discuss why the US Intelligence Community got prickly about Kaspersky: their Israeli colleagues tipped them off that something was fishy in the software's use. UpGuard says Accenture left some AWS data buckets exposed. Accenture says they were associated with decommissioned systems, but exposed they seem to have been. Sources say Deloitte's breach is worse than hitherto disclosed, with more than three-hundred clients exposed. Joe Carrigan from JHU ISI with some follow-up from a listener on password security when using password managers. Brian NeSmith from Arctic Wolf with results from an IoT ransomware survey.  \n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors.\n If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper.\n Cylance uses cutting edge artificial intelligence to help protect your systems.\n If you are a woman in cyber security and want make connections with others in the field, check out our own  Women in Cyber Security event.",
