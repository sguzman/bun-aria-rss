  "description": "<p>Dr. Sarita Adve is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research interests span the system stack, including hardware, programming languages, operating systems, and applications. She co-developed the memory consistency models for the C++ and Java programming languages, based on her early work on data-race-free (DRF) models, and has made innovative contributions to heterogenous computing and software-driven approaches to resiliency. Her group recently released the Illinois Extended Reality testbed (ILLIXR), the first fully open source extended reality system to democratize XR systems research and development. She is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science, IEEE, ACM and a recipient of the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award. As ACM SIGARCH chair, she co-founded the CARES movement, and is a winner of the CRA distinguished service award.</p>\n",
