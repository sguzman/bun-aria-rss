  "description": "<p>It's our June Book Club! Today is Becca's Superbowl... also known as <em>The Idea of You</em> Emotional Support Group. If you’ve been listening for a while you know how OBSESSED we are with this book. Seriously, we’re still trying to figure out how life continues after reading it. We finally get to talk about it today. Becca has begun her healing process through writing her own sequel. In light of this book, Becca and Grace talk about their favorite boy band, leading to a heated debate over whether or not Mark Wahlberg was actually a real member of New Kids on the Block. Finally, we talk about the youngest age we would date and whether that changes if he was famous (hint: it does). </p> <p>Also in this episode, Grace had a mini college reunion at the Boston live show and Becca is still distraught over this book, but is recovering with the show <em>Dead to Me.</em>  </p> <p>PSA: Tomorrow we are releasing a bonus episode with the incredible writer of this book, Robinne Lee, where we practically beg for a sequel.
