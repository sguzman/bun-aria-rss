Guiding us to that reconnection is award-winning \"Art-ivist\" Queen Quet, who, through her organization, the Gullah/Geechee Sea Island Coalition, advocates for the preservation of the Gullah/Geechee Nation and knows all too well how the motherland's spirit still lives in Black Americans.\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!
