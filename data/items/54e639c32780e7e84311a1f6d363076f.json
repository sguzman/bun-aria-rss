  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden visited Buffalo, NY, and harped on 'replacement theory' but took no responsibility for what's going on at the border. The vast majority of Americans including Hispanics who live near the border reject Biden's border policies. The Buffalo killer identified as a nationalist socialist with contempt for Fox News and Jews and didn't shoot at Hispanics, he specifically targeted African Americans which has nothing to do with the so-called 'replacement theory' ideology. Then, Iran is positioning itself to advance its nuclear position. Iran is deploying more advanced centrifuges and enriching more uranium, enough for one or more nuclear bombs. The Biden Administration and the media are ignoring these developments. Later, Michelle Obama moves to change the language by eliminating the letter \"E\" from the word women and replacing it with an \"X\" in her comments on how overturning Roe v. Wade would hurt women. And a middle school mom gets shut down by a school board for defending her kid from pornographic material distributed by the school. Afterward, polls in Pennsylvania have closed, however, there is no clear winner as of yet. Ted Budd wins the North Carolina Republican Senate primary.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
