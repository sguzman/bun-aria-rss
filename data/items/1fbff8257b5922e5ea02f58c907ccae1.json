  "description": "<p>The very last in our installment of live podcasts that I did at the almighty Outbreak Fest in June of 2022 in front of a live audience. These two chats were awesome and of course, with great people involved in independent music. The first one is with Mat Kerekes from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0znuUIjvP0LXEslfaq0Nor?si=KDmyqv6lQmSJh8accOTniQ\">Citizen</a> in which we discuss video games, working out and UK audiences. Then, I chat with Isa Holliday from <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3nOrhUtscermNwmfBQRZZv?si=n6_py60JR16AS5RYpBx9FQ\">Slow Crush</a> as they were wrapping up a whirlwind world tour that was so ambitious I admired it from afar. We got into her background, why they love guitar pedals and a lot more. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://taken.limitedrun.com/\"><strong>Buy Podcast Merch Here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/tapestrygoldmusic?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\"><strong>Theme Song by Tapestry Gold</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_akI_b6HY7yrc2Zc1ciBvw\"><strong>Subscribe to the podcast on YouTube</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rockabilia.com/\"><strong>Rockabilia sells you officially licensed Merch from ALL your favorite bands (and your Dad's favorite band, your siblings etc...).
