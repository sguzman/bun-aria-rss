  "description": "<p>It's Em's lucky episode 222 and the rumors are true... Christine is with demon! We're dishing all the details on reactions and reliving the wild pregnancy genius that is The Maltese Bagans (created because a certain famed demon hunter yet again did not respond to Christine's pleas). Then Em takes on a story just dripping in ectoplasm from every orifice, the story of medium Eva Carrière (NOT to be confused with our Eva, for reasons that will soon become clear). Afterward, Christine takes us to New South Wales, Australia to cover the brutal and heartbreaking case of the Lin family murders and a daughter so incredible we can't send her enough love and light. We also debate the use of planchettes as teething toys... and that's why we drink! <br /><br />Watch the Maltese Bagans here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/andthatswhyidontdrink\">bit.ly/andthatswhyidontdrink</a><br /><br />Please consider supporting the companies that support us!<br /><br />Go to Canva.me/atwwd to get your FREE 45-day extended trial! <br /><br />If you go to <a href=\"http://reliefband.com/\">reliefband.com</a> and use promo code DRINK you’ll receive 20% off<br />plus free shipping and a no questions asked 30-day money back guarantee! <br /><br />Go to DAILYHARVEST.com and enter promo code DRINK to get $25 off your first box!<br /><br />Try 5 pairs of glasses at home for free at <a href=\"http://warbyparker.com/drink\">warbyparker.com/drink</a><br /><br />Stay fresh, stay clean with Native by going to NativeDeo.com/drink for 20% off your first order! <br /><br />Go to Curology.com/drink for a free 30-day trial, just pay for shipping and handling!</p>\n",
