  "description": "<p>This week, we share the second half of a talk from Bishop Barron on John Henry Newman’s book, <em>The Grammar of Assent</em>. We shared the first half last week, so be sure to listen to that first.</p> <p><em>The Grammar of Assent</em> concerns question about how we come to believe in God, and is widely considered Newman’s most important text.</p> <p>Also, it’s a timely topic, since John Henry Newman will be canonized in just a couple weeks, on October 13. Bishop Barron will be attending the canonization, then a few days later will deliver a talk at Oxford University on “John Henry Newman and the New Evangelization.” That talk, which we’re planning to livestream, will focus primarily on <em>The Grammar of Assent</em>.</p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
