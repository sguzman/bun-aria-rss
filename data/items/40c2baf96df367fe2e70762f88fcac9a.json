  "title": "220 - The Truck Stop Killer: Robert Ben Rhoades",
  "description": "<p>Robert Ben Rhoades, born in 1945, started driving big rigs across America’s interstates and major highways in the mid-1970s, and he seemed to most like an unassuming and harmless trucker for the next fifteen-ish years. He wasn't. He was a monster. The Iowa native’s childhood had ended abruptly when his dad was arrested for an alarming crime and, after the way his father responded to this arrest, life seemed to spiral out of control for the man who would soon introduce himself to others as either “Dusty”, or, via is CB radio - “Whips and Chains.” Bob became a sexual sadist, obsessed with the fetish world of BDSM. <br />Soon, he began to completely ignore the “fun and consensual” part of bondage and submission, pivoting from pleasure through pain to pleasure through rape, torture, and murder. The <em>“Truck Stop Killer”</em>  killed an estimated fifty-plus people between roughly 1975 and 1990, most of them young women and the occasional men they were traveling with. <br />Bob overpowered young hitchhikers and sex workers in the sleeper cab of his truck, tying them up with BDSM chains and restraints, and then raping and torturing them for days, sometimes longer, in a mobile dungeon with nipple clamps, belts, chains, handcuffs, fish hooks and more. We explore Bob's crimes, the world of BDSM he was obsessed with, and more in today's true crime edition of Timesuck. </p>\n<p>In honor of Veteran’s Day,  we made a Bad Magic Productions donation of $10,000 to <a href=\"https://veteransfoodpantry.org/\"><strong>https://veteransfoodpantry.org/</strong></a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ydt4VBd_NSY\">https://youtu.be/ydt4VBd_NSY</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"> </a><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
