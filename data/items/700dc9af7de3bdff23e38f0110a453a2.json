    "media:description": "Scalability is the ability of a database to constantly adjust its resources to meet application demands. MongoDB has a full range of vertical, horizontal, and elastic scaling options available, and they are built into MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB’s multi-cloud developer data platform.&#13;\n&#13;\n- Vertical and horizontal scaling — and which one to choose&#13;\n- Scaling proactively vs. reactively&#13;\n- How to choose cluster sizing and tier selection&#13;\n- Atlas cluster auto-scaling&#13;\n- Horizontal scaling with sharding&#13;\n- Serverless instances and elastic scaling&#13;\n&#13;\nScalability is a key requirement of modern, distributed applications and database systems. Make sure your applications are using the best practices for scaling.",
