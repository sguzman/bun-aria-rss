  "title": "The Greatest Blood Week in the History of Week 1",
  "description": "Blood Week: the week (or weeks) in a college football season where maximum chaos is realized, and the status quo is upturned by as many upsets as the sport can stuff into its craw in one stretch. That usually happens in the middle of the schedule, but there's no rule saying Blood Week has to be then. So we decided to hunt for the bloodiest Week 1 in the sport's history. Without totally spoiling it, our choice includes:\n- A wasted trip to Anaheim, California\n- Golf clubs used as rescue devices\n- A mountain hero named Earl\nRemember - if you enjoy the Shutdown Fullcast, tell a friend and leave us a nice review! If you do not enjoy the Shutdown Fullcast, write your thoughts down on a letter that will be sent to us only upon your death! We won't be able to argue with you! Ultimate victory is within your grasp!!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
