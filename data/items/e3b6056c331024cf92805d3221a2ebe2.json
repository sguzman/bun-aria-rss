  "description": "<p>Today’s episode of The POD kicks off with a full barn! The boys open up the episode with a discussion about the season finale of The House of Dragons and other show/movie chatter. With a rather candid start the boys then jump right into the Pod FOD which is a folder compiled of all things around the internet. Today's FOD includes a look into a close up of an ant’s face, some crazy trick shots, a massive GET OUT OF THE WAY moment, and much much more. Make sure to subscribe to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/thepodpmi\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/thepodpmi</a> to watch full episodes and don't&nbsp;forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD&nbsp;to&nbsp;@ThePodPMI on twitter and instagram. We appreciate&nbsp;you rocking with us and we'll see you Wednesday, Cheers.</p>\n",
