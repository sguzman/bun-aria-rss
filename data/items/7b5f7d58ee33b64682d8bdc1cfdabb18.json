The restaurants reflect her lifelong passion for food and ingredients of excellent quality, as well as a joie de vie. All the concepts are cherished neighborhood destinations, serving dishes made with the highest quality ingredients in the freshest preparation methods possible. Their walls are filled with art, music floats above the buzz of the diners and an urban energy reverberates that is the direct result of her vision.<br />\nWhen Hoover opened Café Patachou, her goal was to prepare the best “simple” food using high quality ingredients. This was quite a novel approach in 1989. Vendors said that it was a mistake to roast our own meat and make homemade bread because cheaper, yet inferior, alternatives were available. The standard in the local industry deemed that strict quality standards were not necessary for success in this market. Immediately, customers noted the difference between Café Patachou and other breakfast/ lunch restaurants and that has been the key to the success of the entire company. Patachou, Inc. has purposefully grown slowly over the past twenty years. Hoover is a hands-on owner who is truly active in the business assuring the adherence to exacting standards and attention to every detail.</p>\n<h4>“I grew up with this family mantra that all the great food in the world starts and ends in New York.” [04:00]</h4>\n<p>“I don’t think I told our story enough early enough.
