  "description": "If you’ve ever worked in an office setting, no matter what your role, you can relate to Glenn's guest. In fact, he has probably made you laugh more than once at the absurdity of the personalities and situations you encounter at work. Until late 2015, he was best known as a wildly successful cartoonist and bestselling author. But a certain larger-than-life presidential candidate changed that. While the media drove itself and the rest of America insane trying to figure out the how and why of Donald Trump, he had an articulate explanation that to him seemed very obvious: Trump is a master of persuasion. Still, he does not call himself a conservative, nor a Democrat. He is one of the leading voices of what is becoming an endangered American species: people who dare to think for themselves. He is still a cartoonist and bestselling author, but has now added blogger, podcaster, and political commentator to his day job. He is creator of the worldwide comic strip phenomenon \"Dilbert\" – Scott Adams.\n\nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nAR500 Armor makes buying ballistic body armor easy, approachable, and affordable. They’ve built out a special package that’s 30% off for my listeners that’s perfect for anyone trying to ensure they have just the right amount of protection for dangerous situations, while maintaining affordability. Go to https://AR500ARMOR.com/BECK to see this package and use code “BECK” for 20% off anything else in their entire store.  \n\nAshford University’s online bachelor’s and master’s degree programs allow you to learn on a convenient and flexible schedule. Go from dreaming to doing.
