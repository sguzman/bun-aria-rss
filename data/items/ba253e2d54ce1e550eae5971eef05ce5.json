  "description": "<p>The leading cause of bankruptcy in America is the inability to pay medical bills- an estimated half a million people file for this reason every year! Almost no one is immune to the rising cost of healthcare, and fellow podcaster Dan Weissmann is here to commiserate. Dan’s podcast, An Arm and a Leg, is part journalism part personal narrative as he dives into real life experiences of Americans with their health coverage. Healthcare is definitely confusing, and based on the fact that our country spends almost 20% of our GDP on medical spending- it is also clear that costs are out of control. </p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an SKB IPA by Sun King Brewery- a big thanks to James for donating this beer to the show!
