  "description": "<p>Back in 2016, a bizarre story emerged in pop culture. Professional wrestler Hulk Hogan won a $115 million dollar lawsuit against the gossip website Gawker for publishing a sex tape that had been made without his consent. The victory was somewhat surprising but the real surprise was who was actually behind the lawsuit; it wasn't Hogan himself, but the billionaire founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel.  </p><p>Thiel had his own axe to grind against Gawker, and he had been honing it since 2007. He had been plotting to take down Gawker for almost a decade. </p><p>What may sound like a tawdry story of celebrity and scandal, actually contains surprisingly potent lessons on revenge, Stoicism, strategy, perseverance, hubris, privacy, and the underrated power of secrets. </p><p>My guest today dug into this story and its insights in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07637TDJJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07637TDJJ&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4&th=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue</em></a>.
