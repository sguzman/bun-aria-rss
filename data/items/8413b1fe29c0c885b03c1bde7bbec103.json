  "title": "Kirk Minihane Is Glad He Didn't Have Twitter at 16",
  "description": "<p><p>A reporter for the Des Moines Register dug up some old tweets from a man who is raising millions of dollars for a children's charity, and we all agree that's a dirtbag move. But what if a Minifan did the same thing to one of Minihane's enemies? That's the conundrum facing the Kirk Minihane Show today. Cousin Mike joins the show to talk about... Tony Kornheiser, whether Minihane can keep his cool during the Trial of the Century, and his often contentious relationship with his son, Dave Portnoy. Minihane's old casting couch pal Trenni Kusnierek shares some Antonio Brown hot takes on WBUR. Former Minifan President MHB drops in to tell hilarious jokes, slander Steve Robinson, and defend his honor. The Minifans respond to Minihane's call to action. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
