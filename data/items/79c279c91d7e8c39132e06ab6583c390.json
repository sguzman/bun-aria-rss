  "description": "This week Joe, Rory, and Mal are joined by “HitMaka” (formerly known as Yung Berg) and if you enjoyed his previous appearance on the podcast (episode 115) you’ll love this episode. Joe and the guys start off by recapping the Grammy’s & some of the headlines that stemmed from the award show (6:42). Then they discuss the Roc Nation brunch and the exclusivity of the event (50:45). Obviously it’s no secret that Joe has retired from rapping, but could HitMaka be the person who convinces Joe to come out of retirement? The guys get into a heated debate on Joe’s next moves (1:46:08). This episode is loaded! Make sure you cop your tickets for “Oh What a Night” on February 21st!
