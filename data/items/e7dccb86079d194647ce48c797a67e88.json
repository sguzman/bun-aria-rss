Perhaps you believed you would have achieved a number of goals by a certain time. Or maybe you expected that you’d be married by a certain age. Or that your relationship would last a lifetime. While it’s admirable to set goals, and aspire to find love and connection, it’s also dangerous to tie our happiness to our expectations. Because when reality doesn’t meet our expectations, we often find ourselves lost, confused and in pain.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome back to the Tony Robbins Podcast where we are continuing our breakthrough series -  taking you to events like Date with Destiny, UPW and Business Mastery, where you’ll have a front row seat to life-changing transformations.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in this episode, you are going to hear Tony work with Dano. Dano has been with his partner for decades. They’ve built a family and a life together, but they are finding themselves at a crossroad.
