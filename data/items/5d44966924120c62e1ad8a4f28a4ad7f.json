    "media:description": "► In this week's video, I discuss the career of indie rock legends, Death Cab for Cutie. Led by Ben Gibbard, the group began in Bellingham, Washington in 1997 as a solo project. Chris Walla, Nick Harmer and Nathan Good would join soon later and thus, Death Cab was born. With 9 studio albums, including classics such as Transatlanticism (2003) and Plans (2005), this is the story of Death Cab for Cutie. A band that continues to amaze 25 years deep into their journey.\n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
