  "description": "<p>Another massive interview coming your way today as we sit down with the legendary two-time Olympic medallist Sally Pearson to learn more about her amazing athletics career. We find out from Sally just what made her switch to hurdles at a young age and why it wasn't an event that she took seriously for a few years into her hurdling career. We also find out more about THAT interview from the Beijing Olympics, and why all the pressure leading into London helped her to win that famous gold medal. Added to this we find out just how she feels she would've gone had she competed in both Rio & Tokyo, and just what other Olympic sport we might have a chance at seeing her compete in one day. It's an incredible chat that you will not want to miss, so tune in and get pumped!</p>",
