  "description": "<p>Seth Rogen (actor, writer, producer, director) and Lauren Miller Rogen (writer, director, producer, philanthropist) join us to discuss the origin and missions of HFC, their non-profit organization, that cares for families impacted by Alzheimer's disease, activates the next generation of Alzheimer's advocates, and leads brain health research and education. Lauren opens up about her mother’s battle with Alzheimer’s at an early age, and how her mother’s diagnosis affected the early stages of her relationship with Seth. Seth and Lauren discuss the ripples of mental health struggles on an entire family, why treating and preventing Alzheimer’s can be so difficult, and the benefits of familiarizing yourself with symptoms of neurological diseases. They explain potential causes of early onset Alzheimer’s, lifestyle changes that can help promote brain health, and the positive and negative effects of marijuana use on brain health. Mayim and The Rogens consider the need for universal access to medical and mental health resources and reasons Americans may be distrustful of the healthcare system.</p><p>Learn more about HFC: <a href=\"https://wearehfc.org/\">WeAreHFC.org</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
