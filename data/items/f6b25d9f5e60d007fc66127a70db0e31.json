  "description": "In recent years, India has repeatedly expressed its ambitions of becoming a global power – or ‘jagat guru.’ Yet, many believe that India’s economic troubles at home are far more pressing and that foreign policy aspirations can wait. But is a proactive foreign policy really a ‘luxury’ for India, to be postponed until the economy develops; or is it, in fact, a prerequisite for economic growth in a globalized world? Why should the average Indian citizen care about foreign policy – and how can a proactive foreign policy help Indians become more prosperous? Scanning our ever-changing world from East to West, and defining India’s national interests and needs, Mohamed Zeeshan’s Flying Blind: India’s Quest for Global Leadership (Vintage Books, 2021) passionately argues that India needs a more coherent strategy for its relations with the outside world. Through travels and debates across continents, Zeeshan lays out a vision for how India can champion the cause of global good.\nMohamed Zeeshan is an Indian journalist, columnist, and foreign policy commentator. He regularly writes for The Diplomat and The Deccan Herald, and he is the Founding Partner and Editor in Chief of Freedom Gazette, an independent media platform.\nShatrunjay Mall is a PhD candidate at the Department of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He works on transnational Asian history, and his dissertation explores intellectual, political, and cultural intersections and affinities that emerged between Indian anti-colonialism and imperial Japan in the twentieth century.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
