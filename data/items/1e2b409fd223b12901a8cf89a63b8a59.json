  "title": "How well does soil actually store carbon?",
  "description": "Don’t miss our live episode of Climavores in New York City on October 20! Sign up here for a night of live audio and networking with top voices in climate journalism. \nThere’s a buzz right now about paying farmers to trap and store emissions. Soil is a carbon sink, and certain farming practices accelerate carbon capture while others hurt it. \nEnter soil carbon credits to incentivize sequestration through methods like cover cropping, no-till farming and agroforestry. These are practices often included under the umbrella of regenerative agriculture. So what does science say about how well these methods actually lock away carbon?\nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Eric Slessarev, staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he studies soil carbon. \nEric says there’s a lot we don’t know about how well these practices actually work. There are even more fundamental questions like how much carbon is in the soil. Turns out dirt is pretty complicated.\nThey cover things like:\n\nHow exactly carbon gets into the soil and why it sticks around.\n\nThe challenges with measuring soil carbon.\n\nThe difference between soil carbon and enhanced weathering.\n\nHow microbes, minerals and the depth of root systems affect storage.\n\nSpecific practices like no-till farming, agroforestry and cover cropping.\n\nWhy our soil carbon models may need a big update.\n\nResources:\n\n\nCanary Media: Carbon storage gets dirty: The movement to sequester CO2 in soils\n\n\nInternational Soil Carbon Network Seminar Series: Towards a Durable Understanding of Soil Carbon as a Tool for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation\n\nCatalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Scale Microgrid Solutions, your comprehensive source for all distributed energy financing.
