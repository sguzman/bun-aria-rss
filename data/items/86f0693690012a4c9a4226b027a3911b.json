  "title": "The Greenham Common women's peace camp",
  "description": "The anti-nuclear weapons protest was the biggest women-led movement in the UK since the Suffragettes. It began in 1981 when Ann Pettitt from Wales organised a women-led peace march from the Welsh capital Cardiff to the airbase at Greenham Common, where American nuclear-tipped cruise missiles were being kept.  A small group of women decided to set up camp outside the fences of Greenham Common to continue their protest.  Women from all over the UK joined the demonstrations, some travelled from Europe and beyond to lend their support. At its peak, thousands of women camped around the base, and some form of protest camp remained for 19 years until  all the nuclear weapons were moved and the airbase was decommissioned.  It's now an open nature reserve. Ann Pettitt has been telling Rebecca Kesby why the women were prepared to leave jobs and families to sleep out in the cold to try to stop a nuclear war.  \n\nPhoto: Women from the Greenham Common peace camp blocking Yellow Gate into RAF Greenham Common , 1st April 1983 .
