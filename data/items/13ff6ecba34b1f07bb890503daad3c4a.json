  "description": "Adam, Dave and Jamey have plenty to say about the first round of the NFL Draft. We start with some of Dave's biggest winners and losers which includes new OAK WR Martavis Bryant (3:58). Then find out what the coaches and GMs are saying about the three RBs who were taken in Round 1 (7:35) ... We get into the standard and PPR rankings for Saquon Barkley (14:00). Is he a first round pick? How many catches do we expect? Then we compare Rashaad Penny vs. Sony Michel (22:10). Also, can Dave pronounce Vita Vea's full name? ... Thoughts on the WRs (29:40) and why one of us loves the fit for Calvin Ridley and one of us hates it. And which Round 1 WR do we like more? Of course we talk QBs (39:30) as we focus a lot on Dynasty outlooks. And how much could the rookie Offensive Linemen help this year (48:00)?
