  "description": "<p>This week on the podcast we’re answering your questions! 1 - Should we go with a cash out mortgage refinance in order to pay off student loans? 2 - Can I contribute to a self employed retirement account while also contributing to my employer sponsored plan? 3 - What does it take to be a HUD landlord and how do I balance community renovation with gentrification? 4 - We have a lot of available credit through our credit cards, but we never use it. Should we keep those cards open or close those accounts? 5 - Considering the stock market is hot and a correction is imminent, is dollar cost averaging or lump sum investing a better approach for me?</p><p>And if you have a question for us, we’d love for you to submit your own via <a href=\"https://www.howtomoney.com/ask/\">HowToMoney.com/ask/</a></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Ogee by Jackie O's Brewery - a big thanks to Art, Mackenzie, and all of our friends there at the brewery!
