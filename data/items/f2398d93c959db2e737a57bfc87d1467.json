  "description": "<p>As a kid Sean was fascinated by the look of the cars that were built in the 1940’s, 50’s and 60’s. The shape and design gave each one it’s own personality. He never would have imagined that he would one day make a living off of them the way he does. Using cut up sections of those old brilliant chrome bumpers, he reshapes and welds their pieces into larger than life sculptures, preserving their essence.
