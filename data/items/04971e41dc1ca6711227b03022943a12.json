  "description": "We are back with a few mini episodes this week as we dive into our mailbag.  First up is a great question in which a listener wants to know why God didn’t leave us detailed instructions on how to live, what to believe how to follow him, etc.  Mike, Bonnie and Tim answer this question by exploring the role of the Bible and the Holy Spirit, how community fits into the mix of things, and the necessary pursuit of God’s wonder.  \n\nMike also recommends a book about this topic by Dallas Willard called “Knowing Christ Today: Why We Can Trust Spiritual Knowledge”.\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
