  "description": "Are you relying on what others say or don’t say for your value? Are you frustrated today because you don’t have the support from others around you?One of the greatest lessons in life is to learn that your true value does not come from people; it comes from Almighty God. Yet many people today rely on the complements, encouragement and approval of others to feel good about themselves and stay motivated. Paul said in Philippians 4:13, “I am self-sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency.” Let Joel show you who you are in Christ and how to go to Him for your value and self-worth. As you apply these biblical principles, not only will you live a more peaceful life, but your relationships will improve, too!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
