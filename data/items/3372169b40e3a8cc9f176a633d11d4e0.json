  "description": "Seven people have been informed that they will be pivotal in the quest for the greatest holy object that has ever existed: the Holy Grail. First, they have to get it to England. That, of course, will involve angelic post-it notes, ships with ejector seats, attacking giants, and, the most unbelievable thing of all (to some of our characters): multi-colored wood. We'll see how the Grail comes to Britain and that the end of Joseph's quest is just the beginning. -- Sponsors: Check out The Great Courses Plus!
