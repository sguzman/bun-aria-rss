  "description": "<p>During the July 4th holiday in 2006, 18-year-old Roxanne Paltauf left home to spend a few days celebrating her anniversary with her boyfriend, a much older man with a lengthy criminal history. The couple checked into a hotel in Austin, Texas, which was the last time Roxanne was ever seen. Her boyfriend later stated that the two got into an argument, and she left with nothing but her state identification. He claimed that he looked for her prior to calling her mother the next day to inform her that Roxanne was missing. Roxanne's family immediately knew something was wrong and alerted the authorities. While all signs seemed to point to her boyfriend, another man later became a person of interest as well. Fourteen years have passed since Roxanne disappeared, and her loved ones have never given up their search for answers.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Roxanne Paltauf, you are urged to call the Austin Police Department at 512-974-5250.
