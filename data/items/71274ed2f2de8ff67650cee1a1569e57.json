  "description": "SUMMARYEnglish is full of unusual terms, both old (eleemosynary, favonian) and new (flyway, catio). Also, the Swahili term that means \"sleep like a log,\" the multiple meanings of the word joint, what it means to play gooseberry, cowpies and horse biscuits, and how to punctuate the expression \"Guess what.\"FULL DETAILSThinking about a flyaway, or will you spend the weekend gazing out at the catio? Grant explains these new terms.Is subscribing just for magazines and podcasts, or can you subscribe to an idea? A husband and wife disagree over whether the latter is grammatically correct.The Swahili phrase nililala fofofo means \"to sleep really well.\" Literally, though, it translates as \"to sleep like a log.\" Are the English and Swahili idioms related?In French, tenir la chandelle means \"to act as a chaperone,\" though literally it's \"to hold the candle.\" Another expression that means \"to chaperone\" is the antiquated English phrase \"to play gooseberry.\"License-plate bingo, anyone? Quiz Guy John Chaneski offers a radio version.\"Who is 'she'? The cat's mother?\" A Davis, Ca., man remembers his mother's indignant use of this expression, and he's curious about the origin.Should you pronounce the word coyote with two syllables or three? A Northern California caller that discovers that in Britain, an invitation to share a joint doesn't mean what it does back home.Eleemosynary is the title of a play by Lee Blessing. The play celebrates this and other unusual words, including sortilege, charivari, ungulate, favonian, and logodaedaly. Martha saw a production at San Diego's Moxie Theater, and takes the opportunity to discuss those words, plus the fizzy roots of moxie.Guess what! Or would that be Guess what? A Honolulu listener asks about the right way to punctuate this interjection. Should you use an exclamation mark or a question mark? How about an interrobang or a pronequark? A Texas listener says his family often describes a great meal as larrupin'. What does that mean, exactly?Grant talks about FOIA (\"pronounced FOY-uh\"), a bit of journalists' jargon.Cowpies, horse biscuits, buffalo chips, horse dumplings -- why do so many names for animal droppings have to do with food?
