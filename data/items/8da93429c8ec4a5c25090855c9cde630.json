  "description": "<p>Oprah Winfrey says that she didn’t understand the true meaning of <em>ego</em> until she met Eckhart Tolle. He opened her eyes to how an ego-based mind can sabotage everything. Initially she thought ego meant arrogance or superiority. But now she sees it's the part of us that identifies as our personality, our accomplishments, our talents, essentially the false self. The key to continued spiritual growth is to understand the ego’s disruptive role in our lives. In this SuperSoul Conversation Oprah talks with Eckhart Tolle, Wayne Dyer, Father Richard Rohr, Brene Brown, Dr. Shefali Tsabary, Jack Canfield, Jeff Weiner, Phil Jackson, Pema Chodron about the many challenges the ego presents and what we can do to stay on track. These talented writers, speakers and thought leaders have been featured on her Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday</em>. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations in her New York Times best-selling book <em>The Wisdom of Sundays.</em></p>\n",
