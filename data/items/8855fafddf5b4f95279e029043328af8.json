  "description": "Check out Houston here: https://www.houstonkraft.com/\nThis week on the Colin and Samir podcast we’re joined by a very unique guest. His name is Houston Kraft and he’s a storyteller and kindness advocate.\n \nHouston uses his storytelling abilities to spread stories about empathy kindness and love all with the goal of giving people the tools to practice more of those emotions in their day to day lives\n \nWe wanted to bring you this conversation during the week of Valentine's day, a week where we hear a lot of about love of a specific kind - but there are actually many different varieties of love and empathy\n \nI believe that empathy is one of the most important emotions to exercise if you are trying to connect with others, whether that’s through business, through content, or just through communication. Houston tells us his story and we talk about the concept of love and kindness. He’s a great storyteller and he ends this podcast on one of the more powerful stories I’ve heard from him. We also have some surprise guests pop in while we are recording, so stay tuned for that.",
