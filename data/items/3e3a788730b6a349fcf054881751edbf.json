Emma gets sensitive sometimes, as we all do, and she talks through it on this episode like a therapy session. From getting over people who wrong you, to worrying about relationships, letting yourself be vulnerable and opening up, why crying is actually good for us, and a lot more. Plus, Frankie the cat makes a (very short) cameo appearance on the podcast.  \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
