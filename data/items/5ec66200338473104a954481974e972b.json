  "description": "<p>Last week, we released the first episode of this narrative audio documentary, which tells the story Robert S. Mueller lays out in his famous 448 page document. This week, Mueller testified before the House of Representatives in what many people hoped would be hearings that brought the document to life. Whatever role Mueller’s testimony may or may not have played in that regard, we are pleased to bring you the second episode of our effort to bring the Mueller Report into narrative form.</p> <p>Episode 2 focuses on the Russian hacking operation, the stealing of documents and emails from the DNC, DCCC and figures associated with the Clinton campaign, and the leaks of the stolen materials timed to impact the US election. The episode tells the story of the GRU operations, the Russian attempts to cover their tracks, and the involvement of Wikileaks and Julian Assange.</p> <p>It features <a href=\"https://ridt.co/\">Thomas Rid</a>,<a href= \"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014U0TKAA0/ben-buchanan\"> Ben Buchanan</a>, and <a href= \"http://www.gmfus.org/profiles/laura-rosenberger\">Laura Rosenberger</a>.</p> <p>We are grateful to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Democracy Fund for their support for this project. </p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
