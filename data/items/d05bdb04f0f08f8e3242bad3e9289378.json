  "title": "Ep. 721 - Don't Worry. Our Army Of Feminists And Gay Activists Will Protect Us.",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Army has launched its own woke leftist ad campaign, as both the intelligence community and the military continue to prioritize left wing ideology over less important concerns, like defending the country from its enemies. Also Five Headlines including a change to the Dictionary that has now turned myself and millions of others into “anti-vaxxers.” Plus college students are suspended for not wearing a mask — off campus. And outrage over a video of a brutal full-contact drill among little kids at a football practice. Is the outrage overblown, or do the critics have a point? And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll discuss the former MSNBC host who has decided that it should be legal to kill any white man who uses a racial slur. That perspective is more popular than you’d like to think.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
