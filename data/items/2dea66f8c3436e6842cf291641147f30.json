  "description": "<p>On the 1958 film and articles including Laura Mulvey's \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" (1975) and Robin Wood's \"Vertigo\" (1965). What's the nature of love/lust? Are we really just loving an image we've built while remaining fundamentally isolated? And is it just an illusionary social construct that keeps us all from feeling fundamental vertigo? Lacan, existentialism, and more!</p> <p>Part 2 is for supporters only!
