  "itunes:summary": "The world is looking for a saviour. The Canadian musician, Lights, expresses this in the lyrics of her song, ‘Saviour’:\n‘The night is deafening,\nWhen the silence is listening,\nAnd I’m down on my knees,\nAnd I know that something is missing…\nSooner than later, I’ll need a saviour,\nI’ll need a saviour...\n‘Lecrae’ (Moore), is a rapper, entrepreneur, record-producer and actor. He speaks for many of us when he says, ‘I’m not a Christian because I’m strong and have it all together. I’m a Christian because I’m weak and admit I need a saviour.’\nThe amazing truth of Christianity is that in Jesus you do have a saviour. How should you respond to this extraordinary good news?",
