  "description": "Today I talked to Leonard Wapner about his new book Unexpected Expectations: The Curiosities of a Mathematical Crystal Ball (A.K. Peters, 2012).  Prof. Wapner’s previous book, The Pea and the Sun, was an in-depth investigation of the Banach-Tarski Theorem, one of the most counterintuitive results in mathematics.  Expectation is an extension of the idea of average value, and is a basic tool of probability theory that underlies both the gaming and insurance industries.  Unexpected Expectations is a fascinating look at some of the counterintuitive aspects of this apparently simple concept.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
