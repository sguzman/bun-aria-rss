  "description": "<p>41-year-old Ian Eckles spent the majority of his free time outdoors and loved to hunt. So when he and a friend made plans to spend a weekend hunting in the mountains near Liberty, Washington, nothing was out of the ordinary. However, when Ian’s friend got to the spot where they agreed to meet up in a national forest, Ian wasn’t there. In fact, there was no sign of Ian, his car, or any of his camping equipment. For more than a year, Ian’s family, friends, and law enforcement have been looking for Ian. They haven’t found him yet, but what they have uncovered is bigger than anyone could have ever anticipated.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://GetQuip.com/VANISHED5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Quip</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://GetQuip.com/VANISHED5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GetQuip.com/VANISHED5</a> to get $5 off a mouthwash starter kit.</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
