    "media:description": "Is Netflix Games A Total FAILURE Or Can It Still Succeed?\n\nThe gaming industry has seen many trends come and go. One trend that has managed to stick around as of late is the game pass subscription model. \n\nFrom Ubisoft+ to the Xbox Game Pass, the ability to play games without having to invest $60 to $100 every time a new title is released has proven to be a great option for gamers who want to save money.\n\nWhile the prices vary between services, the game subscription model has also made its way into mobile games with the Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass. \n\nApple and Google have a duopoly on the mobile game market with their respective app stores, but one company is trying to enter the mobile game market and compete with its own subscription service. That company is Netflix.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://patreon.com/akshonesports\nSubscribe to our channel! https://goo.gl/OvCljl\n\nJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/ZHeCNJQUpY\n\nBecome a Member to support us: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dI8msF1_I9HuDSvMtk_nQ/join\n\nFollow us to stay up to date with our releases! \n\nWebsite: https://www.akshonmedia.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/akshonesports/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/akshonesports/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/akshonesports\n\n#netflix #gaming",
