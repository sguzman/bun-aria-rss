  "description": "<p>NEW DECADE, NEW SLEEP GOALS. So often we glorify not getting enough sleep. We brag about pulling an all-nighter. We “grind” or wake up at the crack of dawn. Some of us think that staying up is helping us achieve our dreams. But sleep is key to our mental and physical health. It even keeps us young. So why do so many of us put quality sleep on the back burner? On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about sleep with a bestselling author on the subject: Shawn Stevenson. Shawn Stevenson is an author of “Sleep Smarter” and creator of The Model Health Show, featured as the #1 Health podcast in the country on iTunes. A graduate of The University of Missouri - St. Louis, Shawn studied business, biology and kinesiology, and went on to be the founder of Advanced Integrative Health Alliance, a company that provides wellness services for individuals and organizations worldwide. Shawn says that often we look at sleep as something we should sacrifice to be more present for other people and our goals. But the word sacrifice actually means “to make sacred.” We need to make sleep a sacred practice that heals our body and mind.<br />\nSo get ready to learn how and why you should have more restful sleep on Episode 896.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat is sleep? (16:00)<br />\nHow bad is sugar for sleep? (28:00)<br />\nWhat does the research say about eating before sleep (32:30)<br />\nWhat is the optimal evening routine?
