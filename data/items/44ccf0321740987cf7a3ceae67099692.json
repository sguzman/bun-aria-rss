So let’s bravely face the awkwardness, with communication hacks for even the most nerve-wracking of convos.</p><br><p>Clamming up during sex talks? I’ve got a confidence-building solution for that. How about giving tough feedback, like asking for better handjobs, or addressing a funky smell? We get into it! Finally, we tackle tough topics like telling a friend you have feelings for them, whether or not to open a relationship, and if you should stay in a partnership if the sex is just OK.
