  "description": "<p>Colin O’Brady is a world class triathlete and world record holder for being the first man to walk across Antarctica on his own. He travelled over 1000 in 53 days. His conversation with Joe is full of inspiration and is truly a testament to what you can achieve when you set your mind to something. I really enjoyed this one.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
