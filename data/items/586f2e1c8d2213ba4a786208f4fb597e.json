  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden regularly violates the Constitution, and the Democrats could care less. School districts are promoting critical race theory and transgenderism, but they want to go after Donald Trump and his White House staff. All the Democrats can focus on is nationalizing everything they can get their hands on, maintaining an open border, and diminishing the U.S economy. Later, Attorney Merrick Garland was questioned in a hearing after he issued a memo labeling parents as domestic terrorists and admitted that the only report his office reviewed was a single letter from the National School Board Association. Garland also admitted that he was not even aware who asked him to write the memo, but suggested it wasn't the White House. How much more dishonesty from the government will Americans put up with? Afterward, retired ICE Special Agent Victor Avila joins the show to discuss a dubious assignment he was sent on in 2011 where he was attacked and shot three times by a cartel hit squad. Avila blames the Obama-Biden administration for poor planning and a failure to protect ICE agents serving abroad.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
