  "description": "<div>Cast iron can be intimidating.  With all of the misinformation floating around, it’s easy to understand why some avoid it all together.  Cast iron is by far my favorite way to cook, but it can present some real challenges for any new user.  Today we cover the difference between standard cast iron, enamel coated cast-iron, when you should and shouldn’t season your pan, what to do with a pre-seasoned pan, some brands to check out, and so much more.  I explain what to look out for with garage sale and Goodwill finds, and I also go why you basically can’t go wrong with any cast iron.  If you’ve been wanting to get into the cast iron game but didn’t know where to start.  This episode is specifically for you. <br/><br/></div><p><a href='http://www.heritagekitchenhandbook.com/'><br/></a><br/></p><div><br/><br/></div>",
