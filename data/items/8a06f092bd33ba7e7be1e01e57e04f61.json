  "title": "PMS 2.0 309 - TNF Recap, TY Hilton, Delanie Walker, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys recap last night's Tuesday Night Football game between the Cowboys and the Ravens and come to conclusion that Mike McCarthy may have set everything up and brought Tom Pelissero out to his barn in order to get himself hired by the Cowboys as their dumpster fire continues to grow larger and larger, and decide whether or not the Ravens are getting hot at the right time. Also joining the program is 4x Pro Bowler, 2016 NFL receiving yards leader, WR for the Indianapolis Colts, TY Hilton. Pat and TY chat about how this season has gone so far, what it's been like playing with Philip Rivers, taking more of a leadership role inside the WR room, and his outlook on this season (21:37-31:50). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is 3x Pro Bowler, 14 Year NFL veteran and current free agent TE, Delanie Walker to chat about taking some time off this season to get the body healthy, his time with the Titans, watching Jim Harbaugh practice in full pads while he was on the 49ers, and his love for power boats (45:42-1:10:27). To close out the show, Pat and AJ chat about last night's game and where the Ravens and Cowboys go from here, the Big Ten changing around some rules to make sure that Ohio State can get into the Big Ten Championship, and everything else going on in the sports world (1:10:29-1:32:27).
