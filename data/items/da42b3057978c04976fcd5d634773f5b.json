  "description": "<p>We go back to 2008, when the Republican candidate for president campaigned on a plan to fight global warming. How, in just nine years, did the G.O.P. go from combating climate change to arguing it doesn’t exist? And several mayors and governors have come forward in recent days to say that their cities and states would meet the Paris commitment, with or without Washington. We talk with one of them. Guests: Carol Davenport, who covers the environment; Jerry Brown, the governor of California. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.
