    "media:description": "by Wolfram Wingerath\n\nSoftware for interpreting and synthesizing natural language is used by millions of people every day who use smart home assistants or simply prefer dictating over typing on their mobile phones. But while hands-free interfaces have found widespread adoption among consumers, IT professionals still mostly consider them gimmicks or do not consider them at all for the purpose of software development â€“ unjustly so!\n\nIn this presentation, I will describe a zero-cost setup for hands-free coding that is extremely powerful and convenient to use. First, I will cover the basics of how to control your computer and navigate applications using just your voice (and eyes and facial expressions and more!), sharing best practices and common pitfalls. To jumpstart the learning process with a brief voice-coding session, I will then eat my own dog food by extending my voice command library via voice coding. Throughout the talk, I will share my personal experiences and explain how I tweaked my own setup to accommodate customized workflows. I will close the talk with how I use hands-free coding at my job and a list of pointers for getting started.",
