  "description": "<p>EPISODE 38 - JEB BRODY - Pres of Production, Amblin Studios</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with Jeb Brody, the president of production at Amblin Studios and learn a lot about the studio side of production. Jeb walks us through so much - the difference between a studio exec and a producer, the relationship between the filmmakers and the studios, the differences between the studios and the movies they make. We discuss what kind of films are getting made these days, look at the difference of negative pickup and acquisition, and why the bad behaviors of filmmakers in the ’70s no longer works. We worked with Jeb on 1917 and get into that as well. And we learn from the studio’s point of view what the growth of streaming means for moviemaking. We even got into the “dark arts of filmmaking” (you’ll have to listen to learn about this!). We’ve never had the opportunity to sit with the studio and ask them all our questions so we had a great time! Don’t miss it if you want to learn everything on the studio side!</p>",
