  "description": "<p>95% of people say that they're self-aware. But only 10-15% of people actually are.

Tasha kicks off our conversation by arguing that our level of self-awareness sets the upper limit of our individual effectiveness and that self-awareness can be developed and is truly the meta skill of the 21st century. She then unpacks what it is you know about yourself when you possess self-awareness, how there are two types of this knowledge, internal and external, and how you can have one without the other. Tasha then outlines the seven pillars of self-awareness, the barriers to getting insights into them --  including falling into the cult of self -- and how these barriers can be overcome, including asking yourself a daily check-in question. We then discuss how two of the most common methods for gaining self-knowledge -- introspection and journaling -- can in fact backfire and how to do them more effectively by asking yourself <i>what</i> instead of <i>why</i>, and actually journaling less instead of more. We also get into why you should be an <i>in</i>-former, rather than a <i>me</i>-former on social media, how to become more mindful without meditation, and how to solicit and handle feedback from other people, including holding something called the \"Dinner of Truth.\"</p><p><i>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</i></p><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-112-the-science-of-insights-with-dr-gary-klein/\">The Science of Insights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-530-how-to-get-more-aha-insights/\">How to Get More \"Aha\" Insights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/\">Define Your Core Values</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/7-habits-covey-interview/\">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/need-reset-day/\">You Need a Reset Day</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-614-get-out-of-your-mind-and-into-your-life/\">Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/why-i-stopped-journaling/\">Why I Stopped Journaling</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/fighting-fomo-4-questions-that-will-crush-the-fear-of-missing-out/\">4 Questions That Will Crush the Fear of Missing Out</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-246-get-better-taking-feedback/\">How to Get Better at Taking Feedback</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.insight-book.com/quiz\">Insight Quiz</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/insight.jpg\" alt=\"insight book cover by tasha eurich.\" /><h3>Connect With Tasha</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.tashaeurich.com/\">Tasha's website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tashaeurich\">Tasha on Twitter</a></p><h3>Listen to the Podcast!
