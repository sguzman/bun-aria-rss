  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can a mom really develop a personal understanding of the Bible in the season of young children? In this episode, Emily and Laura chat with author and Bible teacher, Jen Wilkin, about her passion for biblical literacy. Jen encourages moms to pursue a firsthand knowledge of scripture and gives practical examples of what this might look like. She offers encouragement to set aside larger blocks of time, get involved in a structured study with accountability, and consistently consume the word whenever and wherever you can. If you haven't been sure how an understanding of scripture can impact your role as a mom, you'll be so challenged and encouraged by this interview!</span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-178-dont-take-my-word-for-it-with-jen-wilkin\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-178-dont-take-my-word-for-it-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">View Transcript</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/advent\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">R|M Resources for Advent</span></a></p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re grateful to Moody Publishers, who recently published <a href= \"https://www.moodypublishers.com/mpimages/Marketing/WEB%20Resources/ProductExcerpts/9780802419453-TOC-CH1.pdf\"> <em>Motherhood Without All the Rules</em></a> by Maggie Combs, for helping make this week’s show possible!
