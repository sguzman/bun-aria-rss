  "description": "<p>My #HoneyDew this week is Joey Diaz! We ended Joey’s first episode at the age of nine and we pick up right where we left off. Joey talks about hustles he learned along the way, the abuse he suffered in Catholic school that led to fighting a nun, and a family that took him in and treated him like a son. One thing about Joey Diaz - he loves hard. This was emotional for him and seeing him shed tears made me love him even more. If you’re a fan of Joey’s you’ll love this episode.
