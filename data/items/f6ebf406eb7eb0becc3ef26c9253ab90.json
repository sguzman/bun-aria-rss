  "description": "<p>Love this one because it speaks to the heart of me, Mom & Pop businesses. As most of you know I come from a small family business out in Jersey. I understand the dynamics between needing to make every dollar stretch and the complications that come from working in a family business. In this talk we discuss meritocracy, proving yourself to others, coming up in a family business, and the power of social when it comes to selling local. For those out in Atlanta in early March, come out and see me: http://cbtconferenceandexpo.com/</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5174533.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
