As we heard in the season preview, Sylvie has recently moved to Paris and, like any mother, Monique is worrying about her daughter, but is equally excited for her as she begins this new adventure.</p><br><p>The lesson is presented by Mark and Pierre-Benoît in a mix of French and English. After presenting Monique’s email, Mark gives a summary of the main narrative points of the email, and then Pierre-Benoît discusses four interesting language points brought up in the text.
