  "description": "In 1982, three Texas teenagers went out to watch the sunset over Lake Waco and didn't come home by curfew. When the night passed, their families feared the worst. But that following evening, their bodies would be discovered at a different park across the lake, and an intense investigation would begin. This is the story of the murders of Jill Montgomery, Raylene Rice, and Kenneth Franks. This is the case of the Lake Waco Murders.\n______________________________\n\nAnaheim investigator Julissa Trapp is not like other detectives. She’s the only woman on the homicide squad, and a skilled chameleon: undercover cop in vice stings, crime-scene commander, patient confidante of killers. A master interrogator, she invokes her personal experience – and deepest griefs -- as a tool to elicit confessions. When a young woman’s body is found at a trash-sorting plant, Trapp learns the murder may be linked to the disappearance of three other women in nearby Santa Ana. Trapp embarks on a dark journey that brings her face to face with a man who takes “a little piece of her soul.”\nListen now at: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1485636621\n________________________\n*Case Sources*\n\nhttps://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-murders-at-the-lake/\n\nhttps://www.wacotrib.com/news/crime/last-lake-waco-triple-murder-defendant-dies-in-prison/article_0e671f9a-4171-594a-987c-82199afd628c.html\n\nhttps://www.kcentv.com/article/news/crime/sons-of-man-executed-for-lake-waco-murders-sue-texas/433127124\n\nhttps://historydojo.blog/2019/09/23/the-case-of-the-lonely-loser/\n\nhttps://murderpedia.org/male.S/s1/spence-david-wayne.htm Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
