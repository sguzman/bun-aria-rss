She also backs Prince Harry to continue making a difference despite his 'stepping back' from royal duties.</p><br><p>This is the second of season 2 of Great British Bosses from Anything but Footy - if you like what you hear please subscribe and also leave a review on Apple Podcasts!</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
