It took me a while to figure out how to do it, but I finally did it!\n\nThis is kind of a follow-up to my previous project, where I turned toilet paper into drinkable alcohol (moonshine). In that one, I used an enzyme called cellulase, but that didn't seem to work here. So, instead, I used concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nNile talks about lab safety: https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZA\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n• Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/nilered\n\n• NileRed Newsletter: https://nile.red/home#newsletter\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n• Discord: https://nilered.tv/discord\n• Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/NileRed2\n• Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nile.red\n• Snapchat: https://nilered.tv/snapchat\n• TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nilered\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/NileRed2\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nMusic in credits (Walker by SORRYSINES): https://soundcloud.com/sorrysines/walker\n\n-------------------------------------------",
