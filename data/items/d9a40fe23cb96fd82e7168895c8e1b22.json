  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, some organizations want to destroy this program because they disagree with saving the republic, promoting individual liberty, and they do it with fascistic tactics and lies. Whether it’s slanderous press or fake Wikipedia pages the left will distort whatever they can to damage this country. Then, the justice system is working. Officer Chauvin was fired and has been arrested all within three days. The Medical Examiner concluded George Floyd did not die of \"traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation\" but the officer's actions did likely contribute to Floyd's death. The Prosecutor, the Governor, and the President have all immediately focused their attention on this killing. Yet there hasn't been any condemnation from Taylor Swift or Lebron James on the rioting, looting, and arson that is chasing minority businesses out of Minneapolis. In fact, President Trump warned Gov. Tim Walz that if he didn't take action to protect his citizens, then the federal government would. Later, Dr. Michael Pillsbury calls in to discuss today's developments on China. The communist Chinese regime has killed Muslims for decades. Now they are coming down on Hong Kong.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
