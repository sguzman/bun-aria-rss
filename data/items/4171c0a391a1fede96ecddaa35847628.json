  "description": "<p>EPISODE 35 - JOE WALKER - Editor</p> <p>Team Deakins speaks with friend and two time collaborator, editor Joe Walker (ARRIVAL, SICARIO, BLADE RUNNER 2049, 12 YEARS A SLAVE). We get an interesting look into the changes in the techniques of cutting between now and when Joe started. We talk about where the cutting style of the movie comes from, when a sound editor comes in and what they, test screenings - pros and cons. We also touch on the editing in Sicario, 12 Years a Slave and Shame. We do get into what crossing the line is and what you can get away with continuity-wise. And we even share our personal work-related nightmares! It’s an episode packed with information that you won’t want to miss!</p>",
