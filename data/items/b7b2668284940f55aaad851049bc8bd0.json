  "description": "We hear this phrase all the time: “once in a generation”…fine, but how long is a generation?...according to Wikipedia, it’s about 30 years, which is the time it takes children to be born, grow up, become adults and then start to have children of their own…\n\nThe international society of genetic genealogy sets the length of a generation between 29 and 31 years…\n\nBut that’s if we’re talking about the child-parent-child cycle of human existence…we can also use the word “generation” to describe other cycles—like music…let’s try to do that…\n\nWe all go through a period of “coming of age” with music…this is the period in our lives when music is central to everything we do…we use music to figure out who we are…we use it to bond to other like-minded people…and we use music to project our identity to the world… “thisis who I am!”\n\nThat period—and I’m generalizing here—begins when we enter high school and ends when we get around to being adults…that’s roughly 10 years: 14 to 24, plus or minus a couple of years…\n\nIf we consider that ten-year period to be a generation in music, the cycles will repeat much faster than the standard genealogical definition of “generation”…\n\nExtrapolating this reasoning (as dodgy as it might seem to some), it’s should be no surprise that we experience periodic revivals in music as age into, through, and out of that musical sweet spot in their lives…\n\n \n\nSo how long are these cycles?...well, using the rules I just described, we should experience revivals every 10 to 12 years…ish…\n\n \n\nThis brings me to Emo…when can we expect a revival in that area?...this is chapter 3 of a series entitled “alt-rock revivals”…\nLearn more about your ad choices.
