  "description": "<p>After getting a firsthand look at the history of trash, we’re having visions from garbage’s present and future this week. Producer Kunsang Dorjee visits a landfill to see what happens to our trash after we throw it away, and producer Ruby Guthrie shows us how we can make less trash and dispose the trash we do make in ways that are better for the planet. Plus: we hear from a kid who helped her class produce almost no waste during the school year. And our Moment of Um answers the question: if ants like sweet things, why don’t they attack beehives?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Mathnasium (<a href=\"https://www.mathnasium.com/\" class=\"default\">mathnasium.com</a>)</p>\n",
