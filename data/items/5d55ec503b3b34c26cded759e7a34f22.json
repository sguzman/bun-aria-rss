The 39-year-old mom was reported missing on November 2,&nbsp; and told investigators when she was found 22 days later that a pair of Hispanic women kidnapped her at gunpoint.&nbsp; Papini said her kidnappers abused her and then shoved her out of a car. Papini&nbsp; was emaciated, her hair was cut shorter, and she had cuts and bruises all over her body, but prosecutors said she caused the injuries herself. The case was broken in 2020 when DNA led investigators to Papini&rsquo;s ex, who told them she had been with him the entire time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal prosecutors charged Papini with 34 counts of mail fraud and one count of making false statements. Papini accepted a plea deal, but didn't explain why she created an elaborate kidnapping hoax, although she apologized for her actions.&nbsp; Since her arrest, Papini's husband has started divorce proceedings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sheriff Michael Johnson - Shasta County Sheriff's Office</li>\n<li>Matthew Mangino - Attorney, Former District Attorney (Lawrence County), Former Parole Board Member, Author: \"The Executioner's Toll: The Crimes, Arrests, Trials, Appeals, Last Meals, Final Words and Executions of 46 Persons in the United States\" &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist,&nbsp; www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Expert in the Treatment of Pregnant/Postpartum Women, Former Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology: Emory University, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Bill Garcia - Private Investigator, \"Bill Garcia Investigative Services\", Part of Search Team for Sherri Papini&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Kristy Mazurek - Emmy Award-winning Investigative Reporter, President: \"Successful Strategies\"&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
