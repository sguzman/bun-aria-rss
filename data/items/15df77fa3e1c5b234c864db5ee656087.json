  "description": "<p><strong>You and your five siblings aren't close, but you all have one thing in common: you endured a childhood marred by abusive parents who played you against each other.</strong> Now that you're all adults, you'd like to unite your siblings to confront your parents as a group for some closure -- but you're not sure they're all on board with the idea. Is there a good way to convince them, or might it be possible to get the closure you're looking for without their help or even a confrontation at all? We'll get into this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
