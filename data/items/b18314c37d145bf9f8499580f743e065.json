  "description": "<p>Imagine growing up hearing the stories of Emma Hale Smith, Phoebe Carter, the Whitmers, Brigham Young, and Brother Joseph. This week’s guest, Dr. Susan Easton Black, didn’t grow up hearing fairy tales but true stories of bravery, faithfulness, betrayal, and courage. Dr. Black teaches us how the Lord taught His People that Zion and the Church were more than a place they visited on Sundays, how they received the command to “gather to the Ohio,” and how Joseph continued his New Translation of the Bible. Do we sacrifice as willingly for the Lord as our earliest Saints as we study Doctrine and Covenants 37-40?<br/><br/>Shownotes: www.followhim.co<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FollowHimOfficialChannel<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast</p>",
