Mark's friends and sister began to notice that they hadn't heard from Mark and attempted to reach him by phone. They didn't get an answer and Mark never returned their calls. His friends stopped over but there was no sign of Mark. While at his house, they noticed some things that seemed out of place. They contacted the police to do a welfare check, they worried that he could have had a medical emergency inside the home but there was no trace of Mark. They reported Mark missing and the police realized that Mark's motorcycle had been found abandoned just days after he was last seen. Over two years have passed and they still have no clue what happened to Mark.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Mark Shearer, please contact the Phoenix Police Department Missing Persons Unit at 602-534-2121 or Det.
