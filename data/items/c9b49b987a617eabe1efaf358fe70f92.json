  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a recent CNN article compares Joe Rogan’s use of the N-word to January 6th — and January 6th as we know, according to the Left, was as bad as 9-11. This may all seem very stupid on the surface — and it is stupid — but there’s something deeper going on here, which we’ll talk about today. Also, a new euphemism for rioters just dropped. It’s the best one of all. The ATF essentially encourages us to make false reports against our enemies for revenge. And a model says that she \"don't need no man\" because she's in love with herself. Will \"autosexuals\" now be welcomed into the LGBT alphabet camp? \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
