  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats have shut down the legislative branch for four months, in effect a four-month government shutdown to conduct this impeachment sham. Congratulations to the Senators that sided with the Constitution in today's vote to not accept witnesses in the Senate trial. The U.S has never had a Speaker of the House unilaterally start the impeachment process on their own. The rogue members of the House Democrat caucus destroyed tradition of precedent, disallowing the President's lawyers from being present early on, and from cross-examination until the end. Another first was how they based their whole case on the secret testimony of one anonymous so-called \"whistle-blower.\" imagine if they would have allowed the president's lawyers to participate from the very beginning? This case would have been eviscerated under normal scrutiny, by allowing the Republicans to call their own witnesses, allowing them to cross-examine their unchallenged hand-picked witnesses.  Later, John Bolton's defection from tradition is odd and harms the presidency by attacking the office's executive privilege. Unsurprisingly, the New York Times has updated their Bolton article alleging that President ordered Bolton to help with his Ukraine 'pressure campaign.' Afterward, Benjamin Netanyahu is told to hold off from annexing new territory due to new pressure from the United States.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
