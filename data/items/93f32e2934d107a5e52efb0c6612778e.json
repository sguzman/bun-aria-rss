  "description": "<p>In a reconfiguration problem, given a problem and two feasible solutions of\nthe problem, the task is to find a sequence of transformations to reach from\none solution to the other such that every intermediate state is also a feasible\nsolution to the problem. In this paper, we study the distributed spanning tree\nreconfiguration problem and we define a new reconfiguration step, called\n$k$-simultaneous add and delete, in which every node is allowed to add at most\n$k$ edges and delete at most $k$ edges such that multiple nodes do not add or\ndelete the same edge.\n</p>\n<p>We first observe that, if the two input spanning trees are rooted, then we\ncan do the reconfiguration using a single $1$-simultaneous add and delete step\nin one round in the CONGEST model. Therefore, we focus our attention towards\nunrooted spanning trees and show that transforming an unrooted spanning tree\ninto another using a single $1$-simultaneous add and delete step requires\n$\\Omega(n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model. We additionally show that transforming\nan unrooted spanning tree into another using a single $2$-simultaneous add and\ndelete step can be done in $O(\\log n)$ rounds in the CONGEST model.\n</p>",
