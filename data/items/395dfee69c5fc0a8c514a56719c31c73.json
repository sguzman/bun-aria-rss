  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin, some Republicans suggest that the term 'conservative' be done away with since very little has been conserved from marriage to other cultural issues. However, these 'Republicans In Name Only' fail to see the 50 years of conservative activism that culminated with the overturning of Roe V. Wade, or the conservative nature of the Republican Party's base. Then, our lifestyles what we think, and what we believe are all under scrutiny. Karl Marx focused on constant revolution and this is what we are seeing in the culture today. We must stop tyrants from using liberty to destroy liberty. Later, Illinois Congressional candidate Catalina Lauf calls in to discuss her race. She is facing a pro-crime progressive that's backed by the Democrat machine. Lauf says her district is ready to reject the Democrat's destructive policies. Afterward, Kathryn Limbaugh joins the show to discuss her new book \"Radio's Greatest of All Time\" which describes Rush Limbaugh's finest moments. Mrs. Limbaugh added that she wanted the book to reflect Rush's humor, quips, and anecdotes so readers could appreciate the fullness of his timeless life lessons. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Radios-Greatest-Time-Rush-Limbaugh/dp/1668001845/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1666397200&refinements=p_27%3AKathryn+Adams+Limbaugh&s=books&sr=1-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
