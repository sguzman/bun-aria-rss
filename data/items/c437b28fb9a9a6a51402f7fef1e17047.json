  "description": "\"Of all the things you can be, why be a taker?  I've never understood that mindset. I mean, how do you decide to take something and give nothing in return? \" -ET.\n Today's podcast is a hot one and the issue of \"Takers Vs. Givers\" is just one of the several points covered in today's session. Success is an incredible attraction, and, as everyone on the squad continues their elevation in both business and private life, more and more people want in on the circle.  The problem is, some but not all of these \"new people\" have brought with them three particularly nasty spirits. Complaining, manipulation, and taking. If you know anything about E, C, Karl, Mal & the Squad, then you already know, these are 3 Things that the squad doesn’t tolerate. \n As ever, ETA's very own \"Quincy Jones\" AKA CJ, plays devil’s advocate when the conversation shifts to the topic of how and when to charge for your services. Today's show covers a myriad of relevant topics and the passion from the guys and their special in-studio guests will have you glued to your headphones!  \n Trust me; if you're in the process of building anything, a business, personal, and professional relationships, or anything else,  you'll need to hear what's about to go down today!
