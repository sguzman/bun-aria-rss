The owners are seeking long-term labor peace prior to those negotiations, hoping it’ll prompt networks to pay more for live rights to show games. Berke also talks about the affect sports betting has had on networks and contract negotiations with sports leagues. He also touches on the National Basketball Association, which is seeing an erosion of television audience this season. The NBA, though, has a younger audience that not only consumes on mobile but tends not to watch full games. And Berke also touches on whether the technology companies will be significant bidders for live sports rights in the near future.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
