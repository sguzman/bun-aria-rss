He has been an outspoken critic of President Trump and his enablers in the U.S. Congress and is leading the new Democratic majority’s efforts to uncover the truth about Trump’s ties to the Russians, the Chinese, the Saudis and others who may have responded to the “For Sale” sign the president put up on the front lawn at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  He breaks news about the new oversight agenda of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and where he sees the multiple investigations into Team Trump heading.  He also outlines the positive agenda the Democrats in the House are advancing and the leadership strengths of both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Kamala Harris, whose presidential candidacy he recently endorsed.
