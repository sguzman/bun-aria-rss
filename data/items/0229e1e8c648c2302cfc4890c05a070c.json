  "description": "<p>For most financially responsible parents out there, it’s not a question of <em>if</em> they should be saving for their kid’s college, but <em>how much</em>. Oftentimes parents are wondering how much they need to save in order to be performing their proper parental duty. But we’re taking a more counter cultural stance and are asking the question: <em>should you be saving for college at all</em>? We’re all about thinking in advance and ensuring that we’re properly saving and investing our money, but for a lot of folks, the answer is that they shouldn’t be putting <em>any</em> money towards their child’s future college expenses. Listen as we discuss the benefits of not saving for your kids college, when you can actually start putting funds away in a college fund, and then ways you can go about it properly.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Coconut Stout by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- thanks to Jess for donating this one to the podcast!
