Also, a criminal steals a car, runs over a mother and her child, tries to flee the scene, and will now spend all of five months in juvenile detention for it. And a mother who rushed into Robb Elementary to save her children while police stood outside is speaking out. Plus, another sneak peak of a scene from my film What Is A Woman, and in our Daily Cancellation, we sent screeners of the film to mainstream film critics. They responded and were not happy. \n\nWatch my new Daily Wire original documentary “What Is A Woman?” at whatisawoman.com. \n\nI am a beloved LGBTQ+ and children’s author.
