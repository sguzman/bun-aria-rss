  "description": "<p>It's time to return to one of our favourite sports in Figure Skating as we chat with American Olympic bronze medallist Jason Brown about his incredible career! We learn from Jason the very unique way in which he got into the sport of figure skating as well as which other sport he had to give up in order to pursue his skating career. We also learn just how the 2010 Olympics played a huge part in spurring him on towards his Sochi appearance and just why a trip to Australia in between 2010 and 2014 was so influential on him. Added to this we learn more about his Olympic experiences in 2014 as well as why the disappointment of not making the 2018 Olympics is helping spur him on towards selection for Beijing 2022. It's a super fun chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
