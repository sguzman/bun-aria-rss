  "description": "<p>This episode has it all! Cripple Creek is a spooky old mining town with a ton of history and many haunts, leading it to be thought of as the most haunted Colorado mining town. We have haunted hospitals, hotels, jail, schools, brothels, saloons and even Nikola Tesla. Cripple Creek is on the south side of Pikes Peak and was once considered the \"Greatest Gold Camp on Earth.\" Many people would find their fortune here, but some would find tragedy and death. Violence, mining accidents and natural disasters plagued the town. And that may be why spirits plague the town now. Join us as we share the history and hauntings of Cripple Creek. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Scott Booker and features Cricket Fighting and This Month in History features Haiti Winning its independence. Our location was suggested by Jon Venezia.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/11/hgb-ep-360-cripple-creek.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Ghost Town Atmosphere by Stockmusic<br /> Groovy Ghost by Strike Audio</p>",
