There&#8217;s a lot to unpack in the survey (over 50 questions), and a ton of ways to slice and dice it. Because I wanted to show various breakdowns, I did this in simple Excel pivot tables and didn&#8217;t spend a ton of time formatting (I know they&#8217;re kinda ugly &#8211; sorry).</p>\n<p>If any of the tables or charts below are particularly hard to understand, please let me know and I&#8217;ll annotate further or improve!
