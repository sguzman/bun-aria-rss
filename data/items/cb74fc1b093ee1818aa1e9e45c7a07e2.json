And that sounds like a trite, and repetitive sentence. But like a lot of cliches in life, it&#8217;s true. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking recently about how many experiences I have with companies as a consumer or a business user or a citizen that are frankly suboptimal. There&#8217;s various reasons for this, such as cost-cutting and misguided M and A. I&#8217;ve had a telco experience and banking experience that were awful. And a fintech experience with <a href=\"http://www.monzo.com\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"www.monzo.com\">Monzo</a> recently that was amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For startups to win they need to delight their users. If they delight their users, your users evangelise for you and you have a word of mouth effect that attracts new customers.</strong> Often finding any &#8216;market&#8217; is hard for a startup. It&#8217;s brutally difficult to find your first 10 customers. And there&#8217;s a lot we can do as founders and in startups to make our early customers have a great experience. There&#8217;s the anecdote that Wufoo sent each new user a handwritten note. And this worked for much longer than they thought it would.<br><br>So founders. Go out tomorrow and try to make your users happy and give them a delightful experience. If you focus on that, everything else will work out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.aforithmic.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aforithmic.ai</a> we will be working on delighting our wonderful customers. We do this every week, but we can definitely do better!<br><br>peadar[at]aflorithmic.ai is my email so let me know your views if you have anything you think we&#8217;re doing wrongly on the customer side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Great reading on this </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paulgraham.com/ds.html</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
