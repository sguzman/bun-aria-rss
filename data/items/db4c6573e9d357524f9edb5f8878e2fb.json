  "description": "<p>Dr. Jamie Wood and Professor Niall Mackay at the University of York are mathematicians who love history. Sensible dudes. They released a paper which sent the rest of the history world into a meltdown when they tried to use the statistics of airframe losses from the Battle of Britain to test just how close Germany might have come to victory in the battle. Essentially (I think but then again I am totally innumerate) they tested what would happen if the loss ration on certain days had been replicated consistently. Anyway I wouldn't read my take on it, give it a listen and see if it makes sense to you. I loved these guys and I hope we get to work together again.&nbsp;</p><br><p>For ad free versions of our entire podcast archive and hundreds of hours of history documentaries, interviews and films, including our new in depth documentary about the bombing war featuring James Holland and other historians, please signup to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.historyhit.tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.HistoryHit.TV</a>&nbsp;Use code 'pod1' at checkout for your first month free and the following month for just £/$1.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
