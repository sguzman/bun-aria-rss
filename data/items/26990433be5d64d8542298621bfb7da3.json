  "description": "<p>While Steve is Madawaska bound, Kirk and Mike welcome Matt into the studio to produce the show. Needless to say, Kirk is not amused. Once again Boston media disappoints, and this time it's OMF underplaying the severity of newly acquired Red Sox outfielder Alex Verdugoâ€™s actions regarding an assault (0:25:42). New Minifan and Madawaska resident, Stacey, checks in about the big event this weekend (0:49:47). The Ringer continues to victim-blame (1:26:09). Nick Francona joins Kirk to slam Gabe Kapler and MLB over how they handled the Verdugo situation (1:58:36).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
