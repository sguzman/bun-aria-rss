    "media:description": "I'm still alive this is what I've been working on\n\nSome info about this game:\n- Sakura Miko is the playable character, but you will be able to use a variety of abilities based on other members\n- Gameplay will be shmup similar to Touhou and Suguri series with some roguelite elements and special focus on melee combat\n- Bosses will be other holomems. Many many bosses are planned, the scale of this game is much bigger than WOWOWOW KORONE BOX\n\nI'll post more updates as development continues, so please look forward to it üôè",
