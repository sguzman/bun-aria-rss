  "description": "<p>What does it take to become a professional gambler? That’s the overarching question we’re asking our guest today: Chris Hanna. Chris graduated with a degree in finance and economics, but then he turned down a solid job on Wall Street in order to become a legit blackjack player. Less than 24 hours after he graduated, Chris hit the road and began counting cards for a living. And of course we believe that investing is a far cry from gambling, but a lot of folks are treating them more similarly than they’d like to admit. So where should we draw the line between gambling and investing? During this episode we unpack Chris Hanna’s story, talk about his shift to personal finance, and share how we can strategically use our money to build an exciting life.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Almond Brown Ale by Temblor Brewing- a big thanks to Ryan and our friends there at the brewery for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
