  "description": "<p>Invariant classes under parabolic and near-parabolic renormalization have\nproved extremely useful for studying the dynamics of polynomials. The first\nsuch class was introduced by Inou-Shishikura to study quadratic polynomials;\ntheir argument has been extended to the unicritical cubic case by Yang.\nRecently, Ch\\'eritat has constructed new invariant classes for these\nrenormalizations, general enough to be applied to unicritical polynomials of\narbitrary degree. Usually the parabolic and near-parabolic renormalizations are\nonly considered for maps which have a fixed point with multiplier close to $1$,\nthough it is well-known that similar phenomena occur when the multiplier is\nclose to any root of unity. In this paper we define the parabolic and\nnear-parabolic renormalization operators in the general setting, and use\nCh\\'eritat's argument to produce invariant classes for these operators.\n</p>",
