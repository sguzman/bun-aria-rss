  "description": "<p>When news broke that the new president of the SBC lifted portions of his message from the previous SBC president’s sermon without attribution, #Sermongate erupted. The Holy Post crew unpacks the controversy, why so many pastors either outsource their sermon prep or plagiarize, and why the pressure to preach may be harming the church. Then, in a dramatic reversal, new data from Pew says mainline churches are growing while evangelical churches are shrinking. Have evangelicals been burned by their own critique that mainline churches don’t take the Bible seriously? Then, author and advocate Mary DeMuth explains the history of sexual abuse in the church, why cover ups are now so common, how we can respond more redemptively, and the best ways to prevent abuse in the first place. Plus—good news! Scientists say we have a back-up breathing option if our lungs fail.</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.cnet.com/news/scientists-say-mammals-can-breathe-through-their-butts-in-emergencies/\"> https://www.cnet.com/news/scientists-say-mammals-can-breathe-through-their-butts-in-emergencies/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/us/sermongate-plagiarism-litton-greear.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/us/sermongate-plagiarism-litton-greear.html</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill/\"> https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/07/08/survey-white-mainline-protestants-outnumber-white-evangelicals/\"> https://religionnews.com/2021/07/08/survey-white-mainline-protestants-outnumber-white-evangelicals/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/\">https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/\"> https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://twitter.com/SkyeJethani/status/1410335364116627465\">https://twitter.com/SkyeJethani/status/1410335364116627465</a></p> <p>Resources from Mary DeMuth:</p> <p>\"We Too: How the Church Can Respond Redemptively to the Sexual Abuse Crisis\": <a href= \"https://amzn.to/3tugZOv\">https://amzn.to/3tugZOv</a> <span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.wetoo.org/resources/\">https://www.wetoo.org/resources/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.wetoo.org/survivors/21days/\">https://www.wetoo.org/survivors/21days/</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.netgrace.org/\">https://www.netgrace.org/</a></p> <p><em>A Church Called Tov:</em> <a href= \"https://amzn.to/38Q55F4\">https://amzn.to/38Q55F4</a></p> <p><br /> (The Holy Post is supported by our listeners.
