  "description": "Over the past year, the labor market has been extremely tight, with record high job openings and historically low unemployment.

Those strategies may be paying off to some extent: Our Fifth District business surveys suggest that the worst of the challenge finding workers has passed. Nonetheless, firms are still reporting difficulties, and our most recent survey revealed a notable shift in the type of workers firms are having the toughest time hiring. Firms now report that it is relatively difficult to hire mid-to-high skilled workers, whereas earlier in the year they were struggling to hire low-to-mid skilled workers.",
