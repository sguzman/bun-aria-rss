  "content:encoded": "<p>A busy week. I finished my Aerial Robotics course! The next in the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/robotics\">Specialization</a> is Computational Motion Planning, which I am more excited about &#8211; mainly because the curriculum goes more towards my areas of expertise. Aerial Robotics was challenging primarily because I was doing a lot of physics/calculus which I had not attempted since a long time.</p>\n<p>Onto the articles for this week:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://qz.com/1113999/nerds-rejoice-google-just-released-its-internal-tool-to-collaborate-on-ai/\">Colab is now public!</a></strong></p>\n<p>Google made <em>Colaboratory</em>, a previously-internal tool public. &#8216;Colab&#8217; is a document-collaboration tool, with the added benefits of being able to run script-sized pieces of code. This is especially useful if you want to prototype small proofs-of-concept, which can then be shared with documentation and demo-able output. I had previously used it within Google to tinker with TensorFlow, and write small scripts for database queries.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/\">Visual Guide to Evolution Strategies</a></strong></p>\n<p>The above link is a great introduction to Evolutionary Strategies such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm\">GAs</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES\">CMA-ES</a>. They show a visual representation of how each of these algorithms converges on the optima from the first iteration to the last on simple problems. Its pretty interesting to see how each algorithm &#8216;broadens&#8217; or &#8216;focuses&#8217; the domain of its candidate solutions as iterations go by.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.athelas.com/paper-1-baidus-deep-voice-675a323705df\">Baidu&#8217;s Deep Voice</a></strong></p>\n<p>In a 2-part series (<a href=\"https://blog.athelas.com/paper-1-baidus-deep-voice-675a323705df\">Part 1</a> & <a href=\"https://blog.athelas.com/baidu-deep-voice-explained-part-2-training-810e87d20047\">Part 2</a>), the author discusses the architecture of Baidu&#8217;s Text-to-Speech system (Deep Voice). Take a look if you have never read about/worked on such systems and want to have a general idea of how they are trained and deployed.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ai-wizard-unveils-a-new-twist-on-neural-networks/\">Capsule Networks</a></strong></p>\n<p>Geoff Hinton and his team at Google recently discussed the idea of Capsule networks, which try and remedy the rigidity in usual CNNs &#8211; by defining groups of specialized neurons called &#8216;capsules&#8217; whose contribution to higher-level neurons is decided by the similarity of output. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-capsnet-or-capsule-network-2bfbe48769cc\">Heres</a> a small intro on Capsule Networks, or the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829\">original paper</a> if you wanna delve deeper.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.getnexar.com/how-a-22-year-old-from-shanghai-won-a-global-deep-learning-challenge-76f2299446a1?gi=326763e2e356\">Nexar Challenge Results</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getnexar.com/\">Nexar</a> released the results of its Deep-Learning challenge on Image segmentation &#8211; the problem of &#8216;boxing&#8217; and &#8216;tagging&#8217; objects in pictures with multiple entities present. This is especially useful in their own AI-dashboard apps, which need to be quite accurate to prevent possible collisions in deployment.</p>\n<p>As further reading, you could also check out <a href=\"https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4\">this article</a> on the history of CNNs in Image Segmentation, another one on <a href=\"https://blog.deepsense.ai/region-of-interest-pooling-explained/\">Region-of-Interest Pooling</a> in CNNs, and <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/TerryTaewoongUm/deformable-convolutional-network-2017\">Deformable Neural Networks</a>.
