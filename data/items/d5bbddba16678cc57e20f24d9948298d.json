  "description": "<p>A new survey from Ligonier Ministries titled <a href= \"http://thestateoftheology.com/\">“The State of Theology”</a> revealed lots of interesting things. But one finding that stood out, and generated lots of headlines, was that most Christians believe about Jesus. Nearly 70% of Catholics believe “Jesus is the first and greatest being created by God,” while 57% of Catholics believe “Jesus was a great teacher, but he was not God.” Bishop Barron and Brandon discuss this survey and the ancient heresy these statements reflect.</p> <p>A listener asks if confirmation is supposed to make us fiery defenders of the faith, then why do some Protestants seem to have more fire for the faith, even without this sacrament?</p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
