    "media:description": "In which Jeff Goldblum, lemmings, and a pixelated photo of Obama help me uncover the mathematical reality of Isaac Asimov’s psychohistory.\n\nIn his Foundation book series, Asimov invented psychohistory, a scientific description of history that can predict the future. This video asks whether such a thing is possible. Join me on a tour of all things prediction: mathematical modelling, chaos theory, cliodynamics, machine learning, and how prediction and media interact.\n\nJoin my Discord server to discuss this video and more:\nhttps://discord.gg/AVcU9w5gVW\n\nGet music to use in your videos with Epidemic Sound (use this referral link to support me):\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/cnceag/\n\n0:00 Intro\n3:37 Part I: Foundation’s Foundations\n12:33 Part II: The World in Numbers\n19:45 Part III: The Lemming Effect\n29:19 Part IV: Megahistory\n42:42 Part V: We, Robots\n52:05 Part VI: Prediction in Fiction\n1:01:40 Credits\n\n----------------------\n\nSOURCES\n\nDid not fit in the description, so can be found here: https://pastebin.com/ENpuxwTr\n\n----------------------\n\nFOOTAGE\n\nDid not fit in the description, so can be found here: https://pastebin.com/ENpuxwTr\n\n----------------------\n\nMUSIC\n\nDid not fit in the description, so can be found here: https://pastebin.com/ENpuxwTr",
