  "description": "The Somerton Man case is one that has confounded Australia for almost 75 years now. It all started when an unidentifiable man was found dead on Somerton Beach. The man had no wallet, no form of ID, there was no name written inside of his clothing as would have been typical for the time. And it seemed like all of this was on purpose. Things in the case only got stranger when a tiny rolled up piece of paper was found in a hidden fob pocket in the man's jacket. The words on the paper read “Tamam Shud” and were later determined to have been ripped out of a book of poetry written in the 11th century: The Rubaiyat. In part one we’ll dip our toes into the mystery and in part two Ash will be taking everyone to the deep end of the pool for a serious dive into who the heck this man could possibly be and what the heck happened to him.<br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nNative:  Go to <a href=\"http://Nativedeo.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">Nativedeo.com/morbid</a>, or use promo code morbid at checkout, and get twenty percent off your first order.<br>\n<br>\nShipStation: Sign up using promo code MORBID for a FREE 60-day trial today at <a href=\"http://ShipStation.com\" target=\"_blank\">ShipStation.com</a> and start saving with every shipment.  That’s 2 whole months of discounted shipping, absolutely free!<br>\n<br>\nNoom: Start building better habits today.
