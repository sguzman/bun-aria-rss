  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, we're not witnessing a civil rights movement today. A civil rights movement would rid America of the Democrat party, which is a party that trashes America and its military. America is magnificent. It’s not fair to sell our military short by calling them systemically racist. Blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, and others join together in our military to defend all races in conflicts all over the world. The Democrat Party has controlled the political agenda in major American cities since the 1950s and things have only gotten worse. Then, the media presents their version of America, not the real America. America is no longer systemically racist! George Floyd was killed by a bad cop who will face a life sentence — that is not systemic racism, that is justice. These leftist, Marxist mayors are the product of anti-American propaganda sometimes this propaganda comes from Generals. Retired Generals get stuff wrong too. Later, did any of the media commentators or former Presidents say that the business owners opening their shops was a peaceful protest? Did any of them say the Governors and Mayors were abusing their power when they took away business licenses, shut off power and water to shop owners? This is what the Democrats have done to America. Finally, Morton Klein, President of the Zionist Organization, calls in to criticize a letter authored by 19 Democrat Senators and sent to Benjamin Netanyahu. The letter threatens damage to the U.S. relationship with Israel if the new, democratically-elected Israeli unity government considers voting in July to extend Israeli sovereignty over Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, and the Jordan Valley.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
