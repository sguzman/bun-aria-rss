  "description": "<p>This week on the show is Scott Shriner who is the bassist of the rock band Weezer. Scott was kind enough to invite me over to his house to discuss his time in the marines, being open to change and how hard he had to work for years to randomly land where he is at now. Not to mention his time on the road with Vanilla Ice...yep, that one. He lends some amazing insight on what it takes to \"make it\" as a musician. THIS IS OUR FUNDRAISING MONTH.
