  "title": "Nate Silver on why 2020 isn't 2016",
  "description": "As you may have heard, there's a pretty important election coming up. That means it's time to bring back the one and only Nate Silver. \n\nSilver, the founder and editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, boasts one of the best election forecasting records of any analyst in the last 15 years. His forecasting models successfully predicted the outcomes in 49 of the 50 states in the 2008 US presidential election and all 50 states in 2012. And in 2016, Silver’s FiveThirtyEight gave Donald Trump a 28 percent chance of victory — a significantly higher percentage than virtually any other prominent analyst at the time. He knows what he’s talking about, and it shows in this conversation. We discuss: \n\n\nWhat went wrong with the polls in 2016 — and whether pollsters today have corrected for those mistakes \n\nWhy a 2016-sized polling error in 2020 would still hand Joe Biden the election\n\nWhy the 2020 race has been so incredibly steady despite a global pandemic, an economic crisis, and the biggest national protest movement in US history \n\nThe possibility of a Biden landslide  \n\nThe not-so-small chance that Biden could win Texas and Georgia \n\nThe massive Republican advantage in the Senate, House, and Electoral College — and how that affects our national politics \n\nWhy the Senate would still advantage Republicans, even if Democrats added five blue states. \n\nWhether the Bernie Sanders left took the wrong lessons from 2016 \n\nWhy Biden’s unorthodox 2020 campaign strategy has been so successful \n\nWhether Sanders would be doing just as well against Trump as Biden is doing \n\nHow a more generic, non-Trump Republican would be faring against Biden \n\nWhy Silver is generally optimistic that we will avoid an electoral crisis on November 3 \n\n\nAnd much more.\n\nReferences: \n“How FiveThirtyEight’s 2020 Presidential Forecast Works — And What’s Different Because Of COVID-19.\" Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight\n\"The Senate’s Rural Skew Makes It Very Hard For Democrats To Win The Supreme Court.\" Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight\nLet the People Pick the President: The Case for Abolishing the Electoral College by Jesse Wegman\n\"Toby Ord on existential risk, Donald Trump, and thinking in probabilities.\" The Ezra Klein Show\n\"The Real Story of 2016\" by Nate Silver\n\n\nBook recommendations: \nThe Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova\nSuperintelligence by Nick Bostrom\nThe Precipice by Toby Ord  \n\n\n\nCredits:\nProducer/Audio engineer - Jeff Geld\nResearcher - Roge Karma\n\nPlease consider making a contribution to Vox to support this show: bit.ly/givepodcasts Your support will help us keep having ambitious conversations about big ideas.\n\nNew to the show?
