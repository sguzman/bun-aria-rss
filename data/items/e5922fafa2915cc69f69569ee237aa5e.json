  "description": "<p>This week the duo is in the studio joined by the ladies of the Black Girls Texting Podcast, Chels & Sade. The ladies start with an Ice breaker before diving into the real tea. Vanilla Sh-t this week brings up the horror of a Spring Breaker who lost her life and the ladies attempt to give advice for safety while traveling. This simply lead to stories of how UNSAFE we are as women and we do put ourselves in harms way without knowing it. We share how we are blessed to be able to recant these stories today because many women cannot. Chels shares a sex tip during the Whore’derv before we dive into the WD which includes all the women discussing the 5 things that get in the way of Black women’s sex lives. We wrap up the show with sharing how we as women flirt with girls. </p><p><br></p><p>Follow the hosts on social media Weezy @Weezywtf & Mandii @Fullcourtpumps and follow the Whoreible Decisions pages</p><p>Instagram @whoreible_decisions</p><p>Twitter @whoreiblepod</p><p><br></p><p>Don't forget to tag #whoreibledecisions or @ us to let us know what you think of this week's episode!</p><p><br></p><p>Want more?
