  "description": "Helen and Lee discuss the noisy installation of Joy and Mick’s hot tub, and how loud Mick and Joy are when they’re in it!  They hope the novelty will wear off, but in the meantime decide to have a word with Joy.  Joy’s horrified when they broach the subject. She knew it was a mistake having it; she’ll sell the hot tub and give the money to charity.\nTracy tells Chelsea that Jazzer’s made it up with Alistair. She asks Chelsea if she’s decided about her pregnancy, suggesting that whatever decision she makes, she should really see a doctor or midwife soon to talk through her options.  But Chelsea’s still confused and says she’s not ready.\nChelsea turns up at Pip’s on the pretext of dropping some hair chalks off for Rosie.  Talk turns to Toby and the impact on Rosie of Toby moving away.  Chelsea wonders whether some people aren’t cut out to be parents. Pip confesses she wasn’t sure if she was herself when she became pregnant with Rosie.   She was young and not in a relationship and admits Rosie was an accident.  Chelsea tells her she has a friend who’s pregnant by accident and confused about what to do.  Pip discloses that she’d initially thought about a termination, but now can’t imagine life without Rosie.  However, she tells Chelsea there are no easy answers and suggests that Chelsea’s ‘friend’ gets some professional guidance.\nLater Chelsea tells Tracy that she still hasn’t decided what to do, but agrees that she needs to get some professional advice.",
