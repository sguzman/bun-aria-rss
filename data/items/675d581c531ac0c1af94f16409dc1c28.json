  "description": "<p><p>Yesterday was a triumphant day for Kirk Minihane. He stormed Fenway attempting to gain access to the Red Sox press conference and ask questions about cheating, cover-ups, and sex offenders in the clubhouse. His enemies were on the ropes. All of this he captured on an epic Periscope video which he was hoping to react to on today's show. There's just one problem. Steve Robinson, in some inexplicable and indescribable act of stupidity, did not cut up any of the sound from the Periscope videos. Today's show is Kirk's reaction to learning this.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
