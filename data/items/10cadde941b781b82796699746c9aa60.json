  "description": "If you hear her weeping, it might already be too late. A life fraught with loss and betrayal creates a tragic and dangerous being that's trapped between life and death, salvation and destruction. She's crying out on the edge of madness for those she's lost, and she might be coming for the ones you care about most. This week, it's a deep dive into the stories behind La Llorona, the weeping woman from Latin American folklore. The creature this week is the chupacabra, which is either a vicious blue imp, a spiky naked bear, or a coyote with advanced mange. One of these things is not like the other. -- Sponsor: You've heard the story from folklore, now go see \"The Curse of La Llorona\" in theaters on April 19th! It's an interesting and terrifying take on the La Llorona legend.
