  "description": "<p>What is grace, and what role does it play in our lives? This week’s guest, Dr. Brad Wilcox, answers these and other questions as he likens grace to a scholarship--it is a gift that keeps on giving if we use and accept it. Hank, John, and Brad discuss how to deal with the Ezra Booths of our day, making it ‘us against the adversary,’ rather than ‘us against them.’ Finally, they touch on how both Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney felt less than qualified for their callings as bishops. What can we do as members to help lighten the bishop’s load? <br/><br/>Shownotes: https://followhim.co/ <br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FollowHimOfficialChannel</p>",
