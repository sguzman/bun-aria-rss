  "description": "<div>It was early on a summers morning in the English Channel, not far from Exeter, when the fishermen pulled up their nets. They were heavy and they were excited by what they may have caught. <br>\n<br>\nThey found themselves looking at the fully clothed body of a middle-aged man and immediately called the police. The difficulty the police experienced was that there was no ID on the man at all, just an expensive rolex watch on his wrist. <br>\n<br>\nWould this help them find the man and just what happened to him?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Referenced sites</strong>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/uktruecrime\">www.patreon.com/uktruecrime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.uktruecrime.com/\">www.uktruecrime.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div><strong>Sources</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/rolex-murder-how-police-caught-516448.amp?fbclid=IwAR37_lJofAr3MStsfCsU_ggZsNUWfKbBrUQtVNalrMQ-4eh5yYaZSYVBAk4\">https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/rolex-murder-how-police-caught-516448.amp?fbclid=IwAR37_lJofAr3MStsfCsU_ggZsNUWfKbBrUQtVNalrMQ-4eh5yYaZSYVBAk4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/crimebeat/the-insanely-bizarre-murder-mystery-of-ronald-joseph-platt-6254fa29bd6e\">https://medium.com/crimebeat/the-insanely-bizarre-murder-mystery-of-ronald-joseph-platt-6254fa29bd6e</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Johnson_Walker\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Johnson_Walker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/daughter-speaks-out-against-evil-father/article18219037/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/daughter-speaks-out-against-evil-father/article18219037/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
