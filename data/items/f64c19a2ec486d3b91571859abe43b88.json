  "title": "Oli Mould, “Urban Subversion and the Creative City” (Routledge, 2015)",
  "description": "Every city seems to be ‘creative’, whether because it has a creative brand, a creative quarter or is home to creative industries. In his new book Urban Subversion and the Creative City Routledge, 2015), Oli Mould shows how this is an essential, but mistaken, aspect of the neo-liberal city. Creativity in the governance of the neo-liberal city erases and obscures inequalities and prohibits social justice. The book demonstrates a very different way of thinking about the creative city through a variety of subversive practices, from skateboarding and parkour, to urban explorations. Filled with images and global examples, the book will attract readers in geography, urban studies, sociology, cultural studies, as well as anyone interested in alternative forms of urban life. Mould also works across multiple media forms, and you can see more about the visual elements of Urban Subversion here, and read his blog and twitter feed.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
