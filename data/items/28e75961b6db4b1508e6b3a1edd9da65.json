  "description": "<p>You’ve probably heard this word, seen others accused of it or maybe been accused of it yourself — but what does it actually mean? What is it? And what is its context within your spiritual practice? This is a big and extremely controversial topic right now in the collective that people are accused of yet most don’t understand what it actually means. I have seen countless arguments and debates on social media about this so I wanted to drop in with my friend Shaman Dr. Axel Carraquillo to discuss it from a spiritual + multidimensional perspective, especially as two brown people. We also dive into connecting to your heart energy through quantum heart healing and activating your powers.
