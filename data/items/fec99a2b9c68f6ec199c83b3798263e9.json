  "description": "This is a special episode of 'The Big Picture': a watch-along commentary track for Christopher Nolan’s 11th feature film. In March, we teamed up with Chris Ryan for our first commentary, a four-hour journey through 'Zack Snyder’s Justice League,' a.k.a the Snyder Cut. We barely survived. This time, we’re diving into a more complex movie, but fortunately one we have seen before. This is our collective third viewing of Nolan’s controversial, confusing, and, we will argue, wrongly overlooked 'Tenet.' We will be together for all 150 minutes of this movie, and we want you to watch along with us. Let’s go!\n\nHosts: Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins\nGuest: Chris Ryan\nProducer: Bobby Wagner\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
