She said that she’d love to hear us discuss what the process was like for us personally and what we learned, what we would do differently, etc. when we built our own homes. So today Cory and Jess talk about their process and what they learned just to help you overcome some of the shortcomings that maybe you’ve experienced. Even as professionals, we still experience shortcomings, so hopefully we can help you not have to fall into those same traps. <br /><br />More about Cory 2:11<br />What we would do differently in building our new home 8:39<br />Exterior pain point 16:36<br />You cannot predict the supply chain 22:03<br />Finding the right people to work with 26:49<br />Terminology 29:28<br /><br />“If you like to make a million decisions, build a house because that is exactly what it is.
