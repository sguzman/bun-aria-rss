  "description": "<p>This week we are feeling very targeted! Targeted by ads, targeted by social media apps, and in Mariah’s case targeted by the nail tech that tried to sell her a little more than she bargained for. Maybe we should head to Heath’s doomsday bunker just to get away from it all… Oh, but we won’t be able to lay low when Zane is about to be in ANOTHER big music video! And I doubt Kenny will feel welcome in the bunker after Heath almost shot him… Ah well, while we figure out how to handle all that lets talk about orthodontics and cryptocurrency, two topics we don’t know a lot about, and two words we had to look up how to spell. Hang in there though, we update you on the future of Zane and Heath’s gaming channel, and answer more of your steaming-hot hotline questions.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>So sound the alarm, bar all the doors, and make sure you have a year supply of coffee to sip on because this is one episode of Zane + Heath: UNFILTERED you might want to hunker down for.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://liquidiv.com\">liquidiv.com</a> and use code UNFILTERED to get 20% OFF</p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://calm.com/unfiltered\">calm.com/unfiltered</a> to get 40% of Calm's premium subscriptions and unlimited access to the entire library</p>\n<p>Get $5 OFF and ZERO delivery fees on your first order of $15 or more when you download the DoorDash app and enter code UNFILTERED</p>\n",
