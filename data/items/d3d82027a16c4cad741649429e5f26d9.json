  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery is joined by Patrick McGuire and Matt Borders of \"The History Things Podcast\" for the first fictional battle episode in a long time; Avery, Pat & Matt tackle perhaps one of the most monumental battles in all of fantasy literature. From the pages and scenes of \"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\", the guys travel to Middle Earth to discuss the Battle of Pelenor Fields aka Minas Tirith, which was one of the final climactic battles of the infamous War of the One Ring. Using mostly their experiences from viewing the film and some material from the book (don't get your hopes up, none of them have read it), the trio walk through the fight and banter about some of the key players such as Aragorn, Gandalf, Faramir, Theoden, Eowyn and even Lord Denethor. Strap in for a hilarious ride into the Pelenor Fields! Enjoy!</p>",
