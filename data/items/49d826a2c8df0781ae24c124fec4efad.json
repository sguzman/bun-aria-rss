  "description": "Today's Historic Story: Ray Charles vs. Elvis\n\nEvery time we hop on Twitter, Instagram, or any other social platform, we’re running into brands who use insidious tactics to get into our pockets. From \"Black\" CGI influencers to brands that align themselves as Black allies when they just want Black dollars, it's all digital anti-Blackness and it's causing more harm than we may know. Leading today's conversation is Dr. Francesca Sobande. She's a Senior Lecturer in Digital Media Studies at the School of Journalism, Media and Culture at Cardiff University. She’s a researcher and writer who’s authored several books and published work about “woke-washing,” digital (re) presentations of Black people, and how brands mis-use, exploit, and commercialize such notions like Black social justice activism.\n\n\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!
