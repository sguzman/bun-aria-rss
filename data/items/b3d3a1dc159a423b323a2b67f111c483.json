    "media:description": "This past spring I attended the FRC North Carolina State Championships and got to talk to a bunch of the teams. If you've never heard of FIRST Robotics, you're in for a real treat, because this competition is AWESOME.\n\nThese teams, thousands of them, have only about 2 months to design, build, and test robots to play a brand new game before the competitions begin, and then their work is put to the test! It would be a lot for any professional engineer, but these kids are still in high school! It's pretty incredible.\n\nStay tuned for all of the individual pit interviews!\n\nIf you're interested in finding a team or attending an event, here's the official team search from FIRST:\nhttps://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search\nAnd if you want to know more about any specific team (like a link to their website) you can probably find it on Blue Alliance:\nhttps://www.thebluealliance.com/\n\nIf you're looking to help a team as a mentor, volunteer, or sponsor:\nhttps://www.firstinspires.org/support\n\nIf you're specifically interested in one of the teams I mentioned or featured, here are links to them all!\n------------------------------------------------------\n435, Robodogs\nhttps://www.robodogs.org/\n------------------------------------------------------\n451, The Cat Attack\nhttp://thecatattack.org/\n------------------------------------------------------\n587, The Hedgehogs\nhttps://www.team587.org/\n------------------------------------------------------\n2059, The Hitchikers\nhttps://team2059.org/blog/\n------------------------------------------------------\n2642, Pitt Pirates\nhttp://www.pittpiratesrobotics.com/\n------------------------------------------------------\n3737, Roto Raptors\nhttps://rotoraptors.wixsite.com/team3737\n------------------------------------------------------\n5727, OmegaBytes\nhttp://omegabytes.org/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/omegabytes5727/\n------------------------------------------------------\n6502, Darc Side\nhttps://6502.team/\nhttps://www.da.org/thedaexperience/upper-school/competitive-academic-teams/robotics\n------------------------------------------------------\n7443, Overhills Jag-Wires\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jagwires7443/\n------------------------------------------------------\n8634, Bootstraps!\nhttps://www.thebluealliance.com/team/8634\n------------------------------------------------------\n8727, Glitch 2.0\nhttps://glitchtwopoint0.wixsite.com/glitch2\n------------------------------------------------------\n(if anybody watching this is FROM one of these teams and wants me to change/update/add a link, let me know!)\n\n\nMusic in this video:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\n#robots #STEAM #firstrobotics",
