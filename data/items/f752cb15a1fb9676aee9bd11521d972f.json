  "description": "<p>A continuous bundle of $C^*$-algebras provides a rigorous framework to study\nthe thermodynamic limit of quantum theories. If the bundle admits the\nadditional structure of a strict deformation quantization (in the sense of\nRieffel) one is allowed to study the classical limit of the quantum system,\ni.e. a mathematical formalization in which convergence of algebraic quantum\nstates to probability measures on phase space (typically a Poisson or\nsymplectic manifold) is studied. In this manner we first prove the existence of\nthe classical limit of Gibbs states illustrated with a class of Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperators in the regime where Planck's constant $\\hbar$ appearing in front of\nthe Laplacian approaches zero. We additionally show that the ensuing limit\ncorresponds to the unique probability measure satisfying the so-called\nclassical or static KMS- condition. Subsequently, a similar study is conducted\nfor the free energy in the classical limit of mean-field quantum spin systems\nin the regime of large particles, and the existence of the classical limit of\nthe relevant Gibbs states is discussed.\n</p>",
