  "description": "Robin Hood is a name that has echoed through the ages as a noble outlaw - one who takes from the rich and gives to the poor and who, with his bow and arrow and merry men, makes the powerful, cruel leaders answer for their treatment of the downtrodden. He wasn’t always that symbol. In his earliest tellings, Robin Hood is a much different outlaw. He’s a cutthroat who lives on the edges of the society. He takes from rich and poor alike and gives to his own. He will grow into the symbol that will be known a world over, but he’s not there yet. This is the beginning of the story of Robin Hood. -- Sponsors: Go to SimpliSafe.com/LEGENDSto check out an awesome home security system Bombas. They are fantastic.
