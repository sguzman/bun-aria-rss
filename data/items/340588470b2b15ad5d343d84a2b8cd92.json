  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat welcomes Butler University legend, 9th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, NBA All-Star, and current face of the Boston Celtics, Gordon Hayward onto the show for an incredibly open and honest conversation. They chat about his rise at Butler, and what the NBA draft process is like when you aren’t positive where you’ll be going. He talks candidly about his horrific leg and ankle injury and what he’s been doing to recover from it mentally/physically and whether he’s still working through that process, and what his relationship with Brad Stevens is like. They also chat about the NBA rumor mill and how he keeps a level head during that process when everything is changing so quickly, and talks about his change in barber once he ended up in Utah (8:37-48:33). Pat also addresses the status of the war against the USGA, the guys try to answer a few logic based questions, discuss Brett Favre announcing on his Instagram that he was coming out of retirement(he was hacked), Max Scherzer breaking his nose laying down bunts in BP, chat a little about the upcoming Pat McAfee Does America Tour, and have a lengthy discussion about some of their favorite places to travel while getting into an in-depth discussion about scuba diving, hot air ballooning while Pat recounts his entire skydiving experience and how he was sure it was going to result in certain death. It’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
