There are some pretty scary stories and rumors coming out of a tiny town in Missouri. Stories of meat hooks, cannibalism and serial killing. These rumors and stories all stem from an ongoing Missing Persons Investigation. The last reported sighting of 33 -year old Cassidy Rainwater was back in July of 2021. With a tip from the F.B.I. the Dallas County Sheriff’s office is investigating after receiving a photo of the woman partially nude and caged. Some of the locals call this place Spookyville. Join us in the Garage for some Halloween fun as we crack a couple and take a look at this open investigation and discuss just what might come of it. </p>\n<p>Beer of the Week - Vanilla Pumpkin Beer by O’Fallon Brewery Garage Grade 3 and 1/2 bottle caps </p>\n<p>Our show - True Crime Garage “Off the Record” is available only on Stitcher Premium.
