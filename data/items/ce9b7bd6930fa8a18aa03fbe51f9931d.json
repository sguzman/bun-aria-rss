These cardiometabolic diseases represented a different type of pandemic, long before Covid-19 hit. We can make incredible reductions to our risk of these health problems, and even reverse them, using the power of food. Even people with genetic predispositions can significantly reduce the risk of any of these diagnoses and the Covid consequences that can come with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I talk to Dr. Ronesh Sinha, author of <em>The South Asian Health Solution</em>.
