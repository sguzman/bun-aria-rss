  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Putin is escalating his attack on civilians in Ukraine as he did in Syria and Chechnya. Yet all the media can do is say how terrible it is, but surmise that nothing can be done because Putin will nuke us if we get involved. However, the U.S has taken on the Soviets in many proxy wars in years past. When Russia invaded Afghanistan it paid a high price - 100,000 casualties. President Biden's fecklessness fears that assassination will be viewed as an escalation, yet it's okay if Putin goes after President Zelensky. What is stopping Putin from launching a nuclear bomb right now? Then, the Mig-29 fighter jets that Poland is offering are even newer than the F-16's that they are requesting in exchange for donating them. Yet, the Putin wing of the media and the Republican Party is acting as if they don't want Putin to fall, as if they want him to win. Later, Biden is making a deal with Iran instead of drilling on U.S soil where leases have already been approved on both private and federal land. This decreases production and drives up the cost of fuel. Biden has no answers yet keeps destroying American energy. Afterward, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah calls in to discuss how the Democrats are blaming the Republicans for slowing down a budget bill, which will aid Ukraine, when they haven't even seen the text for it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
