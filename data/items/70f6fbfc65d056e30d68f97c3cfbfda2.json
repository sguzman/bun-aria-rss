  "description": "<p><p>Akaash Singh (1:20:00)Â comes by to chat about Helen of Troy, Flagrant 2 with Andrew Schulz, blackface, R Kelly, and whether or not Neil Degrasse Tyson puts it down in the bedroom. Henry Winkler (1:49:00) drops in to discuss his legendary role as The Fonz, Arrested Development, creating the phrase \"jumps the shark\" and the time he met Action Bronson. KFC and Feits reminisce about all the places KFC Radio has recorded as we pack up and leave the original Barstool NYC office and get ready to open a new exclusive studio. Deadspin layoffs and ESPN the Magazine shutting down. Voicemails include what rumors would you want to be spread about you, and would you stop a BJ? The Office topics from Rone, YP, Nate and a mystery submission: being paid to live, gardening, how do they build buildings and nudes.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
