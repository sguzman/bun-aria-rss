  "description": "In this episode I answer some questions asked by all of you. We speak about how to connect with the right people, believing in yourself, and how to chose the path that you are most passionate about. <br>Something I am passion about is giving back. That is why I started a hashtag for our community, it is #MWFmission because I end every episode with \"Make it your mission to make somebody else's day better.\" I want our MWFmotivation community to give back this holiday season, take pictures and inspire others to do the same.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
