    "media:description": "How do sentences fit inside other sentences? Where can we put words like \"that\", \"whether\", and \"if\"? In this week's episode, we take a look at complementizer phrases: what exactly they are, how they account for embedded sentences and questions, and what they can let us do to capture word order in languages like German and Dutch.\n\nThis is Topic #86!\n\nThis week's tag language: Tok Pisin!\n\nRelated videos:\nA Clause for Celebration: A History of Syntactic Clauses - https://youtu.be/980meOhBGR8\nTopic of Focus: Information Structure - https://youtu.be/gZ6o8yFvJYI\n\nLast episode:\nBuilding Baby Trees: The Stages of Child Syntax - https://youtu.be/zmghbKNiI1k\n\nOther of our syntax videos:\nJust in Case: Case Theory and Where We Can Put Nouns - https://youtu.be/8Xi81H80J-w\nMark of Possession: Determiners, Nouns, and the DP Hypothesis - https://youtu.be/gWy7QdZJg9E\nDesert Island Words: Islands and Where You Can't Move - https://youtu.be/01uH4XfJx3g\n\nOur website also has extra content about this week's topic, discussing the nuts and bolts of how embedded clauses work, at: http://www.thelingspace.com/episode-86/\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: http://thelingspace.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheLingSpace\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, http://www.thelingspace.com/ !\nYou can also find our store at the website, https://thelingspace.storenvy.com/\n\nWe also have forums to discuss this episode, and linguistics more generally.\n\nSources:\nMost of the information for this episode came from Andrew McIntyre's short online syntax textbook (https://www.angl.hu-berlin.de/department/staff/1685901/unterrichtsmaterialien/fundamental-engl-syntax-2014-online-einseitig.pdf), David Adger's Core Syntax (which also talks about German), and Andrew Carnie's Syntax: A Generative Introduction (2nd Edition). There's also a good set of slides on the topic at http://www1.pu.edu.tw/~jason/UMS_i(DPs,%20CPs,%20NegPs%20&%20TPs).pdf .\n\nFor the German section, we used this handout by Sten Vikner: http://www.hum.au.dk/engelsk/engsv/handouts/vikner-ho-2016-V2-cP-CP-Cambridge.pdf\n\nAnd there are more examples taken from the following:\nhttp://switchll.net/papers/2013AFLAhandout.pdf\nhttp://gagl.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/1999-43/03/GAGL-43-1999-03.pdf\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/view/product/19650\n\nLooking forward to next time!",
