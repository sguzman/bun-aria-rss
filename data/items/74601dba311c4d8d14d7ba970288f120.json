The thing is, almost nobody understands what that particularly nasty bit of confusion is about. Luckily, the most high-profile case of the problem, which occurred in the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Kentanji Brown Jackson, gave us the answer. She said she didn't know what a woman is (while being a woman) because she's not a biologist. In other words, to know what a woman is, you have to ask a qualified expert. It doesn't matter what the definition is because the whole thing is a power grab making use of Queer Theory (better called Queer Marxism) to steal power from deliberately constructed confusion.
