In reality, dairy isn’t the vital source of calcium and strong bones that we were led to believe. Dairy can cause digestive problems for the majority of people with lactose intolerance, along with a range of other symptoms in people with and without lactose intolerance. These symptoms can include sinus issues, skin issues, headaches, autoimmune issues, and more. So how do you know if the lactose in dairy, or dairy overall, is a problem for you?</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss lactose intolerance and the myriad of ways dairy can cause digestive problems, and more. They also share how they work with patients to determine how dairy is being tolerated, and if it is the cause of other underlying health issues.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life.
