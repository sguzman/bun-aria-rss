  "description": "<p>We first brought you the story of Johnthan Hall just over two years ago in December 2019. On Wednesday, February 13, 2019, 30-year-old Johnthan Hall went to work with his dad. The two worked together at a maintenance job in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the end of the day, his father dropped him off at home. Johnthan then left for his second job at a local billiards club not too far away. Johnthan was seen at the club that night around 7:30 PM. No one knows precisely when Johnthan left or where he may have gone. Missing along with Johnthan were the items he always carried with him in his backpack.</p><p>Frustratingly, Johnthan is still missing today, but there has been one major turn of events that reignited John's case. In October of 2020, someone very close to John was arrested by Las Vegas police and accused of stabbing three people. Two of those victims died, and one survived. This was a person that some of John's family members had suspicions about in the original episode, but they were under the impression that he had been ruled out. Investigators told John's family in 2019 that they didn't think this person was capable of murder. But now, they aren't sure what to think.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Johnthan Hall, please call the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at 702-828-3111.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://storyworth.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">StoryWorth</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://storyworth.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">StoryWorth.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;for $10 off your first purchase.</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
