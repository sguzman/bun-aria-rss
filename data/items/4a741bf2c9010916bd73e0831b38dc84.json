None of the events depicted in this video actually happened, and are merely for entertainment purposes.\n\n[Kiosk by @RM05 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZcUVLRsiNPVWI_eLAvuZyg]\n\nUnauthorized amateur footage of two previously unseen areas of the Spaceworld 1995 build of Super Mario 64, captured on the showfloor of the event. Curiously, the presence of English in-game text suggests that it may have been a misplaced development cartridge intended for showcase in the west.\n\nNintendo's fun is eternal.\n\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/greenio64\nDeviantArt | https://www.deviantart.com/greenhat64",
