  "description": "<p>The best thing you can do is not ignore, but rather, LISTEN TO this episode of Las Culturistas because, bitch, BETTY WHO is the guest. One of Matt & Bowen's favorite artists joins them in person in LA to discuss naming wigs and hair as expression, hanging in there in the music industry through ups and downs, touring, the importance of rehearsal, and the question of WWBD (Beyonce...and Britney!) Also! Britney as formative culture, always getting the moms in the crowd on her side with Betty's cover of \"I Love You Always Forever\", playing every Pride in America, and queering up the lives of the straight men you know. All this, cannibalism fever, how TikTok is running the music industry, performing on The Bachelorette and how sometimes a Glee Cast Version can go all the way off. It's fucking Betty Who everybody! We woke up and chose violet for this one... STREAM THIS WOMAN.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
