  "description": "Hey guys. Christie and Heather here. As you may have noticed from the title of this week's episode, we're doing something different. After talking about it, we decided that given the renewed focus on racial justice, criminal justice reform, and the violent actions of the government against protestors and the black community, we wanted to step back from the mic and instead amplify the voices of black creators and create space to share their show with you.\n\n\nThe Why You...? Podcast is a brand new podcast by fellow Texans, and husband and wife duo, Mikayla and Alfonso Davis. Their first three episodes dropped June 2 and can be found on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, and Spotify. We're bringing you their first episode which focuses on anxiety and how they have coped with it throughout their lives. They are funny, charming, and inviting. We are so grateful that they're letting us share their first episode with you and know you'll love it just as much as we do.\n\n\nLike, subscribe, share, and follow them on social media on Instagram at WhyYouPod_ and on twitter at WhyYouPod. Also head to their feed where you'll find two more episodes. Links are in the show notes.\n\n\nIf you're like us, you have spent a lot of time this week wondering how you can show your support to the black community and protesters. We have compiled a list of resources we hope you find helpful. Head to our website and click “Justice Resources” in the top right corner to find ways to help. Please enjoy this episode. Thank you so much and stay safe!\nSupport Sinisterhood\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
