  "description": "Contributor(s): Richard Bronk, Professor Lib Taylor, Professor Mary Morgan | Welcome to LSE IQ, the monthly podcast from the London School of Economics and Political Science. This is the podcast where we ask some of the leading social scientists - and other experts - to answer intelligent questions about economics, politics or society. \"The human species thinks in metaphors and learns through stories.\" So says Mary Catherine Bateson, writer and cultural anthropologist.  Narratives are all around us, from the TV shows we watch, the newspapers we read to the anecdotes we tell. But how do narratives shape our understanding of the world, ourselves and the people around us? Do they distort or clarify our view of reality? In this episode James Rattee asks, 'How do stories help us understand the world?'. This episode features the following academics: Mr Richard Bronk, LSE European Institute, Professor Lib Taylor, University of Reading's Department of Film, Theatre and Television and Professor Mary Morgan, LSE Department of Economic History. If you've been affected by the issues in this podcast, you could contact the Samaritans on 116 123.
