  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>Life is precious. George Floyd death compounded by hurt of coronavirus economic destruction. Rush decided to reach out to the African-American community by talking to The Breakfast Club radio show. Many of you may think Rush was treated rudely, but it was worth the effort. Coronavirus vanishes as an issue. Things were looking bad for Democrats, Dem governors were imploding, Biden was imploding, then come the riots. Nobody justifies George Floyd's death, cop should be charged with first degree murder. Left trying to blame \"white supremacists\" for violence. Democrat governors giving rioters, Antifa space to destroy.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Trump tells governors they have to dominate, use National Guard. Rudy: If you want to be safe, don't elect Democrats. Leftists organizations hijack the justified George Floyd protests. Susan Rice thinks the Russians are behind the protests. Riots are Democrat Party chickens come home to roost. If GOP wants to win in November, they will tie Dems to riots, like 1968. Space launch was moving. Andy McCarthy: The president doesn't have to wait for the governors to use the National Guard. Caller: Rioters are the last gasp of the Trump haters. Democrat Party is to blame for all of this.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Rush's conversation with the hosts of The Breakfast Club about the George Floyd murder and the state of race relations in America, Colin Kaepernick, white supremacy, white privilege, the Democrat Party, black unemployment. Police officers joining the protests. George Floyd murder makes no sense. There are rogue people in every group.
