  "description": "Donald Trump has promoted a foreign policy that seeks to reverse or undermine many of the lasting tenets of post WWII U.S. foreign policy. He wants to retreat into a gated community nationalism that eschews international institutions, alliances, engagement, diplomacy and even the basics of sound coordinated foreign and national security policy at home. The risks are becoming clearer every day: in Syria, via trade wars and in the gains Trump has won...for our rivals, notably the Russians. We discuss how long it may take to recover and how we may get there with Tony Blinken, former Deputy Secretary of State under President Barack Obama and currently an advisor to the presidential campaign of Joe Biden. It is an important, thought-provoking conversation that you won't want to miss. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
