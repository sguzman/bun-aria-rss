  "title": "Ep 101 | Ric Grenell Knows Too Much & This Is Why He Prays to God | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Despite the Biden administration bragging that it’s the first to have an openly gay Cabinet member, that distinction belongs to President Trump and his former acting Director of National Intelligence, Richard Grenell. But reducing his accomplishments to just that is insulting. Ric joins Glenn to give just a glimpse at what he learned under the Trump administration and from nearly 20 years of intelligence briefings before that — which has led him to admit that it’s no wonder he believes in God. Ric gives a behind-the-scenes look at what he knows about everything from aliens and AI to spies, D.C. corruption, and the extreme threat that is communist China. And he’s one of the few people who can confirm just how dishonest the media was on stories like Hunter Biden’s laptop scandal and “Russian collusion” — because he’s read the classified documents.\n \n This Week’s Sponsor:\n \nWhether you’re catching up on your favorite news podcast, binging an audiobook, or powering through your workout with a pumped-up playlist, a pair of Raycons in your ears can make all the difference. Get 15% off your entire Raycon order at http://BuyRaycon.com/Glenn\nLearn more about your ad choices.
