  "description": "<p>Did you know that Hunter S Thompson of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fame was one of the first people to bring national attention to the Hells Angels? Or that they were founded by soldiers returning home from World War 2? Or that a Marlon Brando movie in the 1950's also lead to growth of not just the Hells Angels but other Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, as the US Justice Department likes to call them? Who are the real Sons of Anarchy? Big informative episode today about the Hells Angels, the history of motorcycles, and the rise of the MC - Motorcycle Club - in American culture (which was quickly exported internationally).  It's a gun-runnin', back your brother's play, keep the ride fast and tight on the freeway and keep the booze and drugs flowing when we make it to the end of the run edition, of Timesuck. <br /><br />The Bad Magic Productions charity for December is the Bad Magic Giving Tree! So far we have raised - thanks to so many of you - $44,160, and that money will give  176 kids from 177 families the best holiday of their lives!
