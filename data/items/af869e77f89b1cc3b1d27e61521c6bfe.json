  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason starts things off my sharing his thoughts on the Atlanta Falcons' Thursday Night Football victory over the Carolina Panthers. In short, the Panthers are exactly who we thought they were: a bad football team. Jason also shares a quick thought on Trevor Lawrence's positive COVID test. Isn't it convenient that the 10-day quarantine period ends exactly on the day of Clemson's biggest game of the regular season against Notre Dame? Weird. But on the bright side, today is Venmo Giveaway Day! Two very lucky listeners earned $100 straight out of Jason's gambling fund (and there's plenty more where that came from). Plus, professional sports gambler Preston Johnson swings by to explain why he wasn't fully against Kevin Cash's decision to pull Blake Snell in Game 6 of the World Series, why he's currently leaning towards betting on Cam Newton and the New England Patriots (even without their top two wide receivers) this Sunday against the Buffalo Bills, why he doesn't buy into certain trends that may lead bettors to bet big on the Los Angeles Rams in their matchup against Tua Tagovailoa, why he really had no choice but to bet on the Denver Broncos this Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, why the Pittsburgh Steelers may be a little bit of Fool's Gold, and much more! Finally, Jason closes things out with a very special NFL Sunday 3-pack edition of The Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe and download all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
