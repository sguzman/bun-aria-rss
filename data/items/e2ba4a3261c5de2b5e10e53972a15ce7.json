  "description": "<p>In part two of this series on focused thinking, John Maxwell helps us narrow down our focus as he shares what we need to focus on. We get the greatest return on investment when we focus on our strengths, our key people, and our team’s development. John concludes by providing a <em>Rule of Five</em> for developing your own team.</p> <p>Jason Brooks and Mark Cole discuss what it looks like to live out this lesson, and Mark encourages us to get very clear on what we’re good at. Jason defines teachability as a combination of hungry, humble, and hustle. Mark challenges us to rate ourselves on each of those attributes and allow that to help us see where we need to focus. </p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Focused Thinking Worksheet.
