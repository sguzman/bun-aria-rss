  "description": "<p>Tony Hale (<i>Veep, Arrested Development, Toy Story 4, Being the Ricardos, Clifford The Big Red Dog, Archibald’s Next Big Thing</i>) discusses the impact a chronic, invisible condition can have on mental health. He explains how living with severe asthma shifted his worldview and contributed to his anxiety and panic attacks, and the consequences of living life in a state of constant vigilance. Tony opens up about how being bullied led him to build a comedic defense system, why he loves connecting with others who share his condition, and the importance of seeing yourself in other people. Mayim and Tony bond over the role faith plays in their mental wellness, learning to practice contentment, and the similarities between cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation. Mayim highlights ways to calm your mind when communicating with difficult people in another installment of Moments of Peace & Calm.</p><p>Tony's Children's Book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Archibalds-Next-Thing-Tony-Hale/dp/0692229485\">https://www.amazon.com/Archibalds-Next-Thing-Tony-Hale/dp/0692229485</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
