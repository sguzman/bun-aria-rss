  "description": "Incomes are stagnating, middle-class jobs are disappearing, economic growth is slowing, and the meager gains are mostly going to those who are already wealthy. More Americans than ever are frustrated by the direction in which we are headed. Understandable Economics: Because Understanding Our Economy Is Easier Than You Think and More Important Than You Know (Prometheus, 2022) aims to replace this frustration with a practical understanding of our economy and empower readers to identify and advocate for a better approach to the problems we face.\nIn this entertaining and informative guide, author Howard Yaruss breaks down our economic system in a straightforward way, avoiding jargon, formulas, graphs, and other technical material so common in books on this subject. Instead, he creates a compelling and comprehensive picture of our economy using accessible analogies, real-world observations, and entertaining anecdotes. Understandable Economics will enable readers to answer questions such as:\n\nWhy is inequality soaring and what can we do about it?\n\nDo tax cuts for the wealthy create jobs or just create more inequality?\n\nWhere does money come from, why does it have value, and who controls it?\n\nWhat does the Fed do and how does it affect our lives?\n\nCould alternative currencies like Bitcoin replace the dollar?\n\nIs our national debt a threat?\n\nWhy do so many people believe free trade is good if it causes some people to lose jobs?\n\nWhy does the economy regularly turn down and how can we get it back on track?\n\n... and many more.\nUnderstandable Economics provides the context, tools and foundational knowledge readers need to thoroughly understand our economy, determine which policies would work best, and champion those policies effectively.\nHoward Yaruss is an economist, professor, attorney, businessman, and activist who greatly enjoys explaining complex issues in a clear, interesting, and easily accessible way. He has taught a variety of economics and business courses, and currently teaches at New York University. Previously, he was executive vice president and general counsel of Radian Group, one of the largest guarantors of debt in the world. He has also served on the boards of organizations that advocate for safer streets, help the homeless, and support the arts. Yaruss graduated from Brown University, studied at the London School of Economics, and earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He lives in Manhattan and is a member of his local community board.\nDaniel Moran earned his B.A. and M.A. in English from Rutgers University and his Ph.D. in History from Drew University. The author of Creating Flannery O’Connor: Her Critics, Her Publishers, Her Readers, he teaches research and writing at Rutgers and co-hosts the podcast Fifteen-Minute Film Fanatics (Twitter @15MinFilm).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
