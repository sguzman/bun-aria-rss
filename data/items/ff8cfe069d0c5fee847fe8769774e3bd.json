  "description": "In this episode, I discuss the profound effect the gut has on the nervous system. I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Gut Microbiome \n(00:03:02) Sponsors\n(00:06:55) Your Gut-Brain Axis \n(00:09:44) Gut-Brain Anatomy\n(00:15:32) Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome \n(00:20:01) Roles of Gut Microbiome \n(00:23:03) Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting with Your Stomach \n(00:34:13) Ghrelin: Slow Modulation of Your Brain in Hunger\n(00:38:02) Glucagon Like Peptide 1; GLP-1 \n(00:42:22) Tools: ‘Free Will’ & Food Cravings \n(00:44:46) Mechanical Cues from Gut to Brain\n(00:49:05) Dopamines, Vomiting \n(00:52:06) Indirect Signals from Gut Microbiota\n(00:59:30) Gut Microbiome “Critical Periods” \n(01:03:08) How Gut Health Controls Overall Health \n(01:12:25) What is a Healthy Gut Microbiome?\n(01:15:00) Tools: Enhance Your Gut Microbiome\n(01:23:49) Foods to Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods \n(01:37:07) High-Fiber Diets & Inflammation\n(01:40:58) Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners \n(01:44:27) Structure & Function of Gut-Brain Axis \n(01:49:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
