Tex and Bird give the rundown on how they toured and built up their fan base without an album, their advice for younger artists, and why you need to try their new Bucked Up Whiskey. The guys also get real about their pride for Americans and gratitude for those who have served.</p> <p>Bunnie: <a href= \"https://dumbblondepodcast.com/\">Website </a></p> <p>Moonshine Bandits: <a href= \"https://moonshinebandits.com/\">Website </a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.buckedupwhiskey.com/\">Bucked Up Whiskey </a></p>",
