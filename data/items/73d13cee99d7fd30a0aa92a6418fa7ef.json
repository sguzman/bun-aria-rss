  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, does the president have the right to impose vaccine mandates on the American People? Of course, the President and the federal government don't have this authority, but that didn't stop the Democrats from producing a workaround to attempt to mandate them. In oral arguments to determine this very question at the Supreme Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor made incoherent claims that simply weren't true, making her case for OSHA requirements in the workplace. Judges shouldn't make health policy; they should interpret the law. Then, Justice Sam Alito made an argument for the unprecedented particularity of the OSHA policy which potentially impacts workers in the name of safety. In fact, the Spanish Flu of 1918 scared people in much the same way but America did not see these types of mandates. Although we did see high numbers of vaccine injuries following the Spanish Flu. Later, Big tech shuts down debate from experts with opposing viewpoints. Discussion on the efficacy of vaccines is not permitted by the left. Just like Liz Cheney won't look at Nancy Pelosi's failure to secure the Capitol Building. Afterward, the jobs numbers are dismal, and Biden's handling of the economy continues to worsen. Employers can't find workers for open positions because of generous unemployment programs.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
