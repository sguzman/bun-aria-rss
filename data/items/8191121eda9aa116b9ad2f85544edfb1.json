  "description": "July 26, 2015. Smithville, Tennessee. Lauren Taylor Agee was a 21 year-old criminal science major. In July 2015, she attended Wakefest at Center Hill Lake in Tennessee with her friend, Hannah Palmer. The weekend festivities included wakeboarding, cliff jumping, camping and all-night parties. While there they met up with Palmer's boyfriend and one of his friends. After spending time at a bar, they made their way to their campsite after 2am which required them to travel by boat then climb a steep cliff with the aid of a rope. The next day, Lauren's body was discovered face down in a cove that was hundreds of feet away from the hammock she had slept in. Law enforcement and Lauren's family do not agree on what caused the woman's death. Did she fall off the cliff by accident as the authorities concluded? Or was foul play involved?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
