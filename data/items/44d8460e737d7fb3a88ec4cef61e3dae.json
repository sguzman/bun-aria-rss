  "description": "In this episode, Sharon sits down with Dr. Lauren Pinkston, Executive Director for Kindred Exchange, to share some good old-fashioned Ohio facts. Join the duo as they discuss why Ohio has long been dubbed “The Bellwether State” and why that title may be in jeopardy. What exactly is a “bellwether” and why do political pundits claim it has been unrung? Ohio has a fascinating geographical settlement history that has shaped the way the state’s demographics have participated in national politics. Sharon tells Lauren how this is evolving, and why Ohio voted for Trump in 2020 but the nation voted for Biden. Of course, there’s no shortage of presidential facts in this episode, as Ohio has produced eight presidents and six first ladies!<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
