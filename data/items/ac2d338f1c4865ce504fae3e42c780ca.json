  "description": "<p>It’s time to bring you your first taste of Artistic Gymnastics today as we chat with Tokyo Olympian Emily Whitehead about her amazing career and Olympic experiences! We find out from Emily how she got involved in the sport and what it is like competing at major competitions at such a young age. We also learn about the importance of being an all-around athlete in gymnastics and just how damn tricky that pesky beam can be. Added to this we learn about how an injury that prevented her selection for the Rio Olympics went on to help her achieve further success, and just why she was so close to pulling the pin on the sport once COVID hit last year. It’s a fun and great chat that will have you flipping all over your house, so get to listening!</p>",
