  "description": "<p>Waynesville, Ohio is known as the \"Antique Capital of the Midwest.\" At the town's beginnings though, it was an important Quaker settlement. The Quaker meeting established here in 1803 was the first in southwestern Ohio. A stagecoach line connected Waynesville to the rest of the state and eventually the village would serve as a stop along the Underground Railroad. Despite having a pretty peaceful beginning, Waynesville has become known as one of, if not THE most haunted city in Ohio. With thirty-six reputed haunted places, that is no wonder. In this episode, we are going to visit several historic locations that also have ghostly activity. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Waynesville! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Michael Rogers and features the White River Monster and This Day in History features Van Gogh chopping off his ear. Our location was suggested by Amanda Turk and she helped with research as well.</p> <p>Check out our website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-172-haunted-waynesville.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-172-haunted-waynesville.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
