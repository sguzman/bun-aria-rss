    "media:description": "This is the 3rd devlog for Hyperbolica where I talk about how I build and render hyperbolic worlds.  If you haven't seen the first 2 videos in the series, make sure you watch them first or else this may be confusing.\n\nDevlog #1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQo_S3yNa2w\nDevlog #2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY9GAyJtuJ0\n\nHyperbolica on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256230/Hyperbolica/\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMKLeS-Uq_8\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/7fAwnYV\nMerch: https://crowdmade.com/collections/codeparade\n\nIf you like the things I do and want to support the channel:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/codeparade\nhttps://ko-fi.com/codeparade\n\n**CORRECTIONS:**\nI just found out that Gyrovectors are indeed associative.  I misunderstood the context of the claim in the paper, which was referring to mobius addition, not the full gyrovector addition which corrects the associativity.  I apologize for the mistake!\n\nOther references from video:\nMiegakure: https://miegakure.com/\nUngar's original paper about Gyrovector Spaces:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/268710591_Gyrovector_spaces_and_their_differential_geometry\n\nMusic:\nHorrible - Mela\nhttps://melagroup.bandcamp.com/album/mela-two",
