  "description": "In 1988, a 23-year-old man from Alaska left for a solo road trip to Washington so he could begin medical school. During the drive, he experienced car trouble, but just 5 days into his trip, his vehicle would be found engulfed in flames 1,700 miles from where his journey began. It wasn’t long until a body would be found, and witnesses began coming forward stating that they saw the young man picking up a strange hitchhiker around the time of his disappearance.
