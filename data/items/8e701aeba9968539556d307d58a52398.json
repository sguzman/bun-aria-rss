  "description": "Two stories, one from Italy, one from England. In the one from italy, Costanza is born which would usually be pretty great...except her parents are already in retirement and have given everything away to her older sisters, so she sets out on her own in the wild medieval world. The second story is Molly Whuppie, whose parents have left her and her two sisters in the forest to die. Then things get worse. The creature this week is hoop snake, a snake that's a hoop and also really confused as to why you're diving through it. -- Sponsors:  Simplisafe home security is my absolute favorite.
