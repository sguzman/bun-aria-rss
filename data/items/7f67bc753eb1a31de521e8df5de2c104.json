He has spent the past 25 years either working in the wine trade or writing about it, in his native Ireland, the UK, and New Zealand. He has a dedication to telling things as they are -- as a true observer of situations rather than a judge, jury, or partisan -- and publishes articles on topics that need to be tackled in the wine industry but that others won't touch because of wine politics. </p> <p> </p> <p>In this show Don and I discuss how the wine world is starting to look in a post-pandemic world where a shift towards stay-at-home drinking and more casual dining will likely be lasting trends. We address the (sort of earth-shattering, in our little world) quote from the head of Penfolds, Peter Gago, <a href= \"https://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2021/07/farewell-to-the-cult-of-the-somm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which was the highlight of the article in Wine-Searcher</a>:</p> <p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>\"The pandemic has probably diminished the 'cult of the sommelier'. Recent events may have also subdued their profile/visibility in the US market. Perhaps we're moving towards a new paradigm: less aspirationally rock star - more humility?\"</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/840x840-Peter-Gago-Penfolds-Chief-Winemaker.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"329\" height=\"329\" /><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: Peter Gago, Chief Winemaker, <a href= \"https://www.penfolds.com/en-us/about-penfolds/winemaking/our-winemakers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Penfolds.com</a></em></span></p> <p>Although he said what most of us in the industry were thinking, his articulation of this sentiment (with a hint of hopefulness) really gives permission to others to stop putting sommeliers on a pedestal. With his proclamation, he effectively has made it ok for restaurants and producers to stop treating these people as influencer gods (as Don and I discuss, beyond their bubbles and their restaurants they don’t actually sell wine so this makes sense!). He has sounded the death knell for sommelier culture. </p> <p> </p> <p>James Lawrence, <a href= \"https://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2021/07/farewell-to-the-cult-of-the-somm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the author of the piece in Wine-Searcher,</a> contacted other heavy hitters in the industry, including respected importer Thierry Thiese in the US, who concurred that the ego and adulation of sommeliers needed to go away.
