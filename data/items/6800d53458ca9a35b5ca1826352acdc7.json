So, when he sees an entitled Karen blocking an employee's path with her car, OP decides to get some petty revenge by giving Karen a dose of her own medicine! He parks his car behind hers to block her in, and then ignores her insane screams of protest as she yells at him to move his car. Revenge is sweet, Karen!</p>\n<p>🔔 Subscribe: https://bit.ly/2E3A8i6</p>\n<p>💬 Discord: https://discord.gg/VD6eYD3</p>\n<p>🎧 Podcast: https://link.chtbl.com/rslash</p>\n<p>⚓ Send me a voice message: https://anchor.fm/rslash</p>\n<p>📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rslashyt/</p>\n<p>♪ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@rslash0</p>\n<p>🛒 Merch: http://bit.ly/rSlashMerch</p>\n<p>🎁 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rslash</p>\n",
