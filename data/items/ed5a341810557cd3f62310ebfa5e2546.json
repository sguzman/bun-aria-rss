  "description": "<p>It's a loved up day 10 of Beijing 2022 with action aplenty, medals galore and so much stuff to talk about that you should probably already be listening by the time you read this! How is Canada feeling about (technically) winning the gold in the monobob? Or are we only counting the bronze? How did Ben do in the monobob and is he pleased with his debut Olympic run by finishing 5th? Are we heartbroken over the aerials or more heartbroken over the OTP curse continuing? What noises is Colin excited to talk about that were made by the CBC today? And are there some winter events that we are maybe starting to question as being part of the Olympics? Get all romantic up in here for another episode of your favourite Olympic podcast!</p>",
