  "description": "<p>Here we present an initial look at the dynamics and stability of 178\nmultiplanetary systems which are already confirmed and listed in the NASA\nExoplanet Archive. To distinguish between the chaotic and regular nature of a\nsystem, the value of the MEGNO indicator for each system was determined. Almost\nthree-quarters of them could be labelled as long-term stable. Only 45 studied\nsystems show chaotic behaviour. We consequently investigated the effects of the\nnumber of planets and their parameters on the system stability. A comparison of\nresults obtained using the MEGNO indicator and machine-learning algorithm SPOCK\nsuggests that the SPOCK could be used as an effective tool for reviewing the\nstability of multiplanetary systems. A similar study was already published by\nLaskar and Petit in 2017. We compared their analysis based on the AMD criterion\nwith our results. The possible discrepancies are discussed.\n</p>",
