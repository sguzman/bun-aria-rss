  "description": "<p>Today, I’m going to share with you my first ever public interview with my friend Tom Bilyeu of the Impact Theory podcast. It is one of my favorite conversations because we talk about the power self awareness has in influencing your relationships with others especially with the people close to you and at work. </p><p>I also talk about breaking free from the norm, from what society expects from us, and from the limits we have set for ourselves. Once we become self aware, we can then start asking questions that need honest answers and we can often get these answers from people we look up to and from our experiences. And as the level of self awareness increases, we make better decisions and eventually, enjoy positive results.</p><p>If you want to pre-order the book, <i>8 Rules of Love</i>, go to <a href=\"https://8rulesoflove.com/\">https://8rulesoflove.com/</a></p><p>Key Takeaways:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 Intro</li><li>00:04:54 How did you find your fourth option?</li><li>00:13:07 We live in echo chambers</li><li>00:16:50 What is power?</li><li>00:20:14 What’s the best part of being a monk?</li><li>00:23:45 What is an ideal life?</li><li>00:26:51 Start your day with gratitude</li><li>00:32:49 Self awareness</li><li>00:40:47 Questions to ask yourself</li><li>00:44:46 Three questions you are often asked</li><li>00:49:31 The three E’s of life</li><li>00:51:52 Making wisdom go viral</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-purpose-with-jay-shetty/id1450994021\">Like this show?
