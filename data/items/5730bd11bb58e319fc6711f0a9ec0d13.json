  "description": "Comparison is a normal, human occurrence. It’s hard not to notice when someone has a nicer car than you, a bigger house than you, or seems more successful than you. We have all fallen into that temptation. But we can’t let comparison trap us. When it does, we begin to live outside of our calling and the life God has for us. In week 4 of our series Cuffing Season, Pastor Mike warns us about the dangers of comparison and teaches us how to kill it in our lives.
