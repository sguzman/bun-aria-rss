Today I continue this tradition with a man who has played a very large role in pioneering meditation, specifically the practice of Transcendental Meditation (“TM”) throughout the West.</p><p>Meet meditation legend&nbsp;Bob Roth.</p><p>Bob first discovered meditation as a freshman at Berkeley during the height of the 1960's – ground-zero for the anti-war movement and the many cultural changes that were sweeping the country at that time. Once a skeptic, he was soon hooked, ultimately training under the tutelage of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the legendary albeit controversial meditation guru made globally famous by the Beatles.&nbsp;Every day since, he has meditated twice a day every day, devoting his life over the last 45 years to teaching what he has learned to millions of people across the world.</p><p>Today, Bob is one of the most experienced and sought after meditation teachers in America. A proper meditation teacher to the stars, his student roster includes such recognizable names as Oprah, Russell Brand, Jim Carrey, Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Scorcese, Ray Dalio, Howard Stern, Tom Hanks, Hugh Jackman, and countless other notables.</p><p>But Bob would much rather talk about his work as the executive director of <a href=\"https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The David Lynch Foundation,</a> where he has helped bring TM to more than 500,000 inner-city youth in underserved schools in 35 countries, as well as to veterans and their families suffering from PTSD, and women and girls who are survivors of domestic violence.</p><p>Bob is also the national director of the <a href=\"https://www.tmbusiness.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Center For Leadership Performance,</a> another non-profit which introduces meditation to Fortune 100 companies, government organizations and non-profit charities.
