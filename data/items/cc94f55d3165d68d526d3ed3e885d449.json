  "description": "On Friday’s, Mark Levin Show, President Donald J. Trump calls in to set the record straight on phony Charlottesville claims and to thank Mark for his accurate commentary on the silent coup against his campaign and presidency. Trump also mentions Hillary Clinton’s emails on Anthony Weiner's Laptop and the dishonest FISA applications. The president tells Mark about his border strategy, how Democrats want to abolish ICE and jokes about how Hillary's election victory party became a funeral for her campaign. The Democrats have tried everything to reverse the outcome of the 2016 election. They tried to spy on Trump, imprison him, impeach him and even flirted with the idea of using the 25th Amendment. Relenting once they realized that it would be more difficult to remove a president under the 25th Amendment than it is through impeachment. Then, former Vice President Joe Biden has admitted to speaking with World Leaders who have encouraged him to run for President of The United States. Biden has literally admitted to running for office at the request of foreign leaders. Later, Congressman Jerry Connolly is now threatening to jail people that don’t comply with subpoenas.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
