  "description": "<p><em>“Race and racism are a reality that so many of us grow up learning to just deal with. But if we ever hope to move past it, it can’t just be on people of color to deal with it. It’s up to all of us—Black, white, everyone—no matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own. It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets. I pray that we all have the strength for that journey, just as I pray for the souls and the families of those who were taken from us.” – Michelle Obama<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></em></p> <p>Long-standing, deep-seated racial inequities are being uncovered in every aspect of American life. Not only do many western illnesses (and even the pandemic) disproportionately affect Black people, but now we’re seeing a widespread public outcry about racism in our criminal justice system. If you’re at all familiar with The Model Health Show, you know my tendency to dig into the numbers, look at the data, and find the root cause of any issue.</p> <p>That’s what we’re going to dive into on today’s show. You’re going to gain a deeper understanding of systemic racism, racial profiling, and the disproportionate rates in which violence, poverty, homicide, and police brutality affect the Black community. I hope you will come into this episode with an open mind, and I also ask for your compassion as I share deeply personal and hurtful experiences.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>I invite you to view these current events through my perspective and the culmination of my experiences as a Black man in America.
