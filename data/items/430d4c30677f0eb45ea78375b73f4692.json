  "description": "<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Emanuel Hahn has never been great at asking for help. He didn’t live with his parents after age 12, and consequently, he says he learned to only rely on himself. But now that he’s launching his first book and juggling a freelance career, he knows he can’t do it all on his own. He tried our <a href=\"https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/ask_for_help_at_work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ask for Help at Work</a> practice, which challenges you to make a direct request when you need a hand from someone. <br>\n<br>\nEmanuel had to pack 800 pre-ordered books into boxes for shipping. It’s a laborious task, and he knew he couldn’t handle it all on his own. It was a Sunday, and people probably already had plans. He took a beat, and then he sent the texts out anyway. Before long, he had eight people packing books. **<br>\n**<br>\nVanessa Bohns of Cornell University has studied exactly what Emanuel experienced: When it comes to asking for help, we underestimate how likely others are to say “yes” to our request.
