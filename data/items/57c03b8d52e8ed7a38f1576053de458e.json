  "description": "On this season of Working, we left the East Coast behind and flew to Detroit. We spoke with eight people who are drawing on the city’s complex history as they work to create its future.\nFor this final episode, we visited the Mosaic Youth Theater of Detroit where DeLashea Strawder leads arts and music programs that inspire the city's young students to pursue their dreams. Strawder tells us about teaching multiplication tables with song, creating new music for original theater productions, and encouraging her students to apply performing arts skills to whatever career path they might pursue. We also listened in on her rehearsal with the Mosaic Singers, which you'll hear throughout the episode. (Stay tuned for a special recording after the credits.)\nThen in a Slate Plus Extra, Strawder shares a little about her role as a fundraiser with the organization.
