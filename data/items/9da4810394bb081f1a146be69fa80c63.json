  "description": "<p>Every time I put an ornament on my tree, I hear my mother's voice \"You're doing it wrong! You can't mix gold with silver!\" I have a radical thought about liking myself...An emailer asks if she should quit her dream of being a social worker because of a failed first gig. I discuss failure and why it's such a loaded word. Speaking of words, do we have to be ultra sensitive about what words we choose? Did the PC movement of the 90's work? This European-American has some thoughts on that...let's get our lives and get DEEEEEEEP on it. </p>\n",
