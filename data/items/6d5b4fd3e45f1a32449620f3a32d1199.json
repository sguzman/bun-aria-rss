  "description": "Civil War letters and the opposite of prejudice. A new online archive of Civil War letters offers a vivid portrait of the everyday lives of enlisted men. These soldiers lacked formal education, so they wrote and spelled \"by ear,\" and the letters show how ordinary people spoke back then. Plus, is there a single word that means \"the opposite of prejudice\"? How about \"unhate\"? Or maybe \"allophilia\"? Finally, there's an old joke that if you buy clothes at a flea market, they throw in the fleas for free. But the story behind the term \"flea market\" is a lot more complicated. Plus: go to grass, go up the spout, take the devil out of it, bobbery, and diabetes of the blow-hole.\n Listen to all episodes for free: https://waywordradio.org/   Support the show to keep episodes coming: https://waywordradio.org/donate   Your responses, questions, and comments are welcomed at any time!    https://waywordradio.org/contact   words@waywordradio.org   Listener line 1 (877) 929-9673 toll-free in the US and Canada   Text/SMS +1 (619) 567-9673   Copyright Wayword, Inc., a 501(c)(3) corporation.
