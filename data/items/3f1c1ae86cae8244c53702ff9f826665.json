  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we meet Chief Technology Officer <a href=\"https://www.qlik.com/us/company/leadership/mike-potter\">Mike Potter</a> of the business intelligence technology company, <a href=\"https://www.qlik.com/us/\">Qlik</a>. More than 50,000 companies, worldwide, depend on Qlik technology for crucial business insights. The company has more than 2,000 employees and operations in 30 countries. </p><p>“The key to being a successful leader is knowing and understanding your own strengths and limitations,” explains Mike. “Then you must surround yourself with people who not only compensate for those limitations, but challenge you to be better and then work together with them in a way that is inspiring for everyone.” </p><p>Mike shares some of the leadership lessons he’s learned throughout his career as a technical leader in large IT companies, especially the importance of learning to fail. He says, “We like to make new mistakes every day. We take risks and we treat failures as data. This means creating a culture that supports failure because if you make people afraid to take risks, you can't lead, you can't be the best in the industry, you can't do things that others aren't.”</p><p>Mike agrees that leading a multinational, global team brings its own challenges when it comes to developing a strong work culture. “We have a diverse group, and that brings its own set of dynamics. It's quite interesting seeing how the different countries approach challenges, problems, conflicts and such. We meet each other in a central approach culturally, while at the same time, honouring our local countries, where we come from and who we are.”</p><p>One thing that supports this central meeting is the team’s use of the <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/about-us#the-approach-section\">Enneagram</a> framework. It allows leaders to see their own automatic patterns of thinking and behaving and helps them become their best as a leader. </p><p>“My leadership team and I all learned how to use the Enneagram. It was an interesting exercise to put a bunch of engineers in front of a model like this, because the first thing they do is reverse engineer it!” explains Mike. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/heather-marasse\">Trilogy Effect Managing Partner Heather Marasse</a> agrees: “It's always interesting to bring the Enneagram to a highly technical team. They're rigorous both in their approach and in their thinking.  It’s reaffirming that everyone is interested in learning more about themselves and about each other. Mike’s team was completely engaged and continue to use the Enneagram as a practical tool to support their ongoing leadership development.” </p><p>Listen to the full interview to gain practical leadership tips and insights. Learn: </p><ul><li>How teams must be allowed to fail if they are going to become their best, most creative selves and do their very best work. </li><li>How supporting your team in developing self awareness and a greater understanding of each other will fuel creativity and high-performance. </li><li>Why we sometimes need to show our own vulnerabilities to become the best, most inspiring leaders and to build strong teams. </li></ul><p>Links to information about the concepts and tools discussed in the show: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/free-leadership-guidebook\">Trilogy Effect’s free leadership guidebook to be your best self as a leader.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/enneagram5\">Detached and Observant: Meet the Enneagram Type 5 Leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-leading-during-unusual-times\">Leading in Unusual Times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/trilogyeffect\">Facebook </a>| <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/trilogy-effect/?viewAsMember=true\">LinkedIn </a>| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_TrilogyEffect\">Twitter </a>| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trilogyeffectleaders/\">Instagram</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
