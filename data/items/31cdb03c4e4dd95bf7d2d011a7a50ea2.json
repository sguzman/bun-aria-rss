  "description": "Welcome to another fun episode of Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli.  This is a different kind of episode where we welcome our good friend from the SDR Show, Ralph Sutton.  We talk about growing up, our first times and never fear... we do get to conspiracies later on in the show.  This is just a real fun conservation!   We hope you enjoy the show because we had a great time recording it.  Thank you so much for all of your support.",
