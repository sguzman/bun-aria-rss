  "description": "We've touched down in Park City, Utah, for the Sundance Film Festival and we're ready to watch some movies. Sean and Amanda break down what it means to be a Sundance movie, the evolving state of the festival, and a few of the films they've already seen, including a Taylor Swift documentary and a hair-centric horror movie from the director of 'Dear White People' (1:00). Then, they share their lists of the movies they're most excited to see, from documentaries with grave international consequences to a drama based on a \"stripper saga\" Twitter thread (19:12). Finally, Sean is joined by Randy Newman to discuss his Oscar-nominated work in 'Marriage Story' and 'Toy Story 4,' his showdown at the Academy Awards with his cousin Thomas Newman, and his long career as a songwriter, composer, and bastion of wit and wisdom (41:55).\n\nHosts: Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins\nGuest: Randy Newman\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
