  "description": "<p>The Chandler, Arizona, Police Department has released some 2,500 documents from their investigation into “cult mom” Lori Vallow after the disappearance of two of her children, 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan.   Among the documents is a photo of young JJ, dated September 22, 2019. It’s unknown if it’s the last photo taken of the boy, but it was taken on the last day he was seen before investigators found his body and that of his sister buried in Chad Daybell’s backyard on June 9, 2020.   Lori Vallow and Daybell have been charged with two counts of murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of the children and Daybell’s then-wife, Tammy Daybell, who died suddenly in October 2019. Daybell has been charged with Tammy Daybell’s murder. </p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><p>Ashley Willcott - Judge and Trial Attorney, Anchor on Court TV, www.ashleywillcott.com </p><p>Dr. Shari Schwartz - Forensic Psychologist (specializing in Capital Mitigation and Victim Advocacy), www.panthermitigation.com, Twitter: https://twitter.com/TrialDoc, Author: \"Criminal Behavior\" and \"Where Law and Psychology Intersect: Issues in Legal Psychology </p><p>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Featured on \"The Piketon Massacre: Return to Pike County\" on iHeartRadio</p><p>Nate Eaton - News Director, EastIdahoNews.com Twitter: @NateNewsNow, Instagram: @n.eaton - Instagram\\</p><p>Dan Schilling - Former Lieutenant Colonel, USAF, 30-year Special Operations Veteran, Author: \"The Power of Awareness\", danschillingbooks.com, Instagram: @danobooks</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
