  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats have impeached the President of the United States and as such, they cast their votes for impeachment based on the case that they themselves made in the House. They must now defend their impeachment. The Senate is not voting on articles of impeachment, the Senate is voting on the evidence already provided by the house. Their vote to impeach was based on their investigation and evidence; this is not a trial in civil or criminal court. Republicans in the Senate have a duty to uphold the Constitution and have a trial based on the evidence already presented by the House in their articles of impeachment. Despite their majority in the House the Democrats could not convince a single republican to join them in voting for their unconstitutional articles of impeachment. Afterward, Mark delivers an opening statement to the Senate defending President Trump and responding to Adam Schiff during the opening of the impeachment trial. Finally, author Peter Schweizer callss in to discuss his new book, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
