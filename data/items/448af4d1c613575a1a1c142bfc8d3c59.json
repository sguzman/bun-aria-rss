  "description": "You’re a good parent if you drink coffee while pregnant. You’re a good parent if you don’t breastfeed. You’re a good parent if you drag your kid to soccer practice… and then let them quit the team mid-season. This week’s podcast guest, award-winning economist Emily Oster, isn’t saying these things to make you feel better. She’s got the data to back it up. Frustrated by all of the “rules” she encountered as a mom-to-be, she researched popular parenting advice and discovered just how much of it is misguided or flat-out wrong. As Dr. Becky and Emily discuss her most surprising discoveries over the years, they demonstrate the power of data to deshame our parenting choices.
