  "description": "Gregg Hurwitz is the Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author of the Orphan X series as well as writing for DC and Marvel on comics like Batman: The Dark Knight and Wolverine. He also offers a fascinating psychological angle on politics, and helps Democrat candidates across America to understand how to reach out not just to Trump voters but to the different wings of their own movement. This is a Political Party episode like no other, a timely reminder of the importance of understanding individuals, an examination the psychological elements of politics and voting as well as answering the biggest question in global politics: is Batman a Democrat or a Republican?
