  "description": "<p>The Mindblowing Healing Power Of Nature | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://paleovalley.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paleovalley</a></p><br><p>While much of our culture and society supports a sedentary lifestyle, primarily spent indoors, there is a ton of scientific evidence that shows how connecting with nature can have profound effects on our health. Just spending small amounts of time connecting with nature—even by looking at a picture or getting a house plant—not only lowers our stress levels, it can lead to better sleep, better decision making, and a range of other health benefits. And nature is not only healing for humans, it also holds the key to healing planetary health as well.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman discusses an array of ways that nature is beneficial to human health with guests Max Lugavere and Drs. David and Austin Perlmutter. He also speaks with Dr. Zach Bush about the ways he is working to create a new paradigm of health based on nature’s guidance as it relates to the challenging issues we have with glyphosate in our soils.</p><br><p>Max Lugavere is a filmmaker, health, and science journalist and the author of the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling book <em>Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life. </em>He is also the host of the #1 iTunes health podcast <em>The Genius Life</em>. Max’s sophomore book is <em>The Genius Life: Heal Your Mind, Strengthen Your Body, and Become Extraordinary</em>, a lifestyle guide to living happily and healthily with proven, research-based lifestyle tactics, which we dig into more throughout this episode.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. David Perlmutter is a Board-Certified Neurologist and four-time <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author. He serves on the Board of Directors and is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition. He serves as a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and has published extensively in peer-reviewed scientific journals including <em>Archives of Neurology</em>, <em>Neurosurgery</em>, and <em>The Journal of Applied Nutrition</em>. His books have been published in 34 languages and include the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Grain Brain, The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs and Sugar</em>, with over 1 million copies in print. Dr. Perlmutter’s book <em>Brain Wash, </em>co-written with his son Austin Perlmutter, MD, was released last year.</p><br><p>Dr. Austin Perlmutter is a board-certified internal medicine physician. He received his medical degree from the University of Miami and completed his internal medicine residency at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland Oregon. His academic focus is on understanding the decision-making process, how it is influenced by internal and external factors, and how it changes our health and illness outcomes. He is also interested in methods of improving burnout and poor mental health in the medical field. He writes for <em>Psychology Today</em> on his blog, <em>The Modern Brain</em>.</p><br><p>Dr. Zach Bush is a physician specializing in internal medicine, endocrinology, and hospice care. He is an internationally recognized educator and thought leader on the microbiome as it relates to health, disease, and food systems. Dr. Zach founded Seraphic Group and the non-profit Farmer’s Footprint to develop root-cause solutions for human and ecological health. His passion for education reaches across many disciplines, including topics such as the role of soil and water ecosystems in human genomics, immunity, and gut-brain health. His education has highlighted the need for a radical departure from chemical farming and pharmacy, and his ongoing efforts are providing a path for consumers, farmers, and mega-industries to work together for a healthy future for people and the planet.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
