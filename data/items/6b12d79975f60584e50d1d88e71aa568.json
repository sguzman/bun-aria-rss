  "description": "<p>“And so, then I thought, <em>Who do I most admire</em>? <em>Who taught me the most, and also, they're doing it for completely selfless reasons, right? </em>And I thought, <em>Oh, that moment and the parking lot</em>. So, I thought, I'm going to start a book in the parking lot of a McDonald's dumpster in a dying town and show you how, in the most unlikely places, magic is happening.” Beth Macy’s 2018 bestseller <em>Dopesick</em> and the Emmy-nominated Hulu streamer it inspired have helped changed our national conversation about Opioids and addiction. Her new book, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/raising-lazarus-beth-macy/1140677088?ean=9780316430227\"><em>Raising Lazarus</em></a>, takes a new approach to our ever-growing crisis, focusing on solutions and the people bringing those solutions to our communities. Beth joins us on the show to talk about harm reduction, meeting people where they are, organizing at a local level, the lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and the behavior of the Sackler family, activism, and more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.
