  "description": "<p>Jessica writes \"I wanted to write to you because my fiancée and I have had a few eerie encounters in our travels through New Mexico and during my time being stationed in South Carolina. I'm now former Air Force, recently separated. I will state that I have never been exposed to anything abnormal or out of the ordinary in my time growing up in California.\"</p> <p>---</p> <p>Todd writes \"Early summer of 1983 I was in love. I took a romantic moonlit walk with my girlfriend on the 17th green. We sat down at 1:00 AM and started to talk. That lasted maybe 2 minutes when we were interrupted by an angry animal in a big oak tree behind us just 25 yards.</p> <p>Whatever it was it shook that big tree side to side as if was jumping all inside of it, I heard it grunting and short yells like a gorilla and it really screamed like an African lion and a silverback gorilla at the same time.</p> <p>I was really scared and yet I was calm at the same time, I knew we had to get back to the clubhouse and get into my car 400 plus yards NE. The moon lit the way and the dense fog near the ponds along the way were eerie as the landscape was a downward slope and a straight shot to the road.</p> <p>I stood up and told my girlfriend to grab my hand and never let go,I knew we could die at any moment and I wasn’t sticking around to find out.</p> <p>That thing was still shaking that tree and I said softly, run, as we ran 100 ft or so I heard a sickening thud. I mean it was like a something really big hit that grass. I knew that thing was coming after us. I glanced over my shoulder, omg it was tall and wide in the shoulders, it darted towards our way and I noticed it slammed it’s the long arm on the ground and grunted like a bear, it was no bear.</p> <p>I think it had red eyes I can’t exactly be sure because I had recurring nightmares long after this happened. I was skinny and ran long distance at school, she was a little heavier and she had no problem keeping up. All I could hear from her and I was fast breathing as the tears rolled down our faces from sheer fear.</p> <p>I distinctly heard to thing forging behind us and not giving up, thank Thank God we didn’t trip and fall. The clubhouse was getting closer we went along the left side and ran across the street into the parking lot I had a four on the floor, Ford Bobcat Pinto and the hatchback was all glass and I had a sunroof in which Kathy was slamming her hands down on it screaming it’s coming hurry open the door. I manage to get my key in the door and opened it and started the car and opened her door, by the time I shifted into first gear and popped the clutch as fast as I could she was already in and I glance out my drivers window and saw this massive hairy dark thing race along the clubhouse and on-road to get us and it yelled that God awful yell again and I could see it was really mad..I raced along Skyline Drive towards Duluth Heights and we both didn’t speak until we went to Mc Donalds and got a coke and sat in a booth staring at each other in shock.. we both pissed ourselves. we were shaking and thankful we were alive.\"</p>",
