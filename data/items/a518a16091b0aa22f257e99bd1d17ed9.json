  "description": "<p>Shannon is riding solo this week to tell you all about her and AG’s Stagecoach shenanigans. Are you out here farting on planes? We really need to have a talk. Did someone ask for a Bridgerton update? Either way, here it is. Shannon is personally declaring her neighborhood a “No Blow Zone” (iykyk). From an almost missed flight to getting dicked down in the desert, hear about how it all went down in season 2 episode 7 of Probably a Podcast. </p>",
