  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Joe Biden is addressing the nation because coronavirus deaths are reported to have surpassed the half-million mark. A virus from communist China that's unleashed in America was not our choice, but for many Democrats, abortion is their choice. Donald Trump has consequently been one of the strongest pro-life presidents in history. Biden is celebrating a 100 million vaccine milestone based on Trump's Operation Warp Speed success. Biden only cares about his legacy; he wants to be more radical than FDR and Obama with his massive spending and overreaching executive orders. Then, the US Supreme Court refused to intervene in several cases today; the Pennsylvania election lawsuit and a question on whether the government can access a former president's taxes. Justices Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, and Neil Gorsuch are the only members of the Court that have upheld the Constitution. Later, the Democrats are trying to steal this country; change the citizenry and voting base by opening the borders, they'll do anything for power. Democrats want a one-party country just like they created a one-party state in California. That's why they've filled the latest coronavirus bill with all sorts of pork from student loan debt relief to public health surveillance.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
