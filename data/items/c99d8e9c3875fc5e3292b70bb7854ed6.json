  "title": "The Plight of the Delivery Worker",
  "description": "In the last few years and particularly during the pandemic, New York City’s delivery workers have become a key part of the food industry’s infrastructure, allowing restaurants to do business with customers too stressed to leave their desks or too afraid of catching a dangerous virus to show up themselves. But a growing incidence of violent attacks and bike thefts has laid bare just how vulnerable the people who bring you your takeout are. Why is it that such essential workers have been exploited by the apps that rely on them, abandoned by the police and the city, and forced to band together just to get by?\n\nGuest: Josh Dzieza, an investigations editor and feature writer at The Verge covering technology, business, and climate change.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
