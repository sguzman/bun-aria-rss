How much does our gut influence our mind? How important is our gut to our health? Why are we spending trillions on healthcare only for many of us to get sicker? Are our genes our destiny? </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international leader in industry disruption and founder of groundbreaking companies such as Viome and Moon Express, today’s guest</span> <strong>Naveen Jain</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has built his career on thinking big, with years of experience applying exponential thinking to a variety of industries, including the healthcare industry. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our gut is one of the most crucial determinants of our health. If something goes wrong in the gut, it can affect our thinking, decision-making, and risk of disease. Modern living and new chemicals are penetrating our gut lining, meaning that our body is dealing with foreign bodies never before seen—and this is resulting in heightened rates of inflammation and illness despite our ever-rising rates of investment in healthcare. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today’s conversation, we talk about why you should trust your gut, explain how much control our gut has over our bodies, and explain why genes are not our destiny.
