  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the country is crumbling because the neo-Marxists and statists have been relentlessly attacking our Constitutional system for over a decade. The vast majority of Republicans in Congress are affixing their seal of approval to this lawlessness. Surrender is not an option; we have future generations of our families and men and women in uniform that are counting on America. The media, the democrats, and establishment Republicans want every American to roll over and accept this. Each American must reject this new 'squad' of radicals and become their own Paul Revere. Then, the framers rejected the judiciary having a role in the selection of the President of the United States and precisely opted for what they outlined in Article II, Section I granting all authority over the selection of the electors for the President to each state's legislature. This was done specifically to prevent state executive or the courts from being involved in the selection of the electors for the presidency. Later, the lawyers representing the Republicans in the Pennsylvania state legislature are the same lawyers representing Mitch McConnell via the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The national Republican establishment is diabolical and wants all GOP votes but not the voters' input. This is one very deep swamp. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
