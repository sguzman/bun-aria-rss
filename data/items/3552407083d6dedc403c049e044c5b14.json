  "description": "<p>John Dennehy came over to talk to me about Ecuador. Specifically about the 2005 People's Revolution that toppled their government. John was there for all of it. He even helped set up road blocks during the protests. Really interesting stuff that seems kind of extra relevant this week, huh?</p> <p>He also told me hella stuff about Ecuador. From the food, to the roads, to the customs, to the crazy obsession with 2 dollar bills. It was a crash course in a country that I desperately needed a crash course on. It's useful and interesting stuff about an amazing paisa. </p> <p>John wrote a book that I just finished reading called \"Illegal.\" It's about being deported, about illegally crossing back over that border again and again, about love, about my balls, about standing up for what you believe in, and it's about following your heart. There's a ton of ideology hidden inside the plot that had me thinking about stuff all week after reading what he wrote. </p> <p>Pick up \"Illegal\" by John Dennehy at <a href= \"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35894887-illegal\">Good Reads</a> or at <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0999185209/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sout?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb_sout-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0999185209&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2\"> Amazon</a>.
