  "description": "<p>Restricted secant varieties of Grassmannians are constructed from sums of\npoints corresponding to $k$-planes with the restriction that their intersection\nhas a prescribed dimension. We study dimensions of restricted secant of\nGrassmannians and relate them to the analogous question for secants of\nGrassmannians via an incidence variety construction. We define a notion of\nexpected dimension and give a formula for the dimension of all restricted\nsecant varieties of Grassmannians that holds if the Baur-Draisma-deGraaf\nConjecture on non-defectivity of Grassmannians is true. We also demonstrate\nexample calculations in Macaulay2, and point out ways to make these\ncalculations more efficient. We also show a potential application to coding\ntheory.\n</p>",
