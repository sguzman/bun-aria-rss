  "description": "<p>Andrew Yang is a former Presidential and Mayoral candidate, entrepreneur, and founder of the new Forward Party. Seeking ways to push our democracy into the future, Andrew has championed novel ideas to improve the deep intrinsic problems of the current two-party system.</p> <p>We see aligned interests between the Forward Party and the crypto community, and Andrew says during the episode that the Forward party IS the Crypto party. Re-establishing legitimacy to our institutions, evolving our governance system, and upgrading our economic protocols are shared interests of Andrew Yang and the Bankless Nation. We are stoked to have Andrew on the podcast, so dive in for a fascinating discussion of what's wrong with our current system and what we can do to fix it.</p> <p>✨ EPISODE DEBRIEF ✨<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-forward-with-crypto\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/exclusive-debrief-forward-with-crypto</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 POOLTOGETHER | DEFI LOTTERY<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether\">https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether</a> <br />  ------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGGREGATOR<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE YOUR ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a> </p> <p>🧙‍♀️ ALCHEMIX | SELF-PAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">http://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a> </p> <p>------</p> <p>Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 8:00 Andrew Yang & Crypto<br /> 13:20 American Democracy<br /> 17:38 A Third Path<br /> 24:51 Banking is Broken<br /> 30:19 Big Tech<br /> 34:45 Open Primaries<br /> 43:47 A More Intelligent System<br /> 51:00 Crypto UBI<br /> 57:57 Crypto and the Forward Party<br /> 1:04:19 Lobbying & Stigma<br /> 1:10:27 Clarity and Platforms<br /> 1:15:01 The Forward DAO<br /> 1:22:00 andrewyang.eth<br /> 1:24:57 Optimism about the 2020s</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Andrew Yang on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/AndrewYang?s=20\">https://twitter.com/AndrewYang?s=20</a> </p> <p>Andrew's Book 'Forward'<br /> <a href= \"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667341/forward-by-andrew-yang/\"> https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667341/forward-by-andrew-yang/</a> </p> <p>Forward Party on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Fwd_Party?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Fwd_Party?s=20</a> </p> <p>Welcome to Bankless:<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-welcome-to-bankless-2021-edition\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-welcome-to-bankless-2021-edition</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
