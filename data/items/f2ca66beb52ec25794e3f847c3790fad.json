  "description": "<p>Timestamps below! Brandy Howard (@TheBrandyHoward) and Julie Goldman (@MrJulieGoldman) from The People’s Couch and the Vanderpump Rules Aftershow are here to talk some smack. We recorded in Ronnie’s apartment huddled around a mic on gardening day, so there are (fittingly) leaf blowers and Bueller barks galore. We laughed our asses off drinking Skinny Girl cocktails, and hope you do, too.</p>\n<p>Timestamps: 0-1:25:55 We talk to Brandy and Julie about their journey to People’s Couch and the Vanderpump Rules Aftershow. Of course, a lot of other nonsense as well. Interspersed are thoughts about the VPR Uncensored Special and Reunion Part One.
