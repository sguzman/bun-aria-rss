  "description": "Welcoming a child into your family can be life changing, but for those struggling to get pregnant the process can be emotionally taxing and expensive. Reproductive science is quickly changing, as is society’s approach to the issues around fertility. In this episode, we bring you a conversation from the WSJ Future of Everything Festival, where a handful of medical practitioners and reproductive entrepreneurs discussed the future of fertility with WSJ’s Amy Dockser Marcus. Guests include: sociologist Rene Almeling, Stephen Krawetz, the Associate Director of the CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Daisy Robinton, the CEO of Oviva Therapeutics and Angela Stepancic, the founder of Reproductive Village Cryobank. This conversation was recorded before the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nUseful Links: \n\nSee more videos from The WSJ Future of Everything Festival  \n\nGUYnecology: The Missing Science of Men’s Reproductive Health \n\nKrawetz Lab at the C.S.
