  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Christian’s finally back! The podcast trio give updates on their recent travels and projects. Phil’s making a new VeggieTales show, Christian’s making a WWII documentary, and Skye missed his ship and ate a frog. They also discuss new research that says cultivating awe makes us into better people. So why does modern Christianity work so hard to make God understandable and the world controllable? Then Skye interviews journalist Julie Roys about her reporting that led to James McDonald’s firing from Harvest Bible Chapel, and the broader challenges facing an evangelicalism driven by money, celebrity, and poor accountability. And are online whistleblowers really helping, or are they becoming a new expression of the same problem—powerful voices with no accountability?</p>",
