  "description": "Modern romance is broken. It's time to flip the script.\nApps have transformed dating from a mysterious adventure into a daily chore. Young, single, college-educated women are sick and tired of competing for a shrinking supply of guys. And marriage-material men, long expected to take the lead when it comes to asking women out, are suddenly balking at making the first move, fearing they'll come across as creepy or inappropriate.\nSociety is changing, which means it's time for dating to evolve. Millennial and Gen Z women are more than capable of seeking out what—and who—they want. They're standouts in the classroom and champions on the playing fields. They're leaders in the workplace and trailblazers in city halls, state houses, and Congress. So why would we tell a generation of badass women that they're not allowed to be bold when it comes to finding love? Why should they have to sit back and wait (and wait and wait) for men to find them?\nIn Make Your Move: The New Science of Dating and Why Women Are in Charge (BenBella Books, 2021) Jon Birger, author of Date-onomics, offers women bold new strategies for finding the one. Backed by research showing that women can win at romance by making the first move with the men of their choice, Birger explains why:\nIt's better to choose than to be chosenThe \"play hard to get\" method is not only outdated but grounded in bad science\nThe first move does not have to be a big move\nIt's time to log off of dating apps and date men you actually know\nThe workplace can be a terrific place to meet a long-term romantic partner\n. . . and more!\nMake Your Move is an honest, solution-based guide to finding love that lasts. If you're tired of playing by old rules, look no further: Make your move and win.\nJon Birger is an award-winning magazine writer and author of two dating books -- Make Your Move: The New Science of Dating and Why Women Are in Charge (2021) and Date-onomics: How Dating Became a Lopsided Numbers Game (2015).
