Annie tells us why she recites the Apostles’ Creed while making tea in the morning, and we learn that spiritual practices and the Body of Christ cannot exist independently from one another. Together, we can let ourselves be beginners, invite each other into the process, and pursue spiritual practices “imperfectly and with conviction.” </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 2 of the She Reads Truth Faith in Practice reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/faith-in-practice-a-biblical-study-of-spiritual-disciplines/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Faith in Practice collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/faith-in-practice-week-2-with-annie-f-downs/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/faith-in-practice-week-2-with-annie-f-downs/</b></a></p>",
