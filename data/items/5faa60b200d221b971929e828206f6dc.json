  "title": "PMS 2.0 477 - Training Camp Fights, Ian Rapoport, Wale, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat calls in from the desert to chat with the boys about all the different training camp fights that have been happening and how that's just how training camp is, Rob Demovsky's question from Aaron Rodgers press conference yesterday and the Packers unveiling new throwback uniforms, and video of Tom Brady coming out talking about Ryan Tannehill and whether or not he was that MFer. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk to do a training camp wrap up is NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport. Rapsheet chats about the joint practice between the Titans the Buccaneers, and the breaking news that Jets free agent acquisition Carl Lawson may have torn his achilles at a joint practice with the Packers today, what is going to happen with the Deshaun Watson situation before the season starts in 21 days, and who Rapsheet thinks will get the majority of the snaps at Quarterback for the Patriots in tonight's game between the Pats and Eagles (40:07-1:05:32). Next, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is a man who has a ridiculous number of bangers under his belt, a legend in the rap game, Wale. Pat, AJ, and Wale chat about his creative process and how it has changed over the course of his career, his love for the Washington Football Team, his football career at Robert Morris, potentially being Pat's manager for a WWE run, what's next for him, and much more (1:05:34-1:16:47). And later, Pat and AJ chat about joint practices at NFL training camps, Tom Brady's comments about Ryan Tannehill, and everything else happening around the league (1:20:18-1:43:43).
