Today we wrap up our series ‘Light’ on understanding evangelism, a play on ‘<em><strong>This Little Light of Mine</strong></em>…’&nbsp;What does a cruciform life actually mean and look like? What does it mean to take up your cross? What does it mean to come down from your cross? How have we distorted the scripture on ‘Speaking Truth in Love?’ What is the full context of that chapter and book? As we see the message of the gospel; as we come to understand good and bad krinó (judgment); as we come to realize what a cruciform life looks like as a community, how do these all reform our understanding of evangelism?? How do they change our view of Sunday morning??</p>\n<p>We also respond to a few emails pushing back on our criticism of Jordan Peterson and his video on masculinity.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
