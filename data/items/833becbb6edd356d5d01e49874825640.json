  "description": "<p><em><strong>Uvalde, the SBC & Prayers of the People</strong></em>. Mike and Tim are joined by Executive Pastor and Elder of Journey Church <strong>Suzie Lind</strong> to discuss the events of the past week, including the sexual abuse report from the Southern Baptist Convention and the mass shooting in Uvalde Texas. It is a very raw conversation as everyone tries to sort out postures and directions forward. At the end of the conversation, Suzie, Mike and Tim engage in another 'Prayers of the People.'&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lord, we pray for the people and children who have been subjugated and abused by institutions or those in power, but specifically within your church. Lord that you would bring healing and peace and freedom to those who have been hurt and who have been hiding or have been made to feel shameful by their abusers. Father, we pray that there would be Justice and a complete dismantling of the church that hides and protects those that prey on others, that marginalizes and exerts power over. Lord have mercy.</p>\n<p>Father God, we pray for the families of Uziyah Garcia, Jose Flores, Amerie Jo Garza, Xavier Javier Lopez, Nevaeh Bravo, Alithia Ramirez, Tess Marie Mata, Alexandria Aniya Rubio, Layla Salazar, Makenna Lee Elrod, Jayce Luevanos, Jailah Nicole Silguero, Eliana “Ellie” Garcia, Eliahana Cruz Torres, Annabell Guadalupe Rodriguez, Jacklyn “Jackie” Cazares, Maite Yuleana Rodriguez, Rogelio Torres, Miranda Matthis, Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia. Lord, that you would hear their cries; That you would bring mercy; That you would sit with them; That others would walk in grief with them. Lord we pray that American hearts would be empathetic and would bring about the change necessary to keep our babies safe, to keep our neighbors safe, to keep our elderly safe. God, show us how to be peacemakers and not just peace keepers.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
