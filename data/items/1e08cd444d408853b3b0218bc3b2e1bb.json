  "description": "In Episode 81 I sit down with Dr Will Bulsiewicz for Part 2 of the \"Your Gut Health Questions\" conversation that Will and I had while in New York. All of the topics that Dr B and I discuss were suggestions from the Plant Proof community - so firstly, thank you for contributing to this conversation by sending through such important questions.\n\nFor those of you who are regular listeners you will have probably tuned into previous episodes (17, 71 & 80 ) with Dr B and therefore already know how much of a wealth of knowledge he is. Dr B is a Board Certified Gastroenterologist, having done over 16 years of medical training to become an expert in all things gut health. This is why he is perfectly positioned to help us navigate tricky gut health questions and clear up some of the confusion that exists on the internet.\n\nIn this episode we cover a lot of really interesting gut health topics (below). What's great about this episode, and all episodes with Dr B, is that throughout the conversation he refers to the clinical science to provide evidence for his recommendations:\n\n\nThe Ketogenic diet, including a vegan Keto Diet, and it's likely affect on the gut\n\nDairy, probiotics, prebiotics (lactose) & gut health\n\nConsuming whey protein with caution\n\nInterpreting science & understanding points of relativity\n\n\nIBs and fasting\n\nProlonged juice or water fasting\n\nProbiotics and gut health\n\nBloating - what's normal and what does it mean?\n\nBreakfast & gut health\n\nHow long before going to bed should your last meal be?\n\nSmoothies &/or juices for children\n\nBreastfeeding, infant gut health including the role of human oligosaccharides\n\nDonor milk & infant formula\n\nAntibiotics and gut health - how to minimise their damage?\n\nShould we avoid gluten?\n\nWhat are dangers of eliminating gluten if you are not intolerant?\n\nWheat sensitivity vs gluten sensitivity - have we over diagnosed gluten intolerance?\n\nShould we be scared of phytate's & anti-nutrients\n\nBenefits of soaking oats\n\nAlcohol and the microbiome\n\nand much more\n\n\nHope you enjoy the episode friends. If you have any comments or questions, Dr B (@theguthealthmd) and myself (@plant_proof) would love to hear from you.\n\n\nAll episodes with Dr Will Bulsiewicz\n\nEpisode 17 - Building a health gut\nEpisode 70 - Ex Vegans & their Gut Health issues\nEpisode 80 - Part 1 of our Gut Health Q & A\nEpisode 81 - Part 2 of our Gut Health Q & A\nEpisode 102 - A Healthy Gut is Fiber Fueled\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
