  "description": "<p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 1:</p><p>We're all being tested in 2020 -- but we are Americans. Americans deal with what challenges and overcomes them. Dems switch like a tsunami to blame burning of their own cities on Trump. It won't work. Rush spent time in hospital last week, thanks Kathryn, audience for support. Democrats are fomenting a race war. Trump's RNC did not respond with hate, but love and diversity at convention -- it was uplifting. DNC platform repeatedly and derisively references white people. Dems trying to goad Trump, putting their agenda on display every day in Democrat-run cities. They're destroying themselves, thinking they're destroying Trump because they still don't know who he really is. DC Circuit Court of Appeals rules against Flynn, allows Judge Sullivan to hold another hearing. Reasons Rush knows Democrat internal polling changed: Hillary tells Biden never to concede election, Pelosi urges Biden not to debate, Don Lemon says focus group data tells Dems to stop riots, DNC speakers begged Democrats to vote. Betting odds swing toward Trump. Best way for us to beat Democrat fraud is to flood polling places on Election Day. Kenosha rioters came from out-of-state, rent-a-mob sent in by Democrats.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Jonathan Chait tweet on decline of BLM support in Wisconsin. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization and they say so, but many of the professional athletes embracing BLM don't know that. Trump took 70 minutes in acceptance speech to refute the lies told about him. The lions of the GOP who we supported and defended were nowhere to be found at RNC. Willie Brown warns Democrats to stop calling riots peaceful protests. Media nervous about improving COVID-19 situation. Hypocrisy of media calling Trump RNC a \"super spreader event,\" but no such concerns when the mob attacking people leaving it, BLM and Antifa demonstrations. Democrats have been rioting since election night 2016. Chris Murphy: Trump's plan is to kill people, Portland Mayor blames Trump, Klobuchar says we're not safe in Donald Trump's America, Biden spokesbabe: Trump has tried to incite violence. Trump gains with black voters. Biden gives speech from inside a cage in Pittsburgh, filled with lies, blames Trump for all kinds of things he has not done.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 3:</p><p>Tired and worn-out Biden says Trump will take away your Social Security. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll blasts America, says slavery has never ended, white people have to learn history. Bucs coach Bruce Arians says \"protesting doesn't do crap.\" NFL end zones will have social justice messages, coaches and players allowed to wear social justice patches with name of black victims. Each week will celebrate black victims. Players will be allowed to wear victims’ names on helmets. Plugs underperforming Hillary in battleground state polling. Politico panic story on COVID-19 cases dropping. Biden pledges to shut down country if scientists tell him to do it. CDC: 94% of recorded COVID-19 deaths include other serious illnesses, advanced age. Only 9,210 Americans have died of COVID-19 alone. Was it worth murdering a $22 trillion economy for that?
