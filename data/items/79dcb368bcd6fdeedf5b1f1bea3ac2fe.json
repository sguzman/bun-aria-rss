  "description": "Mabel Moraña's book Philosophy and Criticism in Latin America: From Mariátegui to Sloterdijk (Cambria Press, 2020) explores the complex relationships between the fields of philosophy and criticism, focusing on methodological, ideological and cultural aspects in which European canonical reflection connects, in many cases conflictively, with Latin American thought. Philosophy and criticism analyzes aspects of the work of influential modern thinkers (Benjamin, Foucault, Bourdieu, Sloterdijk) vis a vis the proposals of representative authors of Latin American philosophy (Mariátegui, Dussel, Bartra, Echeverría), trying to discover convergences and challenges between both slopes. Likewise, this volume focuses on crucial issues of our time: the crisis of humanism, the strategies of biopolitics, the problems of scarcity, violence, the critique of modernity, the world of affections, and the challenges of globalization. The marked profile of Latin American thought is thus imprinting its brand in current debates, revealing the thriving force of intellectual currents that resist epistemic domination in search of renewed forms of collective emancipation.\nDaniela Gutierrez Flores is a PhD candidate in Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Studies at the University of Chicago Romance Languages and Literatures department.
