  "description": "<p>OUR THOUGHTS ARE DREAM KILLERS. The bigger the dream, the more fear you’re going to have. But to grow, you have to take on new challenges. It’s a real catch-22. I’m very curious about fear and self-doubt. In fact, I’m writing a book about it. In this new year, I want to challenge you to change the way you think about the things that scare you. I want you to start embracing difficult situations and stop letting yourself get in your way. Once you do, nothing will stop you. So how can we harness our thoughts so they start to work for us and not against us? On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I’m re-sharing a previous episode about facing fears with the creator of the “Five Second Rule:” Mel Robbins. Mel Robbins is the most booked female speaker on the planet with a 7 figure speaking business. Oh yeah, she’s also a bestselling author, a former criminal defense attorney, a CNN commentator, happily married for 20 years, and a mom of 3 kids. But what I really fell in love with about Mel was her passion, energy, straight-talking truth, and beautiful vulnerability. I’m pumped to re-share Mel’s incredible wisdom about how she overcame procrastination, fear, and low self-confidence after a devastating career blow and financial hardship. Get ready to laugh, cry, and learn how to master your thoughts to create extraordinary results on Episode 887.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nOnce you mastered your thoughts, did you have no more fear? (13:30)<br />\nWhen did you discover the 5 Second Rule? (16:34)<br />\nWhat area of your life has the 5 Second Rule had the biggest impact?
