  "description": "Today, I am talking with my dear friend, Ray Montalvo. We've known each other for many years, and we have been having a continued conversation about something that we both really enjoy and like to make beautiful in our lives: plants. On Thursdays, I will be doing a bonus episode where my friends and I will discuss about some of our own personal discoveries and opinions on beauty, health and wellness. And I also want to hear from you. Share some of your aha moments on beauty, health and wellness, and have a discussion. If you're on Apple podcasts, write your aha moment in the comment section. Or you can email me at beautyuncovered@olaplex.com. And maybe you could be chosen to come on our Thursday discussion panel.",
