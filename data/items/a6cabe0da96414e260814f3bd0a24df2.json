  "description": "We are long overdue for our conversation with the amazing architect Roger Seifter. He’s a partner at the renowned firm Robert A.M Stern Architects (RAMSA) and has designed houses all over the world including in the US, UK, India, and Canada. His work has been featured in Architectural Digest, House & Garden, The New York Times, Lux, and many more. He recently co-authored the book HOUSES with his colleagues featuring projects and the design work from the firm. We talk all about his processes, projects in the book, adapting to different architectural styles, and more!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nAll about the process of writing HOUSES and the projects in the book.\n\nDetails about the incredible Las Olas project featured in the book.\n\nRoger’s advice about designing or landscaping when you can’t build from scratch.\n\nWhat is Roger’s process in building and designing a house?\n\nHow much input does a client have in a project?\n\nHow ornamentation is used in Mediterranean architecture.\n\nWhy a geographic location often dictates the architectural style of a building.\n\nWhat’s the best way for a person to learn about architectural styles?\n\nIs there such a thing as too much in terms of texture, ornament, patterns, etc., and how do you decide when and where to use it?\n\nHow to work with a boxy house.\n\nMore about Roger’s personal home in New Jersey he designed with his wife — a fellow architect.\n\nDetails on the Kiawah project that RAMSA worked on.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Amanda,\nThe easiest answer is DO NOT put a glass top table in the dining room; I would put a nice wood table. There’s enough beautiful tile that we don’t need to see through it, but you could do with some leggy chairs. Regarding the fireplace; it’s beautiful but it’s tiny, so it would be odd to focus the furniture around the fireplace. Your instinct to mount the TV in the built-ins is the way to go and then position the furniture in a way that you can actually sit in it to watch. I would put the sofa across the room with the two chairs opposite it and then some pull-up chairs by the fireplace. In terms of types and colors of furniture, I would keep the upholstery simple and soft in a neutral, lighter color. Then use pillows that pick up the colors from the tile. Just remember not to pick oversized furniture that will overpower the floors. If you decide to go without a rug, you’ll be relying on your furniture and window coverings to balance the sound, so maybe steer towards lush, skirted upholstery and ample, soft curtains. A bonus with skirted chairs is you can have them on swivels to access both the TV and the fireplace!\nThis is an amazing space and we can’t wait to see it finished. These floors are so unique and such a treat to see! Please send us the after photos.\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nRoger Seifter\nRAMSA: Robert A.M.
