  "description": "<p>You guys like when we deep dive into absolute nonsense right? … perfect!</p><p>Rory & Mal start with discussing thank you tracks/interludes in hip-hop, eventually ending up in a conversation about their respective weekends, where they both attended the Teyana Taylor ‘Last Rose Petal’ farewell tour… but on separate nights. NYC was lit this weekend between the tour and the Soul Train Awards being filmed at the Apollo, so of course the guys discuss this, as well as the AMA’s. We’re going into Thanksgiving, and the guys discuss plans, and family, and how Lebron’s dad is probably regretting walking out on him. Mal wants to find out who is really getting it out of the ‘’mud” … as well as where all the imaginary haters and opps are. Rory got ran down on at the Donda show, and Mal gives him an apology. Baisley’s Only Fans, street harassment, and more get brought up.</p>\n",
