  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane is on a cancellation spree and everything must go until we're in a world with shitty, mundane entertainment. Kirk addresses the attacks on Barstool Sports and Barstool's response. Coronavirus is starting to return with a vengeance and no one wants to talk about those huge protests a few weeks ago. Things aren't looking good for President Trump's re-election effort. Steve went to Maine and makes the case for the best sandwich shop in the state. Kirk memorializes the late Carl Reiner. The Kirk Minihane Show returns to our Watertown studios in less than one week.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
