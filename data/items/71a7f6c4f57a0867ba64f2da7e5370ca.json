  "description": "<p>We&rsquo;re talking today about how to avoid screwing up your kid&rsquo;s relationship with money. As parents, our job is to raise amazing adults to one day replace us! And even if you don&rsquo;t currently have kids, or maybe you know that you never will- today&rsquo;s conversation will do a great job shedding some light on why you think and feel the way you do about your personal finances.

We talk about parenting styles, the increasing trend of boomerang college students, ways that we can strategically help our kids with money, and personal finance conversations between parents and adult children as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Farm Friends by New Image Brewing!
