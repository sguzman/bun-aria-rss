  "description": "The story of William Tell is so much more than an arrow and an apple. It's the story of a reluctant hero, a tyrannical ruler, and why you shouldn't let your prisoners drive the vehicle you're using to take them to prison. The creature this week is the cockatrice, and if you see a frog keeping eggs warm, that is just a completely normal and ok thing that won't end up destroying you and everyone you love. Sponsors: Casper is the most comfortable mattress I've ever used. I did the math - you spend a quarter million hours on your mattress over your life, you should be comfortable.
