  "description": "<p>Friday 8/11 – Today on the show we had the classic group, that made all the girls who are 20 and up now, all excited at one point, “Pretty Ricky!! Why not for freaky freaky Friday. The group spoke about why they got back together, how they grown and of course about what they stood for, pleasuring the ladies. Moreover, Charlamagne gave “Donkey of the Day” to CNN commentator, Jeffrey Lord; well not anymore after they fired him after he tweeted the Nazi salutation “Sieg Heil!” in response to a feud with a liberal activist. Also, we opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners ate after sex for our freaky Friday topic. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
