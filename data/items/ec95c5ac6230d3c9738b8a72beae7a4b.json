  "description": "Manscaping is perhaps the most underrated beauty ritual. No Shave November is coming to a close, gentleman. While women are told over and over again to have hairless bodies, most men traipse around like hairy beasts.A man might say his hair makes him masculine and rugged. Don’t get me wrong, I want to pet Jon Hamm’s chest hair all night, but a lot of women aren’t into hairy balls.I’m not saying you should shave yourself bare or shave an arrow leading to your penis (please don’t), but I recommend spending time taming the mane and manscaping.In the show I interview Anthony Sosnick,Founder and CEO of Anthony Brands, on the best manscaping techniques, from trimming to shaving. Also, what horrible thoughts do men think of to prevent premature ejaculation? Also, will letting a woman paint your toenails help you get lucky?
