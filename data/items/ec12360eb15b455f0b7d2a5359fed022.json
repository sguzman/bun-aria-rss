  "description": "Today I talked to Eddie Chau about his new book Random Imaginations: A Collection of Illustrated Musings (ORO Editions, 2018). The book is a reproduction of thousands of graphic images from a single sketchbook, drawn over the course of 27 years. As a way to challenge the approach of drawing what is in front of the artist, these freehand drawings are a collection of images from imagination and memory. What started as an exercise to break out of a design block, these images began on a single sheet and then became a visual journey and exploration of landscapes, everyday items, architecture, abstracts, and compositions. Like the original sketchbook, Random Imaginations is a visual catalog of countless subjects and visions, to be used as discovery, inspiration, or just casual viewing.\nEddie Chau is the owner and Landscape Architect of ECLA Studio in San Francisco, CA. In addition to being a practicing landscape architect, he has taught at U.C. Davis and U.C. Berkeley Extension, where he is the Program Director of the Landscape Architecture Program. He also draws and paints and is a big fan of the University of California Golden Bears.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
