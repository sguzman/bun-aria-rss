  "description": "This week's episode is all about a certain even-complexioned, old-fashioned dreamboat of a Thirst Object, Boris Kodjoe! Half German, half Ghanaian, and all American, Mr K is a tall drink of water we have been quietly thirsting after for more than a decade, bless him. Boris Kodjoe has the longevity and (thirst) range. So we went deep on how his strong eyebrows, deep voice, and clean musculature wins us — and actors such as Sanaa Lathan, Nicole Ari Parker and Gugu Mbatha-Raw —over every single time. Plus, Fanfic Wars, in which Boris does... things for us. ::eyes emoji:: And finally, you can speak your thirst with your whole chest – TAK has merch!\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush?
