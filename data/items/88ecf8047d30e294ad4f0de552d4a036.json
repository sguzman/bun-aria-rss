  "description": "<p>The Hags are on an eight hour time difference from each other LA and Scotland. Indecision descends as Kate chooses her birthday treat at Sephora. Negative visualization and Stoicism are experienced via an app. Listeners may note: Jacqueline references her own metaphor from a previous episode, lake full of fish, and Kate does not recall it. Jacqueline wonders what makes a product purple, Kate finds the answer, says it twice, and Jacqueline does not hear her. Mirroring language back to the others. We can handle colorless product. </p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>This episode was edited and engineered by C.
