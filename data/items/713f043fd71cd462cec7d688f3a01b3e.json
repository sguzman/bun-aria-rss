This led to a discussion about how we make decisions and how we judge success. What would have happened if we hadn’t done this together?

How do we even judge success, given that we never set a target in the first place?<br>\n<br>\nAlice suggests that one way to decide anything is to ask ‘does it feel fun?’ Louise suggests that there has to be some kind of reward to keep you going - and sometimes the reward is simply the enjoyment of the process.<br>\n<br>\nWe both agree that (a) your decisions should be guided by what feels good (b) the rewards have to be internal (external validation is less important) and (c) that we shouldn't look for results too quickly; everything takes time to build.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we also take a detour into our school days via Alice’s school reports and answer a question from a listener about selling styles - when are we helping people decide and when are we just being pushy?</p>\n<p><br>\nMentioned:<br>\n<br>\nCowshed Collective &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cowshedcollective/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/cowshedcollective/</a></p>\n<p>Tracey Ross Art <a href=\"https://tracey-rossart.co.uk/\">https://tracey-rossart.co.uk/</a><br>\n</p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
