  "description": "<p>The Persian king Darius had never heard of the Greeks, their nations were so distant and so remote on the periphery of his empire. Then the Athenians burned Sardis, one of the king's cities. Thereafter at each evening meal, a servant was instructed to whisper in the monarch's ear, \"Sire, remember the Athenians.\" From this reminder of revenge came wars that went on for centuries and are still shaping our world today.<br/><br/>New episodes every Monday.<br/><br/>Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.</p>",
