  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles and Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony take on one of the most decisive naval battles in U.S. military history: The Battle of Midway. Fought between June 4-7, 1942, the United States Navy squared off with the best the Imperial Japanese Navy had to offer. The same Japanese aircraft carriers that participated in the battle were the same ships that had delivered the devastating blow at Pearl Harbor nearly seven months prior. At Midway Atoll, just a few miles west of Hawaii, American sailors and airmen gained their first decisive victory against the Japanese Empire, marking a significant turning point in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The guys discuss the most significant aspects of the battle amid the usual banter, so strap in for a good time. Enjoy!</p>",
