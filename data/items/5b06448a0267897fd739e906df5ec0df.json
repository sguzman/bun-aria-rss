  "description": "<p><em>This is a re-broadcast. The episode originally ran in October 2018. </em></p>\n<p>Do you have a teenage boy who struggles in school? Or do you have a younger son who you can imagine struggling in school as he gets older? He may be an otherwise capable young man, but seems apathetic and unmotivated, to the point you think he’s not excelling simply because he’s lazy. My guest today says that’s the wrong conclusion to draw, and one that leads to the wrong parenting approach to addressing it.</p>\n<p>His name is Adam Price and he’s a child psychologist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1454916877/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1454916877&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>He’s Not Lazy: Empowering Your Son to Believe in Himself</em></a>. Today on the show, Dr. Price argues that the real reason many young men are unmotivated is not that they don’t care about succeeding, but that they feel too much pressure to do so, and are scared of failing. We discuss why nagging and over-parenting simply exacerbates this issue, and how stepping back and giving boys more autonomy can help them become more self-directed and find their footing.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/notlazy\">aom.is/notlazy</a>.</p>\n",
