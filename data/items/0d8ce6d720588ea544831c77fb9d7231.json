  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Jussie Smollett trial has reached its dramatic conclusion. Today we’ll take a look back at this whole bizarre story and figure out what we might learn from it. Also, Bill De Blasio defends his new dystopian covid measures on the basis that, if New Yorkers submit to this one last infringement on their liberty, covid will be gone forever. And the trial of Kim Potter, the officer who shot Daunte Wright, begins this week. Wright has been made into another martyr of the BLM cause, but we’ll look at the real man, and his brutal and violent history. You haven’t heard some of this before. It’s pretty shocking. And Dallas Police brag about taking 100 thousand dollars from someone who did not commit any crime at all. It’s called civil asset forfeiture.
