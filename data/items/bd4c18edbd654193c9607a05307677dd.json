  "description": "<p>In the last few weeks, the Russian government has been turning up the heat on tech platforms in an escalation of its long-standing efforts to bring the internet under its control. First, Russia forced Apple and Google to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/russia-navalny-app-election.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remove an app</a> from their app stores that would have helped voters select non-Kremlin-backed candidates in the country’s recent parliamentary elections. Then, the government <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/29/russia-ban-youtube-german-coronavirus/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">threatened to block YouTube</a> within Russia if the platform refused to reinstate two German-language channels run by the state-backed outlet RT.
