  "description": "On this special episode of Deep State Radio, coinciding with the official beginning of the House Judiciary Committee's Impeachment Hearings, we discuss the case against Trump in the context of history. Our guests are impeachment historian Frank Bowman of the University of Missouri and Ryan Goodman, NYU Law School professor and co-editor at \"Just Security.\" Are the Democrats making a mistake by focusing on bribery? Did the GOP make any good points in their counter-arguments as the hearings kicked off. Where do we go from here? Can Chief Justice Roberts keep the Senate trial from being a kangaroo court or do Senate rules hamstring him and is the outcome inevitable? It's a lively, vital discussion that is not to be missed. Join us.\nWe’re extremely grateful to our sponsor, Mova Globes.\nMOVA Globes turn all on their own, with or without a base, in any setting with ambient lighting.
