  "description": "<p>It&rsquo;s time to get your financial butt in shape! Our guest today, Ericka Young, is the financial coach that <em>she</em> never had! As a newlywed couple, Ericka and her husband discovered that it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy to become just like the average US household that now has over $150,000 in debt. It&rsquo;s the norm and if you don&rsquo;t have a plan to avoid debt, you will likely find yourself falling into that trap! But that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> the path that Ericka continued along- she was determined to change her family tree, and now helps others who are seeking financial freedom in their lives. Ericka started her company, Tailor-Made Budgets where she creates custom plans for her clients that give them the tools and the knowledge to cut their stress levels by <em>increasing</em> their savings and <em>decreasing</em> their debt. We get to hear Ericka&rsquo;s debt story, how she was able to leave a high paying engineering job, signs that someone might need a financial coach, what it looks like to face your financial reality, how she helps her clients think through making trade-offs, and why friends may not be enough of an accountability partner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Where I Want To Be Deciduous Brewing!
