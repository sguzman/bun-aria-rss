  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, WPHT Radio Host Rich Zeoli fills in for Mark. It's difficult to believe Bob Woodward, but Gen Mark Milley is a woke General so this report rings true. Milley has cited \"America's original sin\" in support of the 1619 project, \"white rage\" and his previous detrimental comments regarding former President Trump.  Why would Milley make such comments to think there's even a hint of a reason to believe that Trump would launch an attack on China? An immediate investigation is needed to get to the bottom of these secret phone calls with China. Later, the public is slowly learning that Anthony Fauci and the federal government lied about the origin of the coronavirus. Now evidence is emerging that reveals that Fauci lied about the US's role in gain of function research. Afterward, masking kids and indoctrinating them in public school continues and the politicians think parents shouldn't even have a say in the matter. The pro-Marxist movement wants to label anyone that opposes them as a white supremacist and woke teachers are teaching children that whiteness is an extension of white supremacy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
