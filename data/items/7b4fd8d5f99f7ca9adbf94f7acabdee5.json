  "description": "<p>We prove that certain types of measure-valued mappings are monokinetic i.e.\nthe distribution of velocity is concentrated in a Dirac mass. These include\nweak measure-valued solutions to the strongly singular Cucker-Smale model with\nsingularity of order $\\alpha$ greater or equal to the dimension of the ambient\nspace. Consequently, we are able to answer a couple of open questions related\nto the singular Cucker-Smale model. First, we prove that weak measure-valued\nsolutions to the strongly singular Cucker-Smale kinetic equation are\nmonokinetic, under very mild assumptions that they are uniformly compactly\nsupported and weakly continuous in time. This can be interpreted as a rigorous\nderivation of the macroscopic fractional Euler-alignment system from kinetic\nCucker-Smale equation without the need to perform any hydrodynamical limit.\n</p>\n<p>This suggests superior suitability of the macroscopic framework to describe\nlarge-crowd limits of strongly singular Cucker-Smale dynamics.\n</p>\n<p>Second, we perform a direct micro- to macroscopic mean-field limit from the\nCucker-Smale particle system to the fractional Euler-alignment model. This\nleads to the final result -- existence of weak solutions to the fractional\nEuler-alignment system with almost arbitrary initial data in $\\mathbb{R}^1$,\nincluding the possibility of vacuum. Existence can be extended to\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ under the a priori assumption that the density of the mean-field\nlimit has no atoms.\n</p>",
