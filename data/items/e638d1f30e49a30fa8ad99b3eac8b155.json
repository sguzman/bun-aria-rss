I&rsquo;ve also migrated\nfrom the <code>eigenfoo.xyz</code> domain to the more creditable-sounding <code>georgeho.org</code>\n(sadly, <code>georgeho.com</code> and <code>georgeho.net</code> were already taken). In terms of\ntypography, the header typeface is <a href=\"https://www.1001freefonts.com/nicholson-gothic.font\">Nicholson\nGothic</a>, the body typeface\nis <a href=\"https://mbtype.com/fonts/equity/\">Equity</a> and the monospaced typeface for\noccasional code snippets is <a href=\"https://mbtype.com/fonts/triplicate/\">Triplicate</a>.\nIn all, I probably spend the equivalent of two fancy lattes a year for this\nsetup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-hugo-why-not-jekyll\">Why Hugo? Why Not Jekyll?</h2>\n<p>Honestly, no good reason! <a href=\"https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/08/migrating-to-hugo/\">Some people point\nout</a> that Jekyll is not\nactively maintained or used anymore, and that GitHub Pages doesn&rsquo;t support\nJekyll 4.0. However, those aren&rsquo;t really good enough reasons for migrating a\nblogging stack.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a short list of things I like about Hugo over Jekyll &mdash; but again, none\nof these things really should have enticed me to make the jump.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ease of installation and use (Hugo is a binary executable instead of a Ruby\nlibrary), and it was very easy to make changes to the theme (e.g. changing\nthe font or <a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html\">increasing the font\nsize</a>) &mdash; although that\ncould just be because <a href=\"https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/\">the theme that I&rsquo;m\nusing</a> is dead simple.</li>\n<li>Automatic generation of a <a href=\"https://www.georgeho.org/sitemap.xml\">sitemap</a> and <a href=\"https://www.georgeho.org/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>\n&mdash; with Jekyll, these needed to be done manually (or by your theme).</li>\n<li>Typographical conveniences like automatic <a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html\">smart\nquotes</a>,\nrendering <code>-</code>, <code>--</code> and <code>---</code> into <a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html\">the appropriate hyphen or\ndash</a>, and <code>...</code>\ninto <a href=\"https://practicaltypography.com/ellipses.html\">an ellipsis</a>.</li>\n<li>Faster builds of my website&hellip; although this isn&rsquo;t really that helpful for\nme, since my blog barely has a few dozen pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-migration\">The Migration</h2>\n<p>&hellip;was surprisingly painless! All I <em>really</em> needed to do was to <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\">pick out a\ntheme</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/\">Hugo Quick\nStart</a>, dump my Markdown blog\nposts into the <code>content/</code> directory and change some of the YAML front matter in\nall of my blog posts.</p>\n<p>In reality, I spent a few extra hours fiddling with the typography and making\nsure that all my links were back-compatible with my previous website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pollen\">Pollen</h2>\n<p>This is actually not the first time I tried to rewrite my website: earlier this\nyear I experimented with writing a\n<a href=\"https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/\">Tufte-inspired</a> blog using\n<a href=\"https://pollenpub.com\">Pollen</a>. For those unfamiliar, it&rsquo;s like R Markdown (in\nthat it&rsquo;s a markup language that allows arbitrary R code to be embedded in it),\nbut instead of R, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://racket-lang.org/\">Racket</a>, and instead of\nMarkdown, it&rsquo;s your own domain-specific markup language that you build with\nRacket.</p>\n<p>This means that I wrote a custom language specifically for formatting\nTufte-style two-column blog posts. It actually worked out pretty well (and the\nresulting blog posts looked <em>damn good</em>), but I couldn&rsquo;t justify maintaining my\nown language specifically for writing blog posts. I&rsquo;d probably recommend using\nPollen for large, one-off pieces of writing (like a book), instead of small,\nrecurring pieces of writing (like a blog).</p>"
