  "description": "<p>Dick Fosbury changed the sport of high jumping forever the first time he jumped <em>backward </em>over the bar. Until then, every competitor had launched themselves into the air going forward, belly over the bar. I’m not sure the last time you watched a high jumping event, but now <em>every</em> high jumper uses Dick’s technique. He essentially exploited a flaw in the high jumping world that no-one else was paying attention to. In a way that’s basically what arbitrage is when it comes to our personal finances- it’s about thinking creatively about the different financial hurdles in our lives. It’s about challenging the assumptions we’re faced with. We’ll cover some very clear forms of arbitrage that you might already be implementing, some problems with arbitrage, and then how you can begin developing more of an arbitrage mindset today.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Newgrass Brewing Co Pineapple Upside Down Shake!
