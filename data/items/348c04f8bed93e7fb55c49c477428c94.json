  "description": "<p>With Allied forces checked at Buna and on the Sanananda Track, the campaign hinged on the Australian attack to seize the westernmost village on the Japanese beachhead, Gona. The 25th Brigade, already exhausted from the fighting across the Owen Stanley Ranges, was tasked to seize Gona, but the attack would soon wear down the 25th as well as the 21st Brigade which was sent in to relieve them. It would all come down to one final throw of the dice. </p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by History Guild in conjunction Military History and Heritage Victoria.
