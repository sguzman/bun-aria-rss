  "description": "<p>It’s the season finale! Shannon sits down with amazing comedian and toe-positive queen, Hannah Berner, to chat (or have a heart-to-heart) about their time on reality tv. How do they really feel about being portrayed as the villain? Why did Hannah post a solo photo after her wedding? Do spray tans contain drugs? The girls talk about staying true to themselves and give some dating and relationship advice. Maybe by next season, Shannon will have a Cubs sponsorship. See ya then, this is episode 15. </p>",
