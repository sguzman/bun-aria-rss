  "description": "Tonight, my special guest is Nicole Weisensee Egan who is an award-winning journalist, former senior writer for People Magazine and Bill Cosby's worst nightmare. Get her book Chasing Cosby to read what she uncovered about American's pudding pop hero.\n\nBill Cosby's decades-long career as a sweater-wearing, wholesome TV dad came to a swift and stunning end on April 26, 2018, when he was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand. The mounting allegations against Bill Cosby - more than 60 women have come forward to accuse him of similar crimes - and his ultimate conviction were a shock to Americans, who wanted to cleave to their image of Cosby as a pudding-pop hero. \nAward-winning journalist and former People Magazine senior writer Nicki Weisensee Egan was the first reporter to dig into the story when Constand went to the police in 2005. Other news organizations looked away, but Egan doggedly investigated the case, developing ties with entrenched sources and discovering incriminating details that would ultimately come to influence the prosecution. \nIn her debut audiobook, Chasing Cosby, Egan shares her firsthand account of Cosby's 13-year run from justice. She tells us how Cosby planned and executed his crimes and how Hollywood alliances and law enforcement knew what Cosby was doing but did nothing to stop him. A veteran crime reporter, Egan also explores the cultural and social issues that influenced the case, delving into the psychological calculations of a serial predator and into the psyche of a nation that fervently wanted to put their faith in the innocence of \"American's Dad\". \n\nEnjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now from anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\nVisit her website\n\nSeven - Our podcast for the jaded ones that need wicked stories in their lives!\n\n\nCheck Out Mysterious Radio!
