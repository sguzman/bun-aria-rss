  "description": "<p>In the season finale of I Am Athlete, the legendary Deion Sanders joins Brandon, Chad, Channing and Fred for an entertaining and powerful discussion as Prime brings his unique energy and puts his personal stamp on various topics throughout the episode. </p><p>Prime Time, a mentor to Chad, starts the show off demonstrating what it would have been like covering the wide receiver back in the day which leads into inside football talk as the guys reminisce about some of the best players over time. Brandon tells a funny story about playing in front of Prime and then lures him into the ongoing X and Z debate in which Deion delivers the final answer on who is who between Chad and Brandon. </p><p>Channing starts poking Deion on his latest endeavour of becoming the new Head Football Coach at Jackson State University and why he would take on such a challenge while Brandon questions Deion walking away from millions being on tv and other opportunities to choose this. Deion describes the coaching decision as easy and the journey as is his calling as he wants to be a conduit of change for these young men while bringing the same exposure and respect to HBCU programs as other top college programs. Respecting his efforts, Fred agrees that there is strong talent in these schools but Channing says no way would he as a young talented player choose a HBCU program over a power five school which sparks some heated discussion between the guys. </p><p>With both of Deion's sons playing for him at Jackson State, Fred asks if there is favoritism and if it's hard coaching your own kids at that level...Deion responds, \"No\" which leads to a funny conversation about ranking his own children not just on the field but in family hierarchy too. One important aspect the men discuss is about being role models and the roles people actually play and also the importance of Deion's coaching staff working day time shifts to be home with their family in time for dinner and to raise their families- an aspect foreign to many professional and college coaching staffs. </p><p>Wrapping up Mental Health Awareness Month, Brandon asks the usually positive Deion what was his lowest moment in life which leads to a surprising answer that leaves the guys speechless as Prime opens up about his own personal struggles and suicidal moments that led him down a different path. Prime recalls a tough night he had in Cincinnati, Ohio after going 3-4 one night and how he contemplated taking his own life that night and what ultimately was his saving grace. It doesn't matter what you have or who you have in life, it matters if you are at peace with yourself because even when you are at the top of the world, you can still be struggling. </p><p>One week out from Chad's professional boxing debut, the guys are checking on him to make sure he's prepared as Chef Nancie serves Ocho a hearty meal that the guys question if that's what he should be loading up on days before his fight. Chef said she wants Chad to feel himself and the conversation quickly turns into a friendly interrogation from the guys to Chef on why she is so dressed up and where she's headed. </p><p>I Am Athlete podcast is a candid, unscripted weekly discussion between former </p><p><b>NFL</b> greats: <b>Brandon Marshall</b>, <b>Chad Johnson</b>, <b>Fred Taylor</b> and<b> Channing Crowder</b>.  These gridiron giants pull no punches and have no filter while expressing themselves on the importance of the issues and topics they cover.  Each week the podcast is growing in popularity and its subscribers due to the panelists frankness in sharing their thoughts and views on relevant topics covered each week.<br /><br /><b>A new episode premieres every Monday at 12pm Eastern.
