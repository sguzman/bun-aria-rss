  "description": "Talking to kids about their love lives can be uncomfortable, but discussing consent is one of the most important conversations to have with our children. Dr. Lisa explains why she feels that when we focus on consent, we are articulating the lowest possible bar for acceptable physical intimacy. She offers thoughts on how we might rethink and reframe the entire topic in order to be most helpful to our children. Reena asks: Can we change our collective mindset on consent? And how do you explain coercion and consent to children? The conversation includes a look at how pornography factors into teenagers' understanding of consensual relationships.\nBOOK GIVEAWAY:\nOne copy each of Girls & Sex and Boys & Sex by Peggy Orenstein\nEnter to win one of 2 books being given away by @asklisapodcast.\n1.
