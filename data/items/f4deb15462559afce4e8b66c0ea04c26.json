Both embody the story of immigrants with the odds stacked against them that used adversity, self-evaluation, and a body-builder mentality to re-write their own narrative.

[37:50] Patrick reveals the impact he wants to have on the world. [38:57]    QUOTES: “I also believe firmly that events, conversations, certain individuals can completely say something that can change your life forever.” [14:40]   “One of the scariest things about life is a question. The scary question can shake a soul up 'cause no one's asked that question from you. So for me, the transition for somebody who'd want to change it and get clarity is actually asking questions.” [15:38]   “If you don't ask the questions of what you want to do next, the world is gonna put you in the box of what you have to do next because they're determining who you need to be. And you are rising up to their expectations 'cause you're not asking the questions yourself.” [15:50]   “Clarity to me is stemmed from you being able to sit down and ask those tough questions that piss you off, that irritate you, that make you emotional, that you cry over, that you reflect, that makes you want to do research, that makes you follow up, that makes you sit down and say, \"I don't really know. I've never thought about this before.\" And that goes deeper, and deeper, and deeper.” [16:08]   “Clarity gives confidence.” [16:55]    “Identity is you asking the questions until eventually you get to a point that you get to the deeper part of who do you want to be? What life do you want to live? And why do you want to live this life? Why is it important to you? Why is it worth you putting through all these hours? Why would you want to do that?” [22:20]   “I think declaring the intention serves a purpose. I think when you go out there and you say, \"This is what I'm gonna be doing, this is where I'm gonna be at,\" you officially have the world holding you accountable.” [23:10]   “Haters highlight your weaknesses.” [29:48]   “The more you tell the world how to manage expectations dealing with you and what to anticipate, you actually minimize a lot of the noise.” [33:33]   “The solution for you to become free is you gotta question every single thing” [36:50]   FOLLOW PATRICK BET-DAVID: WEBSITE - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/30XeIfU\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/30XeIfU</a> FACEBOOK - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2HMSy8p\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2HMSy8p</a> TWITTER - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2HOxNJu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2HOxNJu</a> INSTAGRAM - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2KkGQUu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2KkGQUu</a> LINKEDIN - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2wztb3u\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/2wztb3u</a>   BOOKS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: The 25 Laws to Doing the Impossible - <a href=\"https://amzn.to\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to</a>/2QFPjCD [2:44] Meditations - <a href=\"https://amzn.to\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to</a>/2allL7m [35:56] Principles - <a href=\"https://amzn.to\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to</a>/2HMSnKh [35:58]   VIDEOS MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: The Life of an Entrepreneur - <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/1ShhMss [2:06]   COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS EPISODE: PHP - <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/2WnfrIR [1:27] Valuetainment - <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/1IybV1h [2:17]",
