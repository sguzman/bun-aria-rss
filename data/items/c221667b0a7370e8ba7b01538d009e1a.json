  "description": "Hi listeners! I’m traveling this month and so I am re-airing some older episodes for you to enjoy here once again. In celebration of our recent “Cherchez La Femme” season, I’m choosing three of my favorite episodes on female artists-- and, hint hint, the last of these episodes refers directly to our upcoming season, so keep your eyes peeled for that one next month. Today, though, I’m returning to tell the story of Angelica Kauffman, one of the prized painters of the 18th century.
