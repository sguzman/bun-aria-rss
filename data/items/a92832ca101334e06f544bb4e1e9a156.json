    "media:description": "Practice your Spanish listening comprehension and speaking while exploring the beautiful and diverse city of San Francisco! Learn vocabulary related to city life while also practicing common descriptions and dialogues using high frequency verbs, such as gustar, ser, estar, poder, tener and ir. \n\nThrough storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and responding to questions in the target language as we explore some of the common vocabulary for places you can visit in a city. \n\nTPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) has been proven to be an effective and engaging way to learn a new language. If you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, subscribe to my channel for more TPRS and Comprehensible Input videos to come!",
