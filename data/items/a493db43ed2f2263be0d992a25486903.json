  "description": "Emily shares the best places to meet someone, because sometimes it feels like there's no one to meet anywhere. Where are all the single hotties at? If you want to meet someone, get ready to drink a lot of coffee, get sweaty, and climb a mountain! You will be rewarded with lots of sex (hopefully). Emily also talks with Dossie Easton, author of the Ethical Slut about relationships. People go from one relationship to the next, without giving themselves time to grieve the person they broke up with. How long should you let yourself cry over your ex before moving on? Emily and Dossie also give advice for people who are dying to be in a relationship. What's blocking you from being in the relationship you want? And what are the best places to meet someone you can actually talk to? Alternatively, if you've been married forever, how do you get your sex life back?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
