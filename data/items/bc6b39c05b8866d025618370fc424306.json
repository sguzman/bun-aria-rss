  "description": "<div>Hi Friends! <br>\nI wanted to talk about Mitrice Richardson, I feel like her story is pretty important. Her case got completely dismissed and not taken seriously, WHY?! WHY would they let her leave at 12:30 am without any car, phone, wallet, nothing?!?! Why was she arrested in the first place? Why why why why why. So many why’s and not enough answers here. There is also a LOT more to this story but I just couldn’t fit it in to one video, this one turned out way longer than expected.  <br>\nI hope for nothing but love, peace, closure and forgiveness for everyone involved. Mitrice was so young, so beautiful and had so much ahead of her. I pray for healing and love for the family. I also hope one day they can get some kind of closure. I know that doesnt mean much but , every family deserves closure. <br>\nHave a wonderful day today and I will be seeing you guys very soon. Love you <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian<br>\n<br>\nAlso, Mitrice's mother released a book shedding light on her journey to find justice for Mitrice.
