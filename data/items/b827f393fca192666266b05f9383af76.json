  "title": "Papal Infallibility",
  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss why, in 1870, the Vatican Council issued the decree ‘pastor aeternus’ which, among other areas, affirmed papal infallibility.  It meant effectively that the Pope could not err in his teachings, an assertion with its roots in the early Church when the bishop of Rome advanced to being the first among equals, then overall head of the Christian Church in the West.  The idea that the Pope could not err had been a double-edged sword from the Middle Ages, though; while it apparently conveyed great power, it also meant a Pope was constrained by whatever a predecessor had said.  If a later Pope were to contradict an earlier Pope, then one of them must be wrong, and how could that be…if both were infallible?\n\nWith\n\nTom O’Loughlin\nProfessor of Historical Theology at the University of Nottingham\n\nRebecca Rist\nProfessor in Medieval History at the University of Reading\n\nAnd \n\nMiles Pattenden\nDepartmental Lecturer in Early Modern History at the University of Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson",
