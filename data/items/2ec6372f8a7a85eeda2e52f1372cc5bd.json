  "description": "<p>Manitou Springs is a touristy town found south of Denver in Colorado that became popular in the 1890s as a health resort, with its clean mountain air and mineral springs. This was a sacred area to the Native American tribes there. Many of them believed this was a gateway to the other side. There are so many interesting legends and ghost stories connected to this town that it's hard not to believe that they might have been right. Join us as we explore the history and haunts of Manitou Springs, Colorado! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Mike Streibel and features Fernand Arbelot's gravesite and This Month in History features Adolf Eichmann captured.
