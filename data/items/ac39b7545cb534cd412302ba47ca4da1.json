  "description": "On Black Bartholomew's Day--August 24, 1662--nearly two thousand ministers denied the authority of the Church of England and were subsequently removed from their posts. Mary Franklin was the wife of Presbyterian minister Robert Franklin, one of the dissenting ministers ejected from their pulpits and their livings on that day. She recorded the experience of her persecution in the unused pages of her husband's sermon notebook. In 1782--some hundred years after the composition of her grandmother's narrative-- Mary's granddaughter, Hannah Burton, took up this same notebook to chronicle her experience as an impoverished widow, barely surviving the economic revolutions of eighteenth-century London.\nCollected for the first time, She Being Dead Yet Speaketh: The Franklin Family Papers (Iter Press, 2019) offers rare insight into the personal lives of three generations of dissenting women.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
