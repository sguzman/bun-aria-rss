  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Show, unlike Trump's 2017 inauguration, today’s didn’t have any riots and other antagonists. The peaceful transition of power was focused on unity. In particular, unity around self-hate, open borders, and the re-writing of our history. The new administration is unified around tax-payer funded abortion-on-demand, appeasement toward foreign enemies like the Palestinian Authority, Iran, and the communist Chinese. The left seems to be united around instituting the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force (manifesto). Biden isn't about unity, he's about conformity and making those that object persona non grata in society.  Then, for the sake of unity, did Biden ask for his party to stop the malicious impeachment of the 45th President? Did he ask that his former Senate colleagues not seek to eliminate the filibuster rule? In the name of unity did Biden ask the people and Congress to respect the independence of the Supreme Court and to avoid packing it? Of course not. it's about conformity, not unity. Later, this is the third term of Barack Obama and the democrats never want Trump to get in their way again. The left has embraced RINO's like Mitt Romney and corporatists like Mitch McConnell, who is at war with constitutional conservatism. Media personalities are comparing Biden's speech to Abraham Lincoln's, yet they trashed Trump as Hitler. Lincoln, however, delivered what many consider to be one of the best speeches by a statesman, ever. In one of Biden's first acts as president, he's added a bust of produce-workers activist Cesar Chavez who called illegal immigrants \"wetbacks.\" Afterward, Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, and other media outlets continue misrepresenting the facts as they editorialize and pass off their lies for objective journalism. This is how the left operates, to attack, libel, and silence their critics. It's a shameful disgrace.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
