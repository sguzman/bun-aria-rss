  "description": "Malcolm Gladwell’s work is nothing short of an intellectual adventure. \nSometimes, as in his podcast Revisionist History, he takes something small and mundane — a hockey statistic, a semicolon, a verbal tic — and draws a broad, sweeping conclusion that shatters your worldview. \nOther times, as in his new book Talking to Strangers, he takes something big and contentious — the death of Sandra Bland, the wrongful conviction of Amanda Knox, the ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff — and produces insights that challenge conventional wisdom, leaving you wondering how you missed what he saw all along. \nIn either case, once you’ve experienced what Gladwell has to say, you can never see things in quite the same way again. \nThis conversation is an adventure of its own. We cover everything from the secrets behind Gladwell’s creative process to the basic social ingredient that undergirds all of modern society to the story of how an entire field office of the CIA got infiltrated by Cuban spies — and what that teaches us about human nature.\nSo, tune in and be a part of this adventure with us. \n\nBooks recommendations:\nExit, Voice, and Loyalty by Albert Hirschman\nThe Journalist and the Murderer by Janet Malcolm \nThe Fall of Heaven: The Pahlavis and the Final Days of Imperial Iran by Andrew Scott Cooper \nWant to contact the show?
