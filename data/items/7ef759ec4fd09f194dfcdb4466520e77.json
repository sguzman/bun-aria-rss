In this episode, Luke Burbank from the podcast Too Beautiful to Live explains how he’s built his devoted fans through openness and honesty: “When in doubt, I pretty much just get as emotionally vulnerable as possible. If people are being really, really genuine about their emotions, and if people are talking about how they’re insecure about things, I always find that compelling.” For the Spiel, various staffers from Planet Money recommend their favorite non-NPR podcasts including Longform, The Chris Gethard Show, Creating a Family, Bad at Sports, Reading Out Loud and The Read.\n\nGet The Gist by email as soon as it’s available: slate.com/GistEmail\n\nSubscribe to the podcast in iTunes: itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slate…id873667927?mt=2\nLearn more about your ad choices.
