  "description": "<p>If you’re anything like me, you’ve been feeling a lot of anger recently with the blatant infringement on our human rights that has occurred. And this anger isn’t new. It’s deep, ancient, primal, the screams of our grandmothers who never got to choose, whose wombs were a commodity, whose worth was based on who they could birth. We’ve had enough and today, we rise. In this conversation, I sit with mystic poet Maya Luna to discuss divine feminine rage and how we can connect with it, despite our fear. We discuss toxic femininity and how we can find it within ourselves. We dive into the wounds of the patriarchy and within it, share our art. You will want to sit with this episode in sacred space because it is potent, transformative and deep. And a conversation that needs to be had. We invite you to sit with us and reclaim the divine feminine rage within you. She is ready for change and respect.</p> <p>Listen to Maya’s Poetry here: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4F3qNrjVBCjwd43Z2Fozi6 and connect with her here: https://www.deepfemininemysteryschool.com/</p> <p>Connect with your body’s wisdom with my free Goddess Embodiment Practice free at http://www.rosegoldgoddesses.com/embodiment</p> <p>Try Betterhelp for 10% off at <a href= \"http://www.betterhelp.com/sahara\">www.betterhelp.com/sahara</a></p> <p>*As a BetterHelp affiliate, we may receive compensation from BetterHelp if you purchase products or services through the links provided</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Follow me your spiritual bestie to active your fullest expression + laugh along the way:<br /> Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> TikTok: @iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose<br /> + Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books: www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
