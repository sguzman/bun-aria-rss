Well it's not a terrible game but it suffers some odd design choices that really bring down the overall experience. The launch didn't go well and it was a massive disappointment for a lot of people who dished out triple A bucks on what is essentially an Indie game.\n\nI found that the story was the one major thing that got me through We Happy Few. Like I say in the video, it's brilliantly voice acted and the animations are clean as hell and the plot twists were unexpected. I wish I talked more about the story in this video but I didn't want to spoil much of it because We Happy Few is worth a go if you manage to find it on a massive discount.",
