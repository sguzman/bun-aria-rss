  "description": "<p>You know that time of the day, because it's marked by a series of recurring events: If you have a baby, they start fussing. If you have toddlers, they start begging for snacks and clinging to your legs. If you have a preschooler, they are bored with all the toys in the whole house. And you? You're exhausted! Oh yeah, and there is still food that needs to be made, a bunch of stuff to clean up, and several hours before bedtime. It's this time of day where most of us crumble (even those of us who were previously in a great mood). But do we have to respond this way? What if our hope in Jesus transformed our response? In today's episode, Emily and Laura talk about how a mom can do more than \"just survive\" until the end of the day! Because our hope isn't in a peaceful house, but in a person.</p> <p> </p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
