The food of Senegal has big flavors and big heart, and Thiam reveals the culture that inspired him to cook. “In Senegal … people believe that the more they share the food with you, the more plentiful their bowl will be,” he says. Then we’ll present our recipe for Tahini Swirl Brownies and a tip for all-new compound butters. Also on the show, we talk to Damon Baehrel about his “mystery restaurant,” in upstate New York, Dr. Aaron Carroll investigates how looking at food stamp choices could reduce obesity and, as always, Christopher Kimball and Sara Moulton take your calls.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
