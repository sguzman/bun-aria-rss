  "description": "It’s always fun for me to be able to talk with future guest at a show where they have all their quilts for me to see.. well maybe not all but a group! I had seen Dora Cary of Orange Dot Quilts booth and knew I had to meet. I didn’t the first time, but after inviting her to the show, we had a chance to talk this past May at an event. I love all her work, it’s fresh, inspiring and something I’d like to make. She is from Romania, now a US Citizen, and had no knowledge of quilts, I think you will enjoy meeting her and her fun and different journey into making quilts!\n\nhttp://www.orangedotquilts.com/\n----------\nDeb Grogan of the Quilt Factory is a very talented designer. With years of designing for other industries, she changed it up and moved into designing for quilter and we are lucky she did! I adore her whimsical style and very can do projects. Need a baby quilt? Deb has so many options you’ll be making her patterns for years to come!\n\nhttps://www.thequiltfactory.com/\n---------------------------\nUnFinished Object … better known to a quilter as a UFO. A project we got stuck on, got tired of, got filed and we forgot about it (yes… it happens!) … maybe even a project we no longer love like we used to. My buddy Jacquelynne Steves is back to chat UFO busting with me! PLUS she has a crazy great deal for my quilters, that’s you! If you want in one of the few kits for her FREE Block of the month, which by the way are awesome, use her exclusive to ME Coupon code PAT2017 Good through July 18, 2017 for $6 off kit\nhttps://jacquelynnesteves.com/\n--------------------\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
