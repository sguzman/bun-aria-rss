  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, we have an absolute disaster on the southern border and the Biden administration doesn't consider it a crisis. President Biden has created open borders, effectively eliminated ICE, and is allowing illegal aliens to pour into border towns, some of them infected with COVID. He is creating anarchy on the border and making it impossible to secure this nation. Biden has created this situation, and Washington Democrats are thrilled. Biden is a human wrecking ball, destroying our institutions, with the media cheering it on. Energy prices are already rising and pressure on inflation is on the horizon. Our schools and health systems will be overrun with this kind of immigration, and we will be the ones to suffer. The country is going down the tubes all so the Democratic party can take total control. If Biden were to run for president again today, after weeks of lying to America from his basement, he’d lose in a landslide. Later, Gordon Chang speaks with Mark about the likelihood of China attacking Taiwan and if America should help Japan arm up their military.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
