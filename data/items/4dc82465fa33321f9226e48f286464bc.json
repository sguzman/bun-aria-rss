  "description": "Have you ever just sat back and observed a small child as they learn something new? There is this profound sense of awe and wonder with each new discovery they make. Kids are naturally curious. As adults, we tend to take what we know about the world for granted. But, through the eyes of a child, the world is an exciting mystery just waiting to be discovered! What if we told you that it is possible to experience that childlike curiosity in your day-to-day life, starting right now? What if we also told you that curiosity is one of the most powerful relationship tools we have? Curiosity is much more than a quest for knowledge and is not as simple as it seems.\nIn this episode of Therapist Uncensored:\nco-hosts Ann Kelley and Sue Marriott, invite you to rediscover curiosity and experience the world and your relationships from a revitalized perspective!\nWhy is Ann so obsessed with curiosity?!\nChildlike Wonder:\n\n \tThink about how a child sees things for the first time. It’s strictly curiosity. As we get older, the world becomes more predictable.\n\nBeing “In the Know” vs “In the Unknown”\n\n \tWhen we think we know a lot, we limit ourselves. It takes a lot of security to be uncertain.\n\nThe neuroscience of curiosity\n\n \tA willingness to embrace uncertainty and curiosity go hand in hand.\n\nAttachment, curiosity, and anxiety\n\n \tHow does our attachment style affect our experience?\n \tIf you feel bodily anxiety in the questions you’re asking, you’re probably not in the right state. How can we learn to become truly curious about someone in a loving way if we lean towards the blue or red side of the spectrum?\n \tIf we’re on the blue side of the spectrum, how can we move out to a place where we’re curious.\n \tIf we’re on the red side, how do we move from asking questions out of anxiety to asking out of curiosity?\n\nPeople who are curious about you are attractive, and we can tell the difference if they’re not really interested.\nYou get to be curious about your therapist.\nTips to cultivate curiosity:\n\n \tTrain your brain\n \tBe aware of what’s happening in your body\n \tRecognizing judgment\n \tAre you judging people when they speak instead of listening to them? This is a kind of cognitive closure.\n \tSlow down and stimulate your own curiosity with questions.\n \tLook for novelty and discovery in your interactions. Early relationships often break up out of boredom. You can be curious about your anxiety related to asking questions and even share your anxiety with the person making you nervous. Sharing vulnerability brings people together.\n \tCultivate wonder and awe.\n\nTo review or learn about the different attachment styles, listen to:\nTU59: Dismissing/Avoidant Attachment – Are You Cool, or just Cut Off?\n\nTU60: Preoccupation in Relationships – Grow Your Security by Learning the Signs of Anxious Attachment\n\nTU61: It’s Not Crazy, It’s a Solution to an Unsolvable Problem – Disorganized Attachment\n\nTU79: Attachment Spectrum and the Nervous System, Quick Review with Updates\nWho doesn’t love special offers?\nWe’re on Patreon! \nBecome a Super Neuronerd, a Gold Neuronerd or an Out and Proud PLATINUM NEURONERD today! 🙂 \n\nJoin our exclusive community of Therapist Uncensored Neuronerds for just $5 a month!\n\n Gain access to private, more in-depth episodes and exclusive content. \n\nHelp us create a ripple of security by sharing the science of relationships around the globe!\n\nNEURONERDS UNITE! Click here to sign up.\n\n \nWe’ve partnered with Audible!
