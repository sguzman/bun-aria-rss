  "description": "As you probably know, I’m a big fan of Staticman’s approach to enable dynamic content on static web sites. When I introduced comments on this blog, things quickly got out of hand: Each day, I would receive roughly five comments that were posted by bots.\nSpam comments as pull requests in GitHub\n Manually approving each post quickly became a nuisance, which is why I deactivated Staticman again after some time."
