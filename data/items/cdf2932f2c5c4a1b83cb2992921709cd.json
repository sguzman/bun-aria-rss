  "description": "<p>WARNING: Spoilers for the new Spiderman movie and Sex And The City reboot in this episode!</p><p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p>Chris-jeansa is SO happy to be back from the holidays and reunited with you! We catch up with some of the things Christina hated most from the break: watching Spirman: No Way Home and the Sex And The City reboot \"And Just Like That.\" We hear about Enny's New Years and some tips on DM-ing. We get into some follow-ups, talk about how snacks are stupid, and hear a juicy mom confession. We try to give some advice to a woman disliking her boyfriend looking at ladies on the internet, marital loves and gassiness during pregnancy. We hear some Pazsitzky effects about lube, PO boxes, buying Kleenex, and using AC in the car.</p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Pazsitzky Effect\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can. </p>\n",
