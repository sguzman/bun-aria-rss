  "description": "<p>Jack Ketchum's&nbsp;The Girl Next Door&nbsp;is not for the faint of&nbsp;heart. The story is based on the&nbsp;grisly murder of Sylvia Likens&nbsp;by her de facto guardian in the 1960s. What preceded her death is too reprehensible to print here, but Ketchum dives headlong into the awful, determined to suss out the causes (and bounds) of human evil.</p><p>Suffice to say, this makes for a difficult discussion on-air, and we spend nearly half the show trying&nbsp;not&nbsp;to talk about the rougher aspects of the book. So please join us for a discussion of phishing, safewords from the future, childhood games, and the parts of&nbsp;The Girl Next Door&nbsp;that made Craig feel terrible.</p><p>Caveat lictor: This episode contains explicit language and discussion of graphic material.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
