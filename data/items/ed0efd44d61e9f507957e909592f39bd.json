  "description": "<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1534801212508_48266\"><a href=\"http://www.igntd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.igntd.com/\">Adi Jaffe</a>, Ph.D. is a nationally recognized expert on mental health, addiction and stigma. He lectures in the Psychology department at UCLA. He is passionate about the role of shame in destroying lives and aims to greatly reduce the stigma of mental health in this country. In this context, Dr. Jaffe has used his personal experience as an incredibly effective inspirational and motivational tool.</p> <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1534801212508_47600\">During his undergraduate career, Adi began struggling with drug issues himself, eventually leading to a 4 year hiatus from studies and into the Los Angeles drug-dealing world, where Adi's days looked more like a re-enactment of a beatnik novel or a Quentin Tarantino film than the life of an upper-middle class suburban kid. Following a SWAT team arrest in his apartment, and extended court case and a year-long jail sentence, Adi began rebuilding his life. This eventually led to his attainment of a Ph.D. from UCLA's doctoral program in psychology. </p> <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1534801212508_47166\">Music: \"Ride,\" by <a href=\"https://brettnewski.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://brettnewski.com/\">Brett Newski</a>. </p> <p><strong>Find me on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\">Twitter</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</a></strong></p> <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1534801212508_48483\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></strong></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
