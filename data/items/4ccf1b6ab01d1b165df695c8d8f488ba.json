We’ll help set you up with a coach or teacher, and Ericsson will be our lead advisor. And then we’ll make some podcasts out of your stories. It will be hard work, maybe a bit embarrassing at times. But wouldn’t it be awesome to get really good at singing, or doing handstands, or whatever your heart yearns for — and to have your whole process recorded for posterity?</p>\n<p>If you’re up for it — truly up for it — and you want to be considered for our <em>Peak</em> project, drop us a note at <a href=\"mailto:radio@freakonomics.com\"><strong>radio@freakonomics.com</strong></a>. Tell us a little about yourself, what you want to get great at, and how far along you are in your progress.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/2016/04/welcome-freakonomics-radio-peak-project/\">Calling All (Potential) Peak Performers!</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com\">Freakonomics</a>.</p>\n"
