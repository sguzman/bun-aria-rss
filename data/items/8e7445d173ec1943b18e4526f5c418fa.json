  "description": "<div>July 15, 2019 / On February 25, 2016, Keith Davis Jr. was acquitted of 15 out of 16 charges related to the morning he was shot by Baltimore Police. He was found guilty of \"illegal possession of a handgun as a convicted felon,\" a contradictory verdict based on a technicality that some believe was misrepresented by the prosecutor. But suddenly, Keith had a new case to worry about. Five days after the verdict, Baltimore Police announced that Keith had been charged with the murder of 22-year-old Kevin Jones, who was killed five hours before the police involved shooting. The gun that was found in the garage had been \"ballistically linked\" to Jones's murder -- and Keith has been fighting to prove his innocence ever since. This week, he began his fourth trial for the murder of Kevin Jones -- and this episode includes a bombshell that was dropped in court on the very first day.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Episode scoring music by Blue Dot Sessions, Uncanny Valley and Spencer Burdette.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This episode was sponsored by thredUP.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.thredup.com/Undisclosed\">www.thredup.com/Undisclosed</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>#undisclosed  #freekeithdavisjr</div>\n",
