This week Prof Steve Keen, a Brexit supporter, says the whole affair should be put on hold whilst the world copes with COVID-19. Phil Dobbie asks whether a deal will ever be reached anyway? Did the UK really think it would secure a tariff-free relationship if it didn’t adhere to rules on government subsidies. Rules that are surely being broken right now as cash handouts are rife to protect businesses that face closure because of the virus. And every free trade agreement always has a clause about opening up public procurement, the terms of which are complicated.
