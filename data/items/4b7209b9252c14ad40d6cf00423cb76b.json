  "title": "Are the Warriors Back? Inside the Title Race and Potential Trades With Marcus Thompson | Ringer NBA Show",
  "description": "The Athletic’s Marcus Thompson joins Kevin O’Connor for a deep dive on the Golden State Warriors’ 2021-22 season. Marcus shares his insight into how the Warriors have balanced their short-term goals for getting the most out of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green and their long-term goals for developing young talent to avoid a down period once their stars are gone (0:45). Then KOC and Marcus discuss two other teams in the league that have overhauled their rosters, while keeping their key players in place, the Bulls and Lakers, and how all three teams share a need for on-court sacrifice (17:30), and whether Steve Kerr can mirror the adaptability the Warriors are requiring of their players (25:45). Then they talk about Klay Thompson’s recovery and how the Warriors could arrange their players on the floor when he returns to play in December (36:00). Finally, they touch on potential big trades looming on the horizon with the three giant question marks of Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, and Ben Simmons still hanging over the league, which young players the Warriors would be willing to give up, and what other kinds of players they might target (51:00). \nHost: Kevin O’Connor\nGuest: Marcus Thompson II\nAssociate Producer: Sasha Ashall\nLearn more about your ad choices.
