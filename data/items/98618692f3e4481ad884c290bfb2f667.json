  "itunes:summary": "Terms such as “fake news” and “alternative facts” have become common vocabulary in the so-called post-truth era. But there is a sense in which these are just contemporary iterations of a familiar phenomenon: propaganda. Propaganda is not merely concerned with sending messages – its aim is to construct reality as such. In this episode visual artist Jonas Staal elaborates on what he describes as today’s arena of the propaganda (art) struggle.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/jonas-staal-propaganda-art-in-the-21st-century\nJonas Staal: Propaganda Art in the 20th Century (Machine Listening)\n\nMachine Listening\n17 February, 2020\nMelbourne Law School, Carlton\nPresented by Melbourne Law School, Curatorial Practice at Monash University and Liquid Architecture.\n\nAudio: Mara Schwerdtfeger\nImage: Jonas Staal\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
