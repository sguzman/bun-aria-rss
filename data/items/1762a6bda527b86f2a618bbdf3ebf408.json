  "description": "<p>There is so much more to handling your finances and investing well, than just knowing the correct information. Oftentimes we’re blind to the factors all around us, including our own tendencies and biases which can have a much bigger impact on how well we money. Willpower is limited and context matters way more than we might think. That’s why we're pumped to sit down with Dr. Daniel Crosby- he is a psychologist and behavioral finance expert who helps folks understand the intersection of their minds and their money. Daniel is a NYT bestselling author on behavioral finance, and his latest book The Behavioral Investor, looks at the psychology, physiology, and sociology of financial decision making. By the end of this episode, you’ll have a better understanding of what steps you need to take in order to be a successful investor.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Hoplanta by Atlanta Brewing Co which you can find on Untappd.
