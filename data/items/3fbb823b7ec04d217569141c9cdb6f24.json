  "description": "<p>The Commissariat Store in Brisbane is the second oldest building in the city and dates back to the early years when Brisbane was a penal colony. The penal settlement in Brisbane was the most violent and toughest on the continent. Convict laborers were used to build many of the early buildings in the settlement, which included the store. A violent confrontation during that construction seems to have led to at least one haunting at the store, but there could be more spirits hanging around this building that now houses a museum that includes some morbid artifacts among its displays. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Commissariat Store. The Moment in Oddity features Posthumous Executions and This Day in History features Florence Lawrence Committing Suicide. We also have the eighth installment in the third series of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition!
