  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys overreact to everything that happened in week 4 of the NFL season including last night's dogfight between the Patriots and Buccaneers, whether or not the Steelers are dead after Big Ben's performance against the Packers, Aaron Rodgers throwing his 420th TD pass and his gamesmanship with Mike Tomlin, if the Cardinals are the best team in the NFL, the Colts beating the hell out of the Dolphins, the Jets and Giants getting their first wins of the season, and all the drama surrounding Urban Meyer this weekend (:26-43:21, 1:15:54-1:43:50). Joining the program fresh off a big win in Atlanta against the Falcons, is the Quarterback of the Washington Football Team, Taylor Heinicke. Pat, Taylor, & AJ chat about his rise to becoming the starting QB of the Football team, his time in the XFL, what he's learned from guys like Alex Smith, Ryan Fitzpatrick, and Ron Rivera, why he was overlooked coming out of college, and if he's had a moment to sit back and enjoy himself after a crazy year (45:25-57:43). Next, 9 year NFL veteran at Defensive Back, host of the Man-To-Man podcast, Everything DB, Darius Butler joins Pat and AJ for overreaction Monday and covers who he likes tonight, his thoughts on Sunday Night Football, if the Steelers are dead, which defense he was most impressed with, dealing with injuries during the season as a DB, and much more (57:47-1:14:44).
