  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, under the state constitution of Pennsylvania, the voting system can only be changed by the legislature. These changes require two consecutive sessions of the State Assembly and the public must be informed - this did not happen in this election and disenfranchised the citizenry and the voters. An omnibus bill known as Act 77 circumvented the legal process and was challenged but was rejected by the rogue state Supreme Court because the Court claimed the Republicans waited too long to bring the case (latches). This is problematic because the plaintiffs had no standing until the election occurred. This problem must be posed as a federal question and the plaintiffs must appeal this issue directly to the US Supreme Court. This must be fixed in Pennsylvania now or it will resurface in the future and no remedy needs to be fashioned by the US Supreme Court, but for the existing law to be upheld. If not, the electors will statutorily present their votes to Congress on January 6th and their votes will be recorded. This will not end if we do not return to a lawful and constitutional voting practice. Then, Joe Biden's choices for his would-be cabinet are a choice between Trotskyites and Stalinists, not between progressives or moderates. Later, President Trump got more votes than any other President and 11 million more votes than he did in 2016. Trump's support among Black voters grew by 50% and he made tremendous gains with Hispanic voters as well. These stats simply don't add up to a Trump loss. Afterward, Sidney Powell gets maligned by the Washington Post as a conspiracy theorist when it's that very publication that perpetuated the Russian hoax conspiracy theory in its pages. Yet the media is happy to discuss would-be President Joe Biden breaking his foot playing with his dog.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
