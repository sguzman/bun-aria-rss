  "description": "<p>In this story of a dangerous magician from Russian folklore, you'll learn that you should maybe believe your spouse if she says you definitely don't want to know what's behind that door in the dungeon. It's the bizarre, sad, and kind of hilarious story of Koschei the Deathless, a man who seems like a much more serious and dangerous version of the Ice King from Adventure Time. Really, if you're horrible sorcerer who's a little lonely, maybe stop kidnapping princesses and just get a cat. Or a hobby. I hear podcasting is fun?<br>Really, though, this is exactly the type of story I love doing on this podcast. I doubt you've heard it, but it is scary, ridiculous, and a little sad, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p><br>The creature of the week is the Boo Hag, a morning breath vampire, and she's a great reason for you to chew an onion before going to bed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Link to iTunes for reviews/subscriptions: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/myths-and-legends/id990897842\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/myths-and-legends/id990897842</a></p>\n<p>Link to the site: <a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com\">https://www.mythpodcast.com</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
