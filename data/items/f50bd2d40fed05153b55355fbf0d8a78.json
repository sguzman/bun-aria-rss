    "media:description": "This is why we don't rush out a review on Day 1. At launch, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G was struggling to compete against some of the Google and Samsung flagships, most notably in the camera department and 5G compatibility. Two months later and the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is looking better than ever. Not only has it been certified with Verizon's 5G network, but it's received several big camera updates that significantly boosts performance across all main camera sensors. There's now even a ultra high-end model with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage for those wanting even more power.\n\nOnePlus 10 Pro 5G on Amazon:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OCIA9f\n\nOnePlus 10 Pro 5G (12GB RAM; 256GB Storage):\nhttps://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-10-pro\n\nSlashdot: https://www.slashdot.org\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/slashdot\nVideo Twitter: https://twitter.com/SlashdotTV\nMain Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdot\nVideo Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdottv\nSlashdot MERCH: https://www.slashdotstore.com/",
