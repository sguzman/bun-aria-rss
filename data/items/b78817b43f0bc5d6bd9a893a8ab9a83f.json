  "description": "<p>The girls head into the big city for Shannon's 28th trip around the sun. What starts as a pleasant experience drinking champagne and slurping down snails quickly escalates into what can only be described as... The Box. Anna Grace gives her predictions for Shannon's next season of life in 28 and where the streets might lead her. You'll learn what oddly specific rules AG has on her movie consumption, an important update on Bridgerton, and a VERY unlikely run in with a previous boss will have loyal listeners hanging on to every word in episode 13: The Birthday Box. </p>",
