  "title": "#286: Jan Broberg and “Abducted in Plain Sight”, Part 1",
  "description": "<p>Lisa, Jim and Laura, sit down with a very special guest this week. In 2013, Lisa cast actress Jan Broberg on an episode of Criminal Minds, as a mother in despair that her son had been kidnapped. What Lisa didn’t know was that in real life, Jan herself had been kidnapped, not once, but TWICE by a close family friend. Years later, Jan would tell her incredible story in the Netflix documentary “Abducted in Plain Sight”. Jim and Laura break down this offender’s behavior and his grooming of not only Jan, but of her family and an entire community. Laura teaches Jan a very important term she had never heard of before regarding her own case...“coercive control”. You won’t want to miss this.</p><p>You can watch the trailer here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLC-Fgfz6n4 \" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLC-Fgfz6n4 </a></p><p><br></p><p>#hernameisJanBroberg</p><p>#netflix</p><p>#abductedinplainsight</p><p><br></p><p><strong>We are so thankful to our sponsors for their generous support that allows us to bring you our show.
