  "description": "<p>Fabric industry veteran David Klaristenfeld has spent sixteen busy years at Fabricut, but 2019 has been particularly eventful. This summer, his company acquired Clarence House, and has ramped up a whirlwind effort to grow the boutique fabric brand. Their first big move? Pulling the collection offline, so it can’t be sold to the general public—only designers. In this episode of the <i>Business of Home </i>podcast, Klaristenfeld chats with host Dennis Scully about the strategy behind the acquisition, the challenging economics of sampling, and why, despite a lot of noise, the industry isn’t going to change as radically as some people think. <i>This episode is sponsored by Chairish and Google.</i></p>\n",
