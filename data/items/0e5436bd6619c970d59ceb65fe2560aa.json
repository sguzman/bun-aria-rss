  "description": "<p>GRIT CANNOT BE TAUGHT. What does it mean to be unstoppable? No matter what knocks you down, you stay the course for your goal. It’s not enough to just withstand the struggle. You have to embrace the struggle. That’s what I did when I played football, and it’s what I do in my career today. Fall in love with the pain associated with your passion. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the power of grit with a champion surfer with an inspiring story: Bethany Hamilton. Bethany is a professional surfer, author and motivational speaker. At the age of 13, Bethany lost her left arm to a 14-foot tiger shark, which seemed to end her dream career as a surfer. However, one month after the attack, Bethany returned to surfing and within two years had won her first national surfing title. Bethany’s foundation of faith has been her backbone; her source of truth, hope, and strength. At 17 years old, she realized her dream of surfing professionally, and she is still an active surf competitor to this day. Bethany talks about her journey to become a mother and what it’s taught her. She also reveals the lessons her parents taught her that allowed her to get back on the board after losing her arm. So get ready to learn all about how to be unstoppable on Episode 841.<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/841 and follow at www.instagram.com/lewishowes.</p>\n",
