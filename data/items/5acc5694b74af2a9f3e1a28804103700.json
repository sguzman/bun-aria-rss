  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Brain health impacts every single area of our lives, including our quality of life as we age. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease are becoming increasingly more common, but this growing epidemic is not a normal or inevitable part of aging. Genetic predisposition only drives around 5% of cases, so the power is in our hands to implement healthy habits and prevention strategies to ward off neurodegeneration.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Today’s guest, Dr. Dominic D’Agostino, is an expert in neuroscience and neuropharmacology. He is a tenured associate professor at the University of South Florida, a research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, and the creator of the website, Keto Nutrition. Dom’s impressive resume also includes working as a research investigator on NASA’s Extreme Environment Mission Operation.
