  "description": "Last week we covered the quarterbacks and this week we're hitting all the other positions, previewing the top prospects in each group. On this episode Ryan Wilson joins Will Brinson to break down the top wide receivers and tight ends in the 2021 NFL Draft. But first, the guys offer their reactions to the end of a super impressive career from Alex Smith (4:15). Smith announced his retirement on Monday after years as an above-average quarterback and one of the most miraculous comebacks in league history. Then, Ryan dishes his Top 10 WR prospect rankings (13:15). Pay attention to names like Rondale Moore, Amari Rodgers and Tylan Wallace as we get to Day 2 and beyond. But up top is where the real focus is as Ja'Marr Chase, DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle are in a class of their own. We analyze what's so special about their games and where they could be selected. Then, our attention shifts to the tight ends led by Kyle Pitts (41:00). There more than likely won't be another TE picked in the 1st round, but still plenty to be impressed by and potentially surprised by in this class. \nCheck out Ryan's Big Board here: www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-draft-2021-big-board-top-150-kyle-pitts-jamarr-chase-crack-top-three-in-class-deep-at-wr-cb-and-ol/\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
