  "description": "No matter which of his popular TV programs he’s worked on -- from the Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods to MSNBC’s What’s Eating America? -- chef Andrew Zimmern has always found comfort in sharing meals with families. His latest show, Family Dinner (streaming now on Discovery Plus), centers around how Americans with different backgrounds and cultures value the simplicity and importance of gathering around the supper table. On today’s episode of Homemade, host Martie Duncan welcomes Andrew to chat about Family Dinner as well as supporting our local restaurants, the food memories that come back to him when he thinks about his grandmother’s apron, and what dish he’d make if he were to ever battle fellow television personality and chef Bobby Flay.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
