  "content": "<p>So I’ve been messing around with Shiny for a year or so now.  It’s great tool and getting greater.</p>\n\n<p><strong>the good:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>capability to rapidly build an interactive visualization with the full universe of R packages to choose from for the computation engine and visualization options.</li>\n  <li>ability to code and house the visualization/app in the same language/place as the code that actually conducts the analysis.</li>\n  <li>integrates seamlessly into analyst’s workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>the bad:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>sharing can be hard</li>\n  <li>developed by analysts, used by analysts … and maybe others</li>\n  <li>need to download and run R to power app</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>the ugly:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>if your app is ugly, it doesn’t have to be! Make it prettier with one of the 951,233,521 R graphics packages out there.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sharing-shiny-apps\">Sharing Shiny apps</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: Rstudio Shiny Server:</strong>  If you have a linux server and the IT chops to configure it, you can set up your very own <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server#shiny-server\">Shiny Server</a> to host your whizbang Shiny apps.\nWe actually set one up at my company, and it is pretty awesome… however I didn’t set it up and I don’t pay for the server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: Shinyapps.io:</strong> If you’re just a mere human, like myself, without a server running in your house to host your app on some domain (which also costs $$), \n<a href=\"http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html\">shinyapps.io</a> is for you!</p>\n\n<p>It’s pretty nifty.  You can deploy all your apps to the cloud by interacting soley with R and a little configuration within the shinyapps.io interface in the web browser.<br />\nFor free.</p>\n\n<p>Shinyapps.io is the successor to the Glimmer and Spark hosting services Rstudio experimented around 2012-2013.  I setup a Glimmer account last year (which still works as of now – October 2014).  You actually interact with Rstudio in the internet browser.  I never established a steady workflow… unsure if I should be developing my apps locally and then SSHing into the Glimmer server and copying the apps there, or developing on the server’s file system…</p>\n\n<p>In any case, shinyapps.io makes things even easier.  Simply develop and test your apps locally on your computer, and when you’re ready to deploy to the world, you simply run:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><span class=\"w\">\t</span><span class=\"n\">deployApp</span><span class=\"p\">()</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-started-with-shinyappsio\">Getting started with shinyapps.io</h3>\n\n<p>A comprehensive walkthrough can be found <a href=\"http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html\">here</a>.  But the gist of it is pretty simple.</p>\n\n<p>First register for an account <a href=\"https://www.shinyapps.io/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then run the following R code:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><span class=\"n\">require</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'devtools'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"n\">devtools</span><span class=\"o\">::</span><span class=\"n\">install_github</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'rstudio/shinyapps'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"n\">require</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'shinyapps'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"n\">shinyapps</span><span class=\"o\">::</span><span class=\"n\">setAccountInfo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'yourUserNameHere'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">token</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'yourTokenHere'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">secret</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'yourSecretHere'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Then navigate to directory of app</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><span class=\"n\">setwd</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'/Users/whoeverYouAre/yourShinyApps/yourFavoriteApp'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"n\">deployApp</span><span class=\"p\">()</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>And voila - you’ve deployed yourFavoriteApp Shiny App to the world… viewable at the URL something like: https://yourUsersName.shinyapps.io/yourFavoriteApp/</p>\n\n<p>shinyapps.io is still very much a work-in-progress.  For example, It’s currently <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps/issues/23\">not possible to delete deployed apps</a>.  However, for \nfree hosting of multiple apps with an easy-to-use R and web interface and unintrusive workflow, it’s pretty good start.</p>\n\n<p>###Proof that it works:</p>\n\n<p>This is a visualization around the <a href=\"http://www.personal.psu.edu/j5j/IPIP/\">IPIP-NEO personality test</a>.  I generated some fake personalities for some familiar names (if you’re a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones\">GoT</a> geek).</p>\n\n<p>Also viewable at the URL: <a href=\"https://brooksandrew.shinyapps.io/ipipex/\">https://brooksandrew.shinyapps.io/ipipex/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (9/1/2015):</strong> It appears I’ve been bumping up against my monthly limit of free hours with shinyapps.io, so if the app below is not rendered, that’s why.  If you’re hosting an app on a website like this, you can change Idle Instance Timeout time in Settings to 5 minutes instead of the default of 15 to conserve some hours.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://brooksandrew.shinyapps.io/ipipex/\" style=\"border: none; width: 1000px; height: 1000px\"></iframe>\n\n  <p><a href=\"http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/deploying-apps-with-shinyapps-io/\">Deploying Shiny apps with shinyapps.io</a> was originally published by andrew brooks at <a href=\"http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog\">andrew brooks</a> on October 11, 2014.</p>"
