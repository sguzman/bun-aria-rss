  "title": "255: The View of American Turmoil from the Other Side of the World | Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche",
  "description": "We have spent the past few episodes talking with black and white Americans about race. But for this episode I wanted to get the view from outside. So I called up a man on the other side of the planet who is widely recognized to be one of the world's greatest living meditation masters. Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche is the author of such books as The Joy of Living and In Love with the World. He’s only in his mid-forties - which is young by my standards - but as the child of another great meditation master, he began doing long retreats in his teens. He now teaches all over the world, with centers on five continents. He's known for his candor and humor. We cover an enormous range of topics here, including: love, hate, panic, boredom, relationships, death, and whether we humans are fundamentally good. And as a bonus, he guides a brief meditation toward the end. Quick audio note: Mingyur Rinpoche spoke to us from his busy home in Kathmandu, Nepal, so you'll occasionally hear some background noises, including barking dogs. Try to use your practice to just let it go.\nWhere to find Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche online:\nWebsite: https://tergar.org/about/mingyur-rinpoche/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mingyurrinpoche\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mingyur.rinpoche/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mingyurrinpoche/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/MingyurRinpoche\nBook Mentioned:\nIn Love with the World: A Monk's Journey Through the Bardos of Living and Dying: https://www.amazon.com/Love-World-Journey-Through-Bardos/dp/0525512535\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Health Care Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/mingyur-rinpoche-255\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
