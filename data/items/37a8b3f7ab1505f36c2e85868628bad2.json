  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the moment we learn we’re going to be moms, the decision points begin to roll in quickly. Whether we’re unsure about pacifier styles and sleep training methods,  or we’re researching the best time to get our kids a phone and leave them home alone, motherhood is made up of choices big and small. These decisions can leave us anxious and exhausted if we don’t know how to discern what is best in our own unique situation. In this episode, Emily and Laura revisit the topic of personal conscience—what it is, how it works, and how we honor other moms who make different decisions. Scripture may not directly address every topic we face in modern motherhood, but we can trust that as the Spirit works in us, our conscience will align more and more to God’s will for our lives as we pursue him.</span></p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our generous donors.
