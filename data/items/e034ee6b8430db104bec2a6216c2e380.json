  "description": "Best known for his role in the smash hit television show Glee, but most devoted to his career as a writer of 15 books, Chris Colfer had a bucket list of goals at age 5. And unbelievably, he achieved everything on that bucket list as a writer and singer. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Chris Colfer talks about drive and ambition, the influence of a grandmother who always believed in him and yet was his harshest critic, and how he overcame bullying from his peers and doubt from an industry that told him he would never succeed.   This episode is brought to you by:   EightSleep. Right now get $150 off your Pod and free shipping when you go to EightSleep.com/IMPACT Impact Theory University. Check out Impact Theory University at: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ImpactTheoryUniversity2\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly/ImpactTheoryUniversity2</a> Audible. Start listening with a 30-day Audible trial and your first audiobook plus two Audible Originals are free.
