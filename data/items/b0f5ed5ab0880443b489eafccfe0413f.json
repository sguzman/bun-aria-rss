  "description": "<p>Get out of that Country A** nonsense, pull up your denim and get ready for the get down. We got a hot new anthem for REAL MOMMIES ONLY. Plus, Tommy ran into Joey \"Try Eating This and Living\" Diaz on a flight and, yeah, meltdown came soon after. Real husbands say, \"Show me how those big T**s fart\" to their wives and maybe now, you will too? Pastor Manning is completely insane and we have the audio to prove it. REAL TALK is back and we are ready to ROAST the Duggars wildly selfish lifestyle. This episode is offensive. </p>\n",
