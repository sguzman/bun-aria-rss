  "description": "<p>Episode 217 - Do you like improv comedy? How about theatre? Well I love both of these things and was excited to speak to Lee Overtree, who is the creative director behind Story Pirates in New York City. His program takes stories written by kids and turns them into stage shows/radio plays. Lee also has a history within independent music and was influenced heavily by the DIY emo/punk scene. It’s what I like to call one of my favorite “secret punk” episodes in which a person who isn’t necessarily doing anything that you’d immediately define as punk, but under the surface is completely punk. We discuss how his life was changed by Jon Stewart (yes, THE John Stewart), making art for kids and the DIY mentality.
