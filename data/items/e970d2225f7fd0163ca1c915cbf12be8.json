  "title": "Mona Lena Krook, \"Violence Against Women in Politics\" (Oxford UP, 2020)",
  "description": "Mona Lena Krook examines the unique phenomena of violence against women in politics, which is distinct from the broader concern and issue of violence against women in general. Krook pulls together global experiences in regard to this issue, noting that violence against women in politics is not confined to any particular region or part of the world. The research also indicates that this is not just physical violence or force, but also includes psychological violence, economic violence, sexual violence, threats, and harassment, and semiotic violence, a newer category to be included with the other classifications of violence against women in politics. \nViolence Against Women in Politics (Oxford UP, 2020) also explores the violence that is directed towards women who are not in elected office but are working in areas or fields that are directly connected to electoral or appointed political offices, namely women who are working in human rights areas or with human rights organizations, and women who are members of the press or media. Krook explains that her research in the book centers around this issue of violence against women in politics because that violence, in whatever form it takes, is designed to keep women from fully participating in politics and in the public sphere. Krook has also developed a number of websites with information and further connections to work towards the end of violence against women in politics, including the companion website for the book itself: https://www.vawpolitics.org/, and the collaborative #NotTheCost website hosted by the National Democratic Institute.\nLilly J. Goren is professor of political science at Carroll University in Waukesha, WI. She is co-editor of the award winning book, Women and the White House: Gender, Popular Culture, and Presidential Politics (University Press of Kentucky, 2012), as well as co-editor of Mad Men and Politics: Nostalgia and the Remaking of Modern America (Bloomsbury Academic, 2015).
