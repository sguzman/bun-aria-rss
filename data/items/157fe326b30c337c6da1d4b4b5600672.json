  "itunes:summary": "Bishop Taylor Smith, former Chaplain General to the Forces, once had a conversation with a young man that went like this:\nBishop: ‘When you think about the cross of Christ, what do you see?’\nYoung man: ‘I see Christ and two thieves crucified either side of him…’\nBishop: ‘What else do you see?’\nYoung man: ‘I see the soldiers gambling…’\nBishop: ‘If that is all you see, I think you will have trouble with the Christian life. When I see the cross – with all that – I see old Bishop Taylor Smith. I was crucified with Christ.’\nIn the New Testament passage for today, the apostle Paul expounds and explains what it means to have been ‘crucified with Christ’. We are ‘in Christ Jesus’. ‘We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life’ (Romans 6:4). ‘We entered into the new country of grace – a new life in a new land!’ (Romans 6:3, MSG).\nSoon after encountering Jesus I wrote, ‘I died in February 1974. My old life was buried. From then onwards I have walked in newness of life. It really does seem like that. Life before was so absolutely and completely different.’\nThrough the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, you are able to live and enjoy ‘a new life.’ In the passages for today, we see how this was anticipated in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament.",
