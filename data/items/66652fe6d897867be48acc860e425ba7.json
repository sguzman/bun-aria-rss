  "description": "<p>ANOTHER OLYMPICS ARE HERE! Yes that's right, it's time to get PUMPED as we move into our second Olympics in less than a year and this time get to the REAL Olympics by pumping up the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics with our MASSIVE preview episode to get you fully into the winter zone! We go over all the medal hopes for both Australia and Canada and talk up just why these games look set to be so exciting for both countries. We also go over some other big names and events to keep a close eye on during the games, talk up our love for the mascots of the Olympics, give our hopes for the Opening Ceremony and talk up TEAM OTP and why the curse may finally go in the purse for good when it comes to medal hopes for our former guests! Added to that all the other regular fun of every episode we do as well as some extra Ester Ledecka love for good measure, and this is the one episode you simply can't miss ahead of the Beijing Olympics! So strap yourselves in for one hell of an entertaining ride and BRING ON THE OLYMPICS!</p>",
