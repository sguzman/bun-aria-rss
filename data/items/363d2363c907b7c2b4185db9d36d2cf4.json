  "title": "Speech Language Pathology (TALKING DOGS... AND PEOPLE) with Christina Hunger",
  "description": "<p>Talking dogs. Rolled Rs. That dangly thing in the back of your throat. Speech impediments. Alternative forms of communication. And talking cats. World famous speech pathologist by day, dog whisperer also by day, Christina Hunger MA, CCC-SLP joins us to talk about what those letters after her name mean, helping people literally find their voice, AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication), different types of language and communication, and how she applied the same principles to gift her dog with the ability to emotionally manipulate her. A tale as old as time. Learn about emerging schools of thought around the ethics of differing modes of interpersonal communication, and just maybe how you can teach your most beloved angels how to demand more cheese in plain language. </p>\n<p>Also: WARD'S DOING A VIRTUAL LIVE SHOW ON MAY 18TH.
