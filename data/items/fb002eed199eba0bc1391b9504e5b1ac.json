  "title": "Aperiology (MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY) with Joseph Saunders",
  "description": "<p>Lights! Cameras! Arachnids! And lizards and bees and beetles. Macro photography is like magic: curved glass gives an entirely new take on the world, from dust on a cricket’s brow to a curious mantid stare to the elegant symmetry of spider whiskers. Joseph Saunders is an Oklahoma-based wildlife photographer whose larger-than-life photos of bugs and reptiles will make you realize just how little we appreciate the creatures on our window sills and skittering up our porches. We talk shop about cameras, bug hunts, lenses, patience, Moth Week, BlackAFinSTEM, and also getting into nature with different mobility concerns. Alie is a shameless, rabid fan of Joseph and asked Patrons to help concoct an -ology to describe the art + science of his macro photography. Aperiology now exists to describe the tiny aperture used to keep these creatures in focus, and the huge world it opens up to us.</p>\n<p>Support Joseph’s photography at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/jdmonroe\">Patreon.com/jdmonroe</a></p>\n<p>Joseph’s website: <a href=\"https://paraherpetologica.com/\">https://paraherpetologica.com/</a></p>\n<p>Follow Joseph at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/reelsonwheels\">www.instagram.com/reelsonwheels</a></p>\n<p>Follow him at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jdmonroe210\">Twitter.com/jdmonroe210</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BlackAFinSTEM\">twitter.com/BlackAFinSTEM</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to the American Chronic Pain Association: <a href=\"https://www.theacpa.org/\">www.theacpa.org/</a> </p>\n<p>Sponsor links: <a href=\"http://kiwico.com/ologies\">kiwico.com/ologies</a>; </p>\n<p>For more links: <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/aperiology\">alieward.com/ologies/aperiology</a> </p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and uh...bikinis?
