  "description": "In today's stories, we venture into familiar locations like a bar in Texas and a subway stop in Japan. Familiar places that all of us can hold both friends...and foes alike. Come close and listen to these harrowing tales of friendship and betrayal. First, we follow a detective on a legendary case into the backwoods of Texas. Next, we’ll buy our first used car, and receive all of the “baggage” that comes with it. After that, a birthday toy that is much more than it seems. And finally, we’ll pass along a grisly story that bears repeating.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
