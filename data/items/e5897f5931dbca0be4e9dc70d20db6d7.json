  "description": "<p>Back to the USSR! Talking about Mother Russia's long history with BRUTAL various secret police agencies terrorizing its own people today on the Suck. Gonna go over the GULAG forced labor camps, gonna talk about the US vs. USSR Cold War spy game, a brief history of spy and secret police agencies in non-Russian parts of the world, and so much more in a Suck that gets about as dark as a show can in various moments. Be glad you don't live in constant fear of the government throwing you in a brutal prison, torturing you, and killing you because they don't like the way you look or think.
