  "description": "Listener favorite Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, chief investment officer at Praetorian Capital and author of Kuppy’s Event Driven Monitor (KEDM), is back on the show today.  We kick it off with a discussion of the economic sanctions placed on Russia. Are they enough, and what about the risks to global businesses? Kuppy explains why the situation could lead to Lehman Brothers-scale bankruptcies outside of Russia. [2:30]  One beneficiary of the market uncertainty is oil. Listen as Kuppy breaks down why today’s high prices are only the beginning… [7:40] Uranium continues to move higher as governments look to replace “dirty energy” like coal and oil. Kuppy shares what investors should pay attention to beyond the price of uranium… how he’s investing in the sector… and the most contrarian trade in today’s market. [16:00] Finally, Kuppy’s newsletter, KEDM, is a great idea generator. He gives us the background story on how it got started… and who his research helps. [26:50] Enjoyed this episode?
