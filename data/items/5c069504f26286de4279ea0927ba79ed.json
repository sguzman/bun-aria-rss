    "media:description": "Kubernetes is an amazingly powerful and flexible platform that introduces a range of new complexities and required knowledge. Sometimes we need that all that control, but sometimes developers just need a scalable, reliable and low friction place to run our micro-services.\nAzure Container Apps aims to meet this need by providing an opinionated Kubernetes environment configured with battle-tested opensource components and management practices.\nThis session will showcase a day in the life of a development team using Azure Container Apps and Dapr to see if the control trade-off lives up to its promise.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcmelbourne.com/",
