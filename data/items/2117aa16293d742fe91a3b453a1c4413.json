John-David realizes he's missing $1,250, and the culprit is his 7-year-old son. Si gets ready to take a belt to John-David to teach him a little Parenting 101.

And the boys delve into Si's free-spirited nudist days, laughing at Si's drill sergeant, Godwin's smoooooth answer to a question about his favorite trophy, Martin's philosophy on child discipline, and whether it's true that \"it hurts me worse than it hurts you.\"\n~\nLearn more about your ad choices.
