  "description": "In Episode #221, I sit down with Dr Satchin Panda to continue The Proof’s conversation on time restricted eating. We discuss circadian rhythms, circadian disruption, and health impacts. We also cover TRE in the context of circadian biology, blood glucose, and calorie restriction. Dr Panda offers his advice on the optimal TRE lifestyle.\nTime-restricted eating (TRE) has caused a stir on social media in recent years. Many studies on TRE are misrepresented online, with people drawing absolute conclusions that often don’t consider all the data. Dr Panda joins me in this episode to look further into TRE, with a focus on circadian rhythm.\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nCircadian Rhythms (2:20)\n\nWhy Circadian Disruption is a Problem (9:35)\n\nDr. Panda’s Early Research (15:29)\n\nWhat Causes Sleep Deprivation (21:05)\n\nDisease & Circadian Disruption (26:07)\n\nLight Exposure (28:59)\n\nTime Restricted Eating (35:19)\n\nOptimal Eating Window (43:57)\n\nImpact on Blood Glucose (57:51)\n\nTRE vs Calorie Restriction (1:03:35)\n\nAddressing Concerns (1:24:12)\n\nIs Fasting Safe for Everyone? (1:26:52)\n\nExtended Fasts (1:35:35)\n\nBig Picture (1:39:00)\n\nOutro (1:43:14)\n\n\nTo connect with Dr Satchin Panda, you can find him on Twitter and read his peer reviewed papers on Google Scholar. To learn more about circadian biology, his books, The Circadian Code and The Circadian Diabetes Code, are an incredible resource. You can also better understand your circadian rhythm while contributing to research with Dr Panda’s app, myCircadianClock.\nThe best way to support the show is to use the products and services offered by our sponsors.
