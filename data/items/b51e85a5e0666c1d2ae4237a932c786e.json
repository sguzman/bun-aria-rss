  "description": "On this weeks episode we sit down with Aerospace engineer, Madison Dye....Madison is also the editor / producer of our podcast. We met Madison the way we meet a lot of people - through a cold email. Maddy sent us an email a few months back and suggested we start a podcast and 6 months later, here we are recording our 13th episode of the Colin and Samir Podcast. For those of you who don't know, Colin and I actually met through a cold email - I saw some videos he was making and sent him an email. Cold email is often times how ideas get turned into action. \nSo why did we respond to Maddy's email? What caught our attention? And how can you be more successful in your cold outreach? We cover all of this and more on this episode of The Colin and Samir Podcast.",
