This one is extra insane!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out that every town has something to complain about, that if your dog brings home a leg, you should maybe ignore it, and that some people are even sicker than you thought possible!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
