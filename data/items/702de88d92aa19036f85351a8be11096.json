  "description": "<div>On April 23, EU leaders met virtually to try to come to an agreement for a common European response to the COVID-19 pandemic. What were the measures taken? Will they be sufficient? Did Europe come together for a coordinated response to the crisis? Or did the meeting further highlight the cracks between member states? This week, Guntram Wolff and Giuseppe Porcaro are joined by Maria Demertzis and André Sapir to comment on the EU Council meeting. <br>\n<br>\n<em>This podcast is a member of the </em><a href=\"https://www.bullemedia.eu/europod\"><em>Europod network</em></a><em>. </em>\n</div>\n",
