  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason shares his thoughts on a pair of disgruntled superstar wide receivers in the NFL: the San Francisco 49ers' Deebo Samuel and the Tennessee Titans' AJ Brown. Both guys scrubbed their social media pages in an effort to gain a little leverage over their respective teams...and promptly got ripped by anonymous sources, team reporters and local fans. This makes no sense. The Niners offense is built almost entirely around Samuel's unique skillset and Trey Lance is on a rookie deal; Why wouldn't San Francisco back up the Brinks trunk for Deebo right now? The Titans were the #1 seed in the AFC last season and Brown is easily the most explosive player on their roster. If you remove him from the offense, are we sure Tennessee is even the best team in a watered down AFC South? Both of these guys deserve to get paid. Later, our fearless leader shares a few thoughts on Monday night's NBA Playoff action. The Philadelphia 76ers have beaten the brakes off the injury-ravaged Toronto Raptors - even with James Harden looking like a shell of himself. In the Western Conference, it's clear to see why Jalen Brunson and Jordan Poole are poised to get big deal this offseason after they both lit up the scoreboard in wins by the Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors, respectively.
