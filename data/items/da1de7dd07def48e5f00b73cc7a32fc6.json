  "description": "Donald Trump's track record as an international deal-maker is perfect.  He still has not made one major deal of any sort anywhere with anyone (except maybe with a nice gentleman in Moscow, but we'll leave that be for now.). He has undone a bunch of deals--from the Paris Accord to TPP to the Iran nuclear deal.  He has announced some deals that weren't really deals--from the \"breakthrough\" with North Korea to the \"breakthrough with Europe\" on trade to the \"breakthrough\" with Mexico on trade.  And he has also promised some deals that never materialized--from getting Mexico to build the wall to a Middle East peace agreement.  On this episode of Deep State Radio join David Sanger of the New York Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Evelyn Farkas of the Atlantic Council as they discuss why Donald Trump may be the worst dealmaker in modern American presidential history.
