  "description": "Today on the Colin and Samir podcast we're talking about social media use...specifically Instagram and the effect it's had on our lives as creators. \nSocial media addiction is a phrase you're probably hearing a lot right now and we're seeing many of our friends deleting these apps off of their phones and taking breaks from them, something we've done ourselves recently. \nWe've actually been taking a break from content creation in general and as you probably know this is our first episode back in almost a month. \nIn this episode Colin and I dive into our own social media use, what we like, don't like, and how we keep our time on social media apps like Instagram in check. \nTowards the end of the episode we talk about some of Instagram's newest product features that get us excited to create with it moving forward.",
