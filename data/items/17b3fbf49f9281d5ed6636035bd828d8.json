  "description": "JonBenét Ramsey's brutal murder captivated a nation. At the time, the family hired an army of lawyers and refused to talk to police.

Suspects have cropped up, but DNA evidence, behavioral analysis, and expert testimony all provide conflicting theories. Through all the theories, one goal emerges - justice for an innocent girl slain on Christmas.\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
