    "media:description": "This microfluidic device generates bidisperse foam by splitting every second bubble. The alternation is based on a slight change in the distance between the \"pincher\" bubble and the \"wall\" bubble downstream. Simulation done in Aphros https://github.com/cselab/aphros .\nSee article https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01513 for more applications and details.\nCheck out the gallery of interactive fluid simulations https://github.com/cselab/aphros/wiki/Aphros-Explorer",
