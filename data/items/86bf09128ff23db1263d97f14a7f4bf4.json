    "media:description": "When two young Christians were murdered in Kishinev, the heart of Moldova, in 1903, popular journalist Peva Krushevanl seized the opportunity to blame the Jews for their deaths. \n\nUsing his daily newspaper as a personal soapbox, he riled up thousands of Kishinev’s civilians to take revenge against the Jews in a deadly pogrom which killed 49 people. \n\nThis attack inspired Jewish poet Chaim Nachman Bialik to publish works to awaken the Jewish spirit and successfully invoked Jews across the world to take action against the rampant antisemitism in Europe. \n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video— 1972 Olympics: The Munich Massacre https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3K9VJ6dhNQ&list=PL-DNOnmKkUaZm05dqTOHEquVVOmEGB9Jm&index=6\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nExecutive Producers:\n— Debra Klein\n— Avi Naider\n— Jerry Ostrov\n— Barry Skolnick\n\nGold Level:\n— Blavatnik Family Foundation\n— The Associated’s Insight Israel Forum\n— The Crane Foundation\n— Aimee & Jerry Ostrov\n— Skolnick Family Charitable Trust\n\nSilver Level:\n— Sig and Miriam Feiger Family Foundation\n— The Messinger Family Charitable Fund\n— Rachie and Jon Teller\n\nBronze Level:\n— The Bernstein Family Foundation\n— Jewish Federation of Broward County\n— Betsy and Philip Darivoff\n— Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit\n— JCRC of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia\n— Marilyn and Neville Isaacson\n— Corie and Michael Koss\n— Steve Miller\n— Pamela Rose\n— Kim and Perry Shwachman\n— Marci and Andrew Spitzer\n\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\n\n— ABC News\n— Biblioteca Naţională Digitală Moldavica\n— Blockchain Travel\n— British Journal of Experimental Pathology\n— Carmel Newsreel\n— David Rumsey Map Collection, David Rumsey Map Center, Stanford Libraries\n— ExBulletin\n— Facebook\n— FEMA\n— Florida Memory \n— Historical Jewish Press website – www.Jpress.org.il – founded by the National Library and Tel — Aviv University\n— Israeli Government Press Office\n— ITN\n— Shlomi Kakon\n— Kibbutz Gan Shmuel Archive\n— Library of Congress\n— MEMRI / Sahar TV\n— NASA\n— National Library of Israel\n— National Portrait Gallery\n— New York Magazine\n— New York Times\n— Bialik House Archive, The National Library of Israel\n— Nadav Mann, BITMUNA.
