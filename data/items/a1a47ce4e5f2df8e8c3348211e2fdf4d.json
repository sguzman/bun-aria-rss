  "description": "The Verge crew is on our way back home after a week at the Consumer Electronics Show 2018. This week, we did a ton of reporting, a ton of videos, and four live Circuit Breaker shows, so we did not have a lot of time to sit down and tape a full-length Vergecast. But what we did do was collect a bunch of audio recorded throughout the show — including clips from Circuit Breaker Live — to give you an idea of what it’s like to be at CES, and what kinds of things we saw this year.\n\nEnjoy, and we’ll see you next week.\n\n00:44 - Day -1\n\n03:14 - Day 0\n\n24:54 - Day 1\n\n45:30 - Day 2\n\n1:05:02 - Day 3\nLearn more about your ad choices.
