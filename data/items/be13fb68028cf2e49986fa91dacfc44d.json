  "description": "2010-10-13 - Part 1 - The Art and Science of Meditation - Introductory Series - The first session defines meditation and describes the Buddhist teachings that give a context to the path of practice.  We explore the two basic types of meditation--concentration and mindfulness--and then focus on the ground of mindfulness training: bringing mindful attention to the breath and bodily sensations.  Guided meditations include setting intention and the sacred pause; learning to \"come back\" using an anchor of the breath; and \"being here\" with an embodied presence. Please donate at www.tarabrach.com or www.imcw.org. Thank you!",
