  "description": "<p><strong>Umm...excuse me? Are we living in frickin' Robocop? Maybe! Last week Dan read about the first robotic policeman being introduced in the city of Dubai and now he's having a mental breakdown. He and Connor discuss whether or not robots can be programmed to make moral decisions and, if they can, what the implications might be if society allows those robots to dish out the law right in citizen's faces. Also, they discuss why the episode is a little late, the ol' trolley problem, and what kind of explosives are popular these days. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
