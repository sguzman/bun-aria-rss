  "description": "<p>In 2018, Michael Lewis published “The Fifth Risk,” which argued, in short, that the federal government was underprepared for a variety of disaster scenarios. Guess what his new book is about? Lewis visits the podcast this week to discuss <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/books/review/the-premonition-michael-lewis.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Premonition,”</a> which recounts the initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“It wasn’t just Trump,” Lewis says. “Trump made everything worse. But there had ben changes in the American government, and changes in particular at the C.D.C., that made them less and less capable of actually controlling disease and more and more like a fine academic institution that came in after the battle and tried to assess what had happened; but not equipped for actual battlefield command. The book doesn’t get to the pandemic until Page 160. The back story tells you how the story is going to play out.”</p><p>The historian Annette Gordon-Reed visits the podcast to talk about her new book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/books/review-on-juneteenth-annette-gordon-reed.html\" target=\"_blank\">“On Juneteenth,”</a> which combines history about slavery in Texas with more personal, essayistic writing about her own family and childhood.</p><p>“This is a departure for me, but it is actually the kind of writing that I always thought that I would be doing when I was growing up, dreaming about being a writer,” Gordon-Reed says. “I’ve always been a great admirer of James Baldwin, and Gore Vidal’s essays I thought were wonderful, better than the novels, and that’s the kind of thing that I wanted to do. So it was sort of a dream come true for me to be able to take this form and talk about some things that were very important to me.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history during this year of its 125th anniversary; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Parul Sehgal and John Williams talk about the latest in literary criticism. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed by the critics this week:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/books/review-secret-to-superhuman-strength-alison-bechdel.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Secret to Superhuman Strength”</a> by Alison Bechdel</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/books/review-jackpot-super-rich-michael-mechanic.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Jackpot”</a> by Michael Mechanic</p>\n",
