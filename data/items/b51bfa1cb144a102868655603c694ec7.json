Some of them were planned, like talking about the FCS bracket, reviewing how great it is that FIU's kicker throat-slashed Miami, praising Herm Edwards Brain for being trapped in the NFL, or feeling afraid of Ohio State. Some of them were not planned, like Jason's weird eating habits revealed or Billy Dee William's Grizzly Bear Movie.
