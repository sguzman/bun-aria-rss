  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Friends, I recently had the privilege of speaking with Fr. Mike Schmitz, host of the popular “Bible in a Year” podcast. We spoke at the 2021 Good News Conference, and our conversation ranged over a variety of topics, including our vocation stories, our early efforts on YouTube, our favorite movies, arguing on social media, and much more. We also shared what inspired us to take creative new approaches to the Bible, and how the success of these projects reveals a hunger for a deeper understanding of Scripture.
