  "description": "I’m smitten with the delightful images that Tasha Noel creates. On fabric and in her embroidery, they are darling! We’ll get an insider peek to how Tasha designs and I can’t wait to hear more about how she loves to use decorative stitches as quilting stitches on her machine!\nwww.instagram.com/tashanoel1/\n==============\nI’m delighted that Linda Thielfoldt is my quilt expert joining me every month in 2017. She is an award winning quilter, a teacher, designer, author and she quilts for hire too. But besides all that Linda has a very deep technical knowledge of the quilt making process. Each month we’ll have a chance to dig deep into a topic everyone wants to know about! To kick off the year, we’ll talk about teaching. And more importantly, teaching someone else to quilt so that they love it as much as we do. You are in for a real treat this year getting to know Linda!\nhttp://www.thequiltedgoose.com/\n==================\nFor the second half of my show I will be talking with Gwen Marston. Her work spans folk art, to liberated quilting making, to minimalist styles. Her newest book, I believe #30, is a retrospect of her pieces called ‘A common Thread’. A coffee table book full of amazing photos of her quilts that span her work to this date. Gwen curated the collection and I can’t wait to talk about quilting ‘then’ and ‘now’ … and mostly about how she she developed as an artist through the years.\n===================\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
