  "description": "In preparation for this episode we got on the phone with our favorite people and we interviewed them to get all of their findings and best practices of what’s hot and what’s not, and kind of what categories of carpet are surprisingly doing so much greater than ever in the history. We talk about where we would put carpet, such as in a bedroom or somewhere you want to be more comfortable, especially with bare feet, and then we discuss where you wouldn’t want carpet, like in bathrooms or around your toilet where it can get wet or gross. We discuss various different types and levels of carpet you can have depending on the quality on which you want to walk through your home. <br /><br />Where to put and not to put carpet 3:29<br />Closets 7:21<br />Places not to put carpet 9:06<br />The anatomy of carpet 12:27<br />Wool 16:34<br />The pad 21:28<br />Accent carpet 26:57<br /><br />“One thing that I thought was really interesting is that he said, ‘Probably 10 years ago--’ I think he called it solid surfaces. So hardwood floors, basically, ‘Solid surfaces were only 10% of the home where today they’re 50% of the home.’” 2:18<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
