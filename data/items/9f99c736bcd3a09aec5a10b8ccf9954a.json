  "description": "Let's face it... The OM3 live shows are fire. They're a perfect combination of great guests, great atmosphere, and a whole lot of fun. But the unfortunate aspect of having a live show in a specific city, is that only a select few get to experience it first hand. But thankfully, the boys always remember to hit the record button for these special occasions, and we're happy to share the latest OM3 event that took place this past Wednesday, live from the Crystal Ballroom in Boston. Marcus Smart of the hometown Celtics joins the crew for an amazing night of laughs, a bit of trash talk, some brutal honestly, and good ol' fashioned hoops x's and o's. It was a fantastic night on every level, and you can catch it all right here without getting out of your seat.
