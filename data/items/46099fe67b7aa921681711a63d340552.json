  "description": "Today, we’re going to tackle some of the biggest issues on every investor’s mind: inflation and a potential trade war. First, we’ll consult with John Petrides of Point View Wealth Management. I try to have John on the show at least once a quarter, because he’s incredibly knowledgeable on all areas of the market. John tells us how inflation (specifically, rising wages) could affect stock prices—and why he isn’t worried about an impending “trade war.” He also shares the sectors he likes today... and a few of his favorite stock ideas. Next, I welcome my good friend and 40-year stock market veteran Richard Suttmeier [41:00].   Rich is the best analyst I know when it comes to the federal budget. He explains how the Fed is trying to “unwind” its balance sheet… how its actions could hurt Main Street… and what to expect over the next 12 months.   Rich also reveals which assets he currently likes and which he doesn’t––including one “safe” asset that could soon roll over. Click here to listen. Good investing, Frank Curzio  ",
