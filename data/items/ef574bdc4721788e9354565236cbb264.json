  "title": "264: The Brain Science of Enlightenment | Rick Hanson",
  "description": "Today we’re going to nerd out about what enlightenment (or, if that word is triggering, let’s just call it “high doses of meditation”) can do to your brain — and, more practically, how we can derive these benefits even if we don’t plan to spend decades living in a cave. My guest is Rick Hanson, Ph.D., psychologist and author of the new book Neurodharma. We go into the deep end, yes, but we also get very down-to-earth, talking about how anyone, including you, can “reverse engineer enlightenment,” and have “Nirvana operationalized in your nervous system.” Quick note that this was recorded right before the pandemic, but enlightenment is evergreen.\nWhere to find Rick Hanson online: \nWebsite: https://www.rickhanson.net/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drrhanson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rickhansonphd\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rickhansonphd/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/RickHanson\nBook Mentioned:\nNeurodharma by Rick Hanson: https://www.rickhanson.net/books/neurodharma\nYou can find meditations from our world-class teachers and more wisdom from Rick Hanson on our app. Visit tenpercent.com to download the Ten Percent Happier app and kickstart your meditation practice.
