  "description": "<p>This week, we check out the life of the man who inspired Sylvester Stallone to write the Rocky character. He came from the streets, liking a barroom brawl even more than a fight in the ring. In boxing, he was known mainly for two things, being the bloodiest fighter, maybe in boxing history, and getting a shot, out of nowhere, to fight Muhammad Ali, for the heavyweight championship of the world! Just like Rocky! He spends the rest of his life selling liquor, legally, and for a little while, selling cocaine, illegally. A federal investigation brings an end to that, but years later, he's in hot water, again, this time for being involved with memorabilia counterfeiting!!
