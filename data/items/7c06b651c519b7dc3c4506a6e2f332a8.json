  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">I used to say \"I'm busy\" as an excuse for not losing weight.</p> <p>OMG! I had no idea what a problem saying that was.</p> <p>I always THOUGHT over and over again I was actually too busy. I'd feel justified eating my face off and overwhelmed that if my calendar didn't change...I couldn't change.</p> <p>My AHA came when I quit saying I was busy and started saying I don't need a lot of time to lose weight.</p> <p>Today on the podcast, you'll hear me coach a No BS Woman on how much time it takes to lose weight each week.</p> <p>Listen in and answer each question I ask. I promise this will help you gain perspective on how much time you really need and shit you don't need to do to lose your weight.</p> <p>You'll also hear me coach women on important topics today like...</p> <p>What to do if you've gained weight and you're ready to get back on track.</p> <p>How to adjust your Doable 24 Hour Plan when you planned a <em>burger</em> and in the moment realize \"I don't want that. I want something healthier.\"</p> <p><strong>(This is a must-listen for anyone who is AFRAID to plan \"bad\" foods. It shows that my method WORKS and breaks the good food/bad food mentality.)</strong></p> <p>You'll enjoy this recording from my weekly LIVE and FREE Clubhouse.
