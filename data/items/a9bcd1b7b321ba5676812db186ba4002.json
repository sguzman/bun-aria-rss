Just after 7pm, her car crashed into a tree. A witness spoke to her, offering help, which she refused. And then she vanished into thin air. Nobody has seen or heard from her since. Everybody has a theory: The family knows more than they're saying, the police botched the case and are covering it up, Maura fled her life and started over in Canada. This documentary series attempts to solve the mystery. </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
