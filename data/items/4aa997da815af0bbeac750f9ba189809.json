Simply put, they are critical to our long-term health. Imbalances in the gut ecosystem often trigger or exacerbate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), along with many other issues.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. George Papanicolaou to explain what SIBO is, how they diagnose and treat it in their patients, and why it is almost always paired with a number of other health issues. Dr. Hyman also shares his personal experience battling SIBO along with mercury poisoning.</p><br><p>George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is Board Certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. He is also an Institute for Functional Medicine Practitioner. Upon graduation from his residency he joined the Indian Health Service. He worked on the Navajo reservation for 4 years at the Chinle Comprehensive Medical Facility where he served as the Outpatient Department Coordinator. In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He practiced with a philosophy centered on personal relationships and treating the whole person, not just not the disease. He called that philosophy, “Whole Life Wellness”. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive this kind of personal care Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health—a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine.
