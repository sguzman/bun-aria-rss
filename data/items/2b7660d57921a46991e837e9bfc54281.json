Obviously I am poking fun a bit at the hyperbole there but this chat was spectacular. Joe is a real ass dude that has a lot of experience within the punk/hardcore subculture, is vegan and straight edge which maybe from the surface...you wouldn't pick up on. We had a lively discussion about all of those things and more.
