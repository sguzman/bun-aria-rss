  "description": "<p>Topological string theory has multi-instanton sectors which lead to\nnon-perturbative effects in the string coupling constant and control the large\norder behavior of the perturbative genus expansion. As proposed by Couso,\nEdelstein, Schiappa and Vonk, these sectors can be described by a trans-series\nextension of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations. In this paper we find\nexact, closed form solutions for these multi-instanton trans-series in the case\nof local Calabi-Yau manifolds. The resulting multi-instanton amplitudes turn\nout to be very similar to the eigenvalue tunneling amplitudes of matrix models.\nTheir form suggests that the flat coordinates of the Calabi-Yau manifold are\nnaturally quantized in units of the string coupling constant, as postulated in\nlarge $N$ dualities. Based on our results we obtain a general picture for the\nresurgent structure of the topological string in the local case, which we\nillustrate with explicit calculations in the case of local $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n</p>",
