  "description": "<p>John Wilkes Booth wasn't some community theater bit player. He wasn't a bartender who did summer theater. He was one of the most famous actors of the day and a member of THE most famous acting family of the 19th century. And he killed the President. He killed the President after putting together several failed plans to kidnap the President. He was a heartthrob dubbed by some theater critics as \"the most handsome man in America\". Imagine Ryan Gosling or Tom Hardy trying to kill the President today. That is comparable to what Booth did. His story is fascinating!
