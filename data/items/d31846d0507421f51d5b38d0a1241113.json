  "description": "In August of 1981, a 20-year-old woman in Ohio disappeared in broad daylight from her office. When her boss arrived to find her car still in the parking lot, and signs that she had been there that day, but no trace of her, she was reported missing. Weeks before her disappearance, she had been receiving threatening phone calls, had numerous dreams about being abducted and murdered, and was concerned about a stalker at work. To this day, she has never been found. This is the disappearance of Cynthia Anderson.\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\n﻿1.
