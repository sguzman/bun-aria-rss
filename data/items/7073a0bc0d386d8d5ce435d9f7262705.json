The conversation moves through Dr. James’ experiences as an academic, some of his work in Sumatra, and the ways in which surfing can generate humility.\nJohn Kaag is Professor and Chair of Philosophy at UMass Lowell and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. John W. Traphagan, Ph.D. is Professor and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Fellow in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor in the Program in Human Dimensions of Organizations.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
