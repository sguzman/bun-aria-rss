  "description": "<div>True Crime Tuesday presents I Don't Like Mondays: America's First School Shooting w/ Author/Researcher N. Leigh Hunt! <br>\n<br>\nIn 1979, Brenda Spencer, a seemingly average teenage girl living in a nice suburban neighborhood, made and executed plans that would place her in infamy and set a violent and terrifying national precedent. She receives a rifle for Christmas and a month later set her sights and opens fire on the elementary school across the street.<br>\n<br>\nThe event is forever glorified by the song ‘I Don’t Like Mondays’ by The Boomtown Rats and marks the bloody beginning of the American phenomenon of school shootings. Long before Columbine and Sandy Hook, there was Brenda Spencer…<br>\n<br>\nN. Leigh Hunt joins TCT to discuss Brenda's history, thoughts, possible motives, and the relationship he has developed with her while she has been incarcerated. <br>\n<br>\nPLUS: An all-new Dumb Crimes/Stupid Criminals with Beer City Bruiser!<br>\n<br>\n\"I Don't Like Mondays...\" comes out via Wild Blue Press on August 30th, but you can get your advance copy here:  <a href=\"https://wildbluepress.com/i-dont-like-mondays-n-leigh-hunt-true-crime/\">https://wildbluepress.com/i-dont-like-mondays-n-leigh-hunt-true-crime/</a><br>\n<br>\n#crime #truecrime #truecrimeppodcasts #truecrimeradio #truecrimetuesday #timdennis #beercitybruiser #ringofhonorwrestiling #dumbcrimesstupidcriminals <br>\n#idontlikemondays #brendaspencer #nleighhunt #1022luger #firstschoolshooting #70s #bobgeldof #sandiego #schoolshooting #sniper #teenagekiller #womankiller #wallyspencer #scottspencer #dotspencer</div>\n",
