  "description": "Everyone thought that Gerard was going to fail when he dropped out of college. But what they didn't know is what he lacked in formal training, he made up for in street savvy and a deep understanding of people. He learned fast and worked his way up to becoming a self-made millionaire by the age 24. But when the economy crashed, he lost it all. In refusing to give up, he reimagined his life and career, finding a niche among the millennial community and creating a massive brand that reached over 80 million readers per month. And once  his company Elite Daily was acquired for nearly $50 million, he reinvented himself yet again, discovering a passion for cultivating leadership with his social impact accelerator for entrepreneurs, Fownders.
