  "description": "Sun Wukong, the (Handsome) Monkey King, is both an actual monkey and an actual king…and presumably handsome according to whatever standard that is judged. One of the most famous anti-heroes of Chinese literature, we start his story, and the story of the extremely famous “Journey to the West” at the beginning, with the story of the monkey’s rock mom on the Flower-Fruit mountain. The creature this week is the ningyo, the human fish. It’s neither human nor a fish, but it is a tired introvert who just wants some me time. Sponsors: Check out Stan Lee’s Alliances: A Trick of Light, an Audible original and one of the legendary storyteller’s final works.
