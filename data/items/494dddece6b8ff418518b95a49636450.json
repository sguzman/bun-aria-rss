  "description": "<p>What if every child with ADHD is actually gifted? As a society, we’ve been struggling to support our kids who have ADHD. And, as it turns out, many of these children are not just hyper-active, but also hyper-intelligent.</p> <p>The great tragedy today is that many of these kid’s amazing gifts are, unfortunately, overlooked or suppressed. ADHD is typically a blanket diagnosis that covers hundreds of different variations in symptoms and experiences. Yet, millions of children are lumped together and given a cookie-cutter treatment, and the results of have been less than impressive.</p> <p>Some rarely discussed side effects of conventional treatment and/or neglect of ADHD are greater levels of depression and anxiety, <a href= \"http://americanaddictioncenters.org/adderall/long-term-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher incidences of drug abuse</a>, and <a href= \"http://www.livescience.com/46532-suicide-risk-adhd.html\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher rates of suicide</a>. Simply giving a child a drug to help them be more focused in grade school may seem appropriate in the short-term, but neglecting the underlying cause of the ADHD could have devastating consequences in the long-term.</p> <p>ADHD simply does not “wear off” when a child reaches adulthood. More than half of the kids diagnosed with ADHD transition into what’s known as adult ADHD. The symptoms of adult ADHD are far reaching and more common than you can imagine. This could manifest as struggles in health, work, finances, and relationships. That’s why I could think of no one better than Dr. John Gray to help us understand this better and truly help us to find some solutions.</p> <p>Dr. Gray is the author of one of the best selling books of all time, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, and several other life-changing books in that guild. John has become wildly successful, and his books have become household names. John has also battled ADHD most of his life, and his story of discovery and reversing his condition will truly blow your mind.</p> <p>John’s success inspired him to research, teach and write about valuable treatments for ADHD and adult ADHD, without the potentially harmful side effects seen with conventional medicine. This episode can literally save lives. It can also help some of our most gifted souls to live healthy, happy, meaningful lives. I’m excited and honored to share this with you today.
