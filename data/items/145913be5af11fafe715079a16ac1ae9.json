  "description": "This whole show is done from the Trade Show in Houston TX. I set up interview and then we try to find a somewhat quiet spot near my guests booth so I don't have to have them go to far. \n\nI was so glad to catch up with the super creative Barb Cherniwchan of Coach House Designs! She talks us through how she thinks about working with panels. And she has a great new FREE feature at her website to change out colors in designs before you decide what you like! It's called FabSwitch, you will have such fun with it! \n--------\nSometimes it takes a few years until I finally meet a designer I admire, Sue Daley and I had a fabulous chat! She is so talented and had a great array of patterns, fabric and tools.\n---------\nWhen I got the first issue of QuiltFolk I knew this was going to be a journal for me. Full of stories and amazing photos of quilt makers. It does not have patterns, but it does have amazing inspiration. Michael McCormick is created this magazine with the goal of telling the stories of quilt makers. He had some time at the show to chat and you'll love hearing the behind the scenes!\n----------\nHappy 25th Anniversary to American Patchwork & Quilting Magazine! I remember that first issue, the excitement!\n\nAt the end of the show today I give you an overview of the trade show, including what's behind me!\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
