  "description": "<p>Too many of you ponder, think, strategize, and are crippled by doing things without having a master plan in place .. and you're going to lose. Dwelling is just simply the wrong strategy. We're far too crippled by things we can't control and we need to stop. If you have something you want to do .. attack !! Get things in motion, adjust on the fly, and put the things in place to help you succeed. Especially when it comes to content creation, too many of you are striving for perfection and that desire for perfection is the single variable that's going to make you lose. Don't overthink it. Just do. You'll learn far more by being in the dirt than by dreaming in the clouds. </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5362414.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
