  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show by going straight to the phones to speak to a self identified 'scientific person' who is very concerned that no one in mainstream media will publicly talk about natural immunity. After Adam stops yelling about that subject, they move on to another caller who works in the ICU and wants to hear Drew's thoughts on the exodus from the nursing profession she is witnessing. As the show wraps up Adam plays a clip of President Biden stumping for Gavin Newsom in his recall election as he points out the talking points the President chose to focus on. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nBabbel.com, promo code ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM\nPluto TV\n",
