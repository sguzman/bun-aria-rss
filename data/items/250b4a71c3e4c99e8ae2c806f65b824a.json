  "description": "<p>This week we review podcast 1376 Artie Lange and 1380 Pete Dominick</p>\n <p>Artie is a comedy legend and has been around for years. He's recently sober and doing really well with that. His message of adiction and recover is a warning and an inspiration. We wish him the best here at the Review and he definitely needs to get a podcast together as soon as possible.</p>\n <p>Link to Mad TV sketch with him and Joe: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgXv-MVHQaM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgXv-MVHQaM</a></p>\n <p>Â </p>\n <p>Pete Dominick was a Sirus radio guy for many years and has recently been canned so he's on Joe's show to discuss options and get his name out there.</p>\n <p>Enjoy the review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email us <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
