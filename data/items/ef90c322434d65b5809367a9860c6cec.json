  "description": "<p>Money just feels like a topic that is off-limits when it comes to discussions you have with your friends. Is it because it’s too personal? Maybe you feel it’s none of your business? A big part of why we started How to Money is because we feel that money conversations need to happen more often. Talking about money shines a light on it and brings about awareness, which can ultimately lead to improvement as we all have room to grow. Listen as we discuss some of the major ways you’re likely missing out if you’re not talking about money. And then we wrap it up with some practical tips that can help you when it comes to striking up a money conversation with your friends and family.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Zoose Joose by Westbrook and Angry Chair.
