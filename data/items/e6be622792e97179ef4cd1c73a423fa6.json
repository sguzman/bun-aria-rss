  "description": "<p>What do psychologists really think about your dreams - do they have meaning?  In this episode I talk about what psychologists think today about dreams.  You probably know that Freud thought that dreams had a manifest content (the people and things that happened in the dream that you remember) and a latent content (the unconscious meaning of the dream).  Do we still think this?  Also: can you look up in a book or online to find out what your dreams meant?  If you dream about a cat for example - what does this mean?  In this episode I explore these questions with author and psychoanalyst Kerry Malawista.  She and her colleagues discuss this topic in their book, Wearing My Tutu To Analysis.  I'll talk to her and include my own thoughts about whether or not dreams have meaning and whether you should be taking the time to analyze them.</p>",
