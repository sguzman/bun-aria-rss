  "description": "<p>For the first time ever, Avery, Codie & Tony are in the same room for their 70th episode to discuss one of the first major land engagements of the American Civil War. Coming up on the 160th Anniversary of the first battle along the banks of Bull Run near the railroad junction of Manassas, the guys discuss the events that played out between the untested Union and Confederate armies. Having spent the day traversing the battlefield itself, Avery, Codie & Tony discuss their new perspectives of the battle, and ask questions like what was the true meaning of Thomas Jackson's nickname? Or if Irvin McDowell was a true bumbling idiot or just a regular guy dealt a crappy hand on the battlefield? All this and more await you in this fantastic episode. Enjoy!</p>",
