  "description": "This is a weird one in a new way. Pete sits down with his old buddy, the hilarious Thomas Middleditch (Improvised Shakespeare Company, Comedy Central's Mash Up, The Campaign) to discuss the anatomy of a break-up. Specifically, their dude break-up. Why do friends just stop hanging out together? What happened to their bromance?! Well, they get into it and get into it deep. And funny. And weird. Please enjoy, it wasn't easy to do!",
