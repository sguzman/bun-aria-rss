  "description": "<p>Less than two months into his term, President Joe Biden is signing his first major piece of legislation, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. What are his other domestic priorities, and who are the leading figures in his administration to deliver them? What obstacles does he face in Congress and elsewhere, and can he overcome them? To discuss the prospects for Biden’s domestic policies moving forward, we welcome a dynamic panel of experts: Andra Gillespie (Emory); Michael Hartney (Hoover Institution); Casey Mulligan (University of Chicago); and Colin Provost (CUSP). Julie Norman (CUSP) will moderate.</p>\n",
