  "description": "<p><p>On Monday's episode of Spittin' Chiclets we have one of our most interesting episodes ever. Once again, the West Coast Wagon Tour rolls on with Ryan “Bugsy” Malone as the guest. We sat down with Bugsy at the house in LA for a nice long chat about his life, his career and some great stories. The guys are also joined by Frankie Borrelli and Sean Avery to dispute Sean's comments about Islanders fans. Frankie is not happy with Sean and they go toe to toe. The guys also go around the league and talk about some league news including the Hurricanes, Iginla, some suspensions and more.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
