  "description": "<p><span>This week, OTM presents the second installment of a new series by our colleagues at The Experiment. In this episode, we learn that SPAM is at the center of one of the longest and most contentious labor battles in U.S. history. In 1985, workers at the Hormel Foods plant in Austin, Minnesota, went on strike, demanding better working conditions and stable wages. Generations of meatpackers had worked at the plant, some for most of their lives—and that gruesome, difficult work afforded them a sustainable, middle-class life. So when that way of life was threatened, they fought back. SPAM boycotts spread to cities and towns around the world. The strike went on for almost two years, pit neighbor against neighbor, and turned violent; the National Guard was called in to protect those who crossed the picket line. In the end, the strike is a Rorschach test: either a lesson in what is possible when workers unite, or a cautionary tale about biting the SPAM that feeds. </span></p>\n<p>This episode is the second in a new three-part miniseries from<em><span><span><span> </span></span><em><span>The Experiment—</span></em><span>“</span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/experiment/spam/\"><span>SPAM: How the American Dream Got Canned</span></a><span>.”</span></span></em></p>",
