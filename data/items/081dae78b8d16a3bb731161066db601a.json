With Patagonia’s support, Thiermann created and hosted the award-winning documentary series, Surfing For Change. The series included stories about the Indonesia trash epidemic, Hawaii’s Monsanto protests, and the adverse impacts of surf tourism in Nicaragua.<br/> <br/> Thiermann speaks at universities throughout the country and in 2011 gave a TEDx talk in his wetsuit.
