  "description": "<p>My guest this week on The HoneyDew is Jeff Danis of Danish & O'Neill! Jeff was a fat kid when he was younger but he could swim his ass off, he just couldn't drop the weight! He got made fun of a lot but he wasn't a fighter so he armed himself with wit. Jeff shares some crazy stories - he was falsely accused of gay sex in front of a roommate, he was involved in a riot, he was humiliated multiple times by the college football team, he was involved in a road trip with a deadly ending and that's just his first semester of college! Jeff has some stories! He's a HoneyDew through and through! I hope you enjoy this episode!</p> <p>http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</p>",
