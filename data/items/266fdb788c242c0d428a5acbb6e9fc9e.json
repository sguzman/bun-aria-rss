There are so many foods we can eat to support better cognition, reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and feel sharper, smarter, and happier every day. Along those same lines, many of the processed foods in our Standard American Diet are sabotaging our brain health with loads of excess sugar and other sneaky ingredients. I’m excited to sit down with Max Lugavere to explore what it looks like to eat a diet that specifically benefits the brain.
