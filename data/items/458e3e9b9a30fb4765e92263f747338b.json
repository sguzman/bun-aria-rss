  "description": "<p>We study the efficient approximation of highly oscillatory integrals using\nFilon methods. A crucial step in the implementation of these methods is the\naccurate and fast computation of the Filon quadrature moments. In this work we\ndemonstrate how recurrences can be constructed for a wide class of oscillatory\nkernel functions, based on the observation that many physically relevant kernel\nfunctions are in the null space of a linear differential operator whose action\non the Filon interpolation basis is represented by a banded (infinite) matrix.\nWe discuss in further detail the application to two classes of particular\ninterest, integrals with algebraic singularities and stationary points and\nintegrals involving a Hankel function. We provide rigorous stability results\nfor the moment computation for the first of these classes and demonstrate how\nthe corresponding Filon method results in an accurate approximation at truly\nfrequency-independent cost. For the Hankel kernel, we derive error estimates\nwhich describe the convergence behaviour of the method in terms of frequency\nand number of Filon quadrature points. Finally, we show how Filon methods with\nrecursive moment computation can be applied to compute efficiently integrals\narising in hybrid numerical-asymptotic collocation methods for high-frequency\nwave scattering on a screen.\n</p>",
