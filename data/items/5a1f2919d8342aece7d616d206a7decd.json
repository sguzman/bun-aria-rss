  "description": "Surfing legend and 11-time world champion Kelly Slater invited us to his new ranch in California, USA. He has created a wave pool that, he claims, produces the best artificial waves in the world. It's located roughly 160 kilometres inland and we took a visit. Olympic Channel podcast reporter Ashlee Tulloch also caught up with six-time world champion Stephanie Gilmore who looks, simply, remarkable on Kelly’s wave. Surfing is making its first Olympic appearance at Tokyo 2020 so grab your board (or headphones) and let’s head to the beach (or a state-of-the-art artificial wave pool).
