  "description": "<p>Did you ever wish you could be that person who captivated a room, a gathering, an audience, a date with a story that cast a spell, moved them deeply, then left you both more connected and alive? Transformed even? Yeah, you’re not alone. We all live lives filled with stories worth telling, but so often we don’t realize it. And few of us know “how” to tell those stories in a way that brings others in close, then leaves them changed. Most just think it’s a God-given ability.&nbsp;</p><br><p>But, what if it wasn’t? What if it was a skill anyone - including you - could learn? Would you want that? My guest today, Catherine Burns, believes it is. And, if there’s anyone I’d believe, it’s her. Catherine is the long-time Artistic Director at The Moth, the global phenomenon dedicated to the art and craft of storytelling. </p><br><p>In our conversation today, you'll hear us dive into many of the ideas, tips, and strategies from her newest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3SdBASK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Tell a Story: The Essential Guide to Memorable Storytelling from The Moth</em></a>, which she co-wrote with fellow The Moth directors, Meg Bowles and Jenifer Hixson.
