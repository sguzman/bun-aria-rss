  "description": "Chris Tomlin has recorded 31 albums, and it cannot be overstated just how much influence he's had on the world of worship music. Sadie and Chris talk about the friend they have in common who encouraged them both when they were first starting out. Chris reminds us that our faith isn't 30 minutes old — Christians from ALL generations will join together to sing the song of heaven. They also discuss how important your inner circle is and share a good reminder that even though you might have plans, it's ultimately the Lord who determines your steps. Plus, Chris describes his very first worship-leading experience and his epic proposal to his wife, Lauren.
