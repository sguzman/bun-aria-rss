  "description": "<p>It is very easy to think about your meditation practice as being quarantined to those minutes when you’re dutifully sitting down with your eyes closed. But actually the point is to turn your whole life into a practice. Our guest <a href=\"https://jeffwarren.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Warren</a> has a very broad, capacious understanding of the concept of practice.
