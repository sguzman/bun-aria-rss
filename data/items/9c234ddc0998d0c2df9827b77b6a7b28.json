  "description": "<p>Has your friend ever dated a not so great guy? You know, the kind of relationship that might dip into the toxic category? Or perhaps she is making other toxic life decisions that aren’t in line with her health or dreams? We’ve all been there at some point – but what is a girl to do about it? Do you step in? Do you step back and watch? Is there a happy medium? All great questions, sister. Listen in as Jordan dives into her experience and advice on this exact topic of finding the balance between supporting and intervening. You’ll learn what questions to ask yourself before a bold conversation, suggestions on how to approach the situation, and even how to evaluate your own, healthy decisions. You’ll walk away hopeful and reminded that it’s not your job to be the hero, but it is your job to love others.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details: <a href=\"http://jordanleedooley.com/what-to-do-when-your-friend-makes-unhealthy-choices\" target=\"_blank\">http://jordanleedooley.com/what-to-do-when-your-friend-makes-unhealthy-choices</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media network of podcasts.
