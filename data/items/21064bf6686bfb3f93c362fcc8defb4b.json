  "description": "<p>Friday 5/4 - Today on the show we had the wild boys Rae Sremmurd stop by to speak about their music and the albums they are putting out while smoking a blunt. But they made one thing clear or maybe not clear and that was \"At the end of the day, f*** you; sremm life; aye, srkt srkt, and then I'm gone.\" Also, we had Shanti Das stop by where she spoke about the national movement to #silencetheshame associated with mental illness, the signs that she was suffering from depression, how therapy helped her realize she needed to forgive her father for committing suicide, leaving the music industry and more. Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to yet another Florida man who shot his wife, mistaking her for a burglar. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
