  "description": "<p>It’s Episode 499 and this week The Cigar Authority welcomes Kurt Kendall & 7-20-4 to the show as he invades the competition; Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH. We’ll talk to Kurt Kendall about the brand he resurrected that originally started in 1874 in Manchester, NH in the first half hour of the show. While in the second half hour two of the best retail minds pull back the curtain and talk about the retail side of business all why smoking a 7•20•4 Lancero, which happens to be a part of the November Care Package.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will debate whether or not to continue after episode 501 and talk about what surprises are in store for the 500th episode. Will anyone from back in the day make a return to the show? Do we want them to make an appearance? Is Mr. Jonathan really skipping this huge milestone just so he can dance with men? We will find all this out while we fire up a La Flor Dominicana 1994 Aldaba.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.
