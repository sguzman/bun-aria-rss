All throughout our life, we keep enforcing those concepts/facts which help us most in our day-to-day activities. ML algorithms are much less selective &#8211; if you train a NN to perform task A and then retrain it to perform task B, the parameters for A will be forgotten &#8216;uniformly&#8217;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09601\">This paper</a> tries to apply the <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Artificial_Neural_Networks/Hebbian_Learning\">Hebbian-learning</a> principle of &#8216;Neurons that fire together, wire together&#8217; to NNs. Its done as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>While training for task A, the algorithm measures the &#8216;<em>importance</em>&#8216; of a parameter as the gradient of the L2 norm of the output-error. In essence, this quantifies the <em>absolute change in output for a small change in the param-value</em>.</li>\n<li>Now, while re-training for a different task, the importance values computed in the above step are used as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)\">regularization parameters</a>. This penalizes changes to the important params for task A, even while training for task B &#8211; as a result, the NN still performs decently at task A even after being re-trained.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://amid.fish/assets/Distributed%20TensorFlow%20-%20A%20Gentle%20Introduction.html\">Distributed Tensorflow</a></strong></p>\n<p>This article gives a very good overview of distributed-computing mechanisms in TensorFlow. The main problem being tackled is the sharing of parameters/variables across different machines. Some take-aways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>tf.Session, by itself, is like an isolated execution engine.</li>\n<li>However, multiple sessions can be made to share variables using tf.train.Servers, which are grouped together into &#8216;clusters&#8217;. All servers in the same cluster share variable values (this is done using namespaces).</li>\n<li>With tf.device, if you have multiple devices each with their own process, you can choose which one holds the original copy of a Variable.</li>\n<li>Each server is responsible for building its own Graph though &#8211; the elements of the graph can include process-specific params, as well as global ones shared across servers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The post gives multiple small examples, as well as one cumulative piece detailed multiple feature &#8211; do take a look!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737260/ai-image-translation-nvidia-data-self-driving-cars\">UNsupervised Image-to-Image Translation by Nvidia</a></strong></p>\n<p>Another good paper from <a href=\"https://nips.cc/\">NIPS2017</a>. The problem addressed here is that of unsupervised image-to-image translation, also shortened as <em>UNIT</em>. Consider the conversion of a street-photo in sunny weather, to the same street on a rainy day.</p>\n<p>If it was supervised, we would have pairs of photos of the same streets, in sunny & rainy weather. But such data is hard to come by, especially in the quantities needed for deep learning. So what if you just have a bunch of sunny street photos, and a set of rainy ones? (with no &#8216;common&#8217; street). This is basically the problem being solved here.</p>\n<p>Nvidia uses a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.09300.pdf\">VAE-GAN</a> for this purpose, with some twists. Consider the sunny/rainy example from above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The raw image is first converted to a latent vector by a <em><a href=\"http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/\">Variational Autoencoder</a>.</em></li>\n<li>This latent vector is then given as input to the Generative part of a GAN.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The twist is that the last few layers of the VAE, and the first few layers of the GAN are shared by both sunny-to-rainy and rainy-to-sunny networks. Why so?</p>\n<p>You can intuitively see that the VAE is converting the raw pixels into a vector encoding basic attributes of the street &#8211; irrespective of the weather. While the first few layers of the VAE deal with raw pixel data, the higher ones understand abstract street-attributes (which are weather-independent). As a result, the latter layers get shared.</p>\n<p>The same logic is applied (but in reverse), in keeping the first few layers of the Generative network common.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/e3aXvYIWIq0\">Heres a video</a> of the method to give you a taste of the results obtained. They are surprisingly good!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gydydm/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn\">Fake AI porn (NSFW)</a></strong></p>\n<p>A Redditor going by the name of &#8216;deepfake&#8217; uses Tensorflow-based deep learning to paste celebrity faces onto pornstar bodies in videos. While the results are not perfect, they are good enough to cause concerns over consent.</p>\n<p>(To give you an example of the progress that has made in video manipulation, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk\">Face2Face</a>Â &#8211; They use a video of some celebrity, and combine it with actions by a user on their live feed, to generate a video of the celebrity doing the same.).</p>\n",
