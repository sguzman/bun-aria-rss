  "description": "<p>Have you ever felt this deep feeling that you aren’t from here, a nostalgia for a home you don’t yet know? Do you resonate with certain environments such as turquoise blue waters and waterfalls or maybe star galaxies and nebulas?</p> <p>In this episode I sit down with starseed expert Paul Silva to discuss a variety of the different starseed systems and how to know which your soul is from. We discuss what starseeds even are, why it’s a frequency rather than a physical thing and the characteristics of Pleidians, Arcturians, Mintakans, Sirias, Andromedans, Orions, Lyrans and more. I also share my own and have you guess!</p> <p>We also discuss the frequency differences of the ancient civilizations of Lemuria and Atlantis.
