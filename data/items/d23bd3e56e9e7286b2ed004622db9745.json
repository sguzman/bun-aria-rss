  "title": "How Chef Pierre Thiam Disrupted the Western-Dominated Grain Market",
  "description": "Senegalese chef and entrepreneur Pierre Thiam is on a mission to break into the Western-dominated grain market with an ancient grain called fonio. He built his company, Yolele Foods, in 2017 with the intention of creating economic opportunities for farmers who grow grains like fonio, and his success could have a huge impact on African countries by alleviating poverty and hunger for millions of people.

Yolele's packaged fonio is flying off the shelves at Whole Foods locations all across the country.
