Today on the show we had entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk stopped by to give our listeners some motivation and inspiration to get rich. Also, Charlamagne gave “Donkey of the Day” to a young and pretty much ignorant couple with one partner ending up dead and the other in jail. Also, Angela gave some advice to some listeners during Ask Yee, and one in particular was a crazy Trey Songz fan and didn’t even notice from what she was asking. Lets just say if someone has to say they are not crazy more than three times, most likely they are crazy.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
