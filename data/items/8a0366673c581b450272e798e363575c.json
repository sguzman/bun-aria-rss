  "description": "<p>In this sermon, we will look at the doctrine of predestination, or election — the idea that we would never seek for or choose God unless first God sought for and chose us. In this passage, Jesus says that “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.” We’ll ask two questions of that statement: 1) What does Jesus mean? 2) What does it mean for us practically? </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 19, 2001. Series: Arguing With Jesus. Scripture: John 6:41-48.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
