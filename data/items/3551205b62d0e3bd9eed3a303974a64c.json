  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this program is sick and tired of racism pushed by Democrats. Whether it's Joy Reid, the Democrat Party, or the media. The left uses anti-white racism conveniently to pursue their own interests. The vast majority of this country are tolerant, fair people that see past skin color. They have redefined racism to only apply to a certain group, but not all bigots fueled by race-hatred. The left uses reparations as one more way to redistribute the wealth of others. Interestingly the border is flooded with people of color desperately trying to get into this nation that they call racist and white supremacist. Then, the media is the scum of the earth, they are frauds. Joy Reid is a bigoted hate-monger that promotes anti-white bias and she should be fired for her comments about \"missing white woman syndrome.\" What's truly appalling about this leftwing ignorance syndrome is that Reid never uses her platform to help stop the slaughter of people of color in cities mainly run by Democrats. Later, Chicano studies have laid the foundation for Marxists that want to promote anti-white racism. So many journalists today espouse these Marxist beliefs and spread them. This is why they support erasing the border. Afterward, the New York Post, confirming what this program has discussed regarding President Biden's skirting of Medicare taxes, is reporting that Biden owes upwards of $500K in back taxes. Biden set up an S corporation in order to avoid paying payroll taxes as an employee.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
