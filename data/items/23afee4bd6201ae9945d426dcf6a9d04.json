  "description": "In this message, Joel will show that instead of accepting an addiction as a part of your life and allowing it to stay, you need to announce to that addiction: “It is finished! You don’t control me, and you can’t keep me from my destiny. The price has been paid. I am free. I am whole. I am clean.” When you rise up and tell the past, tell the poverty, tell the guilt, “It is finished! This is not who I am. I am blessed. I am prosperous. I am victorious,” strongholds are broken in the unseen realm, chains are loosed, and favor is released.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
