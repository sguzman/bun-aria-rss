The majority of foods on our market shelves contain insane amounts of added sugar and high-fructose corn syrup—ingredients that literally slow down our metabolism and turn on our internal fat storage switch. That means we have the power to turn that switch off by choosing to use food as medicine. Today, I’m excited to talk to Dr. Richard Johnson about how our biological fat storage process works and what we can do to positively affect it.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Richard Johnson is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado in Denver and has been a practicing physician and clinical scientist for over 25 years. He is internationally recognized for his seminal work on the role of sugar and its component fructose, in obesity and diabetes. His work has also suggested a fundamental role for uric acid (which is generated during fructose metabolism) in metabolic syndrome. He previously authored <em>The Sugar Fix</em> with Timothy Gower in 2008, and <em>The Fat Switch</em> in 2012. His new book, <em>Nature Wants Us to Be Fat</em> was just released.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, InsideTracker, and HigherDOSE.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
