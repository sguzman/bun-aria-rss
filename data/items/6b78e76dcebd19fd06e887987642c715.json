  "description": "<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, frazzled and in complete despair with the state of the world right now, that’s because your nervous system wasn't designed to know about everything going on across the planet. We have never known about every war, famine, natural disaster, disease or conflict happening in all parts of the world and our minds cannot even begin to comprehend it. In this episode, I share how we were designed to only be aware of our local surroundings and how the state of the media has us in a constant state of overwhelm, without the following peace. I also share two powerful tips to help you move out of despair and into action to truly make a difference in this world in the way you were born to share. This is a powerful episode to reactive your soul and share with others similarly feeling this.</p> <p>Doors are open this week only to Rose Gold Goddesses, my divine feminine mystery school, for a transformational year of embodiment, expression, intuition, womb wisdom + joy.
