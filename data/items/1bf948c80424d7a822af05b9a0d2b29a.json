  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, due to President Biden's policies, the wholesale inflation rate for September was 8.6% and was the highest rate of the year. Since it's taking longer to get goods from overseas, there's a situation where too many paper dollars are chasing after too few goods and this hurts all Americans. Inflation has gone up and the number of available jobs will go down. Consumers are panicking and hoarding whatever they can get their hands on for fear of the impending recession. Then, Biden's actions to shut down the Keystone Pipeline slowed down oil production on federal land, so now gasoline is at a 7-year high and America went from being an exporter of energy to being an importer of foreign energy. Democrats are using their razor-thin majorities to fundamentally change the economy which will destroy the currency and ultimately the country. Later, a federal judge has ruled that the warden of the D.C jail holding some January 6th prisoners, be held in contempt of court and is being referred to the AG for a federal civil rights investigation. Afterward, the intricacies involved in producing a wooden pencil, as described in the i-pencil video, is proof that this supply chain mess that Biden has created will affect a lot more than just the ports and truckers. Finally, the candidate for Lt Governor of VA, Winsome Sears, calls in with an update on her race and shares her personal story of her time as a Marine and when she sold her car and traveled with a child seat on the back of her bicycle to get through college.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
