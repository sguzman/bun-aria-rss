However, he has adopted a clear stance and alleged that his government was toppled through an international conspiracy, facilitated by local players. According to Khan, the incumbent PML-N-led coalition government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was installed under the same international conspiracy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1-scaled.webp?ssl=1\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-27355\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1.webp?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1-scaled.webp?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1-scaled.webp?w=1024&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1-scaled.webp?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vosa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2551343-imran-khan-1-scaled.webp?resize=390%2C220&ssl=1 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>PTI senior leader Senator Faisal Javed, who was injured when a bullet grazed his face, said that a party worker was killed during the attack, while another was severely injured.
