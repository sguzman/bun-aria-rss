  "title": "Julia Child Was My Boss, With Stephanie Hersh",
  "description": "Stephanie Hersh dreamed of a job in the culinary world, but she never imagined she would have a front-row seat to the life of the biggest culinary icon around, Julia Child. Stephanie became Julia’s executive assistant in the most unlikely of ways, when a chance phone call came into the secretarial school she was attending after time at the Culinary Institute of America. The only catch? Julia wanted an office assistant, not a starry-eyed culinary school grad. Stephanie talked her way into the job and wound up becoming Julia’s right hand for almost 16 years. Today, Stephanie is a chef instructor with Oceania Cruises and is based in New Zealand. She joins host Kerry Diamond to share some of her memories, her thoughts on the film 'Julie & Julia,' and what Julia was like as a boss. \nThank you to Chronicle Books, publisher of the upcoming 'Tables & Spreads,' for supporting this episode.\n\n",
