  "description": "<p>Jimmy Carr, one of the UK's best loved comedians and game show hosts, is so good at giving advice, he's written a self-help book. He shares with Tig his “cheat” on what all self-help books have in common.  Jimmy and Tig compare notes on why they may actually appreciate heckling during a standup - and offer advice about a woman worried she's getting marriage proposals only because she's rich.</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy) and Zocdoc (go to Zocdoc.com/TIG  to download the app and sign up for free).</p>\n<p>Need advice?
