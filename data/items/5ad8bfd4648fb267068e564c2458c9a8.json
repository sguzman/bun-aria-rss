Todd wants to know what kind of app the guys would each create if they had an unlimited budget, and what they would call the app. They answer some listener questions including picking professions they think the other guys would be good at, and what they would consider their top guilty pleasure song. And as always, the guys end the show by giving you some Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend. Today's episode is a fun one.
