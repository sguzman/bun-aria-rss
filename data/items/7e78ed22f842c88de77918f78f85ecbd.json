  "description": "In this message, Victoria will explain when you’re in emotional pain, it’s easy to shrink back in fear and allow an emotional limp to become a stronghold in your mind—a wrong way of thinking. The last thing you want to do is to step out in boldness or put yourself in a position where you can get hurt again. But you can’t allow a painful experience to trick you into thinking you’re going to have a painful life. If you find yourself shrinking back because you’re afraid you’ll be hurt again, you have to understand that God can heal what hurts! He is the mender of broken hearts.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
