He said he had to, ‘Fight the human side of it all’ and remind himself, “this is a different team and a very different situation” and after an open, honest conversation with his wife, he re-centered and decided to play with the mentality of not looking at the clock or scoreboard and simply hone in on what he’s supposed to do.” </p><p>There is a story about <a href='https://dailystoic.com/cato/'>Cato</a> being given an army command during the Roman Civil War and then having it stripped from him days later by some backstabbing enemies.
