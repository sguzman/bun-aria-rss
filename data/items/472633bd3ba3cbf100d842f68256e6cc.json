JR talks about his career, some things he's learned along the way and he also tells arguably the craziest story/prank of all time. The guys are then joined by Nick Niedert, the ECHL goalie who just got his first win in pro hockey in over 1000 days. The guys wrap up with some NHL news, Grinnelli makes a new Sabres bet, and RA recaps his 5-0 gambling corner.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
