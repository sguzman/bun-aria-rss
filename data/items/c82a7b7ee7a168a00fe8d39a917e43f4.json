  "description": "How does a political regime function? What contributes to a regime’s longevity and subversion? Laszlo Borhi’s Dealing with Dictators: The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe 1942-1989(Indiana University Press, 2016) invites readers to consider a complex nature of regime. The focus of Dealing with Dictators is Hungary, which during and after the Second World War is presented as “a weak client state”, borrowing Laszlo Borhi’s description. Through a meticulous research Laszlo Borhi illustrates how Hungary gradually develops into an independent state. This process, however, is not only gradual but conflicting and complicated as well. In Dealing with Dictators, Hungary’s major political counterparts are the Unites States, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other. This combination seems to locate Hungary in an unfavorable situation for the development of the country’s domestic and international policies. However, as Laszlo Borhi’s research demonstrates, a “weak state,” under certain conditions, generates decisions that change not only internal state of affairs but external as well.\nDealing with Dictators reconstructs a multi-facet process of the country’s political development. The book includes a vast database of economic and political events that contribute and signal nuanced stages of transformation. In addition to a detailed account that navigates various levels of political engagement and which, in fact, eventually puts political players of different caliber on one level, Dealing with Dictators offers acute observations of the cultural domain that appears to reflect (and at times trigger) internal and external modifications. Laszlo Borhi invites his readers to navigate a complex web of events that narrate a (hi)story of Hungary, which is presented and constructed as a space of dialogical political and cultural interactions.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
