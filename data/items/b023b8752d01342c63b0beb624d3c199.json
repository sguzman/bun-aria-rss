  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys are joined by Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, 7x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, the most gifted thrower of football’s of all-time, and Pat’s best friend, Aaron Rodgers. They chat about what he’s doing with State Farm to bring some aid and relief to those who have been afflicted by the wildfires in California, and how that situation hits close with him. They also cover the differences in the Packers offense this year, his thoughts on responding after a tough loss to the Chargers, he expands on his relationship with Brett Favre, and explains what a normal night in his life is like. If you’d like to help donate to wildfire relief visit <a href=\"http://neighborhoodofgood.com/\">neighborhoodofgood.com</a> (2:16-25:09). Also included on today’s show is the announcement that Pat will be joining the XFL in a field analyst position that was created specifically for him. He explains what exactly he’ll be doing, and asks for some suggestions. Plus, Pat and the guys break down the first College Football Playoff Rankings, and effectively fix the entire system to ensure that the best team is crowned champion every year. Pat also goes through the list of ESPN’s NFL power rankings and gives his thoughts and who is slotted where and what he’s looking forward to in the coming weeks of the season, and we throw to the Rich Eisen show as Pat retells the story of having a team camaraderie building barbecue at his house in college and why Rich Rod was less than pleased. Today’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
