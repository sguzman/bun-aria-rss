Heidi was just 4 years old when her mother was brutally murdered in their own home. From that night forward Heidi tried over and over again to tell the police who was responsible but there just wasn’t enough evidence. We covered Loretta Jones Murder in episode 335 if you would like to listen to that first to hear the outcome. Getting to chat with Heidi was an absolute delight, and who better to weigh in on this subject than someone who lived it themselves.
