  "description": "<p>In this 98th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss critique, and specifically dissect two negative reviews of our book—one of which, in an establishment outfit, is not really a review; the other of which, posted on amazon, is actually careful and cogent. We discuss the difference being uninformed (or scientifically illiterate), and being unwilling to be informed (scientifically resistant).  Our book is an invitation to think deeply about what we are, and how to live better lives at both the individual and societal level. We discuss new research out of New Mexico that finds evidence for people there 23,000 years ago. We discuss how history is taught, and what our actual human past has to say about different types of frontiers, including geographic, as those earliest Americans found. We discuss Roger Scruton’s essay Dying in Time. And yes, we do mention that we made the New York Times best seller list.<br/><br/>*****<br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Vivo Barefoot: Shoes for healthy feet—comfortable and regenerative, enhances stability and tactile feedback.
