  "description": "In this second part of this series, we will look at some advanced techniques for model evaluation and techniques to estimate the uncertainty of our estimated model performance as well as its variance and stability. Then, in the next article, we will shift the focus onto another task that is one of the main pillar of successful, real-world machine learning applications -- Model Selection.",
