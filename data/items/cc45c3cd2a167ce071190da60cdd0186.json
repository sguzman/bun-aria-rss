  "description": "<p>The Kirk Minihane Show is coming to Barstool Sports' Sirius XM channel one day per week starting Wednesday at 11am EST. The First Annual Dave Portnoy Memorial 5k was a thrilling success with zero fatalities and huge sport from Erika Nardini, Big Cat, and even Tucker Carlson. Kirk actually enjoyed 'Champions for Charity', the golf event featuring Tiger Woods, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Phil Mickelson (0:28:30). Larry King inked a $5 million podcasting deal, but we don't buy it. Kirk reacts to Call Her Daddy host Alexandra Cooper telling her side of the story. Joe Biden says black people who don't vote for him aren't actually black. MA Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito reportedly had a Memorial Day weekend party despite being a member of the Lock It Down gang. New evidence has emerged in SnapperGate (0:48:38).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
