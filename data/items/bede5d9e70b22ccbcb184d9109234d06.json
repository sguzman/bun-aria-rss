In her current role, she helps coordinate scientific projects of all kinds, which means she has to keep up with a dizzying array of recent research topics. She also discussed how she helps communicate NASA's work to students and the public at large, before addressing that big question: Are we alone? \nAnd in a Slate Plus extra, Dr. Stofan tells us why she'd like to visit Titan, a moon of Saturn that is much like Earth in certain ways and profoundly alien in others.
