  "title": "PMS 2.0 254 - OVERREACTION MONDAY. NFL Week 2 Recap, Harrison Butker, Matt Hasselbeck & Charles Robinson",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys overreact to everything that happened this weekend in the NFL, including Russell Wilson being incredible at football, the Chiefs clawing back to a victory with Harrison Butker's game-winning kick after Justin Herbert's effort, plus Pat gives his worst three teams in the NFL as opposed to his top three, and everything else that was noteworthy. Joining the show to overreact to everything is 17 year NFL QB, 3x Pro Bowler, co-host of Sunday NFL Countdown, and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck. Pat and Matt overreact to this weekend of football, including whether or not Russell Wilson is the best QB ever, whether or not Josh Allen is for real, Justin Herbert's big day in LA, if the Vikings should be concerned with Kirk Cousins' play, what it's like feeling the rush in the pocket, and who he likes for tonight's game between the Raiders and Saints (1:40-27:53). Next, Super Bowl Champion, the man who hit multiple 50+ yard field goals against the Chargers including a 58 yard game winner (which was also a franchise record), Chiefs Kicker, Harrison Butker. Pat and Harrison chat about his mentality leading up to the kick, what he's done in the offseason to strengthen his leg, why he felt good from 70 on Sunday, and his thoughts about the onside kick by Greg Zuerlein in the Cowboys v. Falcons game (27:55-47:30). Lastly, Yahoo Sports NFL Insider and friend of the show, Charles Robinson joins the program. Pat and Charles chat about all the injuries from Sunday and Charles gives an update on many of the players and how serious he thinks the injuries may be, what he's hearing about who's on the coaching hot seat, and what San Francisco is going to do after being hammered by the injury bug (49:30-1:06:29).
