Congratulations!</p>\n<p>Thaler is a big reason I personally got interested in economics. (I&#8217;ve known him quite a bit longer than I&#8217;ve known <strong>Steve Levitt</strong>.) He is everything to be admired in a scholar and thinker: original, judicious, crafty, and more than a little sardonic. (My only gripe is that he turned me down years ago when I wanted to write a book with him.)</p>\n<p>Without Thaler, the world would know far, far less about the work of <strong>Kahneman</strong> and <strong>Tversky</strong>, as he was the earliest (and pretty much only) economist interested in harnessing the power of their decision-making research. Without Thaler, there is no way that behavioral economics would now be a standard tool in the arsenal of policymakers (and, of course, others).</p>\n<p>He has been featured on this blog many times over the years; you can sample those pieces <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/tag/richard-thaler/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He has also been on the <em>Freakonomics Radio </em>podcast a few times, including “<a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/fighting-poverty-with-actual-evidence-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/\">Fighting Poverty With Actual Evidence</a>” and “<a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/should-we-really-behave-like-economists-say-we-do-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/\">Should We Really Behave Like Economists Say We Do?</a>”</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/28/arts/calculating-the-irrational-in-economics.html\">here&#8217;s a <em>N.Y. Times</em> piece</a> I wrote about Thaler and other behavioralists back in 2003, near the start of his “libertarian paternalism” push.</p>\n<p>Among his books: the influential <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X/ref=la_B000AP9OS4_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1507550259&sr=1-1\"><em>Nudge</em></a>; the revealing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Misbehaving-Behavioral-Economics-Richard-Thaler/dp/039335279X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1507550314&sr=1-2\"><em>Misbehaving</em></a>; and the oft-overlooked <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Winners-Curse-Paradoxes-Anomalies-Economic/dp/0691019347\">Winner&#8217;s Curse</a></em>, which I happened to dip into just last week for fun, and as always got swept up in Thaler&#8217;s starkly sane view of the world.</p>\n<p>Well done, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/prize_awarder/committee.html\">Economics Sciences Prize Committee</a>, and well done, Dick Thaler!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/2017/10/congratulations-nobel-laureate-richard-thaler/\">Congratulations to Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler!</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com\">Freakonomics</a>.</p>\n"
