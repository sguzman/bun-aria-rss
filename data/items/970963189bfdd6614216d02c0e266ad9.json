  "description": "<p>Nature allows one to explore a manifold of remarkable quantum effects. Most\nprominently, quantum entanglement can be observed in many-particle systems,\nbetween multiple quantized fields, and hybrid combinations thereof. This\ndiversity, however, also leads to contradicting conclusions about what truly\nconstitutes entanglement in any given physical scenario. By explicitly allowing\nvarious perspectives, we rigorously consider different notions of entanglement\nin the context of first and second quantization. By providing instructive\nexamples, we show that particle entanglement and field entanglement are\nactually distinct phenomena that can occur and be observed independently of\neach other. This finding not only affects our fundamental understanding but has\ndirect implications on quantum technology which can harness those independent\nforms of entanglement in practical scenarios.\n</p>",
