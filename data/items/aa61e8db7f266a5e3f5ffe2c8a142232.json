We must not let them push us around. As you well know, it has always been an important part of our culture. Why should we assume that this small group of radicals have got it right and that our ancestors have all been wrong? Think of all the memories we’ve shared when eating the meat around the table with our families. It is a wonderful thing.</p> <p class=\"\">Secondly, I have yet to come across anyone who doesn’t gain great satisfaction from the delicious taste of the meat.
