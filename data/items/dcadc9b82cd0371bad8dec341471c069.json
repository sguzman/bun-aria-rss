  "description": "The debate this week was a trainwreck inside a dog's breakfast wrapped in bad acid trip. It was, despite the best efforts of Joe Biden to discuss the issues, chaotic. But that's what President Trump wanted. Because it distracts from 200,000 dead from COVID, tens of millions unemployed and revelations about his taxes and his manifold failures as a business leader. We discuss those taxes, failings and the debate to get to core issues he was trying to avoid with our guests, NYU Law Professor Daniel Shaviro, journalist David Corn of Mother Jones and former senior Obama White House official, Dr. Kavita Patel.
