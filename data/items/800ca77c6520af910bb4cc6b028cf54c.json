  "description": "<p>This week's episode is a continuation of Cindy Rollins and Angelina Stanford's discussion of <em>An Experiment in Criticism</em> by C. S. Lewis. They start with an exploration of the difference between loving a book and evaluating a book as a work of art, followed by an explanation of Lewis' idea that works of art do not teach us. Angelina goes in depth about why it is not our job as readers to find the \"nugget of truth\" in a book. Cindy brings up Lewis' point about \"using\" literature as an academic tool, versus \"receiving\" literature as a work of art.</p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>In covering chapter 9, Angelina and Cindy dig into the dangers of rushing to express an opinion about what we read, rather than getting ourselves out of the way when approaching a book. Cindy points to the many similarities between what Lewis says in these chapters and what Charlotte Mason says about true education.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Be sure to check out Thomas Banks' <a href= \"http://angelinastanford.com/webinars/\">next webinar</a>, \"Poetry and Classical Myth: The Influence of Greek and Roman Myth on English Poetry.\" The live stream will be on October 17, 2019, but the replay will be available soon afterward.</p> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:html /-->  <!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p> <h3>Rose-Cheeked Laura</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em>by Thomas Campion</em></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,<br /> Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's<br /> Silent music, either other<br /> Sweetly gracing.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Lovely forms do flow<br /> From concent divinely framed;<br /> Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's<br /> Birth is heavenly.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>These dull notes we sing<br /> Discords need for helps to grace them;<br /> Only beauty purely loving<br /> Knows no discord,</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>But still moves delight,<br /> Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,<br /> Ever perfect, ever in them-<br /> Selves eternal.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p>(Amazon Affiliate Links)</p> <p><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AETffE\">Seeking God</a></em> by Esther de Waal</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2pJG2jG\">The Great Code</a></em> by Northrop Frye</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Maci77\">Wuthering Heights</a></em> by Emily Brönte</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Om7nmb\">Til We Have Faces</a></em> by C.
