  "description": "Some colleges and universities have announced that COVID vaccination will be mandatory (with some exemptions) and the FDA has authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 to 15. While coronavirus infections are declining in the United States, vaccination rates also appear to be slowing down, so pediatricians and public health officials say they're trying to spread the word to overcome hesitancy, and get the vaccine out to people where they go to school and shop. Emily talks with NPR health correspondent Allison Aubrey about this and other topics in the pandemic news. <br/><br/>If you'd like to assistant on finding a vaccination site, you can dial 1-800-232-0233 or go to <a href=\"https://www.vaccines.gov/\">vaccines.gov (English)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vacunas.gov/\">vacunas.gov (Spanish)</a> for more information.  <br/><br/>Have questions about the latest coronavirus headlines?
