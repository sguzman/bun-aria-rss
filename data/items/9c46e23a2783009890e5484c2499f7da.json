  "description": "<p>The Besties are back!\nAt the end of 2013, the fate of the show was unclear. We were unsure what the podcast would look like in 2014.\nBut after hearing positive feedback from many of our listeners, we buckled down and came up with a new format. We really like it; we hope you do, too. This year, we will record one extended episode at the end of each month, discussing the best games of the previous 30 or so days. With the new format, we can ensure all four hosts have had time to play the selected games. We think that change alone will produce better conversations. If all goes well, the show will feel more like our end-of-the-year specials.\nAlso, we'll be reading listener mail. So send your thoughts, feelings, questions and deepest, darkest secrets to besties at polygon dot com! We also want to know your favorite games of February and why they're so special.\nThanks again to everyone who asked for more Besties. You are why we do the show.\n<p>9:20 - Rust<br />\n29:00 - Hearthstone<br />\n49:00 - Halftime!<br />\n55:00 - Loadout<br />\n1:05:00 - News of the month<br />\n1:23:00 - The Banner Saga</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
