  "title": "227 - Operation Paperclip: Nazi War Criminals Hired by the United States",
  "description": "<p>In the final days of World War II and in the next few years after the war was over, the U.S. government helped hundreds and hundreds of Nazi Scientists whose knowledge and expertise was deemed crucial to the development of advanced weapons - no matter HOW complicit they were in heinous Nazi activities - to relocate to the States and become integral pieces of the US military-industrial complex. The US wanted them to continue their work on creating atomic bombs, weaponizing plagues, making chemical weapons, and sometimes, even medically experimenting on people in ways that certainly violate the “<em>do no harm</em>” oath that doctors take, to find out either how enemies would be affected by weapons, how US soldiers and civilians might best recover from the devastating effects of their attacks, and more. Evil stuff. We look into who some of the Nazi scientists were today, and also into how the US was crossing plenty of moral lines without their help before and after WW2. Does being really good at science and making important medical and military progress justify committing crimes against humanity? Operation contributions likely changed the outcome of the Cold War - but does that make it right? Treading some murky waters today, as we dive into a morally ambiguous, top-secret, declassified Nazi history edition of Timesuck.<br /><br /><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Aumvi_h-WkQ\">https://youtu.be/Aumvi_h-WkQ</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"> </a><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
