  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does better sleep, less anxiety, more focus, more energy, and an all around better quality of life sound good to you? Let’s find out how transdermal magnesium may be able to help you achieve that and more. Kristen Bowen is the owner of Living The Good Life Naturally, where they specialize in magnesium soaks, sprays, and lotions. Unlike traditional oral magnesium, there are no digestion issues, and you absorb much more with the transdermal method. Having a cell saturation of 6.3 or higher is ideal, and within just 30 days using transdermal magnesium you should be at least a 5. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristen stumbled upon transdermal magnesium after suffering through the worst health crash of her life. After having her 4th child, Kristen needed to undergo a surgery. For the next 3.5 years following the surgery, Kristen would experience daily seizures, be confined to a wheelchair, need a colonoscopy bag, and a catheter bag. This was all a massive stress on Kristen’s family, and it was her husband that ultimately discovered it was a reaction to the titanium introduced to her body. While learning to put her health back together, she discovered that it is much more expensive to be sick than it is to be healthy, so she spared no expense in the pursuit. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After finding what worked for her, Kristen’s health began to dramatically improve, and people started asking questions. This is when Kristen discovered she loved talking about it, and helping other people. No matter the disease or ailment, magnesium is a great place to start, as it’s like a spark plug for your body. Many people will actually experience a tingling sensation as the lymph nodes pull the magnesium up through the feet. While you can add ¼ cup to your bath and soak your whole body, all that’s really needed is to soak your feet. Even kids can benefit from soaking, only requiring an ⅛ cup. Soaking for 20 minutes will uptake about 80% of the magnesium, where soaking for 45 minutes uptakes about 98%.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us have experienced some sort of trauma in childhood, and that can lead to a disregulated nervous system, which leads to an increased magnesium burn rate. Other factors, such as smoking, drinking, or stress, can all deplete magnesium levels. Addressing these other factors while using transdermal magnesium is essential. It’s also important to make sure you’re getting high quality magnesium. Kristen shares that she could get it much cheaper from Utah, but it would be very high in heavy metals. All of her magnesium is sourced from deep beneath the earth’s surface from the Zechstein Sea, and is third party tested for purity. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In as little as a few weeks, people report better sleep, more stability, calmer mood, weight loss, clear skin, and blood sugar regulation. Now, Kristen wants people to have reasonable expectations. Magnesium isn’t a cure-all for everything, but it is a great starting place. For instance, if you’re still exhausted after introducing magnesium, that’s your body telling you that you are low on potassium. Magnesium and potassium work great together.
