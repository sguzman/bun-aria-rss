  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, Bunnie and her gal FeFe King talk about all the hilarious and brilliant ways they are staying somewhat sane during this zombie apocalypse. They share their top five tips to get out of the Quarantine funk and into looking hotter, more fit, and tan than ever before. Then, Bunnie shares how much she made on OnlyFans in the first week alone, and FeFe gets a surprise guest appearance from her shoeless husband Al. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <div style=\"margin-left: 2em\"> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to fight about the most ridiculous things when you are a couple in quarantine. For Bunnie and Daddy it’s just about a simple drinking cup, where FeFe and Al got into it over the TV remote. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">FeFe’s quarantine life hacks include setting up a hand sanitizer dispenser right at her door and spraying her grocery bags with alcohol even before they get in the car.

Even if you have to carry around gallons of milk in your backyard.
