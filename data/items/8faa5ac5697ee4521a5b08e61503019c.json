I'm pretty certain we're at a moment in time where our mobile devices are indeed our 'first' screen of choice. </p>\n<p>When it comes to retail though, it makes sense that we refer to our phones as the \"second screen\" because it certainly holds true that our eyeballs serve as the 'first screen' when we're walking around. What's really resonated with me recently with retail  is how people are behaving when they're out and about and shopping around. People are literally IGNORING the promotional end-caps that brands spend tons of money on, simply because they're too distracted by their phones. Although this may sound like a wasted opportunity, I see it as the future of in-store marketing. </p>\n<p>This has been a hot topic of discussion over the last few years -- how phones and other devices will play a role in our shopping experiences -- and is something I'm very interested in. Brands need to start being more conscious of how we're using our devices in our everyday interactions. With the advent of ApplePay and the beginning phases of beacon sensors, there's no question that our in-store purchasing behaviors will be highly influenced by those shiny little devices we seem to never be at an arms-length distance from. </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578189.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
