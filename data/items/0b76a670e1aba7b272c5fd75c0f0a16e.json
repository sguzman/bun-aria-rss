  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys do a little housekeeping and address the ESPN situation, discuss the start of free agency with the Patriots being major players early, and the March Madness Bracket Challenge that Pat is starting that is worth $51,000 and up to $75,000 or $100,000 if it becomes the biggest group on the March Madness Live app and 50,000+ entries. Joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade team and friend of the program, Kansas City Chiefs TE, Travis Kelce to chat about recovering from the Super Bowl loss, what the Chiefs need to do to get back on top of the mountain, whether or not he's restructured his contract, and if he's going to have to take any reps at tackle next year (23:03-36:20). Later, 2x Pro Bowler, 2021 Bart Starr Award winner, stalwart at LB for the New Orleans Saints, Demario Davis joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about Drew Brees' retirement, how much different the Saints are going to look next year, what rule the NFL needs to change immediately, and building a linebackers room at his alma mater, Arkansas State (1:20:22-1:34:34). Later, Pat and AJ also chat about the different free agent signings, and why AJ hates Ohio State so much (1:01:16-1:20:20).
