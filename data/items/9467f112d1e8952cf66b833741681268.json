  "description": "<p>This podcast often emphasizes going it alone. But what if you could achieve your own dreams of continuous learning and creative expression while also having full-time jobs and getting that mythical thing, a regular paycheck? I talk with <a href=\"http://badyewex.com/\">Alli Dryer</a> and <a href=\"http://thoughtbrain.com/\">Jenni Leder</a>, user interface/user experience (UI/UX) designers, who changed their lives —&nbsp;and those of their husbands — to bring their lives closer to what they want within the structure of employment. We talk about that most scary of words to your host, a J-O-B, in this episode.
