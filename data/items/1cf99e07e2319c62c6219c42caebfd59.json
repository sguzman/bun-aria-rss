  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 19 - “The Road Less Traveled” Matthew 7:13-29. “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.…” THIS IS THE END! We have arrived at the final section of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus warns us against false prophets and easy routes. What is He saying with the narrow and broad gates? Sheep’s clothing? How can you differentiate the false prophets from the true? This is a complicated section, one where these wolves in sheep’s clothing drove out demons and prophesied and performed miracles… \n\nWe also discuss the recent CPAC (The Conservative Political Action Conference), an article by David French on the Seven Mountain Mandate and the old Christian rock band Stryper.\n\nSo much of this is about playing the long game with one another, how we coexist as humans and how to actually love our neighbors as ourselves.\n\nThese threads are weaving a beautiful tapestry that speak to so much of how we are to be, both with one another and with God. Jesus is speaking with such intention that resonates so much with where we are today.\n\nThis is the FINAL section of the Sermon on the Mount! This has been a wild ride for us and we’re honored to have walked this road with you all.\n \nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
