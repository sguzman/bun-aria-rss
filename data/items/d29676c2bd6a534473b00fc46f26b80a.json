His motto Love Loyalty was etched into the windows. He refused all terms of surrender.</p><br><p>As royalist strongholds crumbled, Loyalty House, as it became known, stood firm. Over two years, the men, women and children inside were battered, bombarded, starved and gassed. Their resistance became legendary.
