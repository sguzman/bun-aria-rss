  "description": "<p>The formula for fitness is pretty simple:</p> <p>Eat good food + Get plenty of movement + Sleep like you're getting paid for it = The body and health you desire</p> <p>Of course, there can be some more variables thrown in the mix, like hormones and environmental toxicity, but for the most part it's as simple as this.</p> <p>Being that it's so simple, why is it that so many people are struggling to have the body and health that they want? It's not complicated to have what we want at first glance... but what makes it complicated is something far more mighty than the power of food or exercise.</p> <p>What trumps everything is the power of your mind.</p> <p>It's the inner game that determines your outer game. It's your mental and emotional fitness that truly determines your outer health and fitness. This is where the real shifts need to happen. And that's what today's show is all about.</p> <p>If we're going to live a great life, then we can't just stop at the acquisition of a great body. What about phenomenal relationships? What about a satisfying career? What about abundant finances and resources to do the things you want in your life?</p> <p>All of this matters. And all of this is a result of developing the real mental and emotional fitness to make it happen. You can have, do and be practically anything you want.
