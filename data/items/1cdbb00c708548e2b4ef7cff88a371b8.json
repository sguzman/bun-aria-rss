  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 87: Featuring Marc-Andre Fleury, Michael Latta & Carson Meyer",
  "description": "<p><p>On this week's Friday episode, Spittin' Chiclets is psyched to have Vegas Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury on the show for a lengthy chat before he starts the Stanley Cup Final Monday night. The Flower reminisces with his former Pittsburgh teammates about pranks and Michel Therrien, talks about team expectations in October and why he's playing at such a high level, fills us in on which celebs stop by the locker room, and a whole lot more in a fun interview. Michael Latta also checks in to provide some perspective on his former team, the Washington Capitals, and tell some Tom Wilson tales as well as a few other funny ones. Biz also has a chat with Carson Meyer, the NCAA hockey player who recently shat out a two-foot tapeworm (so you've been warned). The guys also wrap up Game 7 of the ECF and give predictions for the SCF. Good stuff. Dive in. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
