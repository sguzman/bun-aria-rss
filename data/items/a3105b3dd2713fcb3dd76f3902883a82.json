  "description": "<p>On essays from Lear's <em>Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul</em> (1988): \"Inside and Outside the Republic,\" \"Eros and Unknowing: The Psychoanalytic Significance of Plato’s Symposium,\" and \"An Interpretation of Transference,\" which compares Socrates' questioning with psychotherapy.</p> <p>Is Plato's analogy between mind and state in <em>The Republic</em> a good one? What can we learn from it about what makes for a stable, healthy character? How does eros (desire) fit into this picture? Lear gives a creative, helpful reading of Plato informed by psychoanalysis.</p> <p>Part two of this episode is only going to be available to you if you sign up at <a href=\"partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partiallyexaminedlife.com/support</a>. <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/03/28/ep266-2-jonathan-lear-plato-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it now</a> or <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/04/04/preview-ep266-2-jonathan-lear-plato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listen to a preview</a>.</p>",
