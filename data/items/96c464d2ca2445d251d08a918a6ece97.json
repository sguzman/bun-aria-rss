Well to sum it up shorthand, epigenetics is how everything you’re exposed to throughout your life—your environment, your social relationships, your diet, etc.—impacts how your genes are expressed. Think of it like this: genes are our hardware and epigenetics are like software. Our software is something that can be changed and upgraded, it doesn’t have to be static. If you want to learn more about understanding, demystifying, and harnessing epigenetics, then this is the podcast episode for you.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Today’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy is my good friend and mentor, Dr. Jeffrey Bland. We talk all about epigenetics and unpack what can be a complicated topic in terms you can actually understand. Dr. Bland’s career in health spans more than 40 years. A lifelong educator, Jeff has traveled the world many times over in his role as the “father of Functional Medicine.” In 1991, he and his wife, Susan, founded The Institute for Functional Medicine. In 2012, Jeff founded another educational nonprofit called the Personalized Lifestyle Medicine Institute. He is the author of The Disease Delusion: Conquering the Causes of Chronic Illness for a Healthier, Longer, and Happier Life, as well as countless additional books and research papers.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Eight Sleep, and ButcherBox.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
