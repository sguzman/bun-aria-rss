  "description": "<p>Joe has just got back and with all this time away hunting I decided to talk about it. I've been a bow hunter since I was 18 years old and was very excited when Joe first started talking about hunting back in 2012. It's such a passion of mine that it was cool to see him get so into it. Today I'm joined by my good friend Mark (a fellow comic) who's not all that into hunting to get a different perspective on it. As always we end up talking comedy but what are you going to do! lol</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
