    "media:description": "Pumpkin update 🎃\n\nWe dug up the whole greenhouse and added nutrition to the soil. We also installed the drip irrigation. Only the best plant can stay in the greenhouse, that is why one plant was removed. The remaining pumpkin plant 🌱 is now starting to grow faster and faster. The first female flowers are already visible! We also sowed and planted the giant sunflowers 🌻 in the flower bed! 🐝 It’s also time to tackle those fast-growing weeds! Next to pumpkin growers, we’re starting to be tour guides as well! We gave our Indonesian friend and his family a tour around the pumpkin patch 🚜\n\n\n #giantpumpkins #growlegendary #sizematters #farming #pumpkins #agriculture #flowerbed #bees #pumpkins #farmlife #teamwork",
