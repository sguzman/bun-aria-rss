  "description": "Sermon On The Mount: Part 2. The Politics of Salt & Light. We’re continuing on through the Sermon on the Mount, with the oft quoted verses focusing on Jesus’s calling to the people to be both Salt and Light. What did Jesus mean when he called the folks at the mount to be Salt? What implications did that have? What of the command to be Light? To whom and how? How does this section play off of the Beatitudes that precede it? How do these commands relate to us, today?\n\nPainting by Sadao Watanabe. \n\nWe have always viewed VOX as a community, despite it existing mostly within the digital realm.
