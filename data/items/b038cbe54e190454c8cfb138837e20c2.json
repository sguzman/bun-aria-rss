  "description": "<p>On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie continues her special coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. First, Katie looks to New York City — now the national epicenter of this crisis — where the rate of positive COVID-19 cases is doubling ever three days. Which means the peak of coronavirus infections will be much higher and hit New York much sooner than expected, giving the city's vast network of hospitals — which are already under tremendous strain — less time to prepare for a deluge of patients. Katie talks to Dr. Robert Femia, the chair of emergency medicine at <a href=\"https://nyulangone.org/locations/virtual-urgent-care\">NYU Langone</a> to find out how emergency rooms in New York City are faring now and how they are bracing for what's to come. Then, Katie speaks to Beth Cameron, the former head of the National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, about why the U.S. wasn't prepared for this pandemic. Beth Cameron is now the Vice President for Global Biological Policy and Programs at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which has a new effort to help local officials during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://covid-local.org/\">You can find more information about that here</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
