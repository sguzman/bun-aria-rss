  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Harvard professor Bernard Bailyn studied pamphlets and reporters from the early1700’s. They weren’t interested in fundamentally transforming America, they were interested in expressing liberty. When the Democrat party and the media reject our history, they reject everything that followed from that history and all that was built from those results. We don’t have a free press anymore; we have a media because the free press advances principles that help society. This media is aligned with the Democrat Party and wants to change our nation in ways that are conflicted with our founding. Later, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar are ignorant people that are creations of the media. They are celebrated for their anti-Semitism and bigotry as they parade around the late night shows like celebrities as they suggest that Palestinians are only looking for human dignity. Also, AOC's fascist ideas aim to destroy capitalism. Medicare-For-All really means Medicare for nobody, and will eliminate Medicaid. They will take the V.A. Hospitals and further nationalize them along with all the doctors and their salaries, because, healthcare is s right. They will decide who lives and who dies by valuing your life, just like they do in Britain. Patients will face rationing, shortages, and massive bureaucracy, all of this means 'We The People' lose.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
