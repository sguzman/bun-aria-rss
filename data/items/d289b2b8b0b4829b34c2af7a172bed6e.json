  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most requested and popular guest, Bailee Ann, rejoins Bunnie this week to have some fun and spill some tea! Bailee catches us up on what life in 6th grade is really like, her best advice to handle bullies, and what’s it’s really like growing up with Bunnie and Jelly as parents. She also dishes the info on her verse in Jelly’s upcoming song, when we can expect to see her on tour, and how long it will be before she joins the family and gets her own channel on YouTube. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bunnie and Jelly have simple advice for bullies — just knock ‘em out! However, Bailee Ann subscribes to the idea that it’s good to try and ration with them first, and make sure you aren’t dealing with the situation alone. Then, if all else fails, punch them. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bailee’s music school, School of Rock, has been such a great experience and is shaping up Bailee and her band to be their very own performing rock stars. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bailee wrote her own verse to Jelly’s song, “Beautiful Disaster”, and even Bunnie couldn’t hide her poker face of how impressed she was. The song will be out Feb 21. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, Bailee really did wear a sweatshirt with a woman’s bare boobies on them to school, and you can thank Bunnie’s eyesight for the whole situation. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bailee is so pumped to join Jelly for some tour dates when she can, and even more excited to hang with Tech N9ne on the shows. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark your calendar now — September 19, 2020, will be with first Dumb Blonde live podcast!
