I'm Michael Zezas, Head of Public Policy Research and Municipal Strategy for Morgan Stanley. Along with my colleagues, bringing you a variety of perspectives, I'll be talking about the intersection between U.S. public policy and financial markets. It's Wednesday, December 22nd at 10:00 a.m. in New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While investors may be focused on the gridlock on the Build Back Better fiscal plan, we think it makes sense to shift our focus from Capitol Hill to the Federal Reserve, which just made a big move, and one that arguably matters more to markets in the near term than developments out of Congress. Last week, the Fed announced a more aggressive tapering of asset purchases. Perhaps more importantly, it signaled an expectation of hiking interest rates three times next year, rather than the two times most forecasters expected. In the press conference following the announcement, Chair Powell repeatedly signaled his intent was to demonstrate both that the Fed takes seriously the risk posed by a recent uptick in inflation, as well as the flexibility of the Fed's monetary policy, by discussing his willingness to adjust the taper and rate hike outlooks as data comes in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This last point is an important one for bond markets. In dealing with substantial uncertainty around the inflation outlook, you have a Fed that elected a pragmatic approach - a willingness to change its mind quickly as it sees fit. That's not a novel approach, but it may be fresh to many investors today who may be more accustomed to the slower, more deliberate approach that economic conditions pressed the Fed to take under its previous two chairs. But such an approach means it's harder to predict with confidence what will happen next to monetary rates. That uncertainty means more disagreement among investors, which in turn means more sustained volatility in the Treasury market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's not necessarily bad news for investors, though. In our view, it actually may lead to some interesting opportunities in 2022 for credit investors. In the muni market, for example, elevated rates volatility has, more often than not, caused market weakness as investors shy away from price uncertainty in an asset class they generally want to own for reasons of capital preservation and asset allocation. But muni credit quality, in our view, is likely to remain quite strong in 2022, with continued strong economic growth allowing municipal entities to lock in their credit gains from government aid and a sharp GDP recovery in 2020 and 2021. So, if volatility leads to price weakness, we're likely to see this as an opportunity to add good credit, just at a cheaper valuation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, beware the Fed and volatility, but don't fear it. We'll keep you updated here for the opportunities it may create.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Happy holidays from all of us here at Thoughts on the Market. We'll be back in the new year with more episodes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And thanks for listening.
