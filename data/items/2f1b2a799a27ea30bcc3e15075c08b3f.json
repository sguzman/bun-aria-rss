  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the leftist media tries its best to defend The Washington Post doxxing the creator of the Libs of Tik Tok account. We’ll talk about that, and also try to answer this question: Why are they bothering to go after Libs of Tik Tok at all? Also, cable news pundits are now shipping themselves off to go fight in Ukraine. A win/win perhaps? Elon Musk exposes the overpopulation hoax. A Democrat lawmaker earns props from the left for his theatrical, tearful speech protesting a bill to protect women’s sports. And as airline passengers tear off their muzzles and celebrate their freedom, the Biden Administration fights to muzzle them once again. \n\nGet 30% off my collection in the Daily Wire online store using code SWAGSHACK: https://utm.io/ueuBl. \n\nWhat is a Woman?
