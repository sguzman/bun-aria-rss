  "description": "<p>“The strength of two people together is enormous. That's why, all over the world, people and creatures are divided into two.” Artists Gilbert & George have been creating \"Art for All\" since they met as students in the 1960s. “In the old days, when we were socially involved with artists, they always would tell you they're always nervous of what to do next. We never had that problem. We were always really ready for whatever,” say the inimitable duo during this lively discussion about their work, their habits and their artistic philosophies.</p> <p>\"In Other Words\" is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby's, produced by <a href=\"http://www.audiation.fm/\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://www.audiation.fm/&source=gmail&ust=1508460957309000&usg=AFQjCNGoebcZrpSFFDC92L22Hnd5B1-Prw\">Audiation.fm</a>.</p> <p>For a full transcript, click here: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-17-transcript-gilbert-george/\"> http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-17-transcript-gilbert-george/</a></p>",
