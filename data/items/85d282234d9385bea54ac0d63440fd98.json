  "description": "Macro guru Raoul Pal is calling Bitcoin / Crypto the fastest growing asset class in human history and predicts gargantuan growth for the cryptocurrency markets by 2030.\n\nThe Real Vision CEO says Crypto markets could 100x from current levels and reach a $200 trillion market cap, even if there are slow years along the way.\n\n“We’re at 300 million active users worldwide in digital assets. Essentially, it’s growing at 185% [per year]. We get to 600 million-plus, call it 750 million, by the end of this year. Even if we have a slow year – we get to 500 million. The year after, it’s a billion. The year after that, it’s two billion. Year after that – four billion.\n\nThe speed at which this is coming, people do not comprehend. And the movement, I think, from the $2 trillion asset class today to the $200 trillion asset class that’s [Jeff Dorman’s] talking about is by the end of the decade.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
