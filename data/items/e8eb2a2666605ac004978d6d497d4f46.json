  "description": "<div>As the UK faces a rising energy crisis with gas supplies in short supply, questions are arising of not just how we mitigate the problem in the short term but how we hedge against it in the long term? What role might nuclear energy play? Whatâ€™s slowing down its development? Is it the technology? The funding? Or public attitudes towards nuclear energy. Can hearts and minds be swayed in its favour?<br>\n<br>\nKate Andrews is joined by Mark Jenkinson MP, vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Nuclear Energy and formerly a self-employed contractor in the nuclear supply chain; Wade Allison is emeritus professor at the University of Oxford; and Julia Pyke is the nuclear development director at EDF.<br>\n<br>\nThis podcast is kindly sponsored by EDF.</div>\n",
