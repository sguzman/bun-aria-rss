    "media:description": "Saul Schleimer and I attempt to explain what a Cannon-Thurston map is.\n\nThanks to my brother Will Segerman for making the carvings, and to Daniel Piker for making the figure-eight knot animations. I made the animation of the (super crinkly) surface using our app (with Dave Bachman) for cohomology fractals. You can play with the app (on Chrome or Firefox) at https://henryseg.github.io/cohomology_fractals/.\n\nAlso see: \nCannon and Thurston, Group invariant Peano curves, Geom. Topol., 2007.\nMumford, Series, and Wright, Indra's pearls, Cambridge University Press, 2002.\n\nSome of these curves are available in t-shirt form at https://www.neatoshop.com/artist/Henry-Segerman.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:28 The Hilbert curve\n01:00 Approximations to Cannon-Thurston map\n01:36 What space do they fill?\n02:01 Symmetry of the Hilbert curve\n02:34 Symmetry of the Cannon-Thurston map\n03:10 The Hilbert curve is artificial\n03:38 The complement of the figure-eight knot\n04:39 The universal cover\n05:20 Unwrapping the surface in the knot complement\n05:51 The crinkling\n06:50 Thurston's pictures\n07:24 Comparing algorithms\n08:23 s227\n09:18 Carvings",
