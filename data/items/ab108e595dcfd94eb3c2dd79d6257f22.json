  "description": "In today’s podcast we hear about the doxing of a major ISIS forum, and we take a look at the state of play with respect to online information operations in the war with ISIS. We ask whether jihad and kawaii offer contrasting case studies of inspiration. In Turkey, did coup plotters (who might have known better) overlook the Internet? DDoS campaigns rise against governments, companies, and games. A researcher shows how 2FA and account recovery capabilities can be subverted for fraud.  Malicious Excel macros are out in the wild. So are the Cknife web shell, as described to us by Recorded Future's Levi Gundert, and the venerable Enfal malware family. Joe Carrigan reminds us why we she be using two-factor authentication. We look at some recent venture investments.",
