Then I discovered that I am very late to this party regarding doxastic logic.</p>\n<p>From Wikipedia:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-25-at-2.44.07-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" /></p>\n<p>In all your blogging items, has doxastic ever been mentioned by anyone?</p>\n<p>*<em>Transpired</em> is an interesting word to me because, as incredible as it may seem, the synonym used today for it, i.e., happened, was fiercely opposed in the 1920s.  The preferred synonym was limited to perspired.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My response:  I&#8217;ve never heard the term &#8220;doxastic&#8221; before, but this discussion reminds me of the distinction between evidence and truth, which I&#8217;ve discussed in many places (for example <a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ethics22.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/04/06/important-distinction-truth-evidence/\">here</a>) and which I think causes no end of troubles among scientists who conflate these two ideas.</p>\n",
