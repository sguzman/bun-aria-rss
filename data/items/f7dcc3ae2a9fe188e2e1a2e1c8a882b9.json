  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's video, we have an incredibly spoiled family who reacts badly to OP's facial scars. The kid gets scared by the scars, which (let's be honest) is understandable because it's just a kid. But what's way worse than that is the parent's reaction, who actually scolds OP for having the audacity to have facial scars. OP turns it around on the parent and scolds him for being such a despicable human being. What kind of douchebag scolds someone for having facial scars?</p>\n<p>Watch on YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjrTmEV11-0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjrTmEV11-0</a></p>\n",
