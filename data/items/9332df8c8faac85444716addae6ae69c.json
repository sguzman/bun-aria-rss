  "description": "<p>Monarch butterflies are unique — they’re the only butterfly to travel thousands of miles when the seasons change. They travel from as far north as Canada all the way down to a few very specific mountaintops in central Mexico.</p>\n<p>They don’t have a car, or an airplane ticket.
