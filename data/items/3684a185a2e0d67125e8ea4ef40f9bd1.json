  "description": "<p><p>NFL Week 7 Fastest 2 minutes (3:10 - 8:17). We recap every game from Sunday. Kirk Cousins is back, the Lions fans roasted the refs , the Titans are buttcheeks still but the good kind. The Ravens are not frauds, the Niners D is legit, the Dolphins had a lead and the Bears are a dumpster fire. Who's back of the week, football guy of the week. College Football and suicidal Big Cat is back.
