  "description": "<p>Today on The Literary Life podcast, we will be discussing J. R. R. Tolkien’s essay “<a href= \"http://www.heritagepodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/Tolkien-On-Fairy-Stories-subcreation.pdf\">On Fairy Stories</a>“. Tune in again over the next two weeks as we continue the conversation with Tolkien’s short story “<a href= \"http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__leaf_by_niggle__en.htm\">Leaf by Niggle</a>“. Cindy, Angelina and Thomas are also excited to announce the second annual <a href= \"https://cindyrollins.net/back-to-school-2020/\">Back to School Online Conference</a>, happening August 3-8, 2020. Register today at <a href=\"https://cindyrollins.net/\">CindyRollins.net</a> for access both live and later.</p> <p>Angelina sets the stage for this discussion by orienting us to the context for the essay by Tolkien as a critique of what is considered a fairy story. She points out the difference between cautionary tales like those by Charles Perrault and the German folk and fairy tales collected by the Grimm Brothers. Our hosts highlight Tolkien’s definition of true fairy stories, ones that take place in the “perilous realm” and involve a journey element. He critiques Andrew Lang as including many stories as fairy tale that are not truly fairy stories. They also discuss topics from the essay including sub-creation, magic and spells, suspension of disbelief, and children’s responses to fairy stories.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One should forgive one’s enemies, but only after they are hanged.</p> <cite>Heinrich Heine</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The German folk soul can again express itself. These flames do not only illuminate the final end of the old era. They also light up the new. Never before have the young men had so good a right to clean up the debris of the past. If the old men do not understand what is going on, let them grasp that we young men have gone and done it. The old goes up in flames. The new shall be fashioned from the flame of our hearts.</p> <cite>Joseph Goebbles</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Human beings are not human doings.</p> <cite>Nigel Goodwin</cite></blockquote> <h3>Into My Heart an Air That Kills</h3> <p><em>by A.
