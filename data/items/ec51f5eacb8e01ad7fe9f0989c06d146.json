  "description": "<p>U.S. media companies are producing new glitzy reality TV shows in Africa. It’s a different kind of portrayal of Africa - something Hana has always wanted: a change in the narrative of poverty, war and famine. But something doesn’t feel quite right. She’s trying to just get her popcorn and enjoy the drama and messiness, but she’s conflicted and she’s wondering why. She talks it out with Nigerian writer Damilola Oyedele - someone else who is watching, and thinking at the same time. Plus, we go to Lagos, Nigeria- to hear how people there are reacting there.</p>",
