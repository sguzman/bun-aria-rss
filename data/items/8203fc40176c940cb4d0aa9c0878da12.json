  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show paying off a tease from our last show where Drew claimed to have pushed back against a school board member who was announcing school closures in March of 2020. Once Adam stops screaming about the buffoonery of the LA School Board & Teachers Union the conversation turns to phones as they speak to a caller who suffers from cystic fibrosis and wants to discuss how covid impacted her life. Adam then turns to the Urban Dictionary to review some of the contributions he has made there over the years. As the show wraps up they turn to the phones and speak to callers on topics from new vaccine options to antibody durability and more.\n\nThanks For Supporting Today's Sponsors:\nBabbel.com/ADS\nLifelock.com Promo Code ADAM\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
