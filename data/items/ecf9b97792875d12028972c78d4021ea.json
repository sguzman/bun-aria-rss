  "description": "<p>This week, we're exploring the history of Japan's most famous drink: sake, or Japanese rice wine (though it turns out, 'sake' in Japanese doesn't necessarily refer to what we think of, nor is it actually a 'rice wine' in the technical sense). We're covering everything from tax laws to how to make your own sake using nothing but your own spit, so buckle up! It's gonna be a fun one.</p> <p>Show notes <a href= \"http://isaacmeyer.net/2021/02/episode-376-the-nectar-of-the-gods/\"> here</a>.</p>",
