  "description": "<p>It’s our first book episode of 2019! Today we are talking about <em>Little White Lies</em> by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. We loved it! It’s a little bit <em>Gossip Girl</em> and a little bit <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> or <em>Paper Princess.</em> This book is soap opera-level drama and it has a twist so good, even Grace didn’t see it coming! We can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this book. Speaking of books, Grace finished her tenth book of 2019 this weekend, while Becca finished her seventh. Also, Grace has resolved to only buy books from bookstores, and Becca can’t stop buying cookbooks!</p> <p>Also in this episode,  we read our favorite review we’ve ever gotten (TexasListener101… we’re looking at you!) where we were compared to <em>Sex and the City</em> characters. To top it all off, Tyrion is ultra stoned on catnip! </p> <p><strong>Can't get enough Bad On Paper?</strong></p> <p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/yapod\">FB group</a> for amazing book recs & more</p> <p>Follow us on Instagram <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/badonpaperpodcast\">@badonpaperpodcast</a></p>",
