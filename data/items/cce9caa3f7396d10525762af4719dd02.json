  "description": "<p>Bodhichitta - The Awakened Heart - Part 2 (2016-03-02)</p>\n<p>While the brightness and warmth of our hearts is always here, like the sun when blocked by clouds, our intrinsic love can be obscured. These two talks explore how we become arrested in a confining story of separate self, and how remembering love releases us from this trance. The first talk emphasizes inner pathways of freeing our heart and the second talk explores awakening bodhichitta actively in relating with each other.</p>\n<p>\"To love someone is to learn the song in their heart and sing it to them when they have forgotten.\" Arne Garborg</p>\n<p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
