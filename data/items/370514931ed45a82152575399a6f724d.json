  "description": "<p>In this paper, we propose an approach how connected and highly automated\nvehicles can perform cooperative maneuvers such as lane changes and left-turns\nat urban intersections where they have to deal with human-operated vehicles and\nvulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians in so-called mixed\ntraffic. In order to support cooperative maneuvers the urban intersection is\nequipped with an intelligent controller which has access to different sensors\nalong the intersection to detect and predict the behavior of the traffic\nparticipants involved. Since the intersection controller cannot directly\ncontrol all road users and - not least due to the legal situation - driving\ndecisions must always be made by the vehicle controller itself, we focus on a\ndecentralized control paradigm. In this context, connected and highly automated\nvehicles use some carefully selected game theory concepts to make the best\npossible and clear decisions about cooperative maneuvers. The aim is to improve\ntraffic efficiency while maintaining road safety at the same time. Our first\nresults obtained with a prototypical implementation of the approach in a\ntraffic simulation are promising.\n</p>",
