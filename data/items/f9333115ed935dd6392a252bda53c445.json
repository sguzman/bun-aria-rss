While there’s nothing inherently wrong with wanting to build a fit, aesthetically pleasing body, it’s not the only reason you should work out. Becoming a stronger and healthier version of yourself is about much more than what your abs look like; it’s also about your mindset, your routines around sleep and nutrition, and your functionality on an everyday basis.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Today’s guest, Gunnar Peterson, is a personal trainer who is recognized for working with professional athletes and celebrities. What I love about his approach is his focus on movements that are critical whether you’re in the gym, in a championship game, or just everyday life. With nearly 30 years in the industry with a focus on functional training modalities, Gunnar is an expert in all things fitness. In this interview, he’s sharing the best principles for building a strong and functional body.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Interviewing Gunnar has been a goal of mine from the beginning of The Model Health Show, and this experience did not disappoint! On this episode, you’re going to hear Gunnar’s background and how he started working with celebrities, the importance of sustainability in any health practice, the power of consistency and intentionality, and so much more.
