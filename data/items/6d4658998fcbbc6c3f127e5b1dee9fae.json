  "description": "<p>Raymond Antrobus’s poem “<a href=\"https://onbeing.org/poetry/miami-airport/\">Miami Airport</a>” bears witness to the disempowerment that comes when you’re not believed. The voice of the poet is absent, and all we hear is an interrogator seeking to disrupt and displace. This space of suspicion creates anxiety, transporting us to the places and times when someone has questioned the truth of our story.</p><p>A question to reflect on after you listen: When have you felt disempowered by questions about yourself? Did you find your voice again? How?</p><p>About the Poet:</p><p>Raymond Antrobus is a freelance poet and teacher. He is one of the world’s first recipients of a MA in Spoken Word Education from Goldsmiths, University of London and is the recipient of the Geoffrey Dearmer Award by the Poetry Society (judged by Ocean Vuong). He has received fellowships from Cave Canem, Complete Works iii, and Jerwood Compton Poetry.</p><p>“<a href=\"https://onbeing.org/poetry/miami-airport/\">Miami Airport</a>” comes from Raymond Antrobus’s book <i>The Perseverance</i>. Thank you to Penned in the Margins, who published the book and gave us permission to use Raymond’s poem.
