    "media:description": "Gareth Soloway, president and CFO of InTheMoneyStocks.com, speaks with Daniela Cambone at the 2022 Stansberry Conference and Alliance Meeting in Boston. He believes bitcoin is \"absolutely sleeping beauty right now, buyers and sellers are equaling each other out for the time being.\" \"The lows are not in yet\" for the cryptocurrency, Soloway continues. He observes that the Fed has given its first hint that it's finally wavering. Going into 2023, gold will be the best-performing asset as it nears its meteoric run. Soloway concludes by saying, \"I do like Cardano, Solana, Avalanche and others in the near term,\" and touts Ethereum and bitcoin as viable longer-term investments.\n\n#federalreserve #gold #bitcoin\n\n⭐️ Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  https://danielacambone.com\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryRe... \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_...\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stan...",
