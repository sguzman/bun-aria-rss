  "title": "The conservative mind of Yuval Levin",
  "description": "Something I’ve been thinking a lot about recently is the way we often conflate two very distinct things when we assign political labels. The first is ideology, which describes our vision of a just society. The second is something less discussed but equally important: temperament. It describes how we approach social problems, how fast we think society can change, and how we understand the constraints upon us. \nYuval Levin is the director of Social, Cultural, and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, the editor-in-chief of the public policy journal National Affairs, and the author of the upcoming book A Time to Build. Levin is one of the most thoughtful articulators of both conservative temperament and ideology. And, perhaps for that reason, his is one of the most important criticisms of what the conservative movement has become today.\nThere’s a lot in this conversation, in part because Levin’s book speaks to mine in interesting ways, but among the topics we discuss are: \n\nThe conservative view of human nature\n\nWhy the conservative temperament is increasingly diverging from the conservative movement\n\nWhat theories of American politics get wrong about the reality of American life\n\nThe case Levin makes to socialists\n\nHow economic debates are often moral debates in disguise\n\nLevin’s rebuttal to my book \n\nThe crucial difference between “formative” and “performative” social institutions\n\nWhy the most fundamental problems in American life are cultural, not economic\n\nWhy Levin thinks the New York Times should not allow its journalists to be on Twitter\n\nWhether we can restore trust in our institutions without changing the incentives and systems that surround them\n\n \nThere’s a lot Levin and I disagree on, but there are few people I learn as much from in disagreement as I learn from him.\nBook recommendations: \nDemocracy in America by Alexis De Tocqueville \nThe Quest for Community by Robert Nisbet \nStatecraft as Soulcraft by George Will \nIf you enjoyed this episode, you may also like: \nDavid French on “The Great White Culture War\"\nGeorge Will makes the conservative case against democracy\n\nMy book is available for pre-order!
