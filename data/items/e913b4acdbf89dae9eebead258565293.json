  "description": "<div>Hi friends! <br>\nWe’ve got a long one! Thank you for always sending recommendations my way, I so greatly appreciate you guys for doing that. Some of the story I did cut out for time purposes, but over all we got the major stuff covered. Um, not much you can really say about him. You know what’s crazy though ? His upbringing seems so tame compared to lots of others we’ve talked about here and he was REALLY BAD. I wonder if there was more to his upbringing he didn't share or I missed. I definitely lost my voice on this one. Ha. Love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon.<br>\nx o<br>\nBailey Sarian </div>\n",
