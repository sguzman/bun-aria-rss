Emily testified before Congress last week about the role of legacy media, and cable news in particular, in spreading disinformation, but she’s also one of the keenest observers of the online news ecosystem and knows a lot about it from her days as director of digital content for The Guardian. They talked about the relationship between online and offline media in spreading disinformation, the role different institutions need to play in fixing what’s broken and whether all the talk about “fighting misinformation” is a bit of a red herring.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
