  "description": "<p>Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum was a place of immense sadness that was for many years home to the mentally ill and other unfortunate souls. The name would change later to Weston State Hospital. The hospital closed in 1994, but the building reopened as a historic site offering tours. And as is the case with so many of these places, one can investigate the paranormal here and there are so many stories of unexplained experiences coming out of this place, that it is hard not to believe that this is one of the most haunted places in the world. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. The Moment in Oddity features The Mystery of Skeleton Lake and This Month in History features Hank Aaron beating Babe Ruth's home run record.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Kobo Audiobooks, check out <a href= \"http://kobo.com/HISTORYGOESBUMP\">http://kobo.com/HISTORYGOESBUMP</a> and use code HISTORY40 for 40% off and also by the History or His Story Podcast at http://hisstorypodcast.com.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/04/hgb-ep-333-trans-allegheny-lunatic.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Haunting Theme by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
