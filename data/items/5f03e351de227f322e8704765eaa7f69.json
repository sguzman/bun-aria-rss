  "description": "<p>We consider design-based causal inference in settings where randomized\ntreatments have effects that bleed out into space in complex ways that overlap\nand in violation of the standard \"no interference\" assumption for many causal\ninference methods. We define a spatial \"average marginalized response,\" which\ncharacterizes how, in expectation, units of observation that are a specified\ndistance from an intervention point are affected by treatments at that point,\naveraging over effects emanating from other intervention points. We establish\nconditions for non-parametric identification, asymptotic distributions of\nestimators, and recovery of structural effects. We propose methods for both\nsample-theoretic and permutation-based inference. We provide illustrations\nusing randomized field experiments on forest conservation and health.\n</p>",
