  "description": "The Nisse’s New Suit - Is it possible to be too kind to a little magical Nisse who helps out on your farm? In this Scandanavian story, a young couple try to thank their Nisse for helping them. But little people can be tricky, and things don’t go as expected. Listen to Tiernan Douieb tell this story from Norway, and discover what goes wrong.\n\nThe Ghost of the Bloody Finger - This ‘scary-not-scary’ story sets out perfectly why it’s probably not a good idea to brag about ‘not being afraid of anything’ – especially when it comes to ghosts! Fortunately, the tale has a funny ending. It’s a good one for beginners to have a go at telling themselves.",
