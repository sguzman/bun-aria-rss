  "description": "<p>Monday 8/21- Today on the show we payed homage to comedian/activist Dick Gregory after he passed this weekend. He spoke on Donald Trump, race relations and more. Also we did the listeners favorite segment \"Shoot Your Shot\" where a listener tried to shoot his shot at a woman who he passed up in the past cause of her heavy weight, but not anymore. But as the new saying goes \"Had back fat they didn't want me, but now I'm hot and they all on me\". Also, after a heartbreaking ending to the show \"Power\" last night, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to the son Tariq St. Patrick for his actions in the show. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
