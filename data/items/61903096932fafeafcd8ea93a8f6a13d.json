  "description": "<p>New York Times best-selling author Cheryl Strayed reflects on her soul-stirring memoir “Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail.” Filled with honesty, raw emotion and breathtaking moments, the book outlines the events that led Cheryl to embark on an 1,100 mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. In 1995, Cheryl was a 26-year-old waitress whose life hit rock bottom after she lost her mother to cancer. Cheryl says she scarcely resembled the healthy, strong, and happy woman she used to be. She knew she needed to make a radical change in her life, and decided to journey back into her true self, step-by-step, along the Pacific Crest Trail. Cheryl’s journey proves that all is never lost, even in the darkest hour. In 2014, “Wild” was produced as a major motion picture, starring Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl.</p>\n",
