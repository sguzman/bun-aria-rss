  "description": "In this episode we are going to be rounding out this podcast with common design mistakes, which is part two of our previous episode. Sometimes people get too carried away with certain \"heroes\" and just have too many items representing one icon in history, causing the room or home to feel less unique. Try to avoid the karate chopped pillow, as it will give it a less inviting, don’t-touch-these look to your furniture. We talk about when people request that we do their bedroom like a hotel room and the flaws that can produce. We also touch on tourist, condo, or timeshare art and why you should not be hanging any of that on your walls. Make sure to avoid putting your family photos on canvas, but instead put a frame around them. We discuss wallpaper and what you should avoid, such as using the same wallpaper throughout your whole home and how to make it look ideal.<br /><br />Iconitis 1:27<br />The karate chopped pillow 4:50<br />Fake metal finishes 6:56<br />Dried flower arrangements 10:26<br />Hotel inspired rooms 12:28<br />Avoid condo art or tourist art 15:17<br />Over protection of furniture 20:08<br />Room dimmers 22:51<br />Different wallpaper 26:51<br /><br />“We have so many people when we talk to them about their primary bedroom, ‘What do you want this to look like?’ It can be anything on Earth, right? It’s a new construction, no decoration has been done yet. It can literally be anything, and they’ll say, ‘I just want it to feel like a hotel.’ And you’re like, ‘No, you actually don’t. Nobody wants that. Nobody wants that really generic, stale, dark fake wood nightstands and upholstered headboard that’s flat up against the wall.” 12:47<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
