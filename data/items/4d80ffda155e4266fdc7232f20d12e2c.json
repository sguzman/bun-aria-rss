  "description": "<p>Living in Australia, I had heard of the Snowtown case. I knew it as the bodies in the barrels case. But that’s all I knew. I had no idea about the who, the what, the why, or the when.</p>\n\n\n<p>So I didn’t know it was the worst case of serial killing in Australia’s history, involving torture and dismemberment. None of the murder victims are children. However, child sexual abuse is prominent throughout.</p>\n\n\n<p>It is a deeply disturbing, depraved case. I didn’t know any of that when I started looking into Snowtown, but now you do, and you can make an informed decision if you want to listen or not.</p>\n\n\n<p>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-19-snowtown/\"><strong><a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-19-snowtown\">casefilepodcast.com/case-19-snowtown</a></strong></a></p>\n",
