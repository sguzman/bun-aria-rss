I hope you LOVE IT!\nOur friend Herman is back with a new story about dealing with FRUSTRATION. But before we get to that, a STUDIO SPIDER has brought to my attention that there is an ISSUE with Herman. In this ridiculous episode, we come to terms with my fallibility and listen as Herman copes with an increasingly frustrating situation.
