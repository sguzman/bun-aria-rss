  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin on Labor Day! America is rounding the corner on the China virus. Hospitalizations are down, fatalities are down, and testing has significantly increased. President Trump's Operation Warp Speed initiative has enabled the CDC to possibly have a vaccine as soon as November 1, 2020. Yet, Joe Biden remains critical of America's success in fighting the virus when he in fact has a poor track record with pandemics. Then, an activist at a leftwing publication, owned by a Biden mega-donor, has falsely accused Trump of trashing dead soldiers. Even fellow leftwing writers have questioned why the piece only cites anonymous sources. Well-known Trump enemy, John Bolton, says he was there and that the decision to not visit the graves of the soldiers was made by Gen. Kelly due to the weather. Later, the media got a reality check when Special Envoy Richard Grenell took them to task over their inexperience and bias regarding news of Kosovo and Serbia. Grenell challenged reporters to study their history and questioned whether they could even find Kosovo on a map. Finally, Donald Trump Jr. calls in to discuss his new book, Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden And The Democrats' Defense Of The Indefensible. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
