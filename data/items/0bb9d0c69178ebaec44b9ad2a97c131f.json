  "description": "<p>With the dust finally settling on one of the highest stakes US elections in recent memory, pollsters, pundits, academics, and policymakers are looking to make sense of what happened. What are the key take-aways from the 2020 US elections? Why did the results turn out as they did? What are the main policy implications of the elections, and how will they shape US governance in the coming years? In this panel discussion, four leading experts—Ross Douthat (New York Times), Sunshine Hillygus (Duke), Terry M. Moe (Stanford), and Paul E. Peterson (Harvard)—will offer a retrospective on how Americans cast their ballots in 2020 and investigate its significance for the nation’s political landscape. </p>\n",
