  "description": "<p>After the excitement of the Beijing Olympics, we're back to bring you another interview as we chat with two-time Australian Olympic Javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Barber about her amazing career and amazing Olympic experiences! We find out from Kelsey-Lee just how she got into the sport and why she freakin' loves it so much. We also learn about how making her first ever Australian team felt just like it was just 'business' and how her disappointment at her performance at Rio in 2016 helped spurred her on to the great success she would have moving forward. Added to this we learn why she might be about to make a killing in the t-shirt industry and just why she is possibly the most passionate guest we've ever had on the show about their respective sport. It's a great chat that you have to listen to! So get to it!</p>",
