    "media:description": "This is a tool-assisted speedrun of the canyon dribble map in hardcore mode. No physics were altered. The ball and car position only get set at the very start of the run. It's simply a combination of exact inputs that leads to this result.\n\nUploaded on April 1st with the following description:\nI've been speedrunning this custom Rocket League map a bit lately and got this insane run. I will have a proper video coming out tomorrow that will explain how I got so good at speedrunnning. The fastest previous time I was able to find was from Fairy Peak on his first try (55:23). There is an any % run with 1:34 but that obviously skips all the checkpoints.\n\nMap by Ebarra0 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697227168\n\nCreator Code:\nROCKETSCIENCE\nI earn commissions when you use the code to buy in the Epic Store, or RL and Fortnite in game shops. #EpicPartner\n\nSupport me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/rocketscience\n\nFollow me on twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/HalfwayDeadRL\n\nJoin my Discord:\nhttps://discord.rocketscience.fyi\n\nAnd you can follow me on twitch :)\nhttps://twitch.tv/halfwaydead\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic\n\nDion Timmer - Shiawase\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRocket Science\n#RocketScience\n#RocketLeague",
