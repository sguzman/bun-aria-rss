But you can’t see them while you’re listening, so it doesn’t really matter! It’s a new look but it has the same great taste.

Does she love it or hate it? Tune in to find out.\n\n02:17 - Code Media\n\n03:23 - Apple headlines, iPhone 8 rumors\n\n09:58 - TV stuff\n\n14:34 - Planet of the Apps\n\n21:54 - Caavo\n\n33:32 - Verizon’s new unlimited data plan\n\n40:52 - Hater app with Megan\n\n46:48 - Paul’s weekly segment “Dieter wouldn’t let me make a slurping noise for the name of this segment”\n\n49:08 - This Belle doll will dance for you, but only if you attempt to code\n\n53:08 - Sonos news / consumer audio talk\n\n1:02:28 - Android apps on Chrome OS\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
