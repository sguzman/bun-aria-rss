  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down The Negotiation, and we couldn't do this episode without an interview with the amazing David Denman. David shares his memories from this episode, saying goodbye to the show, and we get his take on a potential Roy and Angela relationship. Then, the ladies deep dive on the art of negotiation, chat about Daryl's negotiation strategy and Micheal's \"ladies clothes\". Finally, we get another Heartbreak In the Breakroom moment with a song brought to us by Josh Compton, we take a fun movie tangent, and we discuss that emotional scene between Pam and Roy. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on instagram @officeladiespod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have questions for an upcoming episode, visit <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__officeladies.com_submitaquestion&d=DwMFaQ&c=aLv4kG3eFBuAUFgZFQ07JQ&r=tLr8qzvUqzBDOt-3tLBXNg&m=-p_ChextsOtNq4lP11b06U1nIbdeX0xlzt18q-VpaO0&s=lgDOOKKWzzyRM67efvUN7s79nQETiI2WJE8mmIuHAZw&e=\">https://officeladies.com/submitaquestion</a> to file your question there, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:officeladies@earwolf.com\">officeladies@earwolf.com</a> </p>\n",
