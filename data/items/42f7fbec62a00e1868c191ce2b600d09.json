While there is some debate over whether a meme ETF is possible at all, there is an ETF out there that gets pretty close and counts AMC and GameStop as its top two holdings.

And while its up big it hasn't seen the rush of flows we are accustomed to seeing when an ETF surges like this.</p><p>On this episode of Trillions we speak with John Gardner, the Business Head of Invest at SoFi, and the brains behind SFYF and the other ETFs they offer. We speak to him about this 'lightening in a bottle' moment with SFYF as well as SoFi's other ETFs and how they fit into the company's bigger business plans. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
