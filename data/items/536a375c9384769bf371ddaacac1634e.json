The managing of portfolio credit risks is crucial for financial institutions. The multi-factor Merton model is one of the most widely used tools that modelling the credit risks for financial institutions. Typically, the implementation of the multi-factor Merton model involves Monte Carlo simulations which are time-consuming. This would significantly restrict its usability in daily credit risk measurement. In this report, we propose an FPGA architecture for credit-risk measurements in the multi-factor Merton models. The presented architecture uses a variety of optimization techniques such as kernel vectorization and loop unrolling, to optimize the performance of the FPGA implementation. The evaluation results show that compare to a basic C++ implementation running on a single-core Intel i5-4210 CPU, our proposed FPGA implementation can achieve an acceleration of up to 22 times, with a precision loss of less than 10&#8722;8.\n  \n   "
