    "media:description": "More info about the book here: https://www.mezzoguild.com/goto/korean-stories\nVisit my blog here: https://www.mezzoguild.com/\n\nI recently received a copy of Korean Stories For Language Learners by Julie Damron and EunSun You (Tuttle Publishing).\n\nThe book covers 42 total short stories in Korean with English translations, comprehension exercises, vocab lists and full audio listening material.\n\nSince the 'short story' niche of learning material seems to be trending at the moment, I thought I'd take time to check this one out. Rather than covering typical dialogue material, it focuses on traditional Korean folktales. The audio is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nA few minor things to point out: absolute beginner material is inappropriate for this book (there's not much of it so it's not a major issue) and some exercises are borderline bizarre (but still funny).\n\nSomething a dedicated Korean student who loves Korean history and culture would definitely enjoy reading.",
