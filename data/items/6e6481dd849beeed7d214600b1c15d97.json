  "description": "Today, millions of immigrants have found a home in the United States. But often, such people end up losing their individual cultures, languages, and identities—simply because they aren’t aligned with those of the rest of the crowd.\nSo what is it like to be living in a nation you weren’t born in? What are the stories and experiences of people who find themselves alternating between two linguistic and cultural worlds?\nIn this new episode, Luis Javier Pentón Herrera and Ethan Tính Trịnh, editors of “Critical Storytelling: Multilingual Immigrants in the United States” talk about how their book brings together powerful voices of immigrants living in the United States. The book is a fusion of narratives by individual immigrants—each story offering a fresh perspective on living as a trans-national person in the United States and containing strong messages of acknowledgment, negotiation, and resilience.\nThis episode is a part of a new special series by Brill, which focuses on Brill’s commitment to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each episode is related to a specific SDG. This episode covers SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
