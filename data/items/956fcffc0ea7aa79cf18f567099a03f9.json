Negative thoughts and stress have been shown to seriously degrade the body and the functioning of the brain because it's our thoughts and emotions that are continuously reassembling, reorganizing, re-creating our body.” – Dr. John Hagelin</p> <p>The mind-body connection is powerful. Our thoughts and beliefs can play a profound role in our biological functioning, and one way to tap into this complex relationship is to establish a meditation practice. We often hear about using meditation as a way to unplug from our modern world, but the truth is that meditation is a practice that’s been in existence for thousands of years. But what hasn’t always been around is the science to back up the powerful effects that meditation can have on the human body.</p> <p>This Masterclass episode is going to take you through seven mind-blowing ways that meditation can transform your health. You’ll learn about stress reduction, the impacts on cognitive function and the immune system, and how a mindfulness practice can actually alter your physical appearance.
