  "description": "<p>Travis is the drummer of the popular rock band blink 182. His conversation with Joe was a really interesting one. This was a great insight in to the life of a rock star. Travis has been through an incredible career and a horrific plane crash and come out the other side a really well thought-out dude. This podcast was great.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
