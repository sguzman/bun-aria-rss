  "title": "Loan classification under IFRS 9",
  "description": "IFRS 9 requires classifying non-defaulted loans in two stages depending on their credit quality evolution since initial recognition by the bank.

In particular he computes the target value of the stage 2 ‘hit rate’ and the size of the stage 2 portfolio",
