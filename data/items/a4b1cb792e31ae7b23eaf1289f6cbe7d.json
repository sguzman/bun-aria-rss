  "description": "<p>EPISODE 60 - BILLY O’LEARY - Gaffer</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with frequent collaborator and friend, gaffer Billy O’Leary (THE IRISHMAN, BLADE RUNNER 2049, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS). It’s a wonderful walk down memory lane and we learned a lot too! He defines the role of gaffer and walks through what he does in prep and how he works with different DPs. He also talks about his love of NOT relying on big lights and working up lighting gags. He likes restrictions and having to think outside of the box. He talks about some specifics on Shawshank Redemption, Blade Runner 2049, Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink and Fargo. When asked what his gaffer’s nightmare is, he not only told us but let us know it was a waking nightmare - he did experience it! A fun and informative conversation that we think you’ll like!</p>",
