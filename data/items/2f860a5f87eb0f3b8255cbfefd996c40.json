  "description": "<p>Listen to Season 4 of the <em>27 Club</em> to hear the insane details behind the life of one of rock's greatest icons — Amy Winehouse. With a voice that seemed to come from another time and an attitude that defied time itself, Amy Winehouse fused the past with the present to make music for the future. But as a central figure in the dawn of 24/7 tabloid and social media celebrity coverage, Amy Winehouse’s story is about much more than the music. At times, it’s about everything but the music. It’s a story of pop idols and police raids, of breakthroughs and breakdowns, of punch-ups and photographers, of triumphant comebacks and violent comedowns...and of a once-in-a-century talent that barely made it into the new century. Jake Brennan, the creator and host of the award-winning <em>Disgraceland</em> podcast, brings you an all new season of the<em> 27 Club </em>that is not to be missed. The<em> 27 Club</em> Season 4 launches on Thursday December 2, 2021.</p><p>For more info on the<em> 27 Club</em> and other great shows, visit the <a href=\"https://www.doubleelvis.com/\">Double Elvis website</a> and follow Double Elvis on T<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoubleElvisfm\">witter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/doubleelvis/\">Instagram</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
