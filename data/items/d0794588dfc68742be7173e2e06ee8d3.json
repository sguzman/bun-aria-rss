  "description": "<p>Financial derivatives are an important component of the financial markets, as they enable risk management. The decentralised derivatives market is expected to grow exponentially with DeFi's growth and, as a result, a widespread and robust financial infrastructure is required. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Opium is a financial protocol for decentralised financial derivative products. Opium Protocol is completely based on open-source software and smart contracts. In addition to conforming to values from the DeFi space and possibly incorporating DeFi currency market and protocols, the Opium Protocol is designed to also incorporate into the traditional financial sector and market participants. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Opium allows the creation, settling and trading of decentralised derivative products on Ethereum. Opium combines any Oracle with any financial tool (e.g. &nbsp;Dapps can interact with Opium). Every position represented by a token can be traded, sent or stored. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Derivative instruments built on top of the Opium Exchange always have limited potential losses and gains. Through a $ OPIUM token and a DAO, the Opium Protocol and its ecosystem will, over time, be completely governed by everyone.</p>\n<p>Get the book at https://book.economicsdesign.com I Pay with crypto and get 15% off</p>\n",
