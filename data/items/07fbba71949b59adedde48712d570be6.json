  "title": "Adrian Reimers, “Hell and the Mercy of God” (Catholic U. of America Press, 2017)",
  "description": "A central theological and philosophical problem facing Christians is the question “How could a merciful God damn people to hell?” It is tempting to solve this issue by developing an image of God that leaves out mercy or an understanding of Christian doctrine that rejects the concept of hell. In his new book, Hell and the Mercy of God (Catholic University of America Press, 2017), Adrian Reimers takes up this challenge. In this thought-provoking work, Reimers does not simply seek to resolve this apparent contradiction, but reveals the connections between Gods mercy and hell while embracing the ambiguity of human existence. Philosophers and theologians in particular will find this work useful, but it is so clear that students, and even historians like myself, will be able to understand it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
