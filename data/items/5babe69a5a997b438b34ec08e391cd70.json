  "description": "<p>What is microdosing?  Why do so many people swear by it?  But does it really work?  Dr. Sophia Korb is a therapist and researcher who worked for the Fadiman Group on the largest microdosing study in the world.  We talked about the findings from that study, including perceived benefits and downsides, why people start or stop microdosing, and patterns of consumption including combining tiny doses of psychedelics with chocolate, lion’s mane mushrooms or niacin.  I was curious about similarities and differences between microdosing and macrodosing.  And we discussed the potential and risks of commercialization since microdosing involves much more frequent consumption than macrodosing.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
