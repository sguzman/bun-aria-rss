  "description": "<p>Einstein! Theoretical physicist. Nobel Prize winning mathematician. Guy who made his name synonymous with genius. Man who changed the world’s understanding of space and time. Guy who Flat Earthers and Conspiracy nuts think is a fraud. A man who stayed curious and worked on coming to a firmer understanding of the world around him and the universe that contained that world until quite literally the day he died. Also, maybe one of the world’s worst husbands. Also maybe a super shitty dad. His genius is indisputable. How great of a person he may have been is a little more complicated. So let’s dig in. Let’s suck in. Lets’s get a little smarter ourselves this holiday season and suck on some Albert Einstein!
