This season we're tackling the Benghazi scandal, starting with the rise of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending with the 2016 election. The episode we're sharing today is the fourth one in the series, in which Mitt Romney's presidential campaign pounces on the Benghazi attack as a political issue before the attack itself was even over.
