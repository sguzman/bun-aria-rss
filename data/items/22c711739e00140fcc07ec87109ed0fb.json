  "description": "<p>A measurement of the jet mass distribution in hadronic decays of\nLorentz-boosted top quarks is presented. The measurement is performed in the\nlepton+jets channel of top quark pair production ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) events,\nwhere the lepton is an electron or muon. The products of the hadronic top quark\ndecay are reconstructed using a single large-radius jet with transverse\nmomentum greater than 400 GeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at\nthe LHC in proton-proton collisions and correspond to an integrated luminosity\nof 138 fb$^{-1}$. The differential $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ production cross section\nas a function of the jet mass is unfolded to the particle level and is used to\nextract the top quark mass. The jet mass scale is calibrated using the hadronic\nW boson decay within the large-radius jet. The uncertainties in the modelling\nof the final state radiation are reduced by studying angular correlations in\nthe jet substructure. These developments lead to a significant increase in\nprecision, and a top quark mass of 172.76 $\\pm$ 0.81 GeV.\n</p>",
