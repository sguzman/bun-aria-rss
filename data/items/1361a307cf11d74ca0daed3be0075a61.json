We’ve each been called by God to love our families, train up our children, and use our gifts and abilities to glorify him in our unique situations. For some moms, this means they work exclusively in the home. For other moms, this means they work in and out of the home. In this episode, Nikki Daniels, wife, mom of three, and Assistant Headmaster of Advancement at Monte Vista Christian School, reminds us that God values us in every role he calls us to. No matter where we spend our days, our call is to be faithful with what he’s given us. The gospel will always meet a mom where she’s at and offer her the sweet freedom of a woman – not just a mom – rooted in Christ.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_1071\" class=\"row sqs-row\"> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1512485357719_144452\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_432\" class= \"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_431\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/show-archive/ep-83-nikki-daniels-finding-freedom-in-christ-as-a-working-mom#rm-apply\" data-initialized=\"true\">RM APPLY QUESTIONS</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_1070\" class= \"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1512485357719_146537\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_439\" class= \"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_438\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a id= \"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_1069\" class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-83-nikki-daniels-finding-freedom-in-christ-as-a-working-mom-transcript\" target=\"_top\" name=\"yui_3_17_2_53_1512485357719_1069\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1512485357719_144520\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p><strong>Articles, Resources and Related Content:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/having-it-all-at-work-and-at-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Having It All at Work and Home</a> - Nikki Daniels, TGC</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/every-woman-s-call-to-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Every Woman’s Call to Work</a> - Abigail Dodds, Desiring God</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/women-work-and-our-crisis-of-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women, Work, and Our Crisis of Identity</a> - Carolyn McCulley, Desiring God </li> <li><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/will-you-still-work-when-the-baby-is-born/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will You Still Work When the Baby Is Born?</a> - Macy English, TGC</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/women-trade-self-worth-for-awe-and-wonder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women, Trade Self-Worth for Awe and Wonder</a> - Jen Wilkin, Desiring God</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/finding-your-identity-in-christ-looks-like-death/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finding Your Identity in Christ Looks Like Death</a> - Trillia Newbell, Rosaria Butterfield & Blair Linne, TGC</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ilUnf9\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Every Good Endeavor: Connecting Your Work to God's Work</a> - Tim Keller </li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2nuFYTr\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">What's Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done</a> - Matthew Aaron Perman</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2At0oAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Just Do Something: A Liberating Approach to Finding God's Will</a> - Kevin DeYoung</li> <li><a href= \"https://hunterbeless.com/new-blog/2017/7/ep18-on-theology-of-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Theology of Identity with Matt Lantz</a> - Hunter Beless, Journeywomen Podcast</li> </ul> <p><strong> For More:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>To subscribe: </strong>on iOS, go to our <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-risen-motherhood-podcast/id1072833310?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iTunes page</a> and subscribe.

How do you grow a gospel-centered filter to discern truth in a world of personal opinions?</p> </li> <li> <p>Saying no to the world’s ideas of motherhood in order to say yes to God’s design for motherhood will be costly. Thankfully, we do not need to fear man’s judgment, because we know that God’s design is always better. How does God describe a mother’s role in scripture?

When you look at your list, what are your “best things” in light of scripture?</p> </li> <li> <p>The gospel applies to everyone – across history, culture, and geographic locations. Women have always served their families in different capacities. It’s encouraging to remember that God has already prepared good works for us to do in each of our roles: woman, wife, mother, worker. Everything we do is in service to him, so it all matters. How do your different roles in this season of life glorify God?</p> </li> <li> <p>The two most common phrases for moms today are “we can’t have it all” and “we can have it all.” These anthems cause intense and unnecessary comparison amongst moms. A gospel-centered perspective of motherhood will continue to bring you back to Jesus, our truest portion and prize. When moms have Christ, they have it all, even if they have nothing else.
