  "description": "This episode I describe how our ears and nervous system decode sound waves and gravity to allow us to hear and make sense of sounds. I also describe protocols for rapid learning of sound and other types of information. I discuss sound localization, doppler effects (sound motion), pitch perception and how we isolate sounds in noisy environments. I also review the scientific findings on binaural beats and white noise and how they can improve learning. Other topics and protocols include tinnitus, sea sickness, ear movement, ear growth and the science-supported ways we can all accelerate learning using \"gap effects\".\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Overview of Topics\n(00:02:20) Protocol: New Data for Rapid Learning \n(00:09:10) Introduction: Hearing & Balance \n(00:13:53) How We Perceive Sounds\n(00:21:56) Your Hearing Brain (Areas)  \n(00:23:48) Localizing Sounds\n(00:28:00) Ear Movement: What It Means \n(00:33:00) Your Ears (Likely) Make Sounds: Role of Hormones, Sexual Orientation \n(00:35:30) Binaural Beats: Do They Work? \n(00:43:54) White Noise Can Enhance Learning & Dopamine\n(00:51:00) Headphones\n(00:55:51) White Noise During Development: Possibly Harmful\n(01:03:25) Remembering Information, & The Cocktail Party Effect\n(01:12:55) How to Learn Information You Hear\n(01:18:10) Doppler\n(01:22:43) Tinnitus: What Has Been Found To Help?\n(01:30:40) Aging: How Big Are Your Ears?\n(01:35:00) Balance: Semi-Circular Canals\n(01:40:35) A Vestibular Experiment\n(01:43:15) Improve Your Sense of Balance\n(01:48:55) Accelerating Balance\n(01:51:55) Self-Generated Forward Motion\n(01:56:25) Dizzy versus Light-Headed\n(01:58:38) Motion Sickness Solution\n(02:01:23) Synthesis\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
