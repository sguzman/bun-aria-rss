  "title": "CB2 president Ryan Turf wants to keep pushing the envelope",
  "description": "<p>In the early 2000s, <strong>Ryan Turf</strong> started on the sales floor of the company’s first store. Now he’s president, and has been leading an effort to carve out a unique voice for the brand that stands alongside—but distinct from—parent company Crate & Barrel. Under Turf’s leadership, the CB2 continues to make more and more adventurous design choices—including a range of capsule collections with unexpected partners like Lenny Kravitz, Goop, Fred Segal and most recently, Kara Mann. In this episode, he chats with host Dennis Scully about why CB2 is hoping to do more business with interior designers, what lessons he takes from Ralph Lauren, and why, pandemic or no, brick and mortar retail will always be part of the equation. <i>This episode is sponsored by The Shade Store and Universal Furniture.</i></p>\n",
