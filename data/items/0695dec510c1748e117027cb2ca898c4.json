  "description": "CNN has taken it too far. Don Lemon couldn’t stop laughing as pundits mocked Trump and his supporters as “credulous boomer rubes” who can’t find Ukraine on a map. But Glenn isn’t afraid to talk to all the “rubes” who refuse to blindly believe the elitist media’s lies. Yesterday, Trump’s defense team was electric, but all the media cared about was John Bolton and Mitt Romney. And Bolton’s manuscript leak sure looks like an elitist publishing scheme to Glenn. The coronavirus continues its rapid spread and may have come from eating bats. But while eating bats is not recommended, Stu has a good recipe. And attorney Alan Dershowitz put Adam Schiff’s constitutional pandering to shame with a real lesson in constitutional law. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
