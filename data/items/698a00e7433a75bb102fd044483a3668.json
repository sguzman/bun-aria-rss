    "media:description": "Nuclear Science and Engineering Professor Mike Short teaches the introductory nuclear physics class at MIT, which he admits can be dry. \"When you're talking about things that nobody has ever directly seen before, nuclear shell structures, protons and neutrons...you're teaching students to use inference from what they can observe to what they can actually infer.\" But Short is a wizard professor, casting spells on his students, whom he refers to as \"raw stuff\" and \"absolutely brilliant\" as he leads them through personalized, unique, and often outrageous-sounding assignments that help them not only understand, but also come to love the subject. In his ever-expanding quest for teaching excellence, Short took advantage of the unforeseen twists and turns of the pandemic to unlock secret passages to new horizons in learning.\n\n\nMB01LYDWCC2UHDL",
