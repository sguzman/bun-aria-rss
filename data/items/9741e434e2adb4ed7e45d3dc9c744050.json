  "description": "It seems like with a lot of fairy tales someone looked at the original, thought that there was absolutely no way they could tell that to a child, and re-wrote it to get rid of the shocking violence and general terribleness of every creature ever. \"The Ugly Duckling\" by Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen is no exception. It's shockingly violent and sad at times, but underneath its brutality and ridiculousness is a profound theme that still resonates today. Also birds are jerks. The creature this time is the Loveland Frog. It's a large-ish frog from my hometown in Ohio. Ohio is so boring we can't even have a cool cryptid. Sponsors: Three words: FRONT. POCKET. WALLET. Get one, and say goodbye to an achey back from sitting at an angle all the time. Not only that, but they are hard to pickpocket. Not only THAT, but they are RFID shielded, meaning people can't scan your pocket and get your credit card info. Also, they come in cool leathers, like moose. Really, check it out.

Dollar Shave Club: For just $5, you can get their top-of-the-line razor and a tube of shave butter (which unlike the Seinfeld episode isn't real butter and won't lead to Newman taking a bite out of you). Just go to https://dollarshaveclub.com/myths  Detour: I've always wondered what I'm missing out on when I'm walking through a city. Now, there's a way to know.
