  "description": "<em>Better Call Saul</em>, the prequel and spin-off to <em>Breaking Bad</em>, has only a few episodes left. We talk with the show's star, Bob Odenkirk, and showrunner/co-creator Peter Gould. While filming <em>Better Call Saul</em>, one scene was interrupted for the worst imaginable reason: Odenkirk had a heart attack that was nearly fatal. He'll tell us about returning to life–and to that scene.<br/><br/>Cory Silverberg's new book, <em>You Know, Sex</em>, touches only briefly on reproduction. Instead, it centers on young people and the questions they might have about pleasure, power and identity.",
