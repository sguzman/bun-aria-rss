It’s so much more than just LDL cholesterol. Statins have become the panacea for anyone with LDL that’s just a little off, yet most people (and even many doctors) aren’t fully informed of the risks versus the benefits of this drug, let alone aware of other treatment options for heart disease. Today, I talk to Dr. Aseem Malhotra about the real data on statins, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and so much more.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra is an NHS-trained consultant cardiologist and visiting Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health in Salvador, Brazil. He is a founding member of Action on Sugar. In 2015, he became the youngest member to be appointed to the board of trustees of UK health charity, The King's Fund. He is a pioneer of the lifestyle medicine movement in the UK and in 2018 was ranked by software company Onalytica as the number one doctor in the world influencing obesity thinking. Dr. Malhotra's first book <em>The Pioppi Diet</em>, co-authored with Donal O'Neill, was an international bestseller and his next book, <em>The 21-Day Immunity Plan</em>, was also a <em>Sunday Times </em>top 10 bestseller.
