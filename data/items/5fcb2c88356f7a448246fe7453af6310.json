    "media:description": "Minecraft Death Shuffle... Can we die some of Minecraft's most random deaths? Or will we live trying... \nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.17 challenge that we have decided to try. We try and find ways to die random deaths that are selected after each round. We have five minutes to find out how to die the way that was chosen before we lose. Me and my friend George both get different random deaths, and whoever loses first loses the game.\n\nThis is a little different than my normal content. Rather than being about combat or about trapping, this is about racing and about general Minecraft skills. This was super fun, challenging, and pretty funny overall.\n\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises.",
