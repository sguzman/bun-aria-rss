  "description": "<p>For over two hundred years, a building called simply \"The White House\" has housed the most important leader in the United States of America, the President.The structure that sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue today is not the original. And even after being rebuilt, it has been transformed throughout the decades both outside and inside. Despite the changes, the White House has always been a symbol of the great republic that America is and how seamlessly leadership is transferred from one presidency to the next. Running alongside the regular history of this building is a supernatural one. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the White House. The Moment in Oddity features the Doppelganger of Emilie Sagee and This Day in History features the assassination attempt on Hitler at Burgerbraukeller. Our location was suggested by Bob Sherfield and April Rogers-Krick with research assistance from April Rogers-Krick.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-162-white-house.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-162-white-house.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and help us bring you more: <a href=\"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
