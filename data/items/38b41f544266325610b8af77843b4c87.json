  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subconsciously, it's not hard to start believing that we cannot achieve something due to preconceived ideas of our capabilities. However, I've been seeing more and more people challenging the status quo, embracing who they are, and changing the dialogue. For me, there is real beauty in that. This week's guest, Chellsie Memmel, is an American gymnast and is the third U.S. woman to achieve world all-around gold. She has earned a total of six world medals and helped the U.S. team win the Olympic silver medal by pulling off the performance, despite a broken bone in her ankle. After retiring in her early 20s, she got married, had two beautiful children, and was working. But eight years after her retirement, she decided to train for the U.S. Olympic trials at 32 years of age, in a world where being in your 20s will put you in the category of Geriatrics. Taking that leap at 32 took a strength of character that is powerfully beautiful. </span>",
