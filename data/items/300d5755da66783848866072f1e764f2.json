  "description": "Biden seeks to go around Supreme Court with executive orders to placate his abortion base. Buck says, \"It's like the legal analysis of an ignorant, spoiled child, and he's the president of the United States.\" Leftists still targeting Justice Kavanaugh even after assassination attempt: Protesters force him to exit out back door of DC restaurant. Clay says, \"Evidently, Brett Kavanaugh can't even have a steak? I hope it wasn't a well-done steak.\" Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assassinated during campaign speech for another politician. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan joins Clay and Buck to discuss his relationship with Shinzo Abe and his legacy to Japan, the U.S and the Pacific Rim. Bidens are as dysfunctional as the Kennedys. Naked Hunter Biden filmed himself smoking crack and touching himself while floating inside a sensory deprivation tank.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
