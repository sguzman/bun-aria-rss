  "description": "<p>Our favorite Nigerian-British-Minnesotan author/speaker/thinker Jo Saxton returns to the show to talk about church and discipleship in an increasingly post-church world.  If you’re in a community that doesn’t want church services at all, maybe tweaking your church service isn’t the right answer.  But what is??  Jo describes experiments from Sheffield, England that she and others are now applying to the US.  Plus, how denomination accurately predicts a pastor’s political affiliation, and Phil finds a story about space worms and can’t stop talking about it.  Seriously.  He can’t stop.  This week on the podcast!</p>",
