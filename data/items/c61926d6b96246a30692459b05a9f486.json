  "description": "It used to be that opening your own restaurant was the only path to gaining recognition as a chef. But these days, more and more chefs are opening pop-ups as a first step, or even an alternative, to a brick-and-mortar spot. Pop-ups can offer flexibility, freedom, and exposure without the high overhead and financial risk. But that doesn’t mean pop-up life is a walk in the park. This week on the show, Amanda talks to two LA chefs who run their own pop-ups—Rashida Holmes of Bridgetown Roti and Brandon Gray of Brandoni Pepperoni—about the pros and cons of the business model, their mixed feelings about press attention, and what chefs need to know before popping up. \nStuff we talk about in this episode: \n\n\nThe Promises and Perils of Pop-Ups: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/promises-and-perils-of-popups\n\n\nBridgetown Roti website: https://www.bridgetownroti.com/\n\n\nBrandoni Pepperoni website: https://www.brandoni-pepperoni.com/\n\n\nAbout Chef Craig Wong: https://chefcraigwong.com/about\n\n\nSanta Monica Farmers Market: https://www.smgov.net/Departments/pcd/farmercontent.aspx?id=10039\n\n\nCrafted Kitchen LA website: https://www.craftedkitchenla.com/the-kitchens\n\nRashida Holmes and Bridgetown Roti – @bridgetownroti\n\nBrandon Gray and Brandoni Pepperoni – @la_brandoni_pepperoni\n\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
