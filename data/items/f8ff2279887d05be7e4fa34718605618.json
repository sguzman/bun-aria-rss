  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Currently Reading podcast!</p> <p>In our inaugural episode, we try out our format for the first time. You get to hear us get over our microphone nerves and get comfortable chatting with each other.</p> <p>We share a “bookish moment of the week” from each of us – something readerly in our lives that we want to highlight, a few of the books we’ve finished reading lately, and what’s up next on the TBR pile. We finish up with A Book (yep, capitalized) that we’d like to put into every reader’s hands: something that has ranked on our favorites list or been well-beloved by the people in our lives that we’ve convinced to read it. Perhaps it will become one of your favorites as well.</p> <p>Time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book we mentioned in this episode. If you’d like to listen first and not spoil the surprise, don’t scroll down!</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>2:33 – <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2oL0QUb\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</a> by J.K.
