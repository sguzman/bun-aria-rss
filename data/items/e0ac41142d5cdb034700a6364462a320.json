  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, KARN Radio Host Doc Washburn fills in. Journalist Andy Ngo was violently attacked by ANTIFA in Portland, Oregon and Senator Ted Cruz has asked the FBI to investigate Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for instructing the Police Bureau to stand down despite ANTIFA's aggression. One more example of how the left wants to control the American people.

Then, higher education is going haywire. Cornell University is offering a course on doing away with reason and critical thinking. Princeton University is offering a course suggesting that objective reality and truth are in fact based on white supremacy. After, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez visited a border detention facility and claimed that the Border Patrol physically and sexually threatened her. Former ICE head Tom Homan responded that AOC was intentionally misleading the public and Hector Garza Vice President of the Border Patrol union says that AOC has lost all credibility.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
