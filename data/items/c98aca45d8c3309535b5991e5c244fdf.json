Together, Sharon and Mary touch on important topics like perseverance, education, and extending gentleness to each other and our own selves. Our egos want to keep us safe, but when we continuously operate from a place of safety, taking risks can feel too scary. Ultimately, slow growth equals strong roots means that, when a tipping point day comes in our lives, we have worked hard to grow our character and foundation to meet new challenges with strength and success. Growth and hard work doesn’t happen like a movie montage with a good soundtrack, it takes a lifetime.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
