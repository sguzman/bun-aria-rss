  "description": "<p>TMZ ain't got S**T on your mommies! We welcome actress, tweeter, and hilarious writer Jenny Mollen aka @jennyandteets into the Mommydome for lots of laughs and general tomfoolery. Real Talk gets really real with more of Big Ang and we get the inside scoop on Jenny's favorite show, The Bachelorette, complete with tons of ridiculous audio. Most noteworthy of all we play Dick Detectives with Jenny and who is the suspect? Her husband - Jason Biggs! (HINT: It isn't small). If that's not enough for you then you go away! Enjoy!</p>\n<p>PS. The voice that pops in a few times is Jenny's very hungover friend, Leslie. </p>\n",
