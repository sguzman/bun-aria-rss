  "description": "<p>Ellicott City is a suburb outside of Baltimore with a historic and shopping district that attracts visitors year round. And it makes sense that this would be a town to bring in tourists, as this is home to the first terminus of the B&O Railroad. Founded back in the late 1700s, there is a lot of history here. The city was named one of Trip Advisor's Top 10 Spooky American Getaways because this is quite the haunted town. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Ellicott City! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Chelsea Flowers and features the Shell Cave Grotto and This Month in History features Dr. William Bryden as sole survivor of Kabul Massacre. Our location was suggested by Melanie Antonelli.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
