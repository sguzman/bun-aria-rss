  "description": "I’m always attracted to beautiful embroidery work. When I saw Kathy Shaw’s books and her work I had to learn more! If you were curious about crazy quilts and stitches, you’ll love this chat!\n------------\nHeidi Parkes tagline is ‘Artist - Quilts - Mending ‘ and I am intrigued by that. Quilts and Mending on the same line? Heidi will change your mind on what that means.\n----------------\nLeslie Jenison and I have been friends a long time, it might have started when we both did a ‘use this Nancy Drew Fabric’ challenge! She is an award winner quilter, fabric designer, and extremely amazing quiltmaker. Leslie and I chatted about how to stay healthy so we can quilt a very long time.\n------------------\nLissa Alexander's newest book is all about scraps and it's fantastic! She is also the director of Marketing for Moda Fabrics, which means she is the organizer of getting all the amazing things about Moda out for us to learn. I've worked with Lissa since the first year I went into business. I'm also lucky enough to have gotten a bit of time to have her tell us about the new Color Cuts that Moda is doing!\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
