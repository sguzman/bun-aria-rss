  "description": "The U.S. has done plenty wrong in its history.  There are millions around the world that have been victims of flaws in U.S. foreign policy.  But since the early part of the 20th Century there has at least been a myth that Americans could cling to that we stood for what was right, for \"the American way\" and tried to shape the international system around those values.  Now, in a week, the U.S. has attacked its allies and friends and embraced one of the world's most brutal dictators.  Our president seems to be an amoral and corrupt man.  And the result may translate into the undoing both of our standing and the international order that has helped uphold it.  Our panelists Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Mieke Eoyang of the Third Way and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss how the tectonic events of the G7 and Singapore summits may impact how America is perceived...and how the world works...for many years to come.
