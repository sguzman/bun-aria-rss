  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>If you’ve been listening to the podcast a while, you know that when we find shows we love, we try to bring them to the podcast so we can chat about the characters, captivating plot lines, and of course any mental health implications that stand out. In this week's session we’re chatting about <em>Peacock</em>’s new series<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/bel-air\"><em>Bel-Air</em></a>. For this conversation I’m joined by our Associate Producer, Ellice Ellis and Senior Producer, Fredia Lucas.</p><p>During our conversation, we explored what we’re loving about the new series, what we notice makes Bel-Air a fresh take on a nostalgic classic, some of the mental health concerns impacting the characters, and of course our predictions for the season. If you haven’t had the time to watch Bel-Air you may want to put this episode on pause and save it until you are caught up because there are definitely spoilers in this episode. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
