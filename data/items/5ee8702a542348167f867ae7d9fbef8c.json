  "description": "<p>It's time to hit a home run with our next interview as we get our first taste of Softball and speak with Canadian Bronze Medallist from Tokyo Joey Lye about her amazing career and recent Olympic experiences! We learn from Joey just why a decision from her parents as a child helped steer her on a path towards an Olympic medal and what other sport she potentially could've gone to the Olympics in. We also find out a little more about the build up to Tokyo and why the Gold Medal win by Canada at the 2015 Pan Am Games was so important. Added to this we find out more about the rivalry between Australia and Canada in Softball and just what she has done with her medal now that she is home. It's a chat that will have you never striking out again, so get to listening!</p>",
