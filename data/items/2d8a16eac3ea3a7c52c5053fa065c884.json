  "description": "The two books in this episode are thrillers that center class as the theme of the narrative. First up is <em>A Slow Fire Burning</em> by Paula Hawkins that the author says, in an interview with Mary Louise Kelly, is a crime-murder-mystery in a setting where \"the powerful and the powerless\" are right next to each other. Next is <em>You're Invited,</em> authored by Amanda Jayatissa, about a wedding invite gone wrong – but, as Jayatissa shared with Ayesha Roscoe, is actually a backdrop to highlight Sri Lanka's present inequalities.
