  "description": "<div>It all started with innocent creeks and cracks on the floorboards of her old childhood home late at night. Shari DeBeneditti knew that something was happening in and around her, but she didn’t fully understand what or even know what “paranormal” meant. Eventually, these experiences would escalate to such an extreme that it was undeniable that she was experiencing a haunting. A haunting that would eventually lead her on a lifelong journey to find answers and to help others who have found themselves paranormally affected.
