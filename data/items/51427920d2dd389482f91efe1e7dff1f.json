  "description": "It might've just been a week for you, but it's been a minute since Tasia and Camo have sat down and recorded. On this week's episode, Tasia and Camo catch you (and each other) up on everything that's been going on in their lives. From how they spent their holidays, the movies they've seen (shoutout to Lady Gaga in \"House of Gucci\") and so much more. Tasia details how she will be getting her license soon, but all of the required upgrades for her car might make it not worth getting back on the road. Camo explains how he's been working on his self-control when it comes to weed and food, as well as hitting the gym to prep that 2022 bod. Plus, they both set some goals for next year and how they'll be back and better when New Year's comes around.\nWatch \"Unfazed and Unbothered\" on YouTube\nGo to ShipStation.com, click on the microphone at the top, and enter code UNFAZED to get a 60-day free trial!\nFollow Tasia on TikTok\nFollow Camo on TikTok\nFollow Tasia on IG\nFollow Camo on IG\nFollow Camo on YouTube\nListen to Camo's music on Spotify \nLearn more about your ad choices.
