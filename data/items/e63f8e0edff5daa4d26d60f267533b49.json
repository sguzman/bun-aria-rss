  "description": "<p>YHWH Shalom,</p>\n<p>We praise You for being our Peace in the midst of chaos. Like Gideon, our lives feel overwhelming sometimes, but You enter in and draw near and bring us what we wouldn’t have access to without You. We praise You for Your perfect timing and miraculous provision. Thank You for the leaders who lead us in your paths of righteousness. Thank You for the prophets who call out our sin and speak truth to us. </p>\n<p>We repent of ignoring them both. We repent of leaning into the lie that You’ve forgotten or forsaken us when You’ve gone to great lengths to pursue us—sending Your Son to pay for our sins, and sending Your Spirit to indwell us even while we’re still sinners!  We repent of doubting You and we thank You for being a God who isn’t afraid of our emotions or anger or doubt. You still draw near to us in all the fullness of our humanity.</p>\n<p>Give us the wisdom and courage to tear down the lies we’re following after—even when it costs us something personally. Align us with the truth. When our hearts have misled us, remind us that there’s no such thing as OUR truth, God—there’s only YOUR truth, and it is THE truth.</p>\n<p>We surrender our lives to You, Lord—every moment of our day, each decision we make, we yield our will and way to Your perfect will and way. </p>\n<p>We love You too. Amen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SHOW NOTES: </p>\n<p>Host & Writer: Tara-Leigh Cobble</p>\n<p>Sound Engineer: Allison Congden</p>\n<p>Patreon / Show Notes / Transcripts: Olivia Ramsey & Laura Buchelt</p>\n<p>Logo: Landon Wade</p>\n<p>Patreon:<a href='http://www.patreon.com/thebiblerecap'> patreon.com/thebiblerecap</a></p>\n<p>Website:<a href='http://thebiblerecap.com/'> thebiblerecap.com</a></p>\n<p>The Bible Kneecap is brought to you by<a href='https://www.mydgroup.org/'> D-Group</a>, an international network of discipleship and accountability groups that meet weekly in homes and churches:<a href='https://www.mydgroup.org/map'> Find or start one near you today</a>!</p>\n",
