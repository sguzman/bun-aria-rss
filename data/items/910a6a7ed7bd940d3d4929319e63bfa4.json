  "description": "<p>Misan Rewane is a remarkable young leader from Nigeria who took the lessons learned from her leadership coach to heart. She created <a href=\"https://www.waveacademies.org/\">WAVE Academies</a> to tackle the problem of youth unemployment by getting young people ‘work ready’ and helping employers to find the local talent they need to grow their businesses. </p><p>Having met Trilogy Effect’s <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/wendy-appel\">Wendy Appel</a> through The Coaching Fellowship, Misan applied the leadership information and knowledge she gained from this coaching experience to create an organization with powerful social impact. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://tcfs.org/\">Coaching Fellowship</a> is a non-profit organization matching volunteer coaches with young women leaders interested in making a real difference in the lives of others.  Misan and Wendy took their relationship way beyond one-on-one coaching to share the learning across the whole WAVE Academies team and to the young people they support. </p><p>The WAVE Academies curriculum includes leadership skills needed to be ‘work ready,’ such as communications, problem solving, negotiations, and teamwork.</p><p>“Where I’m from, we don't get a lot of space to reflect inward.  We're struggling to meet the basic needs of food, shelter, clothing and security, so we don’t get a lot of space to reflect on who we are and how we show up in the world,” Misan explains. “At Wave Academies, we’re teaching emotional intelligence to unemployed young people who often don't have emotional vocabulary beyond ‘I’m happy or I’m sad.’”</p><p>Wendy has travelled to WAVE headquarters in Nigeria several times to work with Misan’s team. She says, “This is far and away some of the most rewarding work I've ever done. I don't know that I've ever worked with an organization where the tools and frameworks I share would have such immediate impact. I would teach them the tools and then they'd apply and make them their own, all before I left the meeting. Their thirst for knowledge was extraordinary.”  </p><p>The impact is real. More than 50,000 young Nigerians have been trained through Wave Academies and the employment rate among alumni is 70%. </p><p>In this episode, you’ll learn about Misan’s incredible leadership journey and how working with a coach not only dramatically improved her effectiveness as a leader, it helped her discover a direct path to creating effective and long-lasting change for the young people in her community.   </p><h2>Listen to the full LIVE episode to learn: </h2><ul><li>What is emotional intelligence and why having it is important? </li><li>About tools and frameworks to develop leadership capability and capacity.</li><li>Why is being human good for business? </li></ul><p>Links to information about the issues discussed in the is show: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-how-to-be-a-better-leader-by-being-a-better-listener\"><strong>How to be a better leader by being a better listener</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/free-leadership-guidebook\"><strong>Trilogy Effect Leadership Guidebook</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-getting-the-job-of-your-dreams\"><strong>Getting the Job of Your Dream!  A Young Leader’s Journey</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/trilogyeffect\">Facebook </a>| <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/trilogy-effect/?viewAsMember=true\">LinkedIn </a>| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_TrilogyEffect\">Twitter </a>| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trilogyeffectleaders/\">Instagram</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
