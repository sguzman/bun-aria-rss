  "description": "<div>Throughout Chinese history, as seen by poems and novels, drinking has been seen as a source for literary inspiration; or a form of manly competition; or, as ever, a status symbol. After a century of political turmoil in which the way people lived was radically disrupted, drinking culture is now coming back with China's growing wealth. As well as the traditional rice and sorghum spirits, grape wine is starting to dominate the Chinese palate.<br>\n<br>\nOn this episode, Cindy Yu's guest Janet Z Wang, author of <em>The Chinese Wine Renaissance</em>, tells her all about the then and the now of Chinese drinking. They chat poetry and wine, noughties extravagance (including a Bordeaux sold for $234,000) and the peculiarities of Chinese drinking culture.</div>\n",
