  "description": "Introducing an economics education for your ears! We're calling it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school\">Planet Money Summer School</a>. It's all the economics you meant to learn, but didn't get around to. Each Wednesday, we'll serve up a Planet Money story, or selection of excerpts, paired with insights from our economists-in-residence for the summer. Get an understanding of the basic concepts of economics going to the beach. You can pick up your economics knowledge while you bike, stroll the sand or just lay in the grass. Amuse your friends.  Win arguments. Throw the words \"diminishing marginal utility\" into every discussion. Wednesdays in the PM feed this summer. (Fridays will be our usual coverage of the economy). <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school\">Start listening to the episodes here. </a>",
