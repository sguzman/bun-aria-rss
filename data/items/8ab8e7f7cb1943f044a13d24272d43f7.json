Against all odds, she worked for 8 years to get her GED, and eventually earned a spot in college in the United States, taking her family with her, where some 20 years after beginning her dream of an education, she received her Ph.D..</p><p>It was her secret additional dream to not only change her life, but to do something for the greater good that turned this into an even bigger story. Trent's story ended up in the pages of the <em>New York Times</em>, where Oprah Winfrey discovered her remarkable story and deeply-passionate quest to help educate women.
