  "description": "If opposite-gender partnerships remain the societal ideal, then why are so many straight couples miserable? Author Jane Ward has been studying this question for some time and outlines her ideas about the tragic effects of heteronormativity in her new book, The Tragedy of Heterosexuality (New York University Press, 2020). In our interview, we discuss her compelling case for why queer people, and lesbian feminism in particular, have much relational wisdom to offer their heterosexual counterparts, and why only a deepening—rather than queering—of their sexuality can save them.\nJane Ward is Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at University of California, Riverside. Her prior books include Not Gay: Sex between Straight White Men and Respectably Queer: Diversity Culture in LGBT Activist Organizations.\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami. He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in gender and sexuality, eating and body image problems, and relationship issues. He is a graduate and faculty of William Alanson White Institute in Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology in New York City and former chair of their LGBTQ Study Group; and faculty at Florida Psychoanalytic Institute in Miami. He is also a contributing author to the book Introduction to Contemporary Psychoanalysis: Defining Terms and Building Bridges (2018, Routledge).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
