  "title": "Ukraine offensive, weak pound & how much do women really exercise",
  "description": "Ukraine has reportedly recaptured nearly 10,000 square kilometres of territory that had been occupied by Russia. We ask where the numbers come from, what they mean and why everyone is comparing them to the size of Greater London. We ask how much money Norway is making out of the current energy crisis. Also why is the pound so weak against the dollar, some odd claims about women and exercise and does it really take 20,000 uses for an organic cotton bag to become more environmentally friendly than a plastic bag?\n\nPresenter: Tim Harford\nSeries producer: Jon Bithrey\nReporters: Charlotte McDonald, Nathan Gower\nProduction Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson \nEditor: Richard Vadon",
