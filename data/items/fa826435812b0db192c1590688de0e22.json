  "description": "<p>Many people have heard of the Vanderbilt family. They are a family of Dutch origin that amassed a huge fortune in transportation through both shipping and the railroad. Their prominence lasted through to the mid 20th century and then the \"Fall of the House of Vanderbilt\" occurred. Many of their mansions and other properties were torn down, but one survives today and is considered the largest home in America, the Biltmore Estate. It is a beautiful home that housed George Vanderbilt II's family at one time. And it just may still house the family in the afterlife. Could it be that this impressive mansion is haunted? Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Biltmore Estate. Moment in Oddity features the Little Woodcutter and This Day in History features Napoleon becoming Dictator.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Check out show notes here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-81-biltmore-estate.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/11/hgb-podcast-ep-81-biltmore-estate.html</a></p> <p>Want more content?
