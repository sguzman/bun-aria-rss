  "description": "<p>Should we banish pedophiles to an actual island? That's essentially what Washington state has been doing since 1990 with the Special Commitment Center for sexually violent offenders deemed to be at a high risk to re-offend. McNeil Island is about two miles off the coast of Tacoma and has about 240 dangerous sexual predators living on it. If we're not gonna put these people on an island, what should we do with them? We thoroughly address the dicey topic of sex offenders - who they are, how many there are, how much damage they cause, why they have the sexual preferences they do, and more, today on Timesuck.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE TAKE THIS SURVEY!</strong> (maybe win that $100 gift certificate) <a href=\"http://podsurvey.com/TIMESUCK\"><strong>http://podsurvey.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a></p>\n<p>We're donating $1600 this month to the <strong>Cancer Research Institute</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearch.org/\"><strong>www.cancerresearch.org</strong></a> to donate!</p>\n<p>Upcoming Tour dates:</p>\n<p><strong>February 22-23 Salt Lake City, Utah </strong>- Wiseguys's Comedy Club <a href=\"https://www.wiseguyscomedy.com/events/dan-cummins\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>February 23 Salt Lake City, Utah</strong> - Wiseguy's <strong>LIVE ANTHILL KIDS TIMESUCK</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wiseguyscomedy.com/events/timesuck\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>February 26 Birmingham, Alabama </strong>- Stardome Comedy Club <a href=\"https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/4285274/dan-cumminsthe-happy-murder-tour-20-general-admission-hoover-stardome-showroom?language=en&country=US&searchType=organization&\"><strong>CLICK HERE </strong></a>for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>February 27 Atlanta, Georgia</strong> - The Punchline Comedy Club <a href=\"https://www.punchline.com/shows.asp?showdate=2/27/2019&month=2&year=2019\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>Feb 28 - March 2 Nashville, Tennessee</strong> - Zanies Comedy Club <a href=\"http://zaniesnashvilletickets.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=516607\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>March 3 Huntsville, Alabama </strong>- Stand Up Live <a href=\"http://standuplivehuntsville.laughstub.com/event.cfm?cart&id=517152\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the best of my standup on Spotify!</strong> (for free!) <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d\"><strong>https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the following <strong>sponsors</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Leesa! </strong>Get 15% off any mattress for a limited time at <a href=\"https://www.leesa.com/products/leesa-mattress?utm_source=timesuck&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=2017&utm_content=all&utm_term=general&referrer=timesuck\"><strong>leesa.com/TIMESUCK</strong></a> and use promo code TIMESUCK</p>\n<p><strong>For Hims!</strong> Try Hims for a month today & get started for just $5 <a href=\"https://ForHims.com/timesuckED\"><strong>https://ForHims.com/timesuckED</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on Youtube: </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zndjGnsd0Jc\">https://youtu.be/zndjGnsd0Jc</a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
