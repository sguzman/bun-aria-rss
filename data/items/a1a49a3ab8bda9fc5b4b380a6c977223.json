    "media:description": "Terminate zombies with 4 inch cut arrows!\n\nI was going to make a fun Halloween video\nand Zombie Apocalypse is really funny, I thought.\nMany are writing funny comments about the Zombie Apocalypse team on my video.\n\nAnd although I actually liked Zombi movies and books\nthen the whole concept of totally stupid and slow zombies\nis actually very little dangerous.\n\nI got my blacksmith to make some oversized 4\" cutting arrows, razor sharp!!\n\nSincerely\nLars Andersen",
