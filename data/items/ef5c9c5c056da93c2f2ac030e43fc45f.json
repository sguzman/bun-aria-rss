  "description": "<p>Although the development of spintronic devices has advanced significantly\nover the past decade with the use of ferromagnetic materials, the extensive\nimplementation of such devices has been limited by the notable drawbacks of\nthese materials. Antiferromagnets claim to resolve many of these shortcomings\nleading to faster, smaller, more energy-efficient, and more robust electronics.\nAntiferromagnets exhibit many desirable properties including zero net\nmagnetization, imperviousness to external magnetic fields, intrinsic\nhigh-frequency dynamics with a characteristic precession frequency on the order\nof terahertz (THz), and the ability to serve as passive exchange-bias materials\nin multiple magnetoresistance (MR)- based devices. In this Perspective article,\nwe will discuss the fundamental physics of magnetic structures in\nantiferromagnets and their interactions with external stimuli such as spin\ncurrent, voltage, and magnons. A discussion on the challenges lying ahead is\nalso provided along with an outlook of future research directions of these\nsystems.\n</p>",
