However, some may affect our bodily systems indirectly. While I am not a doctor or nutritionist, these are some of the foods I notice in practice can have an affect on increased acne, that also have some scientific evidence to support.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>If you are struggling with your relationship with nutrition currently, this may not be the episode for you as this episode covers food. There are no \"bad\" foods, and these foods are discussed in terms of their relationship to skin, NOT calories or weight gain. All of our bodies are bioindivideal, and foods that may be a trigger for one person, may not be a trigger for everyone.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Have a topic request or question for a future episode?
