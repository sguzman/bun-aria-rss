  "title": "Ep. 815 - No, I Will Not Celebrate \"Indigenous People's Day\"",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Columbus Day has been increasingly replaced by Indigenous People's Day. We're told that we should celebrate Indigenous People rather than Columbus, because Columbus was a violent man who conquered lands that didn't belong to him. And that's mostly true, but I still say we should celebrate him and I'll explain why today. Also, Southwest canceled thousands of flights right as its employees went on strike over its vaccine mandates. But the media insists that the two issues are not connected at all. Plus, the family of the Texas school shooter continues to defend him, even though he brought a gun to school and shot people. And in our Daily Cancellation, we'll talk about one of the most nauseating ESPN segments ever aired on the network. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
