In the future, we will also roll out Digital Collectibles on Facebook and allow people to display and share their digital collectibles as AR stickers in Instagram Stories, bringing the benefits of this technology to even more creators and collectors. <br /><br /><br />Details on how digital collectibles will work:<br /><br />Creators and collectors in this test group will be able to post NFTs that they created or own on Instagram by linking third-party digital wallets in-app. <br /><br />NFTs displayed on the app will receive a special ‘shimmer’ visual treatment and both the creator and owner of the NFT will be attributed for the content.<br /><br />Starting at launch, the blockchains that are supported include Ethereum and Polygon, with Flow and Solana coming soon.<br /><br />The third-party wallets compatible for use at launch will include Rainbow, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet, with Coinbase and Dapper coming soon.<br /><br />There will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram. <br /><br />Soon, we will roll out digital collectibles on Facebook, and will also soon allow people to display and share their digital collectibles as AR stickers in Instagram Stories, bringing the benefits of this technology to even more creators and collectors.<br /><br /><br />Mark on NFTs as a form of expression:<br /><br />\"I think our whole thrust as a company is around helping people connect and communicate. Part of communication is your exchanging information, but a lot of it is signaling and expression and kind of saying something about yourself and trying to find like-minded people and form communities and express your values… And I think that there's no reason to think that will be any different in digital spaces. That's a lot of what early social networks started off as, and I think that they've become more sophisticated in terms of helping people express and share and kind of project the expression that they want. But when I think about NFTs in the metaverse, I think if you're spending a lot of time [in the metaverse] – whether it's working in VR if a fair amount of your meetings are happening in virtual reality in the metaverse. Or, as a hologram sitting there with someone, then you're going to care about what you look [like] there. And, you're probably not going to want to wear the same thing every day, right? So you're probably going to have a collection of clothing and digital objects, just like you have clothing in the physical world. And you're going to want that clothing to be meaningful and express something about you. So you're not just gonna want it to be generic, like a lot of these early systems. What color shirt do you want? Which designer made it? Which creator made it? That's going to be meaningful. And I think that that needs a whole format for commerce. And I think NFTs are going to be a really important part of that.\"<br /><br />Follow Mark Zuckerberg:<br /><br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/zuck</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zuck/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/zuck/</a>",
