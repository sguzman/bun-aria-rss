  "description": "Olympic bronze medalists Maia and Alex Shibutani, a.k.a. the “Shib Sibs,” stick to a pretty regimented diet while training—but it turns out they’re actually as food-obsessed as we are. This week we talk to the ice dancing duo about beignets, egg McMuffins, and their dad’s famous eggplant Parm. After that, with wedding season around the corner, we go deep on the dos and don’ts of registries. (Unsurprisingly, we've got lots of opinions on platters, wine glasses, sheets, and more.)\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
