  "description": "<p>This week we're taking a look back on Branch Closing. This is the episode that spawned the famous Michael Scott \"This Is The Worst\" meme, and the ladies dig into those Angela and Roy flirtations, along with getting into the intricacies of low-pony tails. There’s a great fan catch at David Wallace's house, and we find out Jim is coming back to Scranton. Finally, we couldn't say goodbye to Josh Porter without bringing on the amazing Charles Esten (Outer Banks on Netflix). Charles gives us his The Office origin story, talks about his family's love of the show, and gives us inside info about his last scenes with Andy (Ed Helms). So enjoy your summer break and a look back on this great episode.</p>\n",
