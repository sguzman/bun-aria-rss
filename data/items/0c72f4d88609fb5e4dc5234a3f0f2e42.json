(Starts at 1:07) Mohammad Ali Kadivar of Boston College discusses the current waves of protests in Iran. (Starts at 32:23) Sarah El-Kazaz of the University of London and Lana Salman of Harvard University discuss their chapter in The Political Science of the Middle East: Theory and Research Since the Arab Uprisings, which focuses on a relational approach to local politics and the lack of subnational literature that engages with the MENA region.
