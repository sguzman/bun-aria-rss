  "description": "<p>This episode is excerpted from a live-over-Zoom Don't Ask Tig show with comedian, actor, producer, and Tig’s longtime pal Nick Kroll. You know Nick from the Emmy-Nominated animated series “Big Mouth,” and as the voice of Uncle Fester in “The Addams Family 2.” Nick and Tig take a stroll down memory lane to reminisce about their careers before they hit it big. They also give advice to a mother whose 9-year-old keeps cursing in public and to a woman who is continually upstaged by a friend's dog on her birthday. Speaking of pups, Tig and Nick also solve the mystery of a runaway Chihuahua destined to be a Broadway star. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month), Postmates (new customers can use code “DONTASK” to receive 50% off their first 5 orders of $50 or more.
