  "description": "<p>This paper concerns the potential of corrective actions, such as generation\nand load dispatch on minimizing the effects of transmission line failures in\nelectric power systems. Three loss functions (grid-centric, consumer-centric,\nand influence localization) are used to statistically evaluate the criticality\nof initial contingent failures. A learning scheme for both AC and DC grid\nmodels combine a Monte Carlo approach with a convex dynamic programming\nformulation and introduces an adaptive selection process, illustrated on the\nIEEE-30 bus system.\n</p>",
