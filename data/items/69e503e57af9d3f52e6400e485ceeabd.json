  "title": "PMS 2.0 539 - Aaron Rodgers Tuesday Week 10, Monday Night Football Recap, Colleen Wolfe, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Rams and 49ers, how dominant the 49ers looked, if there's reason to start panicking a bit about the Rams, and everything else happening across the league as we wrap up week 10 of the NFL season. Joining the program as he does every Tuesday, coming fresh off the Covid list and a big win against the Seattle Seahawks, is the Quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about the Seahawks game, how he's feeling post Covid and if he felt it at all during the game, how incredible the defense played and has been playing, if he felt off at all, his thoughts on Jamal Adams doing the belt celebration after a fumble, what the latest installment of the Aaron Rodgers bookclub is, and much more (31:34-1:12:23). Later, host of the pregame and postgame show for Thursday Night Football, NFL Network Reporter, and friend of the show, Colleen Wolfe joins the program to chat about what Thursday Night Football is like with that panel, and the interactions and access they get with the players, what she's hearing from Philadelphia about Nick Sirianni, why the NFL has had so much parody this year with under dogs covering a large amount of spreads, what it's like working with Steve Smith, and much more (1:12:25-1:25:51).
