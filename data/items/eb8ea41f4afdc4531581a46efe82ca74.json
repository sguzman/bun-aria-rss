  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-433-ed-mylett\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ed Mylett</strong></a> knows the housing market. He’s <strong>participated in real estate investing for decades</strong> and has become wildly successful thanks to his tenacity, relationship-building skills, and creativity when getting deals done. But, funnily enough, Ed Mylett isn’t most well known for his real estate investor prowess—he’s known for his <strong>mindset-shifting, world-changing ideas</strong> when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/top-personal-development-books\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>personal development</strong></a>, <strong>discipline</strong>, and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.</p><p>In Ed’s newest book, <strong><em>The Power of One More</em></strong>, he talks about the small tweak that anyone can make to<strong> become many multiples more successful</strong>. In essence, every extra push-up, cold call, and hug to your spouse or child is the exact thing that puts you above the rest. It’s not about putting in the effort, it’s about<strong> putting in more effort than the average person would</strong>. This not only applies heavily to real estate investing but to any goal we set.</p><p>David and Rob get the opportunity to talk to Ed about his book as well as his sentiment towards <strong>today’s </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/is-the-housing-market-about-to-collapse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>housing market</strong></a> and what deals he’s doing in the background. You may be surprised to hear it, but <strong>Ed is incredibly bullish on real estate investing</strong> for a few good reasons. He gives a simple yet incredibly practical explanation for why<strong> this year is surprisingly the best time to get into real estate investing</strong> in a long time.</p><p><strong>In This Episode We Cover:</strong></p><p>How the power of “one more” can <strong>change everything about your life&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Why committing to your standards is arguably <strong>more important than </strong><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/set-achievable-real-estate-goals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>goal

“<strong>evaluating their income streams</strong>” instead of just their properties</p><p><strong>The “most crazy deal” Ed has ever done</strong> and why it’ll be a first of its kind</p><p>Building
