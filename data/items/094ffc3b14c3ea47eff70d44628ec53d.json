  "description": "The Second Amendment is very clear about our RIGHT to defend ourselves against a tyrannical government, so if both sides believe one is coming, why would we give up our guns? There’s a real problem in this country, but while so many argue that it’s assault weapons, murderers, or opioids, the reality is that we’re empty inside. Bridget Phetasy joins to discuss this epidemic of depression, as well as who’s joining together to FIGHT the silencing of opinions. And politicians like Elizabeth Warren aren’t helping, but instead confusing our rights and privileges. In more crazy news, Ilhan Omar is making very strong claims against Israel, and CNN is reporting that Alaskan salmon are dying, but not at the hands of hungry fishermen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
