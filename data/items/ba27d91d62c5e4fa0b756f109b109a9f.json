  "description": "<p>THIS EPISODE IS RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES, YOU GUYS!</p>\n\n\n<p>In 2013, James (Whitey) Bulger, the South Boston mobster, was captured after 16 years on the lam. He was finally brought to justice for a murderous reign of terror that inspired books, films and a saga of Irish-American brotherhood and brutality. Last month (October of 2018) he was found beaten to death in a West Virginia prison. He was 89.</p>\n\n\n<p>This documentary tells the story of Whiteyâ€™s rise to power in South Boston, his dealings with the FBI during that time, it tackles questions of his relationship with the FBI. The film ultimately deals with his capture, trial, and--for lack of a better term--legacy. Whatever, any way you slice it, he was garbage.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered <strong>\"Serial\"</strong> episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an interview with <strong>Rabia Chaudry</strong>--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig AND with <strong>Asia Mcclain</strong>--Adnan's alibi witness!
