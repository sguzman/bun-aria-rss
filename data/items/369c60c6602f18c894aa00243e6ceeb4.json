  "description": "<p>Colt Cabana had me over to his flat in Edinburgh, Scotland for a talk about indy wrestling. Colt is a looper. He's made a living as a wrestler for almost two decades. We talked about the travel, the money, the trials and tribulations. Everything about what it's like to be an independant wrestler. He's a super positive guy and he taught me a thing or two about appreciating what you've got.</p>",
