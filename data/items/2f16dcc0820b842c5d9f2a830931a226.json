  "description": "<p>Due to a miscommunication, Jared Carrabis never made it off the launch pad for today's show. Benjamin Allbright, the Colorado sports talker who tried to get Steve fired, is back on the radar. Kirk and Steve cover the passing of radio giant Rush Limbaugh, his legacy, and the reaction of so many mainstream left-wingers. Kirk confronts those commentators who lionize Howard Stern's transformation from a nasty shock jock into a more acceptable, mainstream voice (0:19:00). Ted Cruz gets pilloried for escaping the Texas snow for Mexico, while Gov. Andrew Cuomo gets a pass for decisions that led directly to the death of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes (0:46:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
