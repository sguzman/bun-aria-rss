  "description": "It's \"brutal\" tax day. Buck asks, \"Why exactly is the tax code thousands and thousands of pages?\" Clay reminds us of the staggering numbers of Americans who do not pay taxes. Bad news for Biden: black adults name crime, economic issues and housing as top three issues in their communities. The bill for two years of lockdowns is coming due, imagine if Build Back Better had passed! New York Mayor Eric Adams blames Republicans for Defund the Police because they haven't passed Biden's Build Back Better. Clay is wearing his OutKick \"Fund the Police\" T-shirt since Defund the Police is \"fundamentally the dumbest slogan in the history of modern American politics.\" Media ignores the Brooklyn subway shooter story. Elizabeth Warren has a plan for how Democrats can avoid disaster in November. As for 2024, Clay says: \"If Trump is on the ballot, does Trump become the story as opposed to Biden failures? Because, if it's Biden failures, Republicans win.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
