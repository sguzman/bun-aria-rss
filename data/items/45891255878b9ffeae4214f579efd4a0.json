  "description": "<p>In 2005 singer Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy a.k.a. Will Oldham and guitarist Matt Sweeney released the <a href=\"https://mattsweeneybonnieprincebilly.bandcamp.com/album/superwolves\"><em>Superwolf</em></a> album, which has developed a cult following that includes Rick Rubin who absolutely fell in love with the project. Now, 16 years later, they’re back with the follow-up, <em>Superwolves</em>.</p><p>The new album was five years in the making—a leisurely pace that allowed Oldham and Sweeney to be incredibly intentional with their creative choices. On today’s episode, Rick Rubin talks to Oldham and Sweeney about their work together, which Rick considers some of his favorite contemporary music and the reason he’s since used Sweeney on so many of the sessions he’s produced including the Dixie Chicks, Cat Stevens, and Adele. Will Oldham talks about his philosophy on connecting with his audience, and how if this pandemic were to take us all, <em>Superwolves </em>would be a great album to go out on.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out a playlist of our favorite Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy and Matt Sweeney songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1y3N0joDz9UrOsIkrnacEx?si=8e207516632b4067\">HERE.</a> Also, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5j3cHwfY7qwEjProJyaBKi?si=e5677b9eac2f4fbe\"><em>here</em></a> is a playlist of some of Oldham's favorite songs and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/79bGks8W6h7iKLk2KM3hf9?si=d6cda0beb7d74a60\"><em>here</em></a><em> </em>is a playlist of some of Sweeney's.
