  "description": "<p>Today we welcome Dr. Gabor Maté. A physician, renowned speaker, and bestselling author, Gabor is highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development. For his groundbreaking medical work and writing, he has been awarded the Order of Canada, his country’s highest civilian distinction. He is also a co-developer of Compassionate Inquiry, a therapeutic approach for deep healing and transformation. His newest book is called <i>The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness & Healing in a Toxic Culture.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Gabor Maté about The Myth of Normal. Healthcare in Western societies tend to focus on physical health, without accounting for an individual’s lived experience. The tension between authenticity and attachment and the pressures of a capitalist culture puts undue stress on our minds and bodies. Dr. Maté invites us to rethink trauma and disease, by emphasizing holistic well-being and the role of agency. We also touch on the topics of early childhood, epigenetics, and self-improvement. </p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://drgabormate.com/\">drgabormate.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drgabormate\">@drgabormate</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>02:36 The Myth of Normal</p><p>06:14 Maslow’s Metagrumbles</p><p>10:25 From individual to global well-being</p><p>13:25 Authenticity vs attachment</p><p>20:48 No separation of psyche and soma</p><p>28:05 Trauma is what happens inside you</p><p>33:34 Dr. Gabor Maté’s early childhood </p><p>37:20 Trauma denial and victimhood mentality</p><p>41:05 Disease is a long term process</p><p>45:21 Epigenetics and the role of environment</p><p>50:24 Screening for special and gifted education</p><p>52:45 Pathways to wholeness</p><p>58:01 The four A’s of healing </p><p>1:06:44 Compassionate Inquiry</p><p>1:10:16 Authentic satisfaction</p>\n",
