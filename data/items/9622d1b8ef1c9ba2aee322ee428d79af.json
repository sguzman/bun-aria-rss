    "media:description": "This video presents a new method for expository mathematical material: the Developmental Method.  It focuses on discovering mathematics ourselves rather than blindly following a textbook.  To describe this method, most of the video is me developing calculus using the method.  It is important that you will have already learned at least the basics of calculus before watching this video, because the point is to compare this method of presenting calculus with the traditional method.  While I produced the video mainly for people who create expository mathematical material, I'm sure many people might enjoy some of the insights into calculus that are present.\n\nSections:\n00:00 Area of a Parabola\n06:26 Integration\n08:21 Differentiation\n14:44 Initial Summary\n16:34 Derivatives\n22:16 Limits\n36:14 Conclusion",
