Everyday, you move through and see the experiences of life with a filter. This filter? It’s your own perspective. Now is the time for you to recognize and become self-aware of this perspective, rid yourself of it, and actually begin to change your life for good. On this episode of Impact Theory, Tom Bilyeu is joined by New York Times Bestselling Author, speaker, and urban philosopher Gary Bishop to discuss such matters and more as they explore how to finally wake up to the reality you’ve fabricated for yourself, break the chains of your perspective which can hold you back, and start to walk on a path towards the person, life, and reality you want to live. They discuss how we each create our own reality from our experiences, how to become self-aware so that you can recognize patterns in your life, why we create false narratives for ourselves, how to become reborn and renewed into a new person, why you shouldn’t require others to change for you, and how to deal with the challenging fundamentals of life such as success, grief, and love.   SHOW NOTES: Reality | Gary reveals how we create our own reality and experiences.
