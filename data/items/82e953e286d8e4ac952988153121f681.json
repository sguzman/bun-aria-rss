  "description": "<p>Ryan Oneill and Jeff Danis come on to talk about some criminal mastermind shooting 3-5 gunshots at Oneill from about 4 feet away. Unfortunately the guy missed. But something good will come from it. And the good is that D&O, The Danish and O'Neill, The Beach Cops boys are able to come on Skeptic Tank to talk over the harrowing experience. Harrowing for Ryan. Jeff was changing his kid's diaper or something, which I guess is also harrowing. Probably more harrowing when you think about it. </p> <p>Check out Beach Cops on Patreon.
