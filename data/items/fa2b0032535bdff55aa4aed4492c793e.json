The three friends celebrate these tiny morsels of portable theology and how the book of Proverbs teaches us to walk in God’s wisdom.  </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 1 of the She Reads Truth Proverbs reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Proverbs Reading Plan collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='http://shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-1-with-russ-ramsey/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/proverbs-week-1-with-russ-ramsey/</b></a></p>",
