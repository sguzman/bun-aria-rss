  "description": "<p>Think about how different our medical system would be if all doctors were required to have an extreme health crisis before practicing medicine. It’s through those toughest times with our own health that many of us turn to Functional Medicine, as we realize conventional care isn’t getting us what we need. But sometimes, being so involved in treating others’ diseases makes it difficult for doctors to even see our own symptoms for what they really are. This week’s guest on The Doctor’s Farmacy, Dr. Cynthia Li, is here to share her personal journey through autoimmunity and realizing her symptoms had deeper meaning.</p><br><p>Dr. Li received her medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She’s practiced as an internist in many settings, including Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital, and St. Anthony Medical Clinic serving the homeless. She currently has a private practice in Berkeley, CA and recently published her first book which I highly recommend, Brave New Medicine: A Doctor's Unconventional Path to Healing Her Autoimmune Illness.</p><br><p>This episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy is brought to you by Thrive Market and by SomniFix.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule. I never let myself get into a food emergency. Instead, I always carry enough food with me when I’m on the go, for at least a full day. I order real, whole foods online from Thrive Market. Right now, Thrive is offering all Doctor’s Farmacy listeners a great deal: you will receive an extra 25% off your first purchase plus a free 30-day membership to Thrive. There’s no minimum amount to buy and no code at checkout. All you have to do is head over to <a href=\"http://thrivemarket.com/farmacy\" target=\"_blank\">http://thrivemarket.com/farmacy</a></p><br><p>Most of us aren’t getting our best rest. But there is actually a proven solution I’ve found for getting high-quality rest, simply by helping you breathe through your nose instead of your mouth. They’re called SomniFix Strips. Breathing through your nose has so many benefits—it protects against mouth dryness and nasal congestion, boosts oxygen saturation for enhanced focus, and helps naturally produce nitric oxide that kills bacteria and supports immunity. SomniFix is now offering all Doctor’s Farmacy listeners 15% off of your first order. Just go to <a href=\"https://somnifix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">somnifix.com</a>, and use the code FARMACY at checkout.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
