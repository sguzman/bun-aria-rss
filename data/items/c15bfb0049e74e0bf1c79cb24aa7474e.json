  "description": "<p>There's two ways to look at balance. There's the way average people understand it: it's a daily, possibly weekly, task. It's calibrating the different events and activities and obligations of our lives so that they all get equal time. But successful people look at balance far differently. Essentially, it's intense, single-minded investment up front with dividends later. If you want to be financially successful, you have to look at it the same way.</p>",
