  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including two recent stories about young athletes blazing new trails in their question to reach the pros. In the first, high school basketball star R.J. Hampton announced this week that he will play basketball professionally in Australia instead of playing in college as he awaits the 2020 NBA Draft. In the second, 19-year-old pitcher Carter Stewart signed to play baseball professionally in Japan instead of re-entering the MLB Draft. Both Stewart and Hampton will make more money in the near-term, and roll the dice that their development will also accelerate due to a higher level of competition. Also talked about is the $110 million sale of Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands Group. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
