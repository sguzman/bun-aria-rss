But we aim to fulfill our curiosity of seeing it in anime.\nWhile we're only fan artists, we'll do our best to deliver this short fan animation well!\n\nFAQ:\nQ: When will it be done?\nA: Considering it took us 4 months to get this far, I'm sure it will take more to finish the entire \"Naturalist Club\" scenes.\nQ: Is it going to be uncensored?\nA: Yes and no. Maybe. Perhaps.",
