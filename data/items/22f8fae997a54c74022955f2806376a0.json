  "description": "<p><strong>When your stepfather passed away and your mother posted about it on Facebook, an old friend -- a self-described \"swami\" who claims to be psychically linked to her -- called to reconnect.</strong> Now, he seems to be taking advantage of her grief and loneliness to get closer, and based on a number of his wild, unlikely claims, you're worried that his end game may be less than altruistic. What can you do to stop this \"swami\" from swindling your mommy? We'll tackle this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
