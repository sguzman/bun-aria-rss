  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles and Banter, Avery, Codie & Justin discuss the importance and pivotal role of the Battle of South Mountain that occurred on September 14, 1862 during the infamous Maryland Campaign. The guys debate the question of whether or not South Mountain was just a skirmish that led up to the bloodiest single day at Antietam, or was actually a decisive victory of the Union Army of the Potomac. Justin tries to get promoted to series regular, Codie starts hearing things, and Avery pines for Tony's return from the wonderful world of Disney. All in all, an excellent episode! Enjoy folks!</p>",
