Yeah, we&#8217;re doing a deep dive on it today.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the case is an obscure campaign finance rule that limits the amount of post-election day contributions that can be used to recoup personal loans a candidate makes to their campaign. It was intended to crack down on corruption. But the court sided with Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and said the law is unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p>On the show today, Weiner talks about what this means for the midterm elections, the future of campaign finance and this court&#8217;s approach to the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Then, sales of new homes fell to the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. We&#8217;ll explain why this is exactly what we&#8217;d expect to be happening in the economy right now.</p>\n<p>Plus, if you&#8217;ve forgotten some of the faces you&#8217;ve met over Zoom during the last two years, you&#8217;re not alone.
