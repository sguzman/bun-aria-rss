  "description": "<p>A graph convolutional network (GCN) employs a graph filtering kernel tailored\nfor data with irregular structures. However, simply stacking more GCN layers\ndoes not improve performance; instead, the output converges to an uninformative\nlow-dimensional subspace, where the convergence rate is characterized by the\ngraph spectrum -- this is the known over-smoothing problem in GCN. In this\npaper, we propose a sparse graph learning algorithm incorporating a new\nspectrum prior to compute a graph topology that circumvents over-smoothing\nwhile preserving pairwise correlations inherent in data. Specifically, based on\na spectral analysis of multilayer GCN output, we derive a spectrum prior for\nthe graph Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ to robustify the model expressiveness\nagainst over-smoothing. Then, we formulate a sparse graph learning problem with\nthe spectrum prior, solved efficiently via block coordinate descent (BCD).\nMoreover, we optimize the weight parameter trading off the fidelity term with\nthe spectrum prior, based on data smoothness on the original graph learned\nwithout spectrum manipulation. The output $\\mathbf{L}$ is then normalized for\nsupervised GCN training. Experiments show that our proposal produced deeper\nGCNs and higher prediction accuracy for regression and classification tasks\ncompared to competing schemes.\n</p>",
