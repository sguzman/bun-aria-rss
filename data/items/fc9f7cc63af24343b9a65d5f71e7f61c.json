  "description": "In the Old Testament, the only way to have forgiveness for sins was to sacrifice an animal. Without the shedding of blood, there was no remission for sin. But Jesus came and shed His blood as a final covering for our sins. Second Corinthians 5:19 says, “God restored the world to Himself, no longer counting your sins against you. He has blotted them out.”Because of Jesus, we have freedom and forgiveness today! Yet many people are living with guilt and condemnation because of past mistakes even after they’ve asked for forgiveness. Do you need to let go of past mistakes and guilt today? Let this message remind you of God’s great grace for your life so that you can rise to a new level!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
