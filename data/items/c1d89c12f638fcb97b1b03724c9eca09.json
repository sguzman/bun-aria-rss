  "description": "<p>Dreams. Everyone has them, but not everyone achieves them. Why is that true? Believe it or not, a large number of people never even voice their dreams let alone create an actual plan to accomplish them. On today's episode, I'm once again joined by my sister Jenna. As she continues on her homesteading journey, we begin discussing Jenna's big goal for what's left of 2020 and the objectives she can hit to prepare herself for succes in 2021. My hope is that today's episode will serve as inspiration to aim high as well as a guide on how to start planning how to hit those lofty goals.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Makerplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps. They’re the perfect way to reduce plastic waste and make your pantry more functional, all at the same time.
