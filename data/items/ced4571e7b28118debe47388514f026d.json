  "description": "We all have opportunities to give up on what we’re believing for and walk away from uncomfortable situations. But Joel wants to show you why it’s important to not give up on the promises God put in your heart or on the people placed in your life. Learn the importance of loyalty and faithfulness and how they tie into your destiny. Elisha received a double portion of Elijah’s anointing when he stayed committed until the end of Elijah’s life. In the same way, if you want to walk in the fullness of God’s blessing and receive everything God has for you, you have to stay committed to what God has in your life.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
