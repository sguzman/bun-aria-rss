  "description": "<p>In Episode 6 of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast, we welcome our first ever guest, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bret-furio-9877123/\">Bret Furio,</a> who took <a href=\"https://www.zarbees.com/\">Zarbee’s Naturals</a>  from a small start-up to being acquired by one of the world’s largest corporations.</p><p>We discuss how leadership development played a starring role in successfully growing a small company of fewer than 10 into a team of 70 and, ultimately, seeing Zarbee’s Naturals acquired by Johnson & Johnson. </p><p>Bret credits the use of the Enneagram framework as a key driver of the company’s success. The Enneagram comprises nine distinct personality Types and it helps leaders become more self-aware and access the full potential of their teams.</p><p>He explains, “The Enneagram helped us to come together as a team. We became a real tight working unit! I am very passionate about the tool with respect to self-awareness, generous listening, granting trust, all these things that you get with the Enneagram. It’s critical to building collaborative, trusting relationships that are required to build a successful business.”</p><p>Trilogy Effect Managing Partner Heather Marasse says, “What was interesting about the work we did with Bret at Zarbee's was coming in when the company was so new. It was at an early stage. The team was running fast, but it was nimble and could pivot when needed. Bret knew that when you help your people grow as individuals, they will grow your business.” </p><p>Enjoy this episode and learn: </p><ul><li>How to improve communications across your organization.</li><li>How to supercharge business growth. </li><li>How to motivate your team by providing rewarding experiences.</li></ul><h2>Resources:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/hey-leaders-have-you-got-a-good-head-on-your-shoulders\">Episode 5: Do you have a good head on your shoulders?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-do-you-lead-from-the-heart\">Episode 4: Do You lead from the heart?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-leaders-what-are-your-instincts-telling-you\">Episode 3: Leaders, what are Your Instincts Telling You?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-do-you-lead-with-your-head-heart-or-gut\">Episode 2: Do you Lead with your Head, Heart or Gut?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-leading-during-unusual-times\">Episode 1: Leading During Unusual Times</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/how-to-use-the-enneagram-to-become-a-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram to Become A Better Leader</a></li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the <i>Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast </i>on iTunes, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
