  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the Democrat Party has a long history of racism and one of their leaders was Woodrow Wilson. Wilson re-segregated the federal government and separated Black workers with cages according to W.E.B. Du Bois. Others like, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee were Democrats who fought to protect slavery and resisted ending lynching. FDR's first SCOTUS nominee was KKK lawyer Hugo Black and he snubbed Black Olympian Jesse Owens from attending the White House. Then, Democrats are afraid to admit that they're not trying to codify Roe v Wade, they're trying to codify death. The Science in Roe acknowledged that it's a viable child and Democrats don't feel that Roe went far enough. Sadly, this is the most vicious form of population control seen anywhere on earth. Later, Democrats take to the media for damage control over the migrants that were voluntarily flown to Martha's Vineyard and trashed Christianity and Republican Governors, while claiming that the migrants were 'kidnapped.' Bexar County Sherriff claims he will investigate DeSantis' relocation of migrants to Massachusetts. Afterward, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joins the show to discuss a recent big tech court victory and how Texas law allows county officials certain autonomy including district attorneys and sheriffs. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
