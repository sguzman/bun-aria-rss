  "description": "<p class=\"\">The smell of coffee, the taste of asparagus, the warmth of a hug, and the agony of death: conscious experience makes up the fabric of our world, yet many consider it to be the most intractable mystery in philosophy and science. <em>What is it like</em> to undergo experience?

Is our stream of consciousness unified?</p> <p class=\"\">The hardest problem of all, might be the origin of consciousness itself: how, why, or <em>are we,</em> subjects of experience? In one sense, it shouldn’t come as a surprise - after all, in the words of physicist <a href=\"https://mkaku.org/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michio Kaku</a>, ‘Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe; 100 billion neurons, each connected to 10,000 others’.
