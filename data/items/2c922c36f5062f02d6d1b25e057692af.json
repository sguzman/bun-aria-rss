  "description": "<p class=\"\">Two years in the making, we’re finally talking to one of our very favorites, Tracey Livesay, about friends-to-lovers romances! Ironically, for a group of people who say they don’t love friends-to-lovers, we sure had a lot of books to recommend! We’ll also peel back the curtain on Tracey’s feelings about Jamie Dornan, talk about the strangest places romance couples have sex, and get to the bottom of why this trope works so well when it works.</p><p class=\"\">Sarah wrote a contemporary novella during a pandemic, and it's coming out September 15th!

May all of your <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EC8dPsFa3Qo\">contract negotiations</a> look like this. Tracey said <a href=\"https://www.theloop.ca/50-times-50-shades-star-jamie-dornan-talked-dirty-to-us/\">“we see more of Jamie” in the next two movies, so maybe she didn’t know about his modeling career</a>.
