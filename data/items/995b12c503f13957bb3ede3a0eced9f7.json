  "description": "Chelsea’s heard the gossip about her mum being pregnant and believes it. Jazzer quickly puts her right. Chelsea reckons he should stop the rumour, but Jazzer explains Tracy doesn’t want that. It’s better this way than the village guessing it might be Chelsea instead. When Chelsea discovers it’s Natasha who set the rumour ball rolling, she goes to see her. Natasha holds her hands up and is sorry. Chelsea tries to explain it’s not Tracy who’s pregnant but gets in a tangle when she’s faced with the twins. Later Chelsea admits to Natasha she’s pregnant. She feels she gets everything wrong; she doesn’t know what she’s doing. Natasha reassures her, confessing she once had a termination. They chat about it, but confused Chelsea still has questions. Natasha counsels that it comes down to just one question in the end. Does Chelsea want the baby?\nAlistair feels the surgery’s too quiet. He and Jakob hope Cheryl’s replacement, arriving today, will be more lively than she was. New nurse Paul duly arrives, and is a chatty whirlwind of energy. Jakob thinks he’s a bit full on, and Alistair deems him lacking in decorum and restraint. Come back Cheryl! Later Alistair tells Jakob Paul’s too familiar with the clients – it’s not a game show. Jakob is more forgiving. He thinks Paul seems competent and should be given a chance. He suggests if Alistair isn’t happy, he should have a word. When Alistair tries, Paul ties him in knots. Alistair protests that Denise was more professional, but Paul reckons she’d approve – Denise is his mum.",
