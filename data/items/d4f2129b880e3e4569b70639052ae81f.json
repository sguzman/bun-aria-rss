  "description": "<p>The final show before the Dave Portnoy Memorial 5k on Saturday, May 23. (If you're not running, you can watch the broadcast live on the Kirk Minihane Show Youtube channel and the KMS Twitter feed.) In a loose Thursday night show, the crew talks pizza and Ben Volin's shitty attempt at journalism. Blind Mike bombs an interview with a comedian who totally wasn't big-timing him -- a contribution to the show only outdone by a strange 40-second audio clip submitted by DEC. Callers inform, annoy, and amuse.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
