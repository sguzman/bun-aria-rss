She received Sibert Medals for Balloons over Broadway and The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus by Jen Bryant; Caldecott Honor Medals for both A River of Words and The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus; and two New York Times Best Illustrated citations.\n\nLearn more at: http://www.melissasweet.net.\n\n\n\nSusan Raab is president of Raab Associates, an internationally recognized agency that specializes in marketing literature, products and initiatives that help improve the lives of young people.
