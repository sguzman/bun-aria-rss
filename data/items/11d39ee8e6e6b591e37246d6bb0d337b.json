She tells us how she survives, and remains upbeat, on the road. Guess how many shoes she went through on her trip? Listen and find out.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We also hear from D’Wayne Edwards, who helped design some of the most iconic shoes ever (Air Jordan anyone?). And see if you can guess the Mystery Sound.
