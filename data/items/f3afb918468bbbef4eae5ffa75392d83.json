  "description": "<p>Episode 207 - Basketball talk? On a music podcast? As part of my ongoing “friendversation” series I wanted to bring a recent guest back on the show to dive into one of my favorite sports, basketball. If you are looking for a discussion of independent music you will have to look elsewhere this week. Benny and I discuss how we both got into basketball, the current NBA playoffs, the upcoming draft and some quick “emotional response” questions I wanted to ask. I had a lot of fun with this and hope you enjoy this slight diversion from the norm. Next week, is our 4 year anniversary and I am incredibly excited about that. Have a good week!
