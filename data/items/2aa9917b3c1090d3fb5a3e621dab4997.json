  "description": "Sean Legister, a vice president in the Global Markets Division, talks about overcoming imposter syndrome on the Goldman Sachs trading floor and what led him to start Breakfast Bites, a monthly fireside chat connecting black colleagues with senior leaders. Legister tells podcast host Jake Siewert, “When I looked at the black population, particularly within the Global Markets Group, I thought, ‘I don’t think we lack the intellect. I don’t think we lack the hunger. I don’t think we lack ambition. I think sometimes where we may falter a little bit is culture, empowerment, access to resources.’ And so what could I do in my seat to be innovative or creative. Not just do what’s asked of me, but to give back?”",
