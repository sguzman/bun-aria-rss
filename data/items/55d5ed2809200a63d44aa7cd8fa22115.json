    "media:description": "Being a young child I knew for sure; you belong to me and I will always belong to you. Why did my parents not feel the same way? Why were they always fighting? Was it my fault? Was I not good enough? You know, after all that happened, I had no other option than to make a drastic decision; \"I never want to see my parents ever again.\"\n\nWe chose this story because we want to encourage people to speak up if something similar has happened to them and to seek help if they're still in such a situation. We hope this video will encourage people to feel empathy and compassion for those who have gone through such experiences. And we hope that it will encourage us all to do what we can to prevent these things from happening. Even if it does happen we want to encourage people to speak up for their own safety\n\nSubmit your story at: https://community02.com/story/new\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/minutevideos.productions\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/minutevideosdotcom\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/minutevideos\n\n#parents #parenting #childhood #minutevideos",
