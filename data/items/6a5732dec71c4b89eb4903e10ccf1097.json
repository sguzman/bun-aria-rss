  "description": "<p>It's night two at the VFW hall in Florence and we find ourselves at war. Once again, Kirk Minihane's enemies have conspired against the Kirk Minihane Show in a coordinated effort to shutdown and silence and charity show. Hours before we went to tape, five agents of the state descended upon VFW Post 8006 to carry out the capricious and nonsensical dictates of the Northampton Health Board. We prevailed over the forces of tyranny. In other triumphs, Steve from Providence successfully walked 88 miles from Providence, RI all the way to Florence. His thighs look like raw ground beef, but he has become legend. Sadly, Intern Justin failed to properly document the adventure as he instead decided to sleep for 17 hours. (There's still time to donate to Steve's GoFundMe, proceeds of which will go either to Steve's child support or the VFW hall: https://tinyurl.com/y3b2oqz4)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
