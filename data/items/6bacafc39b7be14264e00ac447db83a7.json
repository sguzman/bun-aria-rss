(See\nthe <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/implicitmodels/bibliography\">bibliography\npage</a>\nfor detailed references.)</p>\n\n<p>The deadline for paper submissions (including travel awards) is June 30, 2017.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-papers\">Call For Papers</h2>\n\n<p>Probabilistic models are an important tool in machine learning. They\nform the basis for models that generate realistic data, uncover hidden\nstructure, and make predictions. Traditionally, probabilistic models\nin machine learning have focused on prescribed models. Prescribed\nmodels specify a joint density over observed and hidden variables that\ncan be easily evaluated. The requirement of a tractable density\nsimplifies their learning but limits their flexibility — several\nreal world phenomena are better described by simulators that do not\nadmit a tractable density. Probabilistic models defined only via the\nsimulations they produce are called implicit models.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably starting with generative adversarial networks, research on\nimplicit models in machine learning has exploded in recent years. This\nworkshop’s aim is to foster a discussion around the recent\ndevelopments, commonalities among applications, and future directions\nof implicit models.</p>\n\n<p>We invite submission of papers for poster and short oral\npresentations. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>implicit models,</li>\n  <li>generative adversarial networks,</li>\n  <li>adversarial training,</li>\n  <li>variational inference with implicit approximations,</li>\n  <li>approximate Bayesian computation,</li>\n  <li>likelihood free inference,</li>\n  <li>two sample testing and density ratio estimation,</li>\n  <li>theory,</li>\n  <li>evaluation and</li>\n  <li>applications of implicit models.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>June 30, 2017: Submission and Travel Award Deadline</li>\n  <li>July 14, 2017: Acceptance and Travel Award Notification</li>\n  <li>Aug 1, 2017: Final papers due</li>\n  <li>Aug 10, 2017: Workshop date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Submission Instructions:</strong>\nResearchers interested in contributing should upload a short paper of\n4 pages in PDF format by June 30, 2017, 11:59pm (time zone of your\nchoice) to the submission web site\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/implicitmodels/submissions. References\nand supplementary material can exceed 4 pages.</p>\n\n<p>Authors should use the ICML style file. Submissions don’t need to be\nanonymized. The workshop allows submissions of papers that are under\nreview or have been recently published in a conference or a journal.\nAuthors should state any overlapping published work at time of\nsubmission.</p>\n\n<p>All submissions will be reviewed and will be evaluated on the basis of\ntheir technical content. Accepted papers will selected for either a\nshort oral presentation or spotlight presentation, in addition to\nposter presentation.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at implicitmodels2017@gmail.com.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Confirmed Speakers:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Sanjeev Arora (Princeton)</li>\n  <li>Stefano Ermon (Stanford)</li>\n  <li>Qiang Liu (Dartmouth)</li>\n  <li>Kerrie Mengerson (Queensland University of Technology)</li>\n  <li>Dougal Sutherland (UCL)</li>\n</ul>",
