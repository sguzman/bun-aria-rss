  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Billions of folks log into social media platforms every day to share life updates and photos, form connections with other humans and create communities based on similar interests. When you sign up for an account with one of these popular platforms, you must agree to their terms of service. This means the company can decide that your content does not align with their community standards, rendering your account censored, shadowbanned, or even deactivated.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Centralized, private social media companies own all your data, and technically it is within their rights to dictate what is and what is not allowed on their platform. The problem is this type of framework interrupts our freedom and our online relationships. And if we want freedom, we must stop expecting permission to be free from traditional social networking companies. Zion is the world’s first decentralized social network, built on bitcoin.
