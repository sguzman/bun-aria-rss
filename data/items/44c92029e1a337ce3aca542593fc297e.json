  "description": "If I could have just re-named myself in grade school, it probably would have been Finn MacCool. I mean, yeah, that's only an English transcription and it's actually spelled Fionn mac Cumhaill and it doesn't really mean \"Cool guy named Finn\" but, loosely, \"Fair one who is the son of Cumhaill\" but, you know, details. Really, really stupid joking aside, today's story is awesome. It's parts tense human drama, revenge tale, and fantasy epic. It has young people trying to avenge their parents, giant monster fights, and, of course, a very smart fish. It's a two-parter, and it's been one of my favorite stories so far on this podcast. The creature this week is a fire monster who likes to play with his food. Unfortunately, that involves flinging flaming heads at grieving families. -- Check out our sponsor today: Credit Karma.
