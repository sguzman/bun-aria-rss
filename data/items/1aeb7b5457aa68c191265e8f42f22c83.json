    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Marco Perone shows benefit examples of defining concepts of category theory using Idris. \n\nFull Presentation Description:\n\nCategory theory provides us the setting and a common language to talk about computation and composition. Its usage pervades and inspires languages such as Haskell and Scala, lending concepts like functors and monads. Still, functional programming is just one of the possible applications of category theory, which may actually vary from physics and chemistry to machine learning and blockchain. So what about a change of perspective? Let's make category theory the subject of our code and actually implement it!\n\nIn this talk, we will take a look at how we can define concepts of category theory, using a programming language as Idris, which allows us to properly define all the required laws and properties of the objects in question, and we will see how we can take advantage of them in concrete contexts.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/marcoshuttle\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
