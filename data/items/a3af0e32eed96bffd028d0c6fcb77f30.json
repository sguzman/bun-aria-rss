This week they take a couple of mailbags and turn it into a show.</p>\n<p>In the first hour Mr. Jonathan addresses the question, “How do you guys taste all those flavors you mention every week?” While some of us think Mr.J makes them up, there is actually a science behind it. Mr. J shares information about our palates, olfactory receptors and flavor wheels. We will even share some tips on how to make it easier to taste the notes we do all while smoking the Perdomo Champagne Epicure from the Cigar Authority Care Package.</p>\n<p>In the second hour Barry will address a question that came in last week about aging cigars. Not every cigar will age well, and the same brand from different vintages might not age the same. However, there are tips to aging cigars and what to look for to determine of there is a chance they will age well. We will do this while we smoke the La Flor Dominicana 50th Segunda Edition TAA.</p>\n<p>We will have all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a></p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
