  "description": "<p>The ExPLORERR was built to go everywhere. That’s why this vehicle’s full name is: the Extremely Practical Land and Ocean Rover Exploring Remote Realms. And guess what? It has a recording studio built on-board! Good thing, because this episode was recorded while traveling up, up, up a mountain!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We discover some wildlife that lives at great heights as well as a rhyming ice cream salesman. Our pal and atmospheric scientist, Dr. Deanna Hence checks in to answer a popular question: if hot air rises, why is it so cold in the mountains? BRRRR! We also hear from NASA’s Dr. Dalia Kirschbaum, who has mountains of information about how mountains form.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, there’s a fun Mystery Sound for you’re ears to explore! And lastly, but not leastly, our two new books came out today. Head to our <a href=\"https://www.brainson.org/page/books\" class=\"default\">books page</a> to find out more about <em>Road Trip Earth </em>and <em>Earth Friend Forever.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Interlochen Center for the Arts (<a href=\"https://Interlochen.org/BrainsOn\" class=\"default\">Interlochen.org/BrainsOn</a>)</p>\n<p>Staples (<a href=\"https://Staples.com\" class=\"default\">Staples.com</a>)</p>\n",
