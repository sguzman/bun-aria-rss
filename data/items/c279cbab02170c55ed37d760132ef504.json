  "description": "A strange syndrome is wreaking havoc on the voices of our biggest pop stars. From Rihanna to Justin Bieber, no one is safe from having their beautiful vocals chopped up, screwed down, repitched and repurposed. As dance music takes over the charts and new software grants vocal manipulation at the click of a button, this uncanny production technique has become nearly ubiquitous. But is this ultramodern sound really that new? We dig deep into the roots of the sound of the moment.\nFeaturing:\n• Kiaara - Gold\n• Coldplay - Hymn for the Weekend (Seeb remix)\n• Hailee Steinfeld ft. Grey & Zedd - Starving\n• Calvin Harris ft. Rihanna - This is What You Came For\n• Mike Posner -I Took a Pill in Ibiza (Seeb remix)\n• DJ Snake ft. Justin Bieber - Let Me Love You\n• Cold Crush Brothers - MC Battle (Live)\n• Cerrone - Rocket in the Pocket\n• Wu Tang Clan - Tearz\n• Wendy Rene - After Laughter\n• Kanye West - School Spirit\n• Whistle - Just Buggin\n• Nu Shooz - I Can't Wait\nLearn more about your ad choices.
