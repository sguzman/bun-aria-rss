  "description": "<p>Another exciting interview coming your way today as we speak with Australian bobsledder Breeana Walker about her hopes for Beijing 2022 and her amazing journey to try and get there! We learn just what made her go from a promising track & field career to the sport of bobsleigh and what the challenges were in making the transition. We also learn about the unique version of the sport that is monobob and just how much of a chance she is at medaling next year at the Olympics. We also learn some more about Bree as a person, including what answer nearly made Ben hang up on her and just what she likes to call her sled and why it might feature the name of somebody you all know. Tune in and get excited for one great interview!</p>",
