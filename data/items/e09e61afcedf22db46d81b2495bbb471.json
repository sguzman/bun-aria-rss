    "media:description": "In this video, I walk you through a shortened version of a protocol of chemical transformation - commonly known as \"heat shock\".  This protocol starts with the preparation of chemically competent cells, before completing the actual transformation.\n\n\nPlease note that the very short treatment in CaCl2 in this procedure will yield enough cells capable of transformation to demonstrate the concept in a teaching lab, but will not yield transformation efficiency that is sufficient for research purposes. \n\n\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:41 - Preparing chemically competent cells\n2:20 - The actual transformation procedure, including \"heat shock\"\n3:33 - Recovery phase\n4:30 - Plating",
