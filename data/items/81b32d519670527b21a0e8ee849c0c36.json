Unedited from start to beginning!</span><span style= \"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I wanted to give all you listeners a peek into I how conduct meetings and what it's like to be in a strategy meeting with me and my team.  In this first installment of meetings, I sit down and talk with The Eighth, a fairly new retail business attacking the white space they saw in the men's luxury underwear market. We discuss their early days in researching and identifying the market, luxury branding, SEM and SEO approaches, influencer marketing, content creation and the importance of documenting versus creating. For the listeners that have asked in the past, this is some really good insight into how I approach introductory business meetings, evaluate the viability of new businesses, and suggest marketing strategies. Thanks for listening, excited to hear your thoughts and learnings from this one.</span></div> <div> </div> <div> </div><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5078317.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
