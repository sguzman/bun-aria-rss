It’s easy in times like these to rush to making new stuff that’s on trend, but in this episode I want to introduce you to a solution that is essentially the opposite of that.\n\nIn this episode we talk about:\n• How to get in touch with the invisible thread running through your work\n• Why priming yourself with the right inspiration before making work is essential and how to do it\n• The practice that separates good art and transcendent work\n• How to learn to hit your creative target more often\n• The trick of taking your best work and riffing on it",
