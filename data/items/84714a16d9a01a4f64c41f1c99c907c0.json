  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has become the George Soros of Big Tech and is using its users' data for political purposes. The media, including social media, is changing the election narrative from no fraud at all to no evidence of fraud at a major scale. They went from alleging the Trump campaign not having any evidence to the Trump campaign not having enough evidence. Then, the latest lawsuit filing in Pennsylvania is over 100 pages chronicling institutionalized fraud in major Democrat cities. There will never be enough examples of fraud for the media because the media is a fraud. Interestingly several PA counties failed to comply with an emergency order from the court requiring poll watchers to have \"meaningful access to serve ballot counting”. The Constitution protects a citizen's right to equal protection under the law and it also delineates that only the legislature of a given state can dictate a state's election laws and to do otherwise is unconstitutional. Later, Daniel Horowitz from Conservative Review calls in to re-state that nobody is saying to rush into this final election result. It's the Biden camp that is rushing to short-circuit a count on a style of balloting that necessarily takes several weeks to verify and that he pushed for. Horowitz suggests that the legislatures must convene hearings and investigations to shadow the litigation in court and the Supreme Court must cure the ill caused by the lower state court. Afterward, USA Today misrepresents this program's commentary and claims to have reached out to this show, but it has not. The media positions itself to prop up Biden and takedown Trump every chance they get. Finally, Media Research Center President Brent Bozell calls in to discuss censorship in the media. Bozell said media coverage on Biden and allegations of foreign corruption remain fundamentally non-existent. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
