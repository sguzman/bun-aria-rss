She is the co-editor of the book, along with John Goddard, Louise Kempton, and Paul Vallance.\n\nThe book explores the new challenges that universities face in this era defined by globalization and internationalization, but also by the consequences of funding shortages and slashed budgets. The authors of the book look at ways institutions can better embed themselves into their surrounding cities or environments to have greater meaning and connection, instead of becoming separate Ivory Tower islands. While the focus is on the management of solutions to these issues and challenges, the target audience for this book is anyone interested in education, civics, or policy.\n\nEllen Hazelkorn previously joined the New Books Network to discuss Rankings and the Reshaping of Higher Education.\n\n\n\nFor any questions, comments, or recommendations for the New Books in Education podcast, you can connect with the host, Ryan M.
