In this latest episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’ we welcome Julio Faura, global head of innovation at Banco Santander, and Johan Pouwelse, associate professor at Delft University of Technology, to help illuminate the blockchain concept and where it could be taking us.\n\nThe development and implementation of blockchain networks is meant to give everyone an opportunity to participate in a market that is not controlled by a central body.\n\nQuestions remain, however, over the practicality of blockchain networks; how to transition from proof-of-concept to real-world usefulness, how to integrate with and provide benefits for the world economy, and where the greatest benefits of such decentralisation might lie.\n\nShining a light on the brave new blockchain world in this latest episode of ‘The Sound of Economics’ is Julio Faura, the global head of innovation at Banco Santander, and Johan Pouwelse, associate professor at Delft University of Technology and found of the Tribler peer-to-peer service.\n\nBoth Julio Faura and Johan Pouwelse participated in the Bruegel event ‘The implications of blockchain platforms’, video and audio recordings of which can be reviewed on our events page.",
