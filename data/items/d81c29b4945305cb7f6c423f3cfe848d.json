  "description": "The Mahabharata is one of the central works of Indian literature—its characters, lessons, and tropes are widely known and referenced in Indian popular culture, literary discussions and political debate.\nAnd like all classic works, it’s ripe for reinterpretations, deconstructions and adaptations.\nOne such reinterpretation is Song of Draupadi (Aleph Book Company, 2021), written by Ira Mukhoty. Ira’s book puts the Mahabhrata’s female characters front and center, focusing the story around their struggles and their strengths in fighting for themselves—and the men they have to care for.\nIra Mukhoty is the author of several books about India and Indian women throughout history, including Heroines: Powerful Indian Women of Myth and History (Aleph Book Company: 2017), Daughters of the Sun: Empresses, Queens and Begums of the Mughal Empire (Aleph Book Company: 2018), and Akbar: The Great Mughal (Aleph Book Company: 2020).\nIra can be followed on Twitter at @mukhoty, and on Instagram at @iramukhoty.\nWe’re also joined by Mariyam Haider, researcher-writer and spoken word artist in Singapore.\nToday, the three of us will talk about the Mahabharata, and how Song of Draupadi reinterprets its story and central characters.\nYou can find more reviews, excerpts, interviews, and essays at The Asian Review of Books, including its review of Song of Draupadi.
