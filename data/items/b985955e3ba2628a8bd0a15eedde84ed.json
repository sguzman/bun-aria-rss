  "description": "Everyone’s skipping over the BIGGEST news story of the week to rant about Trudeau’s blackface and Trump’s creditless whistleblower “scandal.” The banks and the Fed are running out of money, but since everyone’s thinking with their feelings, a second Great Depression will make Elizabeth Warren look like a DREAM candidate! Bill O’Reilly joins with his take on how Corey Lewandowski’s mockery, the student climate protests, and Beto’s backfiring gun stance all prove how LITTLE we trust the press and government. And as Facebook pranksters descend on Area 51, what kind of “alien” weapons should the military use against them? How about “barf guns?” The Pentagon is also opening up about UFOs, and it just CONFIRMED three sightings.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
