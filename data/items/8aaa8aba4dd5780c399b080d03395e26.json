  "description": "<p>Greenwich Village is on the island of Manhattan in New York City. After European settlement, this area would become a place for carriage houses, black servant quarters and row homes. The area would industrialize and become home to slums. Eventually, the avant-garde would come and soon beatniks, hippies, artists and homosexuals called The Village home. Upscale stores moved in and New York University bought up historic buildings and gutted them. Residents have not embraced these changes, nor does it seem, have the ghosts. Join us as we share the history and hauntings of Greenwich Village. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jannae McCabe and features the Dracula Parrot and This Month in History features the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima. Our tour was through NY Ghosts.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com</p> <p>Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/03/hgb-ep-331-greenwich-village.html<br />  <br /> Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Staying Alive (Bee Gees) Full by Alibi Music Library on Mutations - Trailerize Album<br /> Cupids Crooner by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
