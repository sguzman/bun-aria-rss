  "title": "BONUS 19: Richard \"The Night Stalker\" Ramirez",
  "description": "<p>Serial killer Richard Ramirez killed at least 14 people and raped and tortured at least two dozen more, mostly during the Spring and Summer of 1985. He robbed to support his coke habit and and he tortured, raped, and killed to both sexually satisfy himself and to appease Satan. Ramirez was WAY into Satan. He’d actually pray to the Devil for protection before sneaking into some innocent family’s home to brutalize, rape, and kill. And today, if you have the stomach for it, you can learn all about the dirty deeds of this dark piece of shit. Extra big parental advisory on this one. We go dark, REAL dark, today, on Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by by the socially conscious and fantastic on-line mattress store LEESA!
