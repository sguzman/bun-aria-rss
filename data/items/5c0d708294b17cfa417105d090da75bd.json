  "description": "Many experts say the housing market is in a bubble that’s about to burst. But this is B.S. My research tells me there’s a lot more growth ahead for housing. [00:30] When you think of helium, you probably think of balloons… But David Johnson, CEO of Imperial Helium, explains why the gas is critical to our economy. (Hint: It has a lot more uses than you might think.) [31:33] Then, Daniel and I discuss the blockbuster earnings from Best Buy and Dick Sporting Goods. There are two huge lessons investors should take away from these reports… [1:01:36] Luke Downey’s Big Money Report lets the data do the talking. Here’s why I couldn’t be more excited about our latest product. [1:10:00] We also share what to expect from the Fed meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this week…  And finally, with bitcoin prices back up to $50k, we break down the “new normal” of big players getting into crypto… and a mayor who wants to give free bitcoin to citizens.
