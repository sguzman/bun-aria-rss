  "description": "<p>Public blockchains implement a fee mechanism to allocate scarce computational\nresources across competing transactions. Most existing fee market designs\nutilize a joint, fungible unit of account (e.g., gas in Ethereum) to price\notherwise non-fungible resources such as bandwidth, computation, and storage,\nby hardcoding their relative prices. Fixing the relative price of each resource\nin this way inhibits granular price discovery, limiting scalability and opening\nup the possibility of denial-of-service attacks. As a result, many prominent\nnetworks such as Ethereum and Solana have proposed multi-dimensional fee\nmarkets. In this paper, we provide a principled way to design fee markets that\nefficiently price multiple non-fungible resources. Starting from a loss\nfunction specified by the network designer, we show how to compute dynamic\nprices that align the network's incentives (to minimize the loss) with those of\nthe users and miners (to maximize their welfare), even as demand for these\nresources changes. Our pricing mechanism follows from a natural decomposition\nof the network designer's problem into two parts that are related to each other\nvia the resource prices. These results can be used to efficiently set fees in\norder to improve network performance.\n</p>",
