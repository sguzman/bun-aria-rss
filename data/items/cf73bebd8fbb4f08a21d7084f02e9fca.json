  "description": "This week, the gals climb into their time machine and head back to the Middle Ages to weigh in on some wild trials. Topics include a whole bunch of rats with a great lawyer, some poor piggies with a taste for blood, and the legal loopholes of monkey selfies. Crack open a bottle of Wild Pig Viognier, stay out of the barn, and tune in for Medieval Animal Trials.",
