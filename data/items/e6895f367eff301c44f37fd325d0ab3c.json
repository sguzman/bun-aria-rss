  "description": "\n<img src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.png?id=26851523&width=980\"/><br/><br/><p>Nowadays, electric machines are often driven by power electronic converters. Even though the use of converters brings with it a variety of advantages, common mode (CM) signals are a frequent problem in many installations. Common mode voltages induced by the converter drive common mode currents damage the motor bearings over time and significantly reduce the lifetime of the drive. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/solutions/test-and-measurement/emc-testing/emi-debugging/white-paper-how-to-measure-and-reduce-common-mode-emi-registration_254960.html?cid=010_de_eml-nl_130_ieee_22-09_int__how-to-measure-and-reduce_eblast_text-ad____MM-1080685\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download this free whitepaper now!</a></p><hr/><p>Hence, itâ€™s essential to measure these common mode quantities in order to take suitable countermeasures. Handheld oscilloscopes in combination with Rogowski probes offer a simple and reliable way to accurately determine the required quantities and the effectiveness of different countermeasures.<u></u><u></u></p>",
