  "description": "<p>One of the unique features of non-Hermitian~(NH) systems is the appearance of\nnon-Hermitian degeneracies known as exceptional points~(EPs). The extensively\nstudied defective EPs occur when the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable.\nAside from this degeneracy, we show that NH systems may host two further types\nof degeneracies, namely, non-defective EPs and ordinary (Hermitian) nodal\npoints. The non-defective EPs manifest themselves by i) the diagonalizability\nof the NH Hamiltonian at these points, ii) the non-diagonalizability of the\nHamiltonian along certain intersections of these points and iii) instabilities\nin the Jordan decomposition when approaching the points from certain\ndirections. We demonstrate that certain discrete symmetries, namely\nparity-time, parity-particle-hole, and pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, guarantee the\noccurrence of both defective and non-defective EPs. We extend this list of\nsymmetries by including the NH time-reversal symmetry in two-band systems.\nTwo-band and four-band models exemplify our findings. Through an example, we\nfurther reveal that ordinary nodal points may coexist with defective EPs in NH\nmodels when the above symmetries are relaxed.\n</p>",
