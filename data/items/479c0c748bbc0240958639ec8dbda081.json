  "description": "In this episode, NPR's Scott Simon interviews two writers whose books about friendship reckon with how people, and what we experience with them, make us who we are. First, Hua Hsu talks about his memoir <em>Stay True</em> which focuses on one of his formative college friendships, and how that friendship was cut tragically short. Then, we hear from Kamala Shamsie about her novel <em>Best of Friends</em>. It follows the push and pull of a friendship between two girls from when they were teenagers in Karachi to when they're older and working in London. ",
