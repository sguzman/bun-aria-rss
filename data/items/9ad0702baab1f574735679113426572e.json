They can occur as a result of injury to the lining of the blood vessels or lack of mobility for an extended period of time. And while the traditional approach to treatment is using a blood thinner or aspirin, Functional Medicine focuses on the prevention of blood clots as well as treatment options, which may include healing the gut, reducing inflammation, and supporting genetics.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman discusses this topic with Dr. Elizabeth Boham. They explore how health conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disease, metabolic syndrome—and even certain genetics—may increase the risk of blood clotting. They also share their personal experiences with blood clots and how they work with patients to prevent and treat them.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the <em>Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine</em>. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including <em>Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life</em>. Her DVD <em>Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer</em> explores the Functional Medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Rupa Health and ButcherBox.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
