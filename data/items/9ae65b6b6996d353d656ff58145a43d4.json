At the present moment this podcast is being released, that deadline is only a few short weeks away.\n\n\nIn many ways the politics of Brexit stretch back far beyond just the past four years, but reflect centuries of contention between the UK and its European neighbours, and marks only the most recent phase in an ever-changing relationship. And while nationalism and Euro-discontent are very much at the fore of the UKâ€™s decision to leave, these processes dig far deeper into the bedrock of British politics than just the rhetoric of the UKip movement.\n\n\nWhat are the sources of Brexit and British discontent with the Pan-European project? How has this impacted relations not only with the UK and the EU, but with long-standing partners like Canada and the United States? And what does Brexit mean for not only the future of UK-EU relations, but the global community as a whole? \n\n\nTo delve into these questions and more, we spoke with Professor Achim Hurrelmann.
