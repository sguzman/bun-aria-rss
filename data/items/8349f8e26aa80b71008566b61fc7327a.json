You don’t own that thing, you only own it when you pay it off.” [26:35]<br /><br />‘Everyone’s got debts cause we borrowed for our future selves.” [37:58]<br /><br />“Humans have a propensity to borrow to create the image of this future self. [...] that dream we had in the 50s, that dream died decades ago, and to fund that dream, the mismatch between the dream and the reality is debt. Sometimes debt is not all bad. Sometimes it can help accelerate some of the things, but if you’re doing it to fund a dream that is never going to exist, that’s the danger.” [47:23]<br /><br />“Focus on your income, work hard, look for other opportunities that can leverage that income and opportunity set that you’ve got for you, [...] look for investment opportunities that can change my life.” [57:51]<br /><br />“You can’t be in it to win it if you’ve got leverage, or if you’re out of the market.” [1:05:52]<br /><br />“Where are we in the volatility, and is this going to survive? [...] and if the long term trend is there, then you should be buying into all of this.” [1:13:18]<br /><br />“Change is happening, and you can fear it, but you’re not going to stop it.”  [1:25:53]<br /><br />“Always out of bad times eventually is the good times, and it’s the same with investing. That cycle is pretty common, and it’s a very human trait.” [1:28:24]<br /><br />Follow Raoul Paul:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://www.realvision.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.realvision.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/raoulgmi/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/raoulgmi/</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBH5VZE_Y4F3CMcPIzPEB5A\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBH5VZE_Y4F3CMcPIzPEB5A</a>",
