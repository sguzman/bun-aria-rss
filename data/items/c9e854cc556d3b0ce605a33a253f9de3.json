  "description": "Our audiobook this week is ALPHA RANGER by Anna Fury\n\nLiv\n\nI’ve been in love with Thatcher Forrest from the moment he walked into my pharmacy, seven feet of quietly dimpled smiles and southern charm. He’s everything I could ever want in a man–a little older, full of confidence, and with a body made for cold winter nights in bed.\n\nYou’d think he’d make a move after three years of intense flirting, but I’m done waiting.\n\nI’m gonna bake up a batch of my best cookies and finally show Thatcher how perfect we are for one another, one chocolate chip at a time.\n\nThatcher\n\nFor three years, I’ve been picking up a prescription I don’t even need anymore just to lay eyes on my town’s beautiful young pharmacist. I probably shouldn’t fantasize about a woman fifteen years my junior, but time hasn’t done a single thing to get her off my mind. If anything, the desire to possess and mark her only increases every time I see her. She’s an omega, I’m certain of it.\n\nImagine my surprise when she shows up at my home with freshly baked cookies. Turns out the beautiful omega wants something only I can give her. Can I rein in my dominance long enough to avoid scaring her away? I don’t know. But if I get a taste of Liv, one thing’s for certain–I’m never letting her go.\n\nAnna Fury: https://amzn.to/3GUsu8t\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/3Q48hRW\nAlpha Compound Series: https://amzn.to/3NDh7nK\nNoire: https://amzn.to/3mm556A\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVSJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
