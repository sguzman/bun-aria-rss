  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! This week I’m joined by Amir Adnani – CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. & GoldMining Inc. (formerly known as Brazil Resources) On today’s show, Amir and I dive into one of the biggest topics in the markets right now – Uranium. If you own any Uranium stocks, or you’re thinking about buying, this is a must-listen. Because for the first time in years, a new dawn for nuclear power is finally approaching. To start off the interview, Amir gives listeners 3 reasons why the “perfect storm” is on its way. We’ve already seen a swing in prices and Uranium is trading at levels not seen since 2004. But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves. Amir explains why investors must be patient. If you haven’t bought into Uranium yet, don’t worry. Although all signs are pointing upward, he say’s companies are still in “no man’s land” – with current Uranium prices sitting at just $22/lb. The point is, however, the Uranium market is finally coming off it’s lows. And we don’t expect prices to return anytime soon. The turnaround is real. And demand expectations are promising… After all, the number of reactors under construction world-wide are at record levels! Tune in to hear everything you need to know about the sector. Amir and I then dive into a stock listeners should be very familiar with – GoldMining (BRI.V). Yes, we’ve seen Gold take an unexpected hit since the Presidential election… but that doesn’t mean investors should run. To end the episode, Amir reassures his investors. He explains how his company, GoldMining, plans to keep building on top of an already strong, overlooked balance sheet. And finally, I move on to my educational segment [54:33]. Sector by sector, I’ll be breaking down this upcoming earnings season. Let’s just say this – Don’t be fooled by analyst estimates, they’re outrageous…",
