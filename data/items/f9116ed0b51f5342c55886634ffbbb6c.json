  "description": "<p>The function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers. As John Maxwell reminds us in this lesson, leadership is more caught than taught. So, today John is going to teach on embracing the three E’s of Developing Leaders. This is a great lesson for anyone who wants to build a winning team of people who can take their organization to the next level. </p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole––CEO of Maxwell Leadership––will be joined by Traci Morrow to discuss how they develop leaders within Maxwell Leadership and what they’re learning along the way. Developing leaders isn’t always easy, but it sure is fulfilling!
