  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts are pleased to begin talking about Jane Austen's <em>Northanger Abbey.</em> For this introduction episode Cindy Rollins and Angelina Stanford are joined by Thomas Banks. Together they discuss the advent of the novel as a form, as well as some predecessors of Austen.</p> <p>Angelina points out Austen's satirical voice in poking fun at the sentimental novel in the first few chapters. She also encourages us to look for the real life dangers the main characters encounter in contrast to those sensations of the popular sentimental or Gothic novel. Furthermore, we ought to notice who is reading various genres of literature and what that says about those characters.</p> <p>Cindy and Angelina also talk about Jane Austen's writing and her economy of style and the lasting quality of her books. Along with criticism of sensationalism, Austen also adds a healthy dose of criticism of the education given young women in her day. We also learn that this is a novel of development as we watch Catherine Moorland learn her way around the world. </p> <h3>Thanks to Our Sponsors-</h3> <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= \"https://newcollegefranklin.org/\">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.
