  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat sits down with 2x Super Bowl Champion, former Coach and Ring of Honor member of both the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and current NBC Sports Analyst, Tony Dungy. Pat and Tony discuss the fallout from Drew Brees' comments about kneeling for the national anthem and why his teammates were so disappointed by it, and Tony outlines what he thinks needs to be done in order to make this country a better place, as well as what he would tell his team if he were still coaching in the current environment of the world (00:00:29-14:09). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss the Drew Brees situation, the NBA Board of Governors finalizing a plan to come back and complete the 2020 NBA season, and they commentate a game of Madden to try and get people's minds off things for a little while (16:05-1:14:28). To close out the show, Super Bowl Champion, the leading scorer of the 2007 NFL season, and current Kicker for the Green Bay Packers, Mason Crosby joins the program. Pat and Mason discuss everything going on in the world right now and how he and his teammates have vowed to change things, what his relationship with Aaron Rodgers is like, the process of having a rookie holder and long snapper, and how many more years he envisions playing (1:16:23-1:33:30). Don't forget to send in the hashtag&nbsp;#ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the opportunity to win some free merch.
