  "title": "NFL Super Wild Card Saturday Recap: Bills break streak, Bucs barely beat Heinicke, Rams eliminate Seahawks (Football 1/10)",
  "description": "We still can't believe there were 3 NFL playoff games in a single day. To celebrate Super Wild Card Saturday, the Pick Six podcast featuring Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech live streamed the recap episode. So, be on the lookout for more live content on Twitch and YouTube. If you missed it live that's okay, because the Superfriends are still here to recap all the games starting with Washington nearly pulling off the upset of Tom Brady and the Bucs (3:00). Taylor Heinicke was announced as the starter just hours before the game and was super impressive in relief of Alex Smith. Meanwhile, Tampa is moving on, but how far can they advance? The Bills are another team that lived to see another week of playoff football, after being outplayed for most of the day by the Colts (19:00). Buffalo won their first playoff game in 25 years behind Josh Allen and some poor decisions from Frank Reich. Will Philip Rivers return in 2021? And the Rams handled the Seahawks with ease that certainly was expected with John Wolford at QB and definitely not with Jared Goff coming on in replacement (46:00). The guys evaluate Russell Wilson's poor performance and answer if there should be any questions about Pete Carroll's job security. Lastly, winners & losers from Saturday, dished out by Will, Ryan and John. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
