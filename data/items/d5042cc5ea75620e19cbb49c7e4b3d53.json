  "description": "<p>On today’s show, 3x Pro Bowler, 17 year NFL veteran, former Quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans, Indianapolis Colts, and friend of the show, Matt Hasselbeck calls in to clear some things up about Spygate 2.0. Matt and Pat discuss why he doesn’t think it is really that big of a deal with the way teams in the NFL make most of their calls through headsets now, why it would be a much bigger deal if it were being done in college, and what repercussions, if any, he thinks will come of the whole situation (4:14-9:49). Later, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, 2005 Defensive Rookie of the Year, and member of the LA Chargers’ 50th anniversary team, Shawne “Lights Out” Merriman joins the show. Shawne and Pat chat about Phillip Rivers going viral recently with his on field trash talk, and Shawne breaks down who Phillip Rivers is on and off the field and goes through their long history together. He also gives his thoughts on the next stage of Rivers’ career, which quarterback he’s played with that he would prefer led a team he was on, what needs to be done in order to contain Lamar Jackson and the Ravens offense, and his take on Spygate 2.0 (20:13-37:15). Also included are a couple of calls from the radio show dealing with Pat’s thoughts about the Chiefs chances heading into the playoffs after an impressive win in Foxborough, and Pat breaks out his new duck call when talking about the Steelers playoff chances with arguably the biggest budding superstar in the league, Duck Hodges. Pat also explains why he’s bummed out and depressed with the newest developments in the Antonio Brown saga, and breaks some For The Brand news dealing with long snappers going to the Pro Bowl. Today’s show is a good one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
