While it can be difficult to sit with hard feelings such as grief, avoiding our emotions only makes them louder. Through practice, we can learn to accept our feelings in the moment. We can work to break the pattern of being at war with the present moment and let our feelings come and go as needed. &nbsp;</p><br><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Joan Rosenberg, Susan David, and Tara Brach about situations that prompt grief, why facing our emotions is healthier than bottling them up, and how to accept difficult emotions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Joan Rosenberg is a cutting-edge psychologist who is known as an innovative thinker, acclaimed speaker, and trainer. A California-licensed psychologist, Dr. Rosenberg speaks on how to build confidence, emotional strength, and resilience; achieving emotional, conversational, and relationship mastery; integrating neuroscience and psychotherapy; and suicide prevention. She is the author of <em>90 Seconds to a Life You Love: How to Master Your Difficult Feelings to Cultivate Lasting Confidence, Resilience, and Authenticity</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Susan David, PhD, is one of the world’s leading management thinkers and an award-winning Harvard Medical School psychologist. Her book, <em>Emotional Agility</em>, describes the psychological skills critical to thriving in times of complexity and change. Susan’s TED Talk on the topic went viral, with over 1 million views in its first week of release. She is a frequent contributor to <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and a frequent guest on national radio and television. Susan is the CEO of Evidence Based Psychology, on the faculty at Harvard Medical School, a cofounder of the Institute of Coaching (a Harvard Medical School/McLean affiliate), and on the Scientific Advisory Boards of Thrive Global and Virgin Pulse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tara Brach holds a PhD in clinical psychology and teaches meditation internationally.
