  "description": "<p><p>The whole squad is in one place for the first time since before Chaps, Kate, and Bren left for the Starbucks trip. Cons admits he had serious FOMO watching everyone else having fun, but he did get to watch an awesome Army-Oklahoma football game. Today's interviews are mash-up of all the best parts of the interviews Chaps and Kate conducted at Starbucks HQ. We talk to two Marines, two Navy vets, and a West Point grad, all of whom play an important role at Starbucks! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
