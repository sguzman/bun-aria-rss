  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the horrid Democrat Party is a party of hate, and anti-Semitism and the media are attached to them at the hip. The Democrat party is now the home on anti-Semitism, open borders and seeks to fundamentally transform society—this is an ideological counter-revolution. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a nasty stupid bigot along with Rep Rashida Tlaib, and Rep. Ilhan Omar. Ocasio-Cortez said the U.S was running concentration camps at the southern border, which is sick. Does she even know what exactly happened during the Holocaust? Welcome to the modern democratic party. Then, democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders says that President Trump is a racist, bigoted homophobe. Finally, we carry the launch of President Trump's campaign kick-off live.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
