Now, he has 200 shops worldwide. In the latest episode of the BoF Podcast, the celebrated designer speaks with BoF Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks about the last five decades, his latest book and how the current moment is prompting a return to craft. <ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\"> <li>Reflecting on the past 50 years, Smith emphasises the importance of making the most of any luck or opportunity by working at it. “For a lot of people opportunities come their way but they don’t embrace them,” he said.</li> <li>To celebrate the brand’s 50th anniversary, Smith has released a book. In it, he tells the story of the last 50 years through 50 objects. “Instead of it just being a coffee table book with pictures of clothes in it, [I wanted it to] be a little bit lateral,” said Smith. “I very quickly chose 50 things — and I say ‘very quickly’ because I wanted it to be spontaneous.” Each object signifies a particular time or a memory that has shaped Smith's life and brought him to where he is today.</li> <li>Despite the challenges 2020 has presented, the designer says he is excited about the industry’s return to craft. “What’s been inspiring for me is the construction,” said Smith. “Instead of the inspiration coming from a Matisse or a Basquiat, going back to how we make things has been really wonderful.”</li> </ul> Related Articles: <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/restructuring-and-redundancies-at-paul-smith'> Restructuring and Redundancies at Paul Smith</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/streamlining-collections-paul-smith-reveals-own-fashion-calendar-fix'> Streamlining Collections, Paul Smith Reveals Own Fashion Calendar Fix</a>   <em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a></em><em>.</em>   <em>To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em> <em>with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em>   <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
