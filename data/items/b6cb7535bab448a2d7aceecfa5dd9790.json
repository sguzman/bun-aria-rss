  "description": "<p>This may be the last Kirk Minihane Show ever or at least until after The Wilbur. Kirk announces he's taking a long break to focus on his health and The Case: Season 2. Bob Murchison strikes again as he interjects himself, possibly orchestrated, an entire hit-piece on Dave Portnoy with Business Insider. The story was riddled with falsehoods and in true journalistic fashion, not one Business Insider representative has been willing to discuss the piece.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
