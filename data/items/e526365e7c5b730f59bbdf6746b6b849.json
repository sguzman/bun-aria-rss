Made on July 10th, 2011\n\nI wonder what life would be like if Daniel Hansen answered Jack Stauber's phone call.\n\nThe image shown in the video is not the official cover art for Daniel Hansen (as the song had none), but is instead the profile picture that Jack Stauber used at the time of posting this song.\nOriginally discovered by someone who would like to remain anonymous.\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20120523091210/soundcloud.com/jackstauber",
