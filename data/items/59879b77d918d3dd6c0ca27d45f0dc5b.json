  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, we have an absolutely repulsive Karen who is among the worst of the worst. The Karen thinks that OP is an employee and gets angry at OP when she doesn't know where the kid's dresses are. This eventually leads to a fight wherein OP reveals that she recently lost her child, and the Karen actually says that it's better that people like her don't have children. How absolutely disgusting can you possibly be?
