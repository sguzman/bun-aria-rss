  "description": "<div>The gals gush over bloodstains and the ways in which sprays, spurts, pools, and trails are used in forensic investigations. Topics include a shady gynecologist, whimsical blood terminology, and whether a dingo really did eat that baby. This episode is paired with Bloody Marys, so mix one up, wipe the spatter off your shoes, grab a protractor, and tune in.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
