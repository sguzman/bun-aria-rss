In the interview, Awoye and Arminda start by defining the roles of director and dramaturg and explaining why they work so well together. They also discuss their group CLASSIX, which aims to revive the work of Black playwrights and to “explode” the classical canon. Then Awoye and Arminda talk about their latest play Wedding Band, written by the mid-twentieth-century playwright Alice Childress. \nAfter the interview, Isaac and co-host June Thomas discuss the pleasures of archival research and the challenges of directing a play that was written during an earlier time period. \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, Awoye explains what it’s like to direct child actors, especially in a play that contains very adult subject matter. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-9675.\nPodcast production by Cameron Drews.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
