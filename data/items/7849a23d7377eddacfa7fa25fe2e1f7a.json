  "description": "<p>Mexico City is in a water crisis. Despite rains and floods, it is running out of drinking water. </p>\n<p>To solve the scarcity issue, the city began piping water in from far away as well as from aquifer below ground, creating yet another problem: the city began to sink as the moisture was sucked up and out from below. Meanwhile, rainwater which should be replenishing the ground can’t penetrate it thanks to impermeable paved surfaces above. Uneven ground and crooked buildings reflect this subterranean crisis on the surface, misshaping the city’s infrastructure and architecture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=28789&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Depave Paradise</a></p>\n",
