  "description": "Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko remains confident that the Bitcoin price is still going to reach $250,000 (as he has predicted several times in the past):\n\n“I absolutely positively believe that Bitcoin is digital gold… I think it is a better form of value storage. I absolutely believe that. Gold – $10 trillion above ground. Half of it [is] in jewelry and chalices – that doesn’t count. The monetary value of gold [is] about $5 trillion.\n\nSo $5 trillion from [BTC’s market cap of] $400 billion today, that’s [a] 10x. [A] 10x from here at $20,000 is $200,000. Round it, my numbers are off a little bit, to that $250,000 number. Seems easy to me to get to $250,000 because you got a few lost or stolen coins. No problem...\n\nEvery halving we had a zero – first halving was $10, second halving was $100, third halving was a $1,000 [and] fourth halving was $10,000, so that means that next halving is $100,000.“\nLearn more about your ad choices.
