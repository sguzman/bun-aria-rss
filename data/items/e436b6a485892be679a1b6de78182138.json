In the Gemer region, surrounding the town of Roznava, every town has a cave. James Thomson has seen some of them, and in this episode of our podcast he gives some practical tips about visiting a Slovak cave. Once you make it to the southeast, do not skip the visit to some above-ground sights, notably the Betliar mansion and the Krasna Horka castle (closed for reconstruction since 2012, but about to be opened), and the Jasov monastery.  https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20060073/exploring-slovakias-caverns-and-caves.html",
