  "description": "<p>Garlic is by far one of my favorite crops to grow.  It's easy to plant, easy to grow, requires almost no maintenance, and adds flavor to every dish.  In today's episode, I walk you through my garlic growing process.  I explain the difference between softneck and hardneck, what to look for when buying garlic seeds, how to harvest it, and some simple uses in the kitchen.  Listen today to find out how to add a serious punch to your cooking with minimal effort.  In all seriousness, you'll forget that you even planted garlic until it's almost ready to harvest in the spring.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Marketplace as our July sponsor!
