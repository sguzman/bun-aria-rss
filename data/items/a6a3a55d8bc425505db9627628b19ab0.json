Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined by actor, writer, director (and co-creator of Netflix’s Russian Doll) - it’s LESLYE HEADLAND!</p><br><p>\"Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the moooooorning comes…\"</p><br><p>So did you do your homework as set for you last week, hmmm? You had ONE JOB! As easy one, if you have a Netflix subscription - yes that one job was to watch Russian Doll, so hopefully that was an achievable task and was taken care of! If so, you will have of course become a fast fan, and you will thoroughly enjoy Brett and Leslye going right into it - a proper treasure trove of trivia for you, going into the logistics, casting, music (yes THAT song), the whole deal. It’s fascinating even if you haven’t seen it though - you’ll get a kick out of it for sure! On top of that, the two go in on how Leslye is open to her creations being interpreted however they may (unless it’s wrong), her dreams of directing a Bond movie, toxic femininity, being put in her feelings by one film in particular, how she loves musicals (apart from one - you’ll hear), how key moments in her life seemed to be centred around film, sexy vs sexist, her early films and her family’s new year’s film traditions! ALSO - treat yourself to the Patreon only moments for this week only, as Brett loved them so much he decided to give you a taste for free…</p><br><p><strong><em>LINKS FOR THIS EPISODE:</em></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeslyeHeadland\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LESLYE on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcKoAMGGvY\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RUSSIAN DOLL on NETFLIX!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2853516/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LESLYE on IMDB!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RussianDoll\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RUSSIAN DOLL on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
