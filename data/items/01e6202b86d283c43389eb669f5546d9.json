  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 5/28/19",
  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, there's a groundswell for the defense of our freedom of the press, but the media does not relent and is now smearing President Trump for agreeing with an insult lobbed at former Vice president Joe Biden by North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. Of course, the media seized on the opportunity to rehash their propagandistic narrative that Trump typically sides with dictators. Yet they turn a blind eye to our military posture on North Korea which has more strength now than it ever has surrounding the Korean peninsula and not a single word about our military might in that region or our sanctions on them. When former President Obama told the Oligarchs to wait until after the election when he could be more flexible or when he ignored Vladimir Putin's annexation of Ukraine; was he considered a dictator-loving fascist? Did the media say that Obama had a thing for autocrats when he quietly sent pallets of cash to the Iranians? Who's been tougher on North Korea, Syria, China, and Cuba - Trump or Obama? Then, Clarence Thomas is a tremendous justice who isn't afraid to adhere to the Constitution. Thomas wrote a moving dissent on abortion, what he described as modern-day eugenics, discrimination, and rights. Later, Michael Wolff puts more lies out in the media about Trump and the Mueller report.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
