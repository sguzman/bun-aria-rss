  "itunes:summary": "Professional wrestling occupies a strange place in the pop culture ether, walking a line between sport and theatricality unlike any other form of entertainment. Its appeal lies in its use of athleticism and realism to tell entirely fictional stories of good versus evil and the just versus the corrupt in a tradition of live performance that goes back well over a century; one that has existed in every continent on the planet, barring the Antarctic.\n\nAnd for nearly five decades the spectacle that is professional wrestling has been defined by a single undisputed king - the brainchild of one Vincent Kennedy McMahon: World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nIn fact, for many the WWE is shorthand for the entire industry of “sports entertainment”, as it has defined the major trends and tropes of professional wrestling since the company’s inception and has taken the industry from a series of localized, territorial travelling circus shows to being a global phenomenon that intersects with nearly all forms of entertainment. The WWE is a publicly traded company that is worth billions, and has spawned its own movie studio, network and publishing house alongside countless action figures, video games and hours of television.\n\nAnd while Mr. McMahon would be the first to tell you that the WWE is just entertainment, it also just so happens to wear its politics on its sleeve.\nFrom the constant use of racial stereotypes through the decades to the contemporary manifestation of anti-liberal storylines, the WWE is hardly an apolitical entity of entertainment, but is a discursive system that constructs and reifies specific forms of identity as good versus evil, and just versus corrupt.\n\nAnd when one considers the personal politics of Vince McMahon, the man behind the WWE, we cannot help but consider the ways in which the politics of that man translate into the product itself and seek to shape and socialize the generations that watch every week.\n\nOn this week's episode of the Carleton University Political Science Podcast, we talk to Paolo Gentile to discuss these issues and more. Paolo is a PhD student with the Department of Political Science here at Carleton University, specializing in political theory and the politics of social media.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CU_PoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
