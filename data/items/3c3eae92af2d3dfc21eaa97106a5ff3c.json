  "description": "\"The most dangerous place for black people to live is in white people’s imaginations.\" That idea has allowed D.L. Hughley to organize a lot of his thoughts on what we're dealing with as a country, and he believes what we're really doing is fighting fear. D.L. tells Marc about his experiences growing up in South Central Los Angeles, getting out before he got lost, and building himself up through comedy. They also talk about two of D.L.'s influences, Robin Harris and Bernie Mac, his tours, his specials, his TV and radio shows, and Kanye. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2UtdM2mvBQesTqGTyiKn8w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls, 1 Keith on Spotify</a>, <a href=\"loopjewelry.com/pages/wtf%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loop Jewelry</a>, <a href=\"http://simplisafe.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SimpliSafe</a>, and <a href=\"http://getquip.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quip</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
