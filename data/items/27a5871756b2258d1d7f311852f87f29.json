  "description": "<p>Another exciting interview is coming your way today as we chat with Australian bobsleigh pilot Ashleigh Warner about her amazing career and how she is tracking ahead of the upcoming Beijing Olympics. We learn from Ash the unique way she got into the sport of bobsleigh and just how close she was to making the Olympics in another sport. We also learn more about the transition from being a brakewoman to a driver and how that has helped her driving in the sport, which types of tracks she prefers as well as just how the disappointment of being cut from the PyeongChang Olympics at the last moment has spurred her on towards her goal of 2022. We also learn which fellow Australian athlete she’d like to swap places with for a day and discover what her dad might say about her on Channel 7 next year should she come away with an Olympic medal. It’s one fun chat that you definitely won’t want to miss!</p>",
