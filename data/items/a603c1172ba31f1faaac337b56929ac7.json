  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scott&nbsp;Galloway</a> (https://www.profgalloway.com/) is a Professor at the NYU Stern School of Business where he was named “One of the World’s 50 Best Business School Professors” by Poets & Quants in 2012. He is the founder of Red Envelope, Prophet Brand Strategy, and L2 Inc., and has served on the boards of directors of Eddie Bauer, The New York Times Company, Urban Outfitters, and UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

In today's conversation, we go deep into Galloway's surprising \"origin story,\" how the fierce devotion of a single mom and an education system that opened its arms despite \"questionable\" credentials made possible so much. And, we explore how the changing face of today's society, education, and economy calls us to reexamine how we define and pursue success in all parts of life.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
