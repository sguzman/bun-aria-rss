    "media:description": "When I was reading through Section 1.5 on the Homotopy Type Theory book, I was initially very confused as to what was going one, particularly regarding the uniqueness principle. I don't go into detail about the constructions they provide in the chapter, but hopefully this will be a helpful overview of what is going on intuitively.\n\n--- Credits ---\n3b1b's animation library \"manim\": https://github.com/3b1b/manim\nHomotopy Type Theory Book: https://homotopytypetheory.org/\nMore detailed account of product type from nLab: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/product+type",
