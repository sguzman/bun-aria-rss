  "description": "<p>This is it. I never thought that this podcast would be a vehicle for such open and inspiring discussion, but here we are. Buddy Nielsen who is the vocalist for Senses Fail who for many years, was arguably one of the largest bands in the mid-aughts comes on the show to discuss his struggles. He opens up about his addictions, sexuality and the self-destructive behavior he inflicted on himself for years. He's never discussed these issues in a public form and it's incredible to hear the stories as well as the process of moving past that season in his life. I am extremely proud to bring this compelling conversation to you and thanks again to Buddy for wanting to share his story. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
