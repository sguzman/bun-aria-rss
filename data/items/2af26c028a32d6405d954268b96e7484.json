The amount of emails we receive has multiplied exponentially, and as a result many of them have gotten pushed aside as an episode had run behind schedule as they do from time to time. Let's face it, we are windbags at times!So this week we will address your questions, and give you the answer you seek, or maybe don't want to hear. All that and more on this week's The Cigar Authority, filmed live on location in Salem, New Hampshire before a live studio audience. ﻿",
