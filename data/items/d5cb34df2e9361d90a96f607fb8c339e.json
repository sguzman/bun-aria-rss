  "description": "The \"golden age of radio drama\" may have been a stellar period for storytelling -- but the stories weren't all golden bright. Sci-fi and horror radio dramas explored deep anxieties people felt from the Depression through the Cold War, and set the stage for later stories that couldn't be told yet without special effects. Eric Molinsky of the podcast Imaginary Worlds co-hosts this episode as we hear from historians like Neil Verma and Richard J. Hand, and radio drama veterans like Dirk Maggs and Richard Toscan. Plus Emory Braswell recalls the day he thought Martians invaded New Jersey.  \n20K is made out of the studios of Defacto Sound and hosted by Dallas Taylor. \nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/theaterforthemind\nLearn more about your ad choices.
