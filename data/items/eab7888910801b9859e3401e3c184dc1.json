  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino of NRATV fills in for Mark. The Democrats are testing to see what they can get away with on down ballot elections while distracting us with recounts. While Rick Scott’s victory was confirmed, Democrats made 77,000 ballots magically appear in the race for Agriculture Commission to steal the seat. The race was fleeced from right under our noses, and nobody is talking about it because we’re so focused on what’s going on at the top of the ballot. Also, there’s evidence to suggest that the Trump team was being spied on much earlier than 2016. On top of that, there is talk of exculpatory evidence that proves President Trump is innocent of collusion. This is turning out to be an entrapment operation, not a collusion scandal.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
