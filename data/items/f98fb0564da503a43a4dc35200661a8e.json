  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to further analyze Super Bowl 54. The guys recognize that Chiefs-49ers ultimately lacked defining moments but select the play that is most likely to be remembered (7:40). Then, they discuss storylines and stats that deserve more attention following Kansas City's comeback championship victory over San Francisco (12:30). Will, Ryan and John mention Frank Clark calling out Jimmy Garoppolo, some absurd Patrick Mahomes nuggets, Andy Reid's celebration, Eric Bienemy's time-travel play call, the first family of 4th down and more. Next, it looks like Tom Brady isn't going anywhere, but does that mean he's staying in New England (51:45)? Lastly, the guys recap NFL Honors and the 2020 Hall of Fame Class, both of which were announced over the weekend (59:00).\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
