  "description": "<p>Covering a lot of ground today! Going over the history of human opioid usage - the opium poppy is one helluva plant. What different types of opiates and opioids are out there? Why are we having a record number of opioid overdose deaths now when we've been using opiates going back at least as far as the ancient Sumerians? What changed in the 1980's to lay the ground work for the opioid epidemic we have today in the United States? What is Big Pharma's role in this epidemic? What are we doing to help millions struggling with a very, very powerful narcotic addiction? And what the Hell is Whipple Chill!?!  A lot to unpack today on an especially informative, drug! drug! drug! edition of Timesuck. <br /><br />The Bad Magic Productions charity of the month is IAVA - Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America- thanks to you we are able to give $15,800 to this very deserving cause. </p><p>IAVA serves and empowers the post-9/11 veterans' community.
