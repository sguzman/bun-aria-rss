  "description": "<p>Every other week throughout the summer, members of the Here’s The Thing staff are selecting their favorite interviews from the archives. This week, we revisit Alec’s conversations with two of the funniest comedians in the business – and coincidentally, two of the most popular episodes from our archives.  Chris Rock is known for his work on SNL, his stand up specials, the sitcom <em>Everybody Loves Chris</em> and films like <em>Madagascar </em>and <em>Grownups</em>.  In recent years, the comedian dove deeper into acting, including an acclaimed turn in the FX dark comedy <em>Fargo</em>.  In a conversation from 2011, Alec goes backstage after a performance of the play <em>The Mother F**ker With The Hat, </em>Rock’s Broadway debut. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld broke the mold with his sharp observational humor and a groundbreaking sitcom about “nothing,” over nine seasons of <em>Seinfeld</em>. He also produced and hosted 11 seasons of his unconventional talk show, <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee </em>and continues to tour standup.  In this conversation from 2013, the comedian discusses getting his start in standup, why he thinks <em>Seinfeld</em> was a success and the unique connection he feels to his audience.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
