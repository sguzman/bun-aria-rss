We’re chatting about books from writing teams, and sequels and classics that go down easy.</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are talking about making 2020 your best reading year yet. Does that mean more books? Maybe. But perhaps it means better books and more time to read them. What are your favorite tips for reading more or better?</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands: we’ve got a young adult selection perfect for February in more ways than one and a murder-y book that is cold as well as bone-chilling.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode.
