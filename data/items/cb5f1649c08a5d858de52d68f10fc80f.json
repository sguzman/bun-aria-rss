  "description": "I may have first seen Krista Moser’s work when I spotted her Hollow Star pattern, which is super clever. That lead me to her tutorials which are so complete you’ll feel like you are in class with her! I’m really excited to learn more about using 60-degree angles, these are Krista’s specialty\n----\nI’ve admired Janelle McKay’s bags for a long time and I’m excited to chat bag making with her today… and did you know she is also a quilter? We learn how to take our quilting fabrics to the next level in her amazing bag patterns. \n-----\nJen Daly is a regular contributor to American Patchwork’s family of magazine and the Moda Bakeshop. You might have even made one of her fun and clever projects. Jen’s designs look fantastic in both traditional and fun fabrics, so I want to learn how she does it!\n----\nJennifer Nevitt of MommySew is a fearless quilter taking on curves, tiny pieces and color combos that make you want to rush out to sew up her projects. Her quilt in the Dec 2017 issue of American Patchwork & quilting caught my eye, so it was time to chat!\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
