  "description": "<p>Yesterday, we brought you Part 1 of Steve Millis’ story. We explored how his family realized that he had disappeared, Steve’s life, and what we know about the evening he was last seen alive. Today, we will take a look at several people who were suspected of being involved in Steve’s disappearance. You will learn that everyone has secrets of their own, making it very difficult to tell who is hiding information about Steve and who is simply hiding their own secrets. Things become murky, and no one seems to be telling the whole truth about where they were and what they were doing when Steve Millis disappeared.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Steve Millis, please contact the Newaygo County Sheriff's Office at (231) 689-7303.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://acorn.tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acorn TV</a>- Try Acorn TV free for 30 days by going to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://acorn.tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Acorn.TV</a>&nbsp;and use our promo code&nbsp;<strong>vanished</strong>.
