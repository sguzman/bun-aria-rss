  "description": "<p>This week, in Fairfield, Ohio, a picturesque wedding, beside a river, ends in horror when a bridesmaid sees a severed leg, washed up on shore. The investigation of the legs uncovers more than everyone bargained for, when we find out where, and how the deceased spent their last moments.  The craziness that ensues is one for the books. Betrayals, befriending other murderers, and, of course... Satan! A roller coaster, from start to finish!!</p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out that no matter how well you plan your wedding, nothing is fool proof, that it seems impossible to sacrifice an owl, and that you can't trust anyone, including your murder partner!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
