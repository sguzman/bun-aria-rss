He’s not famous nor is he a world champion. And he’s the first to say he’s just not that talented. In most ways Luke is a normal bloke. An everyman who decided to face his debilitating battle with clinical depression through the lens of adventure and ultra-endurance sports.</p><p>Soccer obsessed as a young boy, from the get go Luke realized he lacked the God-given athletic gifts enjoyed by his teammates. Nonetheless, perseverance prevailed and Luke achieved his life-long dream of traveling the world as a professional footballer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that career was cut short by significant, chronic & persistent injuries. What followed was an unexpected yet quite severe bout with acute, clinical depression — a back hole of desperation that often left him bedridden and teetering on hopelessness.</p><p>To escape this prison, Luke dug deep. Through sheer force of will matched with equal parts faith, he compelled his mutinying body, mind and spirit to simply get up, get outside and begin exploring again — one step at a time.</p><p>Having never ran more than 10 kilometers at any one time, and with only six months to&nbsp;prepare, in 2012 Luke conquered the infamous <a href=\"http://www.marathondessables.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Marathon des Sables,</a> a 250 kilometer, six stage self-sufficient running race across the treacherous and unrelenting sand dunes of the Moroccan Sahara.</p><p>Since then he has competed in a variety of adventure races, including the <a href=\"http://everestultra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mt.
