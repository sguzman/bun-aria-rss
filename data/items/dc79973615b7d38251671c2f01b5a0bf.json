  "description": "<p>Dr. Weil has been working as a doctor and a leading man in the alternative medicine world since the 60s. He has many books on alternative medicine and lectures that are absolutely fascinating. Iâ€™ve been a fan of his work for many years. This conversation with Joe really allowed him to clearly outline his view on medicine and what is missing in todays medical world. Joe calls bullshit a few times too which is always a good time lol</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n",
