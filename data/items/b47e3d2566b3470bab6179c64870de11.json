    "media:description": "Because of the current situation I decided to create a data visualization video on the state of nuclear weapons throughout the world. I not only show the numbers of nuclear weapons but also some of the devices and their destructive power. Some of these tests and devices include:\n\n1945: It all started with the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico\n1949: The Soviet Union conducts its first nuclear test, RDS-1\n1952: The United States detonates the first hydrogen bomb, \"Ivy Mike\"\n1953: The Soviet Union detonates their first hydrogen bomb, RDS-6\n1954: Castle Bravo was a 15 megaton nuclear test by the US at Bikini Atoll\n1961: Soviets detonate a 50 megaton bomb, Tsar Bomba\n1962: The US conducts a nuclear weapons test in space, Starfish Prime\n1970: French military detonates hydrogen bomb in Licorne\n\nAfter the pandemic I expected the world to come together and work on all sorts of solutions to improve this planet, yet here we are on the brink of WW3.",
