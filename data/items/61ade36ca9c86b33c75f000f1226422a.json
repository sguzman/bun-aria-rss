  "description": "<p>Meet the Friedmans: Father Arnold, Mother Elaine, and kids David, Seth, and Jesse. They're all living the 'perfect' middle class life on Long Island in the 1980 until Arnold and Jesse are arrested and charged with truly horrific crimes. And guess what? Thanks to the family's love of camcorders and, weirdly, taping every second of their lives, we're treated to a front row seat as their lives completely fall apart. \n The question is, did  they do it? The police say yes, but many witnesses say otherwise. Come with us as we learn all about this strange family with their bizarre love of pre-jail piano parties, yelling at their mother, and VIDEO DIARIES! Ahhh, the 80s. </p>\n",
