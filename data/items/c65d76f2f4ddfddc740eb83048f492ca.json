    "media:description": "► Joy Division is one of the most iconic bands of all time, formed in 1976 Manchester. Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris were at the forefront of one of the most revolutionary music scenes ever, popularizing a new style. 1979's Unknown Pleasures and 1980's Closer have become essential albums for their innovation. Songs such as \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\", \"Disorder\" and \"She's Lost Control\" have been cemented in history as some of the most significant songs ever written. This is the story of Joy Division, a band that started off as punk, but quickly transcended that label, delving into new territory all together.\n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
