  "description": "<p>Dallas returns to the show to share what happen to him when he returned to his families property and how he ran into the dirty old man for the last time. Dallas will also be sharing his Native American culture and how he believes that Sasquatch is not the nephilim. This should be an interesting show as Dallas shares what Native Americans use to chant around a fire and where they came from. I ask that everyone give the show and Dallas a chance as it will be a fascinating conversation you will not forget. We will be discussing Sasquatch, giants and some Native American culture.</p>",
