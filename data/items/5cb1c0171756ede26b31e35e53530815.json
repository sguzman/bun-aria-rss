  "description": "Do we always know our own desire? How does it elude us? In her new book, Disorganisation & Sex (Divided Publishing, 2022), Jamieson Webster makes us think about the ways in which our deepest, truest desires can be unknown to us and offers thoughts about how we might get closer to knowing them. In our interview, we discuss her ideas on unconscious desire as well as the painful complexities of dealing with sexual abuse and the role of the body as an avenue towards greater self-knowledge. \nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
