  "description": "<p>Barren airports, anchored cruise ships, vacant hotels—it’s impossible to run a tourism business when international borders close and most of the world shelters in place. There is no doubt the pandemic has pushed the travel industry into a corner: one estimate suggests the industry will lose a trillion dollars in 2020 alone. How do you come back from that? For the time being, it feels like travelling for pleasure is a thing of the past, but the urge to leave home for a little while and explore something new is strong. And pent-up demand from locked-down, would-be tourists could flood the world again soon—but at what cost? What opportunities exist to rebuild a healthier, more sustainable industry?</p><p>Host Sonari Glinton explores how travel could change. Sound designer Shawn Cole takes his family on a staycation adventure and Brian Hazelton of Winnebago tells us it’s been a record sales year. Meanwhile, Jessica Nabongo, the first Black woman to travel to every country in the world, is stuck at home, and she questions why she travels. In Barbados, Valerie Workman mourns the loss of an industry her island nation is nearly wholly dependent on, but also welcomes the break from the crowds. Traveler and writer Pico Iyer believes travel is about much more than visiting a new place—he says it’s fundamental to being human. And journalist Elizabeth Becker believes it’s time to rethink how we travel when we inevitably do so again.</p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
