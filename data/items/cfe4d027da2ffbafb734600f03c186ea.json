  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Pat going to war with Miami Dolphins twitter over questioning whether or not the Dolphins might finish 3rd or 4th in the AFC East, and what we need to remember betting wise as we approach the start of the NFL season, which teams are going to be reliable over the course of the first four weeks, and a look at this weekend's college football slate starting with Ohio State @ Minnesota tonight. Joining the program for the NFL Wrap-Around is NFL Network Insider, and friend of the show Ian Rapoport to chat about the NFL season approaching, the flooding in New York, Packers vs. Saints being played in Jacksonville, how much we'll see Trey Lance at QB the start of the season, if the Steelers are going to get TJ Watt's deal done before the start of the season, and much more (27:51-45:37). Next, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is star of the UNTOLD: Crime & Penalties, former President/GM of the Dansbury Trashers, AJ Galante, to chat about the Netflix documentary and how everything has kind of been a whirlwind in the aftermath of it, his birthday party with some of the biggest stars in the history of the WWE in attendance, how his dad is doing, and much more about his life growing up and running the team in an incredible conversation (1:02:43-1:21:28). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is friend of the program, a man who left ESPN and now has 100 jobs, 9x MMA Journalist of the Year, Ariel Helwani. Pat, Ariel, and AJ chat about his departure from ESPN, how things are going now, working the Jake Paul Tyron Woodley fight and how it was one of the biggest moments of his career, having Drake reach out to him, what's next, and much much more (1:22:37-1:52:35).
