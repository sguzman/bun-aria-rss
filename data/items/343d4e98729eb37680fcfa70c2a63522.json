  "description": "Netflix's new ad-supported tier excludes a few movies and TV shows. Here's a list of them that aren't available in the Basic with Ads $7 subscription plan.",
  "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/best-movies-on-netflix/\">Netflix</a> is finally rolling out an <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/netflix-advertising-plan-pricing/\">ad-supported tier</a>. This new tier, which costs $7 a month, is designed to curb concerns that the ad-free version of the streamer was too expensive. It first rolled out on November 3, and now that it&#8217;s available, many potential subscribers are curious about all the ways it&#8217;s different from the long-running ad-free version of the service. The main difference, obviously, is that all of the content has ads. Almost as important, though, is all the stuff that isn&#8217;t currently available on the ad-free version.</p>\n<p>No comprehensive list of these titles has been released yet, but based on a perusal from <em><a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflixs-ad-plan-titles-not-available-missing-1235422524/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> </em>as well as other available information, it seems that there are a fair number of high-profile TV shows and movies that won&#8217;t be available at the ad-supported tier. Some estimates suggest that as much as 10% of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/best-shows-on-netflix/\">Netflix&#8217;s existing content</a> won&#8217;t be available at the ad-supported tier, although Netflix has said that they&#8217;re hoping that number will decrease as the new tier becomes more established. A “limited number of movies and TV shows won’t be available due to licensing restrictions, and we’re going to be working on reducing that over time,&#8221; Netflix COO Greg Peters explained. Without further ado, here&#8217;s the list we know of thus far:</p>\n<h2>TV Shows:</h2>\n<p><em>Arrested Development</em><br />\n<em>House of Cards</em><br />\n<em>Peaky Blinders</em><br />\n<em>New Girl</em><br />\n<em>The Magicians</em><br />\n<em>The Last Kingdom</em><br />\n<em>The Sinner</em><br />\n<em>Good Girls<br />\nJurassic World: Camp Cretaceous<br />\n</em><em>She-Ra and the Princess of Power<br />\nAll Hail King Julien<br />\n</em><em>Dawn of the Croods<br />\nThe Good Place</em><br />\n<em>Knight Rider</em><br />\n<em>Queen of the South</em><br />\n<em>Marlon</em><br />\n<em>Friday Night Lights<br />\n</em><em>Ash vs. Evil Dead<br />\n</em><em>Wynonna Earp<br />\nStargate: SG1<br />\n</em><em>Van Helsing<br />\nUncoupled</em></p>\n<h2>Movies:</h2>\n<p><em>Oblivion</em><br />\n<em>Man on a Ledge</em><br />\n<em>Robin Hood</em><br />\n<em>Steve Jobs</em><br />\n<em>The Butler</em><br />\n<em>Skyfall</em><br />\n<em>Casino Royale<br />\n</em><em>Vampires vs. The Bronx<br />\nUncharted<br />\nPineapple Express<br />\nThe Zookeeper&#8217;s Wife<br />\nPaddington<br />\nNocturnal Animals<br />\nSorry to Bother You<br />\nA Knight&#8217;s Tale<br />\n</em><em>Labyrinth<br />\n</em><em>Hell or High Water<br />\nThe Hurt Locker<br />\n</em><em>If Beale Street Could Talk<br />\nWon&#8217;t You Be My Neighbor<br />\nCrimson Peak<br />\nIt Follows<br />\nThe Green Inferno<br />\n</em><em>Raw<br />\nResident Evil<br />\nResident Evil: Retribution<br />\nResident Evil: Apocalypse<br />\nUmma<br />\n</em><em>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark<br />\n</em><em>Quantum of Solace</em><br />\n<em>28 Days</em><br />\n<em>Rambo</em><br />\n<em>Darkest House</em><br />\n<em>Made of Honor</em><br />\n<em>The Imitation Game</em><br />\n<em>Wanted</em><br />\n<em>Legend</em><br />\n<em>Blue Jasmine</em><br />\n<em>A Monster Calls</em><br />\n<em>Sing 2</em><br />\n<em>Morbius</em><br />\n<em>Road House</em><br />\n<em>The Mist</em><br />\n<em>A Good Old Fashioned Orgy</em><br />\n<em>Phantom Thread</em><br />\n<em>Contraband</em><br />\n<em>Tully</em><br />\n<em>Vice</em><br />\n<em>The Hateful Eight</em><br />\n<em>The Bad Guys</em></p>\n<p>There are far more movies than shows excluded from the ad-supported tier, which is likely because a larger share of Netflix&#8217;s TV shows is originals, whereas they still have a fairly healthy library of movies that were produced by other studios. This list of movies features three of <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/10-best-james-bond-movies-ranked/\">Daniel Craig&#8217;s James Bond movies</a>, a number of Oscar nominees and winners, and several other recent titles that are likely to be regarded as classics in the near future.</p>\n<p>There are also<a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/best-horror-movies-on-netflix/\"> quite a few horror and action titles</a> that aren&#8217;t available in the ad-supported tier. Like Netflix more generally, most of the movies that won&#8217;t be in the ad-supported tier skew more recent, and it still leaves plenty of movies worth watching on the platform. Given that this new tier is a full 50% cheaper than the ad-free tier, it may be worth sacrificing a few titles for.</p>\n",
