  "description": "<p>MONEY IS A GREAT SERVANT BUT A BAD MASTER. Money can get a bad rap. You hear stories of people who worked so hard to get it, and it left them feeling unhappy. Some people even call it the root of all evil. But what if you used money as a tool for happiness? If you spend it wisely, it can help you have better health, better relationships, and more time for the things that fill you up. Instead of making money the problem, make it work for you. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Gretchen Rubin where she talked about her research on happiness and money. She says that happiness, like money, should be something we observe in the good times and the bad. Learn how to improve your relationship with happiness in Episode 879.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nWhy you need to think about happiness in the good times and the bad (2:00)<br />\nHow money relates to happiness  (03:00)<br />\nThe difference between buying things and experiences (3:30)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/879 and follow at http://www.instagram.com/879</p>\n",
