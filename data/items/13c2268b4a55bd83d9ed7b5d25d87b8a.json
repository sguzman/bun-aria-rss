  "description": "Three states (Arizona, Louisiana, and Missouri) have filed a federal lawsuit against the Biden Administration (CDC, HHS, DHS) over their attempt to rescind Title 42 and the serious consequences it will have for the growing crisis at our southern border. Title 42 was a pandemic-era border policy that was put in place by the Trump Administration in March 2020 – right when the COVID-19 situation broke out. It was the initial response that allows border patrol agents to turn back migrants at our southern border on the grounds that they might bring COVID-19 into the United States. Jay and the rest of the <em>Sekulow</em> team discuss the hypocrisy of the Biden Administration for attempting to rescind this policy at the worst possible time as there are still pandemic restrictions throughout our own country. Why would we be lifting any restrictions at the border? ACLJ Senior Advisor for National Security and Foreign Policy Ric Grenell also joins the broadcast. This and more today on <em>Sekulow</em>.",
