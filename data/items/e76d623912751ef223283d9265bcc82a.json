  "description": "<p>This week, Alice welcomes special guest Jo McCarthy to the podcast. Jo is a small shop mentor who helps creative professionals build their e-commerce businesses and in this episode, she shares her expertise on how to successfully market your work online. Alice and Jo discuss blocks to selling (and how to overcome them) and also discuss the importance of taking small steps rather than trying to make giant leaps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jo suggests reframing the idea of productivity, and viewing your business in terms of capacity rather than time. She also explains why she she uses a 'can do' list rather than a 'to do' list. Perhaps most importantly, Alice and Jo discuss the importance of showing up and starting to sell even thought everything is not yet perfect. If you've been feeling unsure about selling online, this episode should make you feel much more comfortable about just getting out there and \"evolving in public.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Find Jo on Instagram at &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jo_at_firain/?hl=en\">@jo_at_firain</a><br>\nAnd her website <a href=\"https://www.firain.com/\">www.firain.com</a></p>\n<p>Seth Godin blog post: <a href=\"https://seths.blog/2016/03/show-your-work/\"><u>https://seths.blog/2016/03/show-your-work/</u></a></p>\n<p>Alice's Time to Shine course:<a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\">www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
