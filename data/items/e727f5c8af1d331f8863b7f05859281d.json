  "description": "<p>It's late August and that can only mean one thing: Back To School! In this this special episode, Vanessa and Jonah recall their visceral memories from that time which include picking out the perfect school supplies, shopping for the previous year's hottest fashions at Marshalls, and the oh so important task of planning an outfit for the first day of school. We also get deep into our former high school's current website on our new segment \"Congratulations, You Played Yourself\" and make a compelling argument for why Jonah should be included in the \"notable alumni\" section alongside Vanessa, former HDWGW guest JD Samson (Le Tigre) and, amazingly, the original bassist for Filter who would probably tell Jonah, \"Hey man, nice shot\" when it comes to his chances for inclusion. We also discuss how wild it is that high school class presidents have a lifetime appointment and our dad chimes in with his own personal history when it comes to the McDonald's Snack Wrap and its enduring influence on the fast food franchise. If you DON'T listen to this episode, well, then congratulations, you played yourself (meaning you should listen).</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
