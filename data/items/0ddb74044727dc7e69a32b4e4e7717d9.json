  "description": "<p>Jared Carrabis and his cell phone join today's episode of the Kirk Minihane Show. Jared, it becomes clear, has fallen head over heels for an Internet influencer -- a 25-year-old bombshell who has left him barely able to concentrate on anything else, even as he awaits news of the Red Sox's hunt for a new manager. Kirk barely avoids a feud with Lights Camera Pod leader Jeff D. Lowe. Jared gives his take on the pitched presidential election roiling the country. Big Cat briefly appears to check in on Jared's love life. Kirk offers a glimpse at the new secret project he's been working on, prompting Jared to volunteer that he, too, has some secret projects up his sleeve.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
