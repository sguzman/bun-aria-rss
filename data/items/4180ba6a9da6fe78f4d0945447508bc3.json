When it comes to movie-based games, you’d think The Nerd covered them all by now, but here’s another one based on the Bruce Willis film, Hudson Hawk on NES. The movie is a bit of a mixed bag, so lets see what kind of \"bag' the game is! Released by Sony Imagesoft in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, you play as the titular Hudson Hawk (Willis), the world's greatest thief, who is forced to steal three of Da Vinci's precious artifacts by the Mario Brothers Mafia. The movie also starred Danny Aiello, Andie MacDowell, Richard E. Grant, and Sandra Bernhard.\n\nWritten and Directed by James Rolfe:\nhttps://twitter.com/cinemassacre\n\nFilmed and Edited by Kieran Fallon, check out their Twitch stream:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/kieeeeern\n\nFor everything else Cinemassacre:\nhttps://cinemassacre.com/\n\n#AngryVideoGameNerd #HudsonHawk #AVGN204 #NES #Cinemassacre",
