  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is back from his semi-vacation in Maine to address a busy week in the Barstool world. First, Minihane is anti-union and it has nothing to do with his fat contract and swollen bank account. This is about principle. The fracas between the Union Buster formerly known as Davey Mouse and AOC has Minihane making a bold prediction: Dave Portnoy will one day be the Commander-in-Chief. Minihane makes two big show announcements, Blind Mike inches closer to a contract, and a sports radio host from Colorado decides to go to war with the Minifans. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
