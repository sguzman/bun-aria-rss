  "description": "<p>A Law Enforcement Officer writes “Hey Wes, I will make this as short as possible. I have a video form a trail cam.</p> <p>The video is not conclusive as it doesn’t show the face. Here is the history of the video. I am a 20+ year Law Enforcement Officer, three of which were done as a Game Warden. I received this video from a collage of mine. He was assigned to a federal task force working gorilla grown Marijuana.</p> <p>This group would go into remote areas of Northern California and set trail cams in an attempt to catch the growers on film.. This particular trail cam was 27 miles back in the Sequoia National Forest, not accessible by vehicles only ATV then foot. He retrieved the trail cam and found the attached video. He did not know what to do with it as he was afraid of repercussions etc. I openly speak about the subject and my beliefs and another officer referred him to me and he provided me the video. I only ask we discuss what to release about the video before sharing if you decide to.</p> <p>I also have experienced events, i.e. tree knocks, footsteps, and extreme fear for unexplained reason. I have also found a few footprints.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I spoke to the Law Enforcement Officer today and he said that trail cam appeared to be ripped off of the tree and this creature had buried it in leaves. He said the cameras are in such remote locations that they are only set to record 5-10 clips so that guys do not have to go out constantly to replace SD cards. They setup the cameras to bust drug trafficking.</p> <p>The officer did not make any claims as to what it is but he served as a game warden for many years and says “it is not a bear... this thing ripped the trail cam off of the tree and started putting leaves over it.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>To see the trail cam video, visit the episode page on our website <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep246-law-enforcement-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p>",
