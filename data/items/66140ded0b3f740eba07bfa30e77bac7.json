Do Jewish Zionists control the Freemason illuminati? Who are the Trilateralists? What is the Bilderberg group? What the fuck do they have to do with the illuminati? Why do I keep saying illuminati instead of Freemason? Am I the illuminati? SO MANY QUESTIONS on today’s whackadoodle episode of Timesuck. </p>\n<p>Trouble with the APP or new website?
