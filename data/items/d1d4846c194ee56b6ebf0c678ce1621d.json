  "description": "U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff thinks increased competition has had an impact on law firms, for the worse.\n\n“It is to the point that the professional ethics and the professional responsibilities of the firms have been affected,” Rakoff told Big Law Business, explaining that firms, in order to keep clients, are willing to endorse risky behavior.\n\nIn the podcast interview with Big Law Business’s Casey Sullivan, Rakoff laid out his concerns about how attorneys in his courtroom have placated clients, to the detriment of their legal judgment, in order to retain business.\n\nThis, he said, has resulted in over aggressive legal tactics that undermine the credibility of lawyers.\n\nIn the podcast, Rakoff speaks about the business of law, his career path, his involvement in an influential insider trading ruling, as well as his biggest pet peeves of lawyers who appear before him in court. \n\nInterview begins at 4:16. \n\nBig Law Business \nhttps://bol.bna.com/\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes\nitunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-l…d1074067483?mt=2\n\nSponsored by  \n\nDMX \nhttp://www.epiqsystems.com/DMX\n\nBloomberg Law \nwww.bna.com/bloomberglaw?promocode=BLBBLAW",
