  "description": "Miss Kay gave Uncle Si a jacket he LOVED, but she may have neglected to mention why his name was really on it. Si has a new way to ride to the deer stand — powered by Stone. Si finally puts his big miss behind him with two more deer, and BK gets excited — in her own way — when she kills her first mallard drake. Stone demonstrates why Si's not allowed to blow a duck call when they hunt. Si believes the pristine mud of North Arkansas may have healing properties. John-David brings us a question from a sorority sister. And the boys weigh in on getting baptized a second time.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
