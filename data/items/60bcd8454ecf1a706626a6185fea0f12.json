  "description": "We kick off our miniseries on Amazon with a discussion with Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store, the book about Amazon. Stone gives us his perspective on the pending HQ2 decision, Amazon's continual growth, and what makes it all work (hint: it rhymes with Leff Tezos). It helps us get at two of our key questions about the company: is their key man risk for Amazon, and is the company at risk of being too big to fail? We discuss.",
