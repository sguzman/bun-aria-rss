  "description": "<p>This week, in McIntosh, Florida, a young couple has trouble as they try to navigate life. These troubles get much more complicated when things turn into a love triangle... then a square... then... the whole thing is just out of control, until a plot emerges against one of the triangle members that ends in a horrific murder, and a messy cover up. In court, precedents are set, and things devolve into just as much of a mess as everything else is in this story!! Along the way, we find out that sometimes it's bad to take a step back in time, that having two kids by age 18 might not be best career decision, and that in order to commit murder, you should really have some clue of what's going to happen next!! </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Small Town Murder!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Crime in Sports</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/smalltownpod\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/smalltownpod</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/MurderSmall\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
