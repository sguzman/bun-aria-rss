More accurately, we can look to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis for the cause of these discomforts. If you have chronic stress, your adrenals get beat up, and your energy plummets and it becomes difficult to manage your life. You could feel tired and wired, all at the same time. All these are clues that you could have an imbalance of your HPA axis.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the signs of HPA axis dysfunction and how to support your HPA axis to reverse burnout. They also share patient cases that they have treated.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the<em> Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine</em>. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the<em> Dr. Oz </em>show and in a variety of publications and media including <em>Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine</em>, and <em>Experience Life</em>.
