  "description": "<p>D-Day on 6 June 1944 saw the largest amphibious landing in history take place as more than 150,000 allied troops stormed five assault beaches in Normandy, attempting to break through Hitler's Atlantic Wall. ⁠One of the unsung heroes of that operation were the landing craft and their crews. Without whom there could have been no initial landing and that beachhead that created could not have been maintained. Landing Craft Tank were the backbone of the operation to put the Allies back on continental Europe. They brought thousands of tanks, vehicles and tons of supplies ashore on the beaches and allowing the men fighting inland to continue to push forward against stiff German resistance. In this episode of the podcast, Dan speaks with historian Stephen Fisher about his exciting new project which has led to the identification of two Landing Craft Tank that were sunk in Poole Harbour after the war as a breakwater. They discuss the role of these ships, their development, the often perilous conditions they faced in The Channel and how Stephen came to discover the identities of these vessels.&nbsp;</p><br><p>For more D-day content, such as the new film <a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/videos/d-day-secrets-of-the-solent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>D-Day: Secrets of the Solent</em></a>, subscribe to <a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">historyhit.tv</a>.
