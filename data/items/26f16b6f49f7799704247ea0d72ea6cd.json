  "description": "<p>Phil and Skye sit down with N.T. Wright for a fun and fascinating conversation with the world-renowned author and theologian.  What does Wright think of the North American church?  Why do modern gender issues remind him of ancient Gnosticism?  Why is Phil singing show tunes to a famous theologian?  What would Wright put on a billboard if he could require everyone to read one message?  What is it he think kids Bibles get wrong that makes him want to write his own?  All this and more!  Plus… Bladerunner 2049 makes Phil think deep thoughts.  And dogs are people too.  Or maybe not.</p>",
