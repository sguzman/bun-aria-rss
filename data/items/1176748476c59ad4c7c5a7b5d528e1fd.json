  "description": "Today we talk about the powder bath, our favorite room in the house where people can play all their cards and take some risks because you won't be in there for long. Choose wallpaper for this room like you are choosing art. You should  feel excited and have an emotional connection with it. We prefer large organic prints to loosen up the space and lose the hard corners amongst the leaves or foliage.  Choose a beautiful pedestal sink, especially if you're going to be doing your walls, let your sink be a silhouette against your wallpaper and choose a mirror with a nice frame to compliment your wall and sink. This is your chance to go wild because there are no other mirrors, so you can test some new things out. For lighting, use something magical like a small pendant or chandelier and sconces to flank the mirror. You can fit a little etagere in almost any powder bath where you can put small paintings, candles, or other storytelling articles. It’s also a nice place to put small toiletries or trinkets your guests can use to freshen up. Get creative with your hand towel rack, hook, or ring.  Candles, diffusers, and other scents can really improve this small space where smells will stick around longer. The door should match the space, and the only white things should be your toilet, and maybe your sink. This is one place where you are up close and can really admire that art, so we recommend getting art which people can enjoy.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />How to pull off a large print in a powder room 2:32<br />Can you mix chrome and brass? 4:38<br />How to improve your mirror 11:21<br />Etagere 18:13<br />Hand towels 22:20 <br />Places to find specialty hardware for powder bath 24:42<br />Art 30:50<br /><br />“If you have a crazy wallpaper and there’s a lot going on, you can leave it if you’re like ‘Nope, I don’t want any art on that,’ you can leave it. That’s the art story. But a lot of times we’ll take a three dimensional object--a butterfly, a shell, something, and we’ll have that framed so you have a center of focus. Usually above the potty where there’s just a wall with blank wallpaper, wild wallpaper, and you’re gonna frame that so you have some focus and a lot of white matte around that object so you can focus in on it. It’s not complicated art, but on top of complicated wallpaper you’re simplifying.” 31:11<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
