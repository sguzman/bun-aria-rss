  "description": "Our audiobook this week is I’M YOURS, BABY by Fiona Davenport! \n\nNarrated by Anastasia Watley & Jason Carpenter\n\nGuy Rule: Don’t knock a girl up and disappear for a year.\n\nWeston Davis was a jaded CIA operative who didn’t believe in love at first sight—until the moment he laid eyes on Aspen Kennedy and knew she was meant to be his. With an undercover operation only days away, the timing was horrible. But he didn’t let it get in the way of spending an explosive weekend with her before he has to leave.\n\nAspen believed Weston when he told her he’d be back. Twelve months, a positive pregnancy test, and countless emails later, she’s given up hope on ever hearing from him again. She’s left alone to raise their baby, a treasured gift from the man who’d stolen her heart and smashed it to pieces.\n\nWhen Weston comes storming back into her life, he has a new mission: claim his family, find the person who’d almost caused him to lose them, and make them pay.\n\nYeah Baby Series by Fiona Davenport (Kindle Unlimited): https://amzn.to/2L6W13w\n\nBought by the Billionaire Series: https://amzn.to/2xVSL3J\n\n$25 Amazon GC GIVEAWAY! http://readmeromance.com/books/aljackson/\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
