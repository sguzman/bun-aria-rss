We&#8217;ve been listening to comments from our existing premium customers and one of the most common requests is for more help and advice for learning languages. We&#8217;ve decided therefore to create a &#8216;club&#8217; around this. Membership to the club will last 12 months and during this time members will receive the following benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Weekly podcasts</strong> in a brand new &#8220;how to learn a language&#8221; series featuring tips, tricks and advice on learning language. We&#8217;ll also be including interviews with language learners from all walks of life who will share their learning tips. The course will feature tips for beginners and for experienced learners and we&#8217;re sure that everyone will be able to benefit from this course, regardless of the language they are learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced prices</strong> on all our content. Members will have access to a special discount rate for any purchases made within the membership period. At certain times we&#8217;ll also offer special discounts on certain products.</li>\n<li><strong>Refer-a-friend refunds</strong>. Members of the Radio Lingua club will be able to introduce a friend to Radio Lingua courses at a discounted rate, and receive an affiliate payment. So if you&#8217;re a Coffee Break Spanish Season Pass holder and you introduce your friend to the show and they purchase the show, you&#8217;ll receive a special payment from us to say thanks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Radio Lingua Club will involve a monthly payment of just £4.00 GBP. Alternatively you can purchase a twelve-month subscription for £36. The club will launch on January 1st 2010 with our first weekly language-learning tips podcast. We&#8217;re offering a special early-bird purchase offer where you can get 25% off the twelve-month subscription: for just £27 you will get access to a full year&#8217;s worth of podcasts, you&#8217;ll access the reduced prices throughout 2010, and you will be able to use the refer-a-friend refund too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that the Radio Lingua Club is no longer available, as of July 2011. </strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4429\" title=\"christmas-box3\" src=\"https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box3.jpg\" alt=\"christmas-box3\" width=\"400\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box3.jpg 400w, https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box3-300x60.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p>If 2009 has been a big year for Radio Lingua, we&#8217;re really excited about what&#8217;s coming in 2010! Our <em>Coffee Break French</em> listeners will be aware that we&#8217;re moving into lessons 71-80 of <em>Coffee Break French</em>, and we&#8217;re often asked about &#8220;what happens when <em>Coffee Break French</em> finishes?&#8221; Well, we&#8217;re busy planning new content for intermediate learners at the moment, and we&#8217;re sure that everyone will enjoy what will come after our existing course content.</p>\n<p>This year we introduced our first experimental video show &#8211; <em>Walk, Talk and Learn French</em>. We were overwhelmed at the response to <em>Walk, Talk and Learn</em>, but as a small company we&#8217;ve been limited in terms of the time required to produce more shows. Fans of the show will be delighted to know that we&#8217;ve filmed a second series and are working on the content at the moment, ready for launch early in 2010.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re a couple of days away from releasing the last ever episode of <em>Show Time Spanish</em>, which has developed into one of our most popular shows. As we&#8217;ve explained to listeners, Show Time took an enormous amount of work to produce each episode and we feel that we can&#8217;t continue the show in its current format. However, we are sure that Show Time Spanish listeners won&#8217;t be disappointed with what we have planned for release in the new year. We&#8217;re working on new content which will continue to feature native-speaker conversations and in-depth study of the language. We can&#8217;t say too much now, but we&#8217;ll be making some announcements early in the New Year.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in languages other than French and Spanish then we&#8217;re very pleased to announce that 2010 will bring more content for Italian and German learners and that we&#8217;ll continue to increase our range of <em>One Minute Languages</em>.</p>\n<p>Last, but by no means least, since September we&#8217;ve been working in conjunction with schools in the UK through Radio Lingua Schools, and we&#8217;ve been involved in several projects involving languages and creative technologies. In 2010 we&#8217;re going to be looking more at the resources side of Radio Lingua Schools and have started work on a major new course for children, due to be launched in August 2010.</p>\n<p>Of course, as we&#8217;ve said many times, we&#8217;re still a small company and we&#8217;re doing our best to continue to produce high quality, engaging materials. We hope that 2010 will bring further opportunities for new projects, collaboration and new ideas!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4431\" title=\"christmas-box4\" src=\"https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box4.jpg\" alt=\"christmas-box4\" width=\"450\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box4.jpg 450w, https://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box4-300x53.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></p>\n<p>Of course we have lots of ideas as to our new developments, but we&#8217;re really interested to hear about your ideas. To this end, we&#8217;re asking for 10 minutes of your time and we hope that you&#8217;ll be willing to share some of your thoughts about language-learning and your next steps as a learner.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve devised a survey and would be very grateful if you would tell us a little about your language-learning and your experience using Radio Lingua materials. You can give as much or as little detail as you wish, but obviously it&#8217;s extremely useful to us if you can provide as much information as possible. There are different sections of the survey, depending on which language(s) you learn with Radio Lingua, and on whether you listen to the free content or use our premium materials. You&#8217;ll be guided through the survey and we&#8217;ll try to explain why we&#8217;re asking what we&#8217;re asking.</p>\n<p>If you complete the survey you&#8217;ll be invited to enter a prize draw &#8211; there&#8217;s an iPod Touch up for grabs along with five platinum season passes to a language course of your choice!</p>\n<p>To start taking the survey now, <a href=\"http://radiolingua.wufoo.com/forms/radio-lingua-2009-survey/\">click here</a>.</p>\n<h4>All that remains for us to do is to wish each and every one of our listeners and friends a very happy holiday season and a peaceful and prosperous 2010.</h4>\n",
