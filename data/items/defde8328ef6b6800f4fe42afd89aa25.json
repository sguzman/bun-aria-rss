  "description": "<p>This one was a long time in the making. I wasn't sure how willing Karl would be in wanting to open up about his musical upbringing, detailed experience with Earth Crisis and many other things but, he was nothing but accommodating. Karl is the vocalist for seminal hardcore band Earth Crisis who shaped the way people think about animals, straight edge and politics in general for the better part of 20 years. We talk about all of these things as well as Karl's experience teaching and more. I am humbled by this chat and hope you enjoy the places we go. MONTHLY DONATIONONE TIME DONATION</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
