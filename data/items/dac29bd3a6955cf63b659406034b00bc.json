  "title": "Spittin' Chiclets Episode 76: Winnipeg, Washington and a Las Vegas Sweep",
  "description": "<p><p>Today's episode is an up-to-the-minute inter-continental affair as Biz checks in from Australia to link up with Whits in New Jersey, and RA and Grinnelli in Boston. The fellas discuss last night's stunning sweep of the Kings by the Golden Knights, the Caps making it a series in the third straight OT game, and Winnipeg grabbing a 3-1 lead over Minny. They also chat about the apparent injury to Sean Couturier due to Radko Gudas, #1 goalies reclaiming jobs, Whitney's cold streak, and much more. This is the first of two eps this week.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
