This is the story of the events leading Burr and Hamilton to stop exchanging words and begin exchanging lead. Also in this episode: the good old days when killing people in a duel was no obstacle to gaining high political office (just ask Andrew Jackson), Abraham Lincoln and his freakish long reach, when the Senate floor was washed in blood, Hamilton's mom was \"whoring with everyone\", Burr's obsession for women, \"Great souls have little use for small morals\", Thomas Jefferson and Vito Corleone's advice, Plan B: take over Mexico, when the President wanted to hang his former vice-president, a perfect plan to get Americans more interested in politics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">This episode is brought to you by Audible.
