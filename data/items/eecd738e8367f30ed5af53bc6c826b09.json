  "description": "<p><em><strong>Exiles in the Church</strong></em>. Today we discuss an email asking about reconciling feeling exiled <em><strong>in</strong></em> the Church, rather than <em><strong>from</strong></em> it. What does it mean to be “Christian exiles” within the body of Christ?&nbsp; Are there similarities to those in exile in the Old Testament? Is it a matter of disagreement? Nuance? Understanding of text and application? Or is it something more? Are we to remain loyal to that which with we’re in exile from? Where does our loyalty lay and how is it manifested?</p>\n<p>We also discuss listener feedback to last episode in regards to LGBTQ+ and New Creation dynamics.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
