  "description": "<p>Jimmy Dore met me at All Things Comedy studios to explain to me exactly what a progressive is. I've found more and more that I relate to his views on politics more than most people. The distrust in journalism, the desire to get out of war, the feeling that the government is neither left nor right but rather serving the people or serving themselves. He's a passionate man and you can find lots of his stuff on youtube on The Jimmy Dore Show. By the way, this took me fucking 4 days to edit and export in iMovie. I have GOT to get a producer to do this stuff for me. I just don't think anyone will get the music stuff down the way I'd like it done.
