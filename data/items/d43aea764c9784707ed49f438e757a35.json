  "description": "<div>One person has a series of paranormal experiences, fears others will believe they are crazy.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Here is a preview of the story.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>“So, it is Halloween.  I got up around 3-3:30 am, got ready for work, and left.  It usually takes me around 30 mins to get to work from where I live.  It seems unusual because of the number of police officers out, and it is about a full moon.  From what I have been told, when a full moon is out, it tends to bring the crazies out more than usual, or just odd occurrences happen more.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<br>\n<div>I turned on the last main road that goes to my office.  It is probably around 4:30am.  I was taking it slow because of the bumps, and my car at the time was kind of becoming super shaky and did not take bumps and potholes well.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<br>\n<div>Around one of the bends.  I noticed a figure in a patient with a white older-looking hospital gown that was white that came down to the knees.  It had long, thick black shimmery and wire-like hair.  The face, arms, and legs seemed like they had a dark transparent look to them.  You could barely see the eyes and mouth.  I noticed it smiled.  It almost looked like the girl from the Ring movie, which is why I named this ghost the Ringer Ghost because of the similarities between this ghost and the evil girl in the movie.”Follow Tony:<br>\n Instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski\">HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski</a><br>\nTikToc: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski\">https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski\">https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski<br>\n<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/<br>\n<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
