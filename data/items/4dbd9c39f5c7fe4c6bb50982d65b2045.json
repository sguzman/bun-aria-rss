  "description": "<p>Learn from a top leader at one the world’s biggest and best-known gaming companies, EA. Employee Enablement and Communications Sr. Director Alex Masters-Goessling joins host Sherrilynne Starkie and Trilogy Effect’s Wendy Appel to talk about how EA benefited from coaching beyond the C-Suite into the extended leadership team.</p><p>Wendy and the Trilogy Effect team have been working with EA leaders for several years having coached top executives across the organization. Now they are working with Alex to grow the internal capacity and capability for self-leadership at different levels of the organization. </p><p>“I would say the one of the greatest tools that we've learned about, is the Enneagram,” explains Alex Masters-Goessling. “During the onset of the pandemic, knowing the Enneagram helped everyone as we transitioned to support millions of players stuck at home. It's led to a lot of positive self-realization and people have been really receptive.</p><p>“The other great tool that we now use all the time is the ‘alignment tool.’ It’s changed the trajectory of our decision making and the philosophy of how we decide. It means we are a lot more agile and can get new things in motion quickly.” </p><p>Trilogy Effect’s Alignment Tool is designed to support strategic decision making. Wendy Appel explains, “A good analogy for alignment is to think of a flock of geese flying in formation. They are not in a single file behind the leader, but everyone is heading together in the same direction. Alignment speeds decisions because you are not deciding on every detail but just on the overall strategy or approach.” </p><p>In this episode you will learn how leadership development outside of the executive suite benefits your organization by building stronger connections among the extended team, improving teamwork, and creating an environment for fast, smart decision making.</p><p>More information about the tools and concepts discussed in this podcast: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/free-leadership-guidebook\"><strong>Trilogy Effect Leadership Guidebook</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-ea\"><strong>EA’s People -Centered Approach to Business</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\"><strong>How to use the Enneagram to Become a Better Leader</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/2017/1/8/what-is-alignment-and-why-does-it-matter-d7r8r?rq=meetings\"><strong>Alignment and Why It Matters</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/trilogyeffect\">Facebook </a>| <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/trilogy-effect/?viewAsMember=true\">LinkedIn </a>| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_TrilogyEffect\">Twitter </a>| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trilogyeffectleaders/\">Instagram</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio, and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
