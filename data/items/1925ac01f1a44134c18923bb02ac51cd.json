  "description": "<p>We demonstrate how Hahn et al.'s Bayesian Causal Forests model (BCF) can be\nused to estimate conditional average treatment effects for the longitudinal\ndataset in the 2022 American Causal Inference Conference Data Challenge.\nUnfortunately, existing implementations of BCF do not scale to the size of the\nchallenge data. Therefore, we developed flexBCF -- a more scalable and flexible\nimplementation of BCF -- and used it in our challenge submission. We\ninvestigate the sensitivity of our results to two ad hoc modeling choices we\nmade during our initial submission: (i) the choice of propensity score\nestimation method and (ii) the use of sparsity-inducing regression tree priors.\nWhile we found that our overall point predictions were not especially sensitive\nto these modeling choices, we did observe that running BCF with flexibly\nestimated propensity scores often yielded better-calibrated uncertainty\nintervals.\n</p>",
