  "description": "The last couple of years have been tough for everyone, and dealing with the plethora of emotions they have brought on can be complicated for many adults. In their new book, <em>Big Feelings: How to Be Okay When Things Are Not Okay</em>, Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy explore seven emotions that they found particularly difficult to overcome: uncertainty, comparison, anger, burnout, perfectionism, despair, and regret. In an interview with Juana Summers on It's Been a Minute, the authors talk about how they don't intend the book to be self-help, but rather an invitation for people to learn how to give themselves some grace.
