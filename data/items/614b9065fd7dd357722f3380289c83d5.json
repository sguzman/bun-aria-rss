  "description": "NPR science correspondent Lauren Sommer joins Short Wave host Emily Kwong to talk about a team of researchers who were the first to document a pack of orcas attacking a blue whale.  Their work shows that killer whales, while stars in marine parks and movies, are also the ocean's top-- and often vicious-- predators.
