  "description": "In some parts of the world, taking a stand for the planet can be incredibly dangerous. This week we hear from Laura Furones, of the campaign group Global Witness, on the finding that <a href='https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/last-line-defence/'>227 environment activists were murdered in 2020</a>. She explains why this is happening and what needs to be done to protect these people. In de-extinction news, $15 million has been given to a team hoping to bring mammoths back to life. While exciting news for some, evolutionary biologist Tori Herridge discusses the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2122872-de-extinction-dilemma-reviving-dead-species-may-doom-the-living/'>ethical implications</a> of creating mammoth-elephant hybrids. The team finds out the latest on the<a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133523-500-is-the-delta-coronavirus-variant-more-dangerous-for-children/'> UK’s plans to vaccinate children</a>, and whether the country is likely to face another lockdown. They also discuss the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, and learn that <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2289981-cows-have-been-potty-trained-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/'>cows are easier to potty train than toddlers</a>.
