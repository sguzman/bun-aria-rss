  "description": "<p>Network systems often contain vulnerabilities that remain unfixed in a\nnetwork for various reasons, such as the lack of a patch or knowledge to fix\nthem. With the presence of such residual vulnerabilities, the network\nadministrator should properly react to the malicious activities or proactively\nprevent them, by applying suitable countermeasures that minimize the likelihood\nof an attack by the attacker. In this paper, we propose a stochastic\ngame-theoretic approach for analyzing network security and synthesizing defense\nstrategies to protect a network. To support analysis under partial observation,\nwhere some of the attacker's activities are unobservable or undetectable by the\ndefender, we construct a one-sided partially observable security game and\ntransform it into a perfect game for further analysis. We prove that this\ntransformation is sound for a sub-class of security games and a subset of\nproperties specified in the logic rPATL. We implement a prototype that fully\nautomates our approach, and evaluate it by conducting experiments on a\nreal-life network.\n</p>",
