  "description": "The United States is experiencing an adolescent mental health crisis. Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Surgeon General are stressing the urgent need to address the mental health needs of children and teens.  <br/><br/>The pandemic focused attention on this issue as young people dealt with isolation, the uncertainty of lockdown and grief over the death of loved ones. But while the pandemic exacerbated the problem, it has been building for years. <br/><br/>We speak with Judith Warner, a journalist and author, to find out how we got to this point, and what can be done to help kids now.
