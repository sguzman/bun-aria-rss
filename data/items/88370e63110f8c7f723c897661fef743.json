  "description": "<div>\n<strong>THIS IS ABOUT THE SPORTS AND STILL SOMEHOW ONE OF OUR FAVORITE DOCS WE’VE EVER COVERED! <br>\n</strong><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Welcome to Florida, land of swamp dinosaurs, tanning salons, and, like, humidity.  But did you also know it was ground zero for the high-profile doping scandal that rocked Major League Baseball? They say South Florida is a sunny place for shady people and this is certainly true of steroid peddler Anthony Bosch and his most notorious client, Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees. While Bosch's medical credentials may be lacking, his storytelling skills are first rate as he hilariously details the rise and fall of his \"health clinic\", including mob connections, financial chicanery, his cocaine habit, and Rodriguez's eccentric behavior. AND A BUNCH OF ADORABLE LITTLE KIDS DO ALL THE REENACTMENTS. IT’S HILARIOUS!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 100 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more!
