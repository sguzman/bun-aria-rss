  "title": "78 - Defiance: the Nazi Killing Bielski Brothers",
  "description": "<p>The Bielski brothers led the largest Jewish-led rescue operation of Jewish civilians in ALL of World War II. They saved over 1,200 men, women, and children by hiding them in the forests of Western Belo-russia, from 1942-1944. More than 20,000 descendants of the survivors the Bielski’s helped save are alive today because of the ingenuity, heart, and perseverance of these men. They led numerous attacks against the German forces, sabotaging their war and round up efforts, killing their soldiers, and earning a huge target on their heads. Let’s get pumped, let’s get some revolutionary blood flowing through our veins, let’s feel thankful to just be alive today. LIFE is what the Bielski brothers fought for - and we deep dive them today, and go on a big emotional rollercoaster of a Suck, today, on Timesuck! </p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
