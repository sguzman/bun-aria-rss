  "description": "Today’s show features an exclusive interview from McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk with Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, and All-Pro, Jordy Nelson. Pat and AJ chat with Jordy about leaving Green Bay to go play for the Raiders and how difficult that was, his thoughts on Derek Carr and why he gets a bad wrap from the media, whether or not he would come out of retirement to play for the Packers, his relationship with both Aaron Rodgers and AJ, what his life is like now on the farm, and how he can hit a softball a country mile (3:28-45:36). Also included is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss The Match 2 and how they both loved it, how their Memorial Day Weekend’s were, a likely landing spot for Jadeveon Clowney, Mike Tyson coming out of retirement and looking for a potential fight, and they discuss everything going on with the NHL as they come closer and closer to potentially finishing the season (45:38-2:01:58). To close out the show, Yahoo Senior NFL writer and friend of the show, Charles Robinson, joins the program. Pat and Charles discuss all the rumors circulating around the Dallas Cowboys making a push for Jets S Jamal Adams and what that price could potentially look like. Charles also gives his thoughts on whether or not a deal for Dak Prescott is going to get done this year or if he’s going to go the Kirk Cousins route, he breaks down where he thinks Jadeveon Clowney will wind up and who is interested, and gives a couple more interesting tidbits about things going around the NFL (2:03:53-2:20:26). Don’t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you’re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We hope everyone had a safe and fulfilling Memorial Day Weekend. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
