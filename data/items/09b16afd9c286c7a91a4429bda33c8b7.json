  "description": "<p>This has become an annual tradition! I sit down and chat with one of my best friends and meditation teacher Cassandra to get real about what we learned this year. We discuss our shifting relationship with time, diving into our purposes, facing death, the preciousness of the present moment, reclaiming our power, coming face to face with people-pleaser qualities and also not being a people pleaser to the universe.
