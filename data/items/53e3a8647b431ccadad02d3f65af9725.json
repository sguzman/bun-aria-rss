  "description": "Shellye Archambeau knew as a teenager she wanted to grow up and become a CEO. But when Shellye started as an undergraduate at the Wharton School of Business in 1980, there were just two female CEOs of large corporations, and none of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were Black. Despite the lack of representation, Shellye became the first Black woman to lead a division of IBM overseas. She broke barriers and took risks leading to a successful career with leadership positions at Blockbuster, Zaplet and MetricStream. Shellye's book, <em>Unapologetically Ambitious: Take Risks, Break Barriers, and Create Success on Your Own Terms</em>, details her singular approach to leadership, and her advice for taking ownership of one's career.
