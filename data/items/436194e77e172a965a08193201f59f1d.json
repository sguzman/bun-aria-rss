Finkel studies American politics, romantic relationships and the intersection of those two concepts. He joins us to discuss the rise of political sectarianism and why the current state of American politics is like a bad marriage.</p> <p>Links</p> <p><a href=\"https://elifinkel.com\">Eli Finkel, PhD</a><br /> <a href= \"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/533\">Political sectarianism in America</a></p> <p>Music<br /> <br /> \"Tension Orchestra Chords\" by <a href= \"https://freesound.org/people/frankum/\">Frankum</a> via Freesound.org<br /> <br /> Sponsor<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://convention.apa.org/podcast\">APA 2020 Virtual</a></p>",
