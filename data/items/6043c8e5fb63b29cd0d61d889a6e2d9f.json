  "description": "<p>Pansy will be joining me tonight. She is from Kentucky and writes \"I have now seen Sasquatch two times where there is no doubt, and 2 other possible sightings. I'm not crazy and I'm not seeing things! I grew up in the country hunting, fishing, playing paintball and hide-and -seek in the woods, riding 4 wheeler and horses all through the woods. I'm also the daughter of a retired taxidermist, I know what all the animals look like from the inside out, I'm not mistaken on what I have seen.\"</p>",
