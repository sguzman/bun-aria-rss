  "description": "<p>Some in the bigfoot community feel that Sasquatch are the Nephilim. I decided to do a show on the Nephilim which was SC EP:112. I feel like that show gave a clear picture of what the Nephilim were and how they did not fit into the Sasquatch topic. One of the topics in Gary's book was secret societies. I wanted to invite Gary back to the show to discuss this as we ran out of time in EP:112.</p> <p>I want to thank the audience for allowing me to go off of the Sasquatch topic to finish this discussion. I will return next week on topic of the Sasquatch.</p> <p>My guest tonight is Gary Wayne, author of \"The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind.\" There are giants among us, passing largely unnoticed, intent on carrying out a secret plan to enslave all humanity. They may not look like giants today, but their bloodlines extend all the way back to the Nephilim—the offspring of angels who mated with human women—described in Genesis 6 when giants roamed the land. Gary Wayne, author of The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind, details the role of modern-day Nephilim.</p>",
