  "description": "You’ve heard us say it before. The Black vote is powerful. But the two-party system wasn’t designed to actively engage our needs. So how do we reclaim our power in a political ecosystem that takes our vote - our power - for granted? Today’s guest has the insight necessary to begin answering that question. Candace Hollingsworth was the first Black mayor of Hyattsville, Maryland, and founder of Our Black Party, an independent political group whose mission is to advance a political agenda and address the needs of our people. We'll explore the history of independent Black political parties and the political actions we must take to reclaim our power. BHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company – hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\n\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands.
