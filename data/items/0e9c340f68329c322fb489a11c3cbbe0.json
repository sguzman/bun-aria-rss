  "description": "<p>Should you work for the man or work for yourself!? There’s a lot to consider when asking yourself that question and there’s certainly not a one size fits all answer. At the same time, it seems that entrepreneurship has been put on a bit of a pedestal in our society causing it to be inaccurately represented. And this question is even more relevant given the high levels of unemployment plaguing our country right now. A lot of folks have been laid off or furloughed while other sectors are doing really well- there are a lot of factors to consider. There are meaningful tradeoffs depending on the choice you make, so during this episode we’ll cover some of the important things you should consider as you think about your future career. We’re here to help you to decide whether or not you should be starting your own business or whether you’re better off in a traditional nine to five!</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Realities by Dssolver!
