  "description": "Hey Trumpcast listeners we wanted to introduce you to a new show! It's called Lend Me Your Ears and it's a six-part podcast miniseries exploring how Shakespeare’s works have shaped our modern views on politics. Each month, host Isaac Butler will dig into a different Shakespeare play to explore how Shakespeare was responding to his current events, and how they map onto our own.\nIn this first episode, Lend Me Your Ears is looking at one of Shakespeare’s most accessible works: Julius Caesar. Why was the Bard so fascinated with the fall of the Roman Republic? Why do we tend to turn to this play when we worry about society’s future? How have contemporary theater makers reinvented Shakespeare’s version of the story for their audiences, especially in troubled political times?\nSubscribe to Lend Me Your Ears on Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.\nSlate Plus members get a bonus episode of Lend Me Your Ears every month.
