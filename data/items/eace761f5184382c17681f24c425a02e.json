  "description": "<p>Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. You loved her Oceanology episode and now she is in your feed to address everyone’s agonizing internal question: IS MY CARBON FOOTPRINT BS?! I don’t drop a lot of podcast episodes into my precious Ologies feed, but this topic was so wonderfully covered by Dr. Johnson and co-hot Alex Blumberg that I had to do it. And as a bonus, stay tuned for Wednesday’s episode between me and my old friend C. Andrew Hall, the creative director of the non-profit illustration collective, the Drawdown Design Project. I’ve been consulting with him for 2 years on a giant project that just dropped and I think you’ll love what he has to say about our individual roles and responsibilities in climate change. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So yes: onward with “How to Save a Planet.”</p>\n<p>Listen to Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson’s Oceanology episode: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/oceanology2\">https://www.alieward.com/ologies/oceanology2</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Drawdown Design project: <a href=\"https://drawdowndesignproject.org/\">https://drawdowndesignproject.org/</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow the Drawdown Design Project: https://www.instagram.com/drawdowndesignproject/</p>\n<p>Buy Dr. Johnson’s book! https://www.allwecansave.earth</p>\n<p>Her podcast: “How to Save a Planet:” <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet\">https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet</a></p>\n<p>Dr. Johnson's collective:<a href=\"http://oceancollectiv.co/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.allwecansave.earth/\">https://www.allwecansave.earth/</a></p>\n<p>Dr. Johnson on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ayanaeliza\"> @ayanaeliza</a> and Instagram<a href=\"http://instagram.com/ayanaeliza\"> @ayanaeliza</a></p>\n<p>Dr. Johnson's website:<a href=\"https://www.ayanaelizabeth.com/\"> ayanaelizabeth.com</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p>\n<p>Follow @Ologies on<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\"> Twitter</a> or<a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\"> Instagram</a></p>\n<p>Follow @AlieWard on<a href=\"http://twitter.com/alieward\"> Twitter</a> or<a href=\"http://instagram.com/alieward\"> Instagram</a></p>\n<p>More links at<a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/\"> www.alieward.com</a></p>\n<p>Sound editing by Steven Ray Morris</p>\n<p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
