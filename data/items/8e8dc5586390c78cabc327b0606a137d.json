    "media:description": "Topos Institute Colloquium, 29th of September 2022.\n———\nIn this talk I will argue that formal verification helps break the\none-mind-barrier in mathematics. Indeed, formal verification allows a\nteam of mathematicians to collaborate on a project, without one person\nunderstanding all parts of the project. At the same time, it also\nallows a mathematician to rapidly free mental RAM in order to work on a\ndifferent component of a project. It thus also expands the\none-mind-barrier by reducing cognitive load.\n\nI will use the Liquid Tensor Experiment as an example, to illustrate\nthe above two points. This project recently finished the formalization\nof the main theorem of liquid vector spaces, following up on a\nchallenge by Peter Scholze.",
