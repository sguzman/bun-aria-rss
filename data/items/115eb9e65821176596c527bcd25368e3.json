  "description": "Thomas Weiss and Dan Plesch are the co-editors of We Are Strong: Wartime Origins and the Future United Nations (Routledge, 2015). Weiss is Presidential Professor of Political Science and Director Emeritus of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at The City University of New York's Graduate Center; Plesch is Director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at SOAS, University of London.\nThey write in the introduction \"Today a key question that ought to be in bold-faced type on the agenda of global governance is: 'Do we need another cataclysm to re-kindle the imagination and energy and cooperation that was in the air in the 1940s, or are we smart enough to adapt in anticipation?'\" Much of the book is built on a hope that the answer to this question is the later, and that world leaders look to the historical lessons delivered in each chapter. Weiss and Plesch break the book into sections: Planning and Propaganda, Human Security, and Economic Development. One is left believing that the original design of the various appendages of the United Nations was the work of truly forward-looking planners, and that while the current institution may not resemble the original vision, much could be gained by looking back to what they designed.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
