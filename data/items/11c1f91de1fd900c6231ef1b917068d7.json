  "description": "<p>What’s it like running the pastry departments at two of New York City’s buzziest fine dining restaurants? We find out when Michelle Palazzo, director of pastry operations for Le Rock and Frenchette restaurants, and Mariah Neston, Le Rock’s executive pastry chef, join us for today’s episode. The two didn’t know each other before meeting in the kitchen at the critically acclaimed Frenchette, but they quickly formed a professional partnership and support system that has served them well. Today, Mariah calls Michelle her mentor and Michelle says Mariah is her “ride or die.” The two chat with host Kerry Diamond about the journeys that led them to fine dining, how they collaborate with their teams to make some of the city’s best desserts, and what makes a great pastry chef. </p><p>Radio Cherry Bombe is supported by Whole Foods.
