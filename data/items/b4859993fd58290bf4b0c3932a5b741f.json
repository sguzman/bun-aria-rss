  "description": "<p>It's time to bring you our first ever Field Hockey athlete today as we speak with London Olympian Ashleigh Nelson about her incredible career for the Hockeyroos and Olympic experiences! We find out from Ash more about growing up in rural Western Australia and how deciding not to go on a trip with her family ultimately helped her towards her future Olympic appearance. We also learn more about her initial feelings of making the Hockeyroos and how she was able to turn that experience around into playing the best hockey she has played in her career between narrowly missing out on a spot in Beijing to her eventual London appearance. Added to that we also find out just why she can't stop meeting the Queen and why she probably won't be eating too many chicken sandwiches from the UK anymore. It's a great chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
