  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the only insurrection is the one that’s been going on since January 20th with the Inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They’ve destroyed the separation of powers, our financial and economic systems, our sovereignty in terms of citizenship, and our public schools. It’s an ongoing insurrection being led by Biden and Harris, aided by the media, and pushed by the tenured Marxist professors in our universities. It’s a real insurrection; not an unarmed group breaching the capitol building. Nancy Pelosi has seized all power in the House of Representatives, and yet she did nothing to prepare for January 6th even though she was alerted and offered National Guard support from President Trump. Also, Tracy Stone-Manning’s nomination for Director of the Bureau of Land Management is still pending despite a history of domestic terrorism. This is the latest in democrat party history of pardoning domestic terrorists who literally bombed and shot up the capitol. They give cover for actual violence but exploit a phony insurrection for political gain. Later, the phony infrastructure bill gets exposed more and more each day. Massive cable companies like AT&T and Charter will receive billions of dollars to improve connectivity to low-income housing. Washington is so corrupt it’s unbelievable, and to call it bipartisan is cover for their thievery. Every senator that votes for this should be primaried and defeated. The Republicans should be putting their foot down on all democrat spending until the southern border is secure. Finally, Mark is joined by Professor Paul Kengor to discuss the spread of Marxism in America through various movements.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
