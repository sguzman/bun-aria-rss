  "description": "Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech link up for the final Thursday night recap of 2020, as the TNF slate ended on a high with an exciting overtime finish. The Chargers beat the Raiders 30-27 in OT as Wilson's preseason bold prediction that Marcus Mariota would replace Derek Carr and lead Las Vegas to the playoffs looked salvageable. It wasn't meant to be as Justin Herbert likely solidified the Rookie of the Year award with a standout performance in primetime. Do the Raiders have a quarterback controversy brewing already? Coaching is a big focus of this episode as Anthony Lynn won, but didn't do much to quiet hot seat rumors. Jon Gruden signed a 10-year deal a few years back, but Breech doesn't find it crazy to question if he's the right guy to finish out seasons.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
