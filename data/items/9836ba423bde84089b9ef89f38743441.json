  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino fills in. Liberals are triggered, enraged and they suck and want your life to suck too. Soccer player Megan Rapinoe is protesting and not acknowledging the flag even though she plays for the U.S World Cup soccer team. Then, the furniture company Wayfair is supplying beds to the detention centers housing children at the border as they await detention. But the liberal employees of the company decided to walk out in protest because they don't want the kids to have beds because they are addicted to misery—your misery. Conversely, conservatives are happy to debate because there's more emphasis on logic so facts are fundamental, while liberals are addicted to emotion. So they'd rather have kids sleeping on a concrete floor than. Also, Robert Mueller will testify to Congress in July and Jerry Nadler thinks that bringing in a disbarred Watergate lawyer will make it look like an impeachment proceeding.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
