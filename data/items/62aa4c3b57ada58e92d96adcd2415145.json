  "description": "<p>Over the past year and a half, we have learned so much about this virus, but there is still more to know. There always will be. We have seen the widespread impacts that the pandemic has had on all facets of society, but there is still more to see. There always will be. The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and its effects will continue to be felt for years to come. What can we expect in a post-pandemic future? Frankly, no one knows. But we can make some guesses based on what we have already seen. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, one of our best reference points for comparison has been, of course, the deadly and devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. What can that pandemic tell us about our own uncertain future, and where do comparisons simply fall short? Did the lessons learned from the 1918 pandemic change the course of COVID-19? Or were we doomed to repeat history? To help us look forward by looking back, we are so excited to be joined by <a href=\"http://www.johnmbarry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Barry</a>, award-winning and <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of books such as <em>The Great Influenza: The story of the deadliest pandemic in history</em> (interview recorded May 25, 2021).</p><p>This marks the tentative final episode in our Anatomy of a Pandemic series on the COVID-19 pandemic.
