In 2018 Jean was named one of House Beautiful’s 10 Next Wave Designers. Her work has also been featured in Traditional Home, Town & Country, Architectural Digest, Luxe, The Wallstreet Journal, and many others. We talk about Jean’s love for bold art, how to create a “Zen” kitchen, Jean’s great house with a great room, and much more.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nHow to start enjoying art in your space.\n\nWhat is an art trainer?\n\nJean’s unconventional path to a career in design.\n\nHow Jean created a Zen kitchen.\n\nWhat Jean recommends for designing with kids in mind.\n\nJean used to stalk her current house from afar…and one day she finally got it!\n\nWhat was Jean’s process for designing her own home?\n\nDesigning a great room with different functions.\n\nStrategies for reusing furniture when moving to a new space.\n\nWhat motivates people to take on a brand-new style?\n\nHow to make warm spaces in rooms that aren’t inherently cozy.\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Laura,\n\nYes, definitely take the symmetry into account and we have three recommendations for you. First, is to consider adding a linear fixture over your island that runs the length of the island. This will help detract the eye from the lack of symmetry and the true center of the room. Another option, given your husband’s height, would be to use a flush mount or semi flush mount throughout the kitchen. We love the Greta fixture! Finally, the last option we suggest is using gooseneck sconces over your window to let the lighting be handled through recessed cans throughout. What direction your windows are facing and the natural light you get may influence your choice. We usually recommend with any kitchen remodel that you strongly consider adding LED under cabinet lighting. You could also add some small lamps or tiny accents to your surfaces. We are all big fans of having dimmers for all lighting, as well!\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you’ll never really be looking at the room straight-on, so it won’t be as noticeable as you may be worrying about. It’s great that you’re keeping it in mind, but don’t let it trip you up too much!\n\nGood luck, Laura!\n\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nJean Liu Design\nJean Liu Design on Instagram\nJean’s Personal Home",
