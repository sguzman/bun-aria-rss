  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, there were more mass shootings under Barack Obama's tenure as President than thus far under President Trump, according to Truth Stream Media. However, this fact hasn't stopped former Vice President Joe Biden from race-baiting on this issue even more than before. Attacking our Constitution as a racist document and misleading voters through his demagoguery, Biden claims that the 3/5 compromise was to limit the humanity of African Americans instead of a formula to include them in the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives. Does Biden reject the principles our nation was founded on?  This type of thinking is what created Nazi's and Klansmen to begin with.  Both Biden and the KKK believe that government should be destroyed in order to repair it. Then, John Lott calls in to discuss the recent shootings and Red Flag laws.  After, Thomas Jefferson (a slave owner) and Abraham Lincoln led the charge to end slavery in America. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
