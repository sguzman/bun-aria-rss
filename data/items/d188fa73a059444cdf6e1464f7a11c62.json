It wasn't until he rejected Hollywood's idea of being a leading man and embraced being a character actor that everything flourished. Kevin also tells Marc stories about Diner, JFK, A Few Good Men, Sleepers, Apollo 13, Mystic River and the new series I Love Dick, which has him doing things he'd never done before as an actor. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
