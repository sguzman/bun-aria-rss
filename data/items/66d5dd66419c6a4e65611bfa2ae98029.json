Andrew is living it up in NYC spending time with a good friend and feeling anxious about Meek Mill's jewelry. Nikki shares a story about going to a place called The Rabbit Hole last night and enjoying getting out of her comfort zone. She's so comfortable that she shares a line of her poetry, Andrew writes one too.
