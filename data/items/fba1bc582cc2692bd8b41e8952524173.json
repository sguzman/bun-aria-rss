Martin, Godwin, and Johnny D admit their favorite guilty-pleasure songs and rank the best sports movies of all time. After breaking down the Masters, Si throws down some fightin' words when he tells Godwin bull riding isn't a real sport. The boys talk eggs and sausage, the problem with hunting in Louisiana, the vileness of buttermilk, and the one vegetable Godwin would outlaw. And Johnny D shares a status update on his relationship with Willie.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
