  "description": "<p>\"People who are great at anything they do don't do it for the money. The money is just a byproduct in achieving greatness. - John Brenkus<br />\nAs I'm sure many of you know, I'm pretty big on sports.<br />\nI love everything about it. The challenge of the games, the sense of being part of a team, and even the science behind how it works. It's always fascinated me.<br />\nWhy is it some people can excel at sports, while others fall short no matter how hard they try?<br />\nIt's not just a matter of genes and physical strength. In fact, someone's natural mind set under pressure also has a lot to do with it.<br />\nWhen you talk to Super Bowl Champions, no matter how much pressure is on them, it's just a game. If they win or lose, they go home to their families and they know life will go on.<br />\nTo most of us that kind of pressure would cause us to live in the moment, we'd be stuck in our heads, and end up costing us the big game.</p>\n",
