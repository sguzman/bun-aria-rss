  "description": "<p>Knowledge proximity refers to the strength of association between any two\nentities in a structural form that embodies certain aspects of a knowledge\nbase. In this work, we operationalize knowledge proximity within the context of\nthe US Patent Database (knowledge base) using a knowledge graph (structural\nform) named PatNet built using patent metadata, including citations, inventors,\nassignees, and domain classifications. Using several graph embedding models\n(e.g., TransE, RESCAL), we obtain the embeddings of entities and relations that\nconstitute PatNet. The cosine similarity between the corresponding (or\ntransformed) embeddings entities denotes the knowledge proximity between these.\nWe evaluate the plausibility of these embeddings across different models in\npredicting target entities. We also evaluate the meaningfulness of knowledge\nproximity to explain the domain expansion profiles of inventors and assignees.\nWe then apply the embeddings of the best-preferred model to associate\nhomogeneous (e.g., patent-patent) and heterogeneous (e.g., inventor-assignee)\npairs of entities.\n</p>",
