  "title": "Robert J. Pekkanen et al., “Nonprofits and Advocacy” (Johns Hopkins UP, 2014)",
  "description": "Robert J. Pekkanen, Steven Rathgeb Smith, and Yutaka Tsujinaka are the authors of Nonprofits and Advocacy: Engaging Community and Government in an Era of Retrenchment (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014). Pekkanen is professor in the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies and adjunct professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Washington. Smith is executive director of the APSA and affiliate professor in the Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, and Tsujinaka is the president-elect of the Japanese Political Science Association and a professor of political science in the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nThis edited volume asks a simple question: Does nonprofit mean nonpolitical? The editors assemble a group of all-stars on the subject to answer that question, including: Jeffery Berry, Elizabeth Boris, and Kristin Goss. In doing so, the authors confront what they call the “double definitional dilemma” that has hampered research on the political dimensions of nonprofits in the past. The answers in this volume reflect the newest research and thinking on nonprofits and should be read by political scientists, generally, and those interested in organizations, civic participation, and representation, more specifically.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
