He finished up in the army as the Chief of the Military History Division at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. I am fascinated to hear about how the modern army chooses to teach history to its future leaders.

Kevin and I discussed how a deep understanding of military history and leadership theories can benefit military and civilian workers in all sorts of ways.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Subscribe to History Hit and you'll get access to hundreds of history documentaries, as well as every single episode of this podcast from the beginning (400 extra episodes).
