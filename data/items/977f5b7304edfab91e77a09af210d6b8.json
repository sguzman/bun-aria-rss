  "description": "<p>If you are putting in the work at the gym and are not satisfied with your gains, then you need to look at your programming. So much of what is called programming today is just a bunch of exercises thrown together in a very unscientific manner. It is highly unlikely that you will ever get close to achieving your genetic muscle building or strength potential using these methods. Good programming understands how the body adapts and adjusts accordingly, minimizing plateaus and maximizing results. In this episode Sal, Adam & Justin break down proper programming.
