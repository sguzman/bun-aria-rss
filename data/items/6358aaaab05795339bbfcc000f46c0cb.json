  "description": "Culture, Context and Ageing of Older Indians: Narratives from India and Beyond (Springer 2021) discusses the intersections between culture, context, and ageing. It adopts a socio-cultural lens and highlights emotional, social, and psychological issues of the older adults in urban India. It is set in multiple sites such as Ahmedabad, Delhi, Kolkata, and Saskatoon to indicate how different cultural practises and contextual factors play an integral role in determining the course of ageing. It also focuses on different narratives such as older adults living with adult children, older adults living with spouses, and older adults living alone to demonstrate the intricate process of growing old. Drawing from various sites and living arrangements of older adults, it sheds light on cultural constructions of growing old, ideas of belonging, the inevitability of death, everyday processes of ageing, perceptions associated with growing old in India, acceptance of the ageing body, and intergenerational ties in later lives. Given its scope, the book is essential reading for students and researchers in the fields of sociology, demography, and social scientists studying ageing.\nRituparna Patgiri, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Indraprastha College for Women, University of Delhi.
