Later, Grammy Award winner, lead singer of Hootie & The Blowfish, absolute legend, Darius Rucker joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his upcoming solo tour, what it was like touring in the heyday of Hootie & The Blowfish, his song writing process, if he ever forgets the words to his songs when performing live, if he hates performing any of his songs at this point in his career, how his golf game his, what he thinks of the Dolphins this year, and much more (1:42:32-1:55:24).
