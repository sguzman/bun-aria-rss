  "description": "<p>The competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is one of\nthe central questions in the research of strong correlated systems. In this\nwork, we utilize a double layer model containing Hubbard interaction and\ninterlayer Heisenberg interaction to reveal their competitions. This model is\nfree of sign problem at certain conditions, and we perform projector quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations to extract the ground state correlations of magnetism\nand superconductivity. Our results shows that the superconductivity emerges\nwhen the antiferromagnetism is suppressed by tuning the filling or the\nanisotropy of the interlayer Heisenberg interaction. This model can be seen as\nan analogue of unconventional superconductors and may help us to understand the\ntransition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a superconductor.\n</p>",
