The online news site decided to publish an editorial throwing its full support behind Donald Trump, and Nazworth wasn’t on board.

Also this week, Christian gets rebuked on a French train, the Hallmark Channel angers a million moms, the Salvation Army says it’s not anti-LGBT, and a youth pastor running a marathon gets in deep trouble.</p>",
