  "title": "Cornelia H. Dayton and Sharon V. Salinger, “Robert Love’s Warnings” (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014)",
  "description": "In early America, the practice of “warning out” was unique to New England, a way for the community to regulate those who might fall into poverty and need assistance from the town or province. Robert Love’s Warnings: Searching for Strangers in Colonial Boston (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014) is the first book about this forgotten aspect of colonial Massachusetts life since 1911. We perambulate with him around Boston’s streets on the eve of the Revolution. Dayton and Salinger present the legal basis of the warning system and the moral, religious and humanistic motives of those who enforced it.\n\nWe interview legal historian Cornelia H. Dayton of the University of Connecticut about the book she wrote with fellow historian Sharon V. Salinger, of the University of California, Irvine. They discovered his “diary,” and from there found warrants and other documents that allowed them to reconstruct his world, as well as the biographies of the sojourners, soldiers, and members of ethnic and religious minorities who were moving throughout the British Atlantic. They provide fresh insights into why people came to Boston and how long they stayed. Professor Dayton explains how she and Salinger provide a fresh, and perhaps controversial, interpretation of the role that warning played in the city’s civic landscape. Robert Love’s Warnings is a comparative legal history as well as social and political history of New England in the decade before the Revolution.\n\nUpdate (April 26, 2015): Sharon V. Salinger and Cornelia Dayton have received a major book award by the Organization of American Historians (OAH).  Their book Robert Love’s Warnings: Searching for Strangers in Colonial Boston (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014) won the Merle Curti prize for the best book in American social history.\n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
