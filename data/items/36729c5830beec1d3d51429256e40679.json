    "media:description": "The iFLOW-200™ system measures the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of a cold plate. It replaces the complex process of varying the volumetric flow rate of the coolant, and measuring the pressure drop and temperature of the cold plate. iFLOW-200™ users simply set up the starting flow, ending flow, number of test points, dwell time, power applied to the cold plate and other parameters in the coolingVIEW™ software and run the application.\n\nLearn more about this system here - https://www.qats.com/Products/Instruments/Specialty-Instruments/iFLOW-200\n\nhttps://www.qats.com\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.\n\nService, Products and Training\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design\n• Design Services\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions\n• Rapid Prototyping\n• Custom Heat Sink Design\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments\n• Engineering Training\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
