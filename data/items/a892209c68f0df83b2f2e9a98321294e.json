  "description": "Did you know that an artificial intelligence named \"Eugene Goostman\" recently passed the Turing Test, our gold standard criterion for whether an AI is conscious? At least, that's what many media outlets breathlessly reported.

In the process they debate what it would mean for an AI to be conscious, and how we could ever tell.",
