  "description": "<p>A broad class of smooth, possibly data-adaptive nonparametric copula\nestimators that contains empirical Bernstein copulas introduced by Sancetta and\nSatchell (and thus the empirical beta copula proposed by Segers, Sibuya and\nTsukahara) is studied. Within this class, a subclass of estimators that depend\non a scalar parameter determining the amount of marginal smoothing and a\nfunctional parameter controlling the shape of the smoothing region is\nspecifically considered. Empirical investigations of the influence of these\nparameters suggest to focus on two particular data-adaptive smooth copula\nestimators that were found to be uniformly better than the empirical beta\ncopula in all of the considered Monte Carlo experiments. Finally, with future\napplications to change-point detection in mind, conditions under which related\nsequential empirical copula processes converge weakly are provided.\n</p>",
