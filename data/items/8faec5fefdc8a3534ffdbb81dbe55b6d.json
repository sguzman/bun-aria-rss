  "description": "This week, the gals broadcast from their live show in Orlando about some reasons you may not want to ever visit Orlando. Topics include some pitfalls of g-force, a woman who takes her fireworks displays very seriously, and the dolphin anatomy you never knew you needed. Crack open some Canyon Road Pinot Grigio, dump it in a novelty water bottle to avoid suspicion, and tune in for Amusement Park Crimes.",
