That is, until now.</p><p>Recent research in neuroscience, genetics, and epidemiology now establish that humans are not only universally equipped with a capacity for (and inclination towards) spirituality, but that our brains, when so awakened, become more resilient and robust—and our lives more meaningful and content.</p><p>Here today to discuss the emerging and fascinating ‘science of spirituality’ is the woman who helped pioneer it,&nbsp;<strong>Lisa Miller, PhD</strong>.</p><p>A leading generational psychologist on the benefits of spirituality, Lisa is a graduate of Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned her doctorate in psychology. She is currently a professor of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and is the Founder and Director of the&nbsp;Spirituality Mind Body Institute,the first Ivy League graduate program and research institute in spirituality and psychology.</p><p>Dr. Miller is widely published in leading academic journals, has appeared on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, and Weekend Today as an expert, and her first book,&nbsp;The Spiritual Child&nbsp;was a New York Times bestseller.
