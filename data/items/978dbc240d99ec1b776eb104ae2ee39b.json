  "description": "In this episode we go over tips on how to design when working with a tight budget, which is a request we have gotten from a few of our listeners. Many people want to have a tall, two story ceiling in their home, but don’t realize how expensive it ends up being and there are ways to work around that. Your budget generally should be 10-20% of the cost of your home. We discuss how you should approach what to keep versus what you should get rid of, and then we talk about what to have on your floor, such as a hand-knotted rug. Sue tells about a great way to make your ceiling look bigger if yours is only eight feet tall, and then we discuss what an estate sale is and how to find amazing deals through these. You can also go on Facebook Marketplace and find great things on there.<br /><br />Two story ceilings 5:14<br />Figure out what your must-haves are 7:43<br />For the ground 10:03<br />What to sit on 12:58<br />Invest in your window treatments 16:06<br />The golden rocker 18:09<br />Estate sales 21:02<br />What not to do 25:34<br /><br />“I have 8 foot ceilings. That’s 96 inches. Not very tall and probably a lot of older homes, if you’re living in an older home, are only 8 feet, so by taking that color of the wall onto the ceiling, I think it grew. Jess, would you agree?” “Oh yeah, for sure.” “It just looks opinionated like there’s no regrets. It’s a super confident way to design a space by just taking that color and wrapping it, and paint is the cheapest thing you can do.” 16:39<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
