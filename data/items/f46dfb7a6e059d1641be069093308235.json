  "description": "Up to 93% of American adults have some degree of math anxiety. The problem often starts in elementary school, but parents can do a lot to fix it. We talk to experts to get some unexpected strategies for children of all ages, with a little bit of help from Sesame Street and, of course, the Count. <br/><br/>Here's what to remember:<br/>- Your own math anxiety doesn't have to hold your kids back.<br/>- Talk about math when you're sharing everyday activities. <br/>- Play math — with board games, card games, puzzles, and more.  <br/>- Forget about right and wrong answers. Keep things open-ended — life, and math, are more fun that way. <br/>",
