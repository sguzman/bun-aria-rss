We also flashed back to the time Jo Koy stopped by and spoke about Mental Health, Being Subject To Racism, New Book 'Mixed Plate' and more. We also, flashed back to the time Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Derrick Jaxn for not only embarrassing his wife but being a narcissist. However it wasn't all classics as we also had Mike Africa who discussed The 1978 Police Raid On The MOVE Group & The Fight To Exonerate His Parents.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
