  "description": "Rosie Duffield won Canterbury in 2017 and became its first ever Labour MP. She repeated the feat and increased her majority in 2019. So how did she manage to get a seat that had never voted Labour to vote Labour twice and increase a majority at a time when Labour's vote was collapsing? In this hugely optimistic interview, Rosie shares her insights into those two amazing results as well as her work on the Domestic Abuse Bill and her role as Chair of the Women's PLP. You'll end the show feeling better about the future.
