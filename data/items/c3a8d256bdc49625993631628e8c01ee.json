  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, more people are now calling for the assassination of war criminal Vladimir Putin and perhaps one of his countrymen will rise to the challenge. There is still opposition to providing the Ukrainians with MIG-29 fighter jets. Air cover is important because it provides the necessary speed to back up troops on the ground. But, until President Biden does more, the Ukrainians will continue to get slaughtered. Why is the New York Times now admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop is in fact real? This program is tired of pontificators who haven't spent any time on the issue of Supreme Court nominations weighing in with their misinformation. To think that Democrats can do whatever they want because they control the White House is absurd. They can't just hand out judgeships! The judicial philosophy of any jurist on the high court should be known before a Justice is confirmed. For Ketanji Brown-Jackson to claim that she has no judicial philosophy means she's hiding it, but obviously the hard left has endorsed her because of her judicial philosophy. Afterward, Biden says that everyone knows someone who's had their nude photographs posted online and moved to include this in the Violence against Women Act (VAWA). Congress is also focused on domestic issues like spending billions more on coronavirus.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
