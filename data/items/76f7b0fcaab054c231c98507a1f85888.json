  "description": "<p>Shanna Tellerman, the CEO of e-design platform Modsy, has a background in tech. She worked at Autodesk and Google before the frustration of decorating her own home led her to an idea: why not use 3D rendering to power the design process and bring it to a wider audience? Seven years later, Modsy has raised more than seventy million dollars, employed hundreds of e-designers, and executed thousands of projects for clients all over the world. On this episode of the podcast, Tellerman speaks with host Dennis Scully about what artificial intelligence can and can’t do in design, how Modsy could work with high-end designers, and what the future holds for technology in the home industry. </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.theshadestore.com/customer-service/to-the-trade\">The Shade Store</a> and <a href=\"https://crypton.com/\">Crypton</a>.</p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"www.modsy.com\"><strong>Modsy</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\"><strong>Dennis Scully</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a></p>\n",
