A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \n\nNow that the election is out of the way, the protests begin, the riots, crying and concern moves in full force. \nWith Trump elected, and Hillary effectively eliminated from politics, we now need to move forward and govern. We need to do what has always been done, build coalitions, move to the center, do what's best for America and return to the traditional approach of politics, working with the otherside. Can we do this? I think so, Lets see what's in store in the near future. \n\nPodcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
