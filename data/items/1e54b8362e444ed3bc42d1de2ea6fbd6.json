Merely walking down a simple flight of stairs or lifting a a book is excruciating. Knife-like pains cause you to scream so loudly, your neighbor calls 911. Then one day you collapse at work and awake in the hospital to discover you have suffered 36 embolisms that are filling your lungs with blood so quickly, drowning is a very real possibility.</p><p>Now imagine yourself a couple years later in a tropical jungle competing in&nbsp;La Ruta Del Conquistadores.&nbsp;Widely considered one of the toughest endurance challenges on the planet, La Ruta&nbsp;is a&nbsp;3-day, 161-mile mountain bike race with over 29,000 feet of climbing that traverses Costa Rica from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>This is the incredible arc of today's guest, Seamus Mullen.</p><p>An award-winning New York City chef, restaurateur and cookbook author known for his inventive yet approachable Spanish cuisine, Seamus is the proprietor of several restaurants, including&nbsp;Tertulia (a finalist for the James Beard Foundation Award for “Best New Restaurant”), El Colmado, a Spanish tapas and wine bar at Gotham West Market, and Sea Containers at Mondrian London.</p><p>A semi-finalist for Best Chef NYC by the James Beard Foundation 3 years in a row, Seamus was also one of 3 finalists on the Food Network’s The Next Iron Chef.&nbsp;He&nbsp;frequents the&nbsp;popular Food Network series Chopped&nbsp;and Beat Bobby Flay&nbsp;as a featured judge and is a recurring guest on programs such as The Today Show, The Martha Stewart Show, and CBS This Morning.</p><p>But the important things in life snapped into focus for Seamus in 2007 when he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that precipitated a near death experience and quite literally brought him to his knees.</p><p>A once&nbsp;avid cyclist who raced competitively in his twenties, Seamus suddenly found himself unable to properly function.</p><p>Pedal a bike? A pipe dream.</p><p>Seamus was faced with a choice. Either live out the remainder of his days with unbearable suffering, or take matters into his own hands. He chose the latter.</p><p>It wasn't easy. And it wasn't overnight.
