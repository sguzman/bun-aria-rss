  "description": "<p>We’ve always said that this series was about so much more than <em>this</em> election. As we’ve shown in the first four episodes, the voting issues of our past — and how we respond to them — pave the way forward, shaping future elections, including the history-making moment we are living in today. But now that we’re face-to-face with the 2020 presidential race, it’s time to start diving into it. On this episode of Turnout with Katie Couric, Katie sorts through some of the week’s big election stories. Then, an interview with newly retired top GOP election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg about his blunt and public rebuke of President Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud. Ginsberg talks about the inherent difference between Republican and Democratic election policy, the impact of the 2000 Florida recount, and why Democrats’ worst fears about what could happen after November 3 may be unfounded. </p><p><strong>Read Benjamin Ginsberg’s Washington Post op-eds:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/republicans-have-insufficient-evidence-call-elections-rigged-fraudulent/\"><strong>Republicans have insufficient evidence to call elections ‘rigged’ and ‘fraudulent’</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/29/how-trumps-evidence-free-attacks-elections-damage-republican-party/\"><strong>How Trump’s evidence-free attacks on elections damage the Republican party</strong></a></p><p><strong>Stream Recount on </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Recount-Kevin-Spacey/dp/B003URYMY0\"><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://play.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GVU3SLggUVVFvjSoJAXmm\"><strong>HBO Max</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/movie/recount-8ec94808-847a-4d5a-baa3-c3d90e326a10\"><strong>HULU</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
