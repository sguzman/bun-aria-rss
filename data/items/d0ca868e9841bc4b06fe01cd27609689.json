  "description": "<p>On this episode, we celebrate our three year anniversary. It's been a wonderful journey! We have some new rewards for Executive Producers, which means more great stuff for them and we announce those changes on this episode. Last year, we held our first flash fiction contest to celebrate our special occasion and we have done it again this year. We share our two runner-ups and our three winners and read their contributions. And then Miranda Enzor, creator of the Spooky Little Halloween blog, joins us to talk all things Halloween and get us in the right frame of mind for our favorite holiday. As if we aren't always in that frame of mind!</p> <p>Check out our website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Miranda's website: <a href= \"http://spookylittlehalloween.com\">http://spookylittlehalloween.com</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and get some amazing rewards: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
