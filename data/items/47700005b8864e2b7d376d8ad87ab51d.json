  "description": "<p>When we think about health, we usually think about diet and exercise. We think about the things we are doing for our physical body to promote wellness. But what about the things we can’t see? Relationships are a big one. For example. committing just ten to fifteen minutes a day to talking to someone we love is a powerful way to keep ourselves happy and connected, especially now during this time of coronavirus quarantine. Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy,</em> I talk with Dr. Vivek Murthy about nurturing greater connection and what it means for our health.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Murthy served as the 19th Surgeon General of the United States between 2014-2017. As the Vice Admiral of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, he commanded a uniformed service of 6,600 public health officers globally. During his tenure, Dr. Murthy launched the TurnTheTide campaign, catalyzing a movement among health professionals to address the nation’s opioid crisis. He also issued the first Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health, calling for expanded access to prevention and treatment and for recognizing addiction as a chronic illness, not a character flaw. In 2017, Dr. Murthy focused his attention on chronic stress and loneliness as prevalent problems that have profound implications for health, productivity, and happiness. His book <em>Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World</em> was just published on April 28th.</p><br><p>*For context, this episode was recorded in February 2020.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Simple Mills and Branch Basics.</p><br><p>There are definitely not many baking mixes out there I trust.
