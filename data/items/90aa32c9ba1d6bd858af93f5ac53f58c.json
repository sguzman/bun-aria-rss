We need your help to reach that amount before December 31st.Reaching that goal will mean covering fixed costs: Broadcast studio rental. A sound engineer and board operator. Website hosting. Podcast hosting. The toll-free phone line. Episode distribution through the Public Radio Satellite System and PRX.What you may not know is that when you donate to your local station — as you should — none of that money goes to A Way with Words. We’re independent of any radio station and independent of NPR. We receive no funds from them at all.This means, in part, that A Way with Words can carry out its educational mission without excessive bureaucracy and overhead costs. It also means we can make it available to everyone, completely free of charge.But it also means that to do well, we require support from our listeners. We need your donations, whether you listen online or on the air.Give Now! http://waywordradio.org/donateYou can also send your donations by postal mail to this address:\n\nWayword, Inc.P.O.
