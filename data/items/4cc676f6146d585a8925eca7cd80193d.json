  "description": "<p>We had the chance to catch up with the homies T-Mo, Big Gipp, Kujo and Cee-Lo Green otherwise known as \"The Goodie Mob\". We chopped it up about their start in the game, how they came up together, their extra-curricular activities, and discussed some good ol' fashioned gangsterism. We also went in depth with Kujo about the accident that cost him part of his leg and how it gave him a new perspective. The audio on this EP isn't perfect, but you can hear what's going on. Everything we do isn't in the studio, we are basically just recording conversations with the homies, so we don't wanna hear no complaints, just enjoy the show lol. Cee-Lo was in the whip and the other homies were in traffic, but we made it happen.</p><p>oh and make sure you stream their new album \"Survival Kit\" featuring Andre 3000, Big Boi, Big Rube and the legendary Chuck D.
