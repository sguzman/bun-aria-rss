  "description": "<p>Your dad is a pedophile. He's taken naked pictures of kids, including one of your cousins on your mom's side, and posted them online. He's been caught by the police, but he's been let go on some kind of probation.</p>\n<p>You don't know how to handle the situation. For some context, You're a high functioning autistic person. You're able to live on your own, take care of yourself, and hold down a full time job, but you have a lot of problems making and maintaining friendships and you have enough sensory issues that you don't like to leave your house any more than you need to.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it would be a great relief to you if you never had to see or hear from your parents again. On the other hand, the number of people in your support network is already quite small, and you wouldn't want to lose contact with your sister, who has very severe mental health problems and is still living at home. What should you do?</p>\n<p>This is pretty dark and heavy territory, but we'll do our best to offer some real advice on this and much more in this Feedback Friday.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
