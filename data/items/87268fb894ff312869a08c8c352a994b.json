  "description": "<p>After the disastrous outcome of Saco III in the summer, The Kirk Minihane Show makes its return to Maine for one thing and one thing only... Redemption. Kirk addressed why Justin was not there for the show following a big week of taking down WEEI's phone lines. Jeff D Lowe checks in live for a little Kirk vs. The Minifans in The Dozen Trivia. Quantum Week Chris and Matt Carano are fighting on the show and behind the scenes, so of course that fight needed to take over the main stage.
