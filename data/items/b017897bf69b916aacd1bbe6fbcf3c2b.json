  "description": "In today’s podcast we hear some preliminary news about ISIS information operations as expressed in captured files. Hacktivists experience remorse and debate doxing ethics. We review the speculation about the DNC hack and note that another Democratic Party campaign organization may also have been compromised. State-sponsored hacking is driving enterprises to seek help from security companies. The University of Maryland's Jonathan Katz tells us about post-quantum encryption, and  Daniel Ennis, former NTOC Director at NSA and currently Executive Director of the University of Maryland Global initiative on Cyber, shares his thoughts on his time with the agency, and the need for cooperation in cybersecurity by government, universities, and industry. Pokémon trainers are still going where they shouldn’t.",
