  "description": "<p>In a paper published in the journal Physics Essays in 2021, the author D.L.\nMamas writes \"A polarized photon interacts with a polarizer through the\ncomponent of the photon's electric field which is aligned with the polarizer.\nThis component varies as the cosine of the angle through which the polarizer is\nrotated, explaining the cosine observed in Bell test data. Quantum mechanics is\nunnecessary and plays no role\". Mamas is right that according to this physical\nmodel, one will observe a negative cosine. However, the amplitude of the cosine\ncurve is 50%, not 100%, and it consequently does not violate any Bell-CHSH\ninequality. Mamas' physical model is a classic local hidden variables model.\nThe result is illustrated with a Monte Carlo simulation.\n</p>",
