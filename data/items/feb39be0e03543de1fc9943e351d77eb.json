  "description": "Roger Latimer says he was beaten by guards in a security camera blind spot at Western Illinois Correctional Center. He complained at the prison. He complained to local officials. He asked medical staff to take pictures. Nothing happened. Then another prisoner, Larry Earvin, died after an altercation with guards in the same blind spot.<br/><br/>In this episode of <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/shows/motive/8c9f445c-4f62-46d6-a7f6-dc70a835e99b\">WBEZ Chicago's <em>Motive </em>podcast</a>, host Shannon Heffernan tracks the pattern of beatings in that blind spot, surfacing nine additional cases, sometimes involving the same guards, using very similar behavior in the same location. We ask the question of why this pattern persisted, even as prisoners like Latimer tried to stop it.<br/><br/>Season 4 of <em>Motive </em>investigates the hidden world of big prisons in small towns. Places where everyone knows each other and difficult truths get buried.<br/><br/>Listen to <em>Motive </em>on<em> </em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motive/id1479220905\">Apple podcasts</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5ymaeoUvVnSrT5CWJ04lFk\">Spotify</a>.
