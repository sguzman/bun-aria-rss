  "description": "In Sochi, Russia, Iran and Turkey got together to divvy up parts of the Middle East.  It was eerily similar to a meeting 780 miles and 72 years earlier...in Yalta, where the allied powers met to discuss the face of post-War Europe.  But this time: no USA.  America was sidelined...as it has been worldwide since the beginning of this administration.  On this episode of Deep State Radio, Kori Schake of Stanford, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Ed Luce of the Financial Times discuss the consequences of the U.S. becoming just a spectator with regard to most key issues on the global stage...and who is stepping up to fill the void left by the U.S.  Also: as an added bonus...we discuss the royal wedding and Rosa and Ed's experiences with the Queen.
