  "description": "This week we give a warm welcome to Julie Massucco Kleiner and Melissa Warner, founding designers of the West Coast-based firm Massucco Warner. Their portfolio is a joy to look at, so we couldn’t wait to catch up with them to talk about using color, texture, and unexpected details in an approachable way. We also talk with Julie and Melissa about patterns, their great lamp game, making the most of the space in a double-height room, the importance of using samples, and color threading from room to room.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nWhy Julie and Melissa love working with color so much, and how they pull it off in such a fun and approachable way.\n\nNeutral doesn’t always have to mean beige or white, it can be navy blue or any other solid color when done correctly.\n\nWays we can color thread throughout our home so colors complement rather than compete with one another.\n\nUsing samples are important and leave them out long enough to decide if it really is a fit for your everyday life long term.\n\nWays that Julie and Melissa create beautiful and chic looks in high traffic areas using textures such as faux leather.\n\nHow to use a colors you may be unsure of, like mustard yellow in a kitchen.\n\nRecommendations for tying in our outdoor furniture with indoor colors so they seamlessly flow.\n\nA few rules of thumb for using patterns and how adding another color can help break up and tone down the pattern.\n\nWays to create a focal point from scratch.\n\nLamps can be a great source of color and flair to a room without making a huge commitment.\n\nHow to treat a double-height room without over-engineering it.\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n@massuccowarner \nMassucco Warner\nDecorating Dilemma:\nThe table and the chairs totally fit the room, but we think you can tweak the size of the rug and beef it up to cover more space! You want to be able to pull your chairs out and still have them on the rug. As far as your seats, it’s super easy to unscrew cushions (and even may be fun to do@) and recover them with a navy and white performance fabric. Two smaller lights over the island and a big one over the dining table could be a great call!\nFind all of the Show Notes at Ballarddesigns.com/podcast.",
