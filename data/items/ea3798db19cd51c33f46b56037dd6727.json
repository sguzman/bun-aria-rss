  "description": "Lisa and Joel Guy Sr. were said to be loving, kind hearted and passionate people. The two of them had raised a family together and at 55 and 61 years old were ready to retire. One caveat with their plan was that they were still providing for their grown son Joel Guy Jr. They had plans to tell him that he was going to need to start supporting himself around Christmas. Unfortunately they would not be able to celebrate their next Christmas. Their only son would brutally murder them in their home on Thanksgiving weekend.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.young-williams.org/support/one-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Young Williams Animal Center donation page to donate in honor of Joel Guy Sr. and Lisa Guy</a><br>\n<br>\n\n<strong>As always, thank you to our sponsors:</strong>\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>MeUndies: </strong>To get 15% off your first order, free shipping, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee, go to <a href=\"http://MeUndies.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">MeUndies.com/MORBID</a>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>HelloFresh: </strong>Go to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid16\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid16</a> and use code morbid16 for up to 16 free meals AND 3 free gifts! \n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Babbel: </strong>When you purchase a 3-month Babbel subscription, you’ll get an additional 3 months for FREE.  Just go to <a href=\"http://BABBEL.com\" target=\"_blank\">BABBEL.com</a> and use promo code MORBID\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Rothy’s: </strong>Get $20 off your first purchase at <a href=\"http://rothys.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">rothys.com/MORBID</a>\n\n\n<br>\n<strong>Peloton:</strong> Visit <a href=\"http://onepeloton.com/\" target=\"_blank\">onepeloton.com</a> to learn more<br>\n<br>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
