  "description": "<p>A few years ago, Connor and Dan discussed the paradox of duplication that teleportation can cause. Now that Connor has taken a dip into the cool waters of Star Trek, Dan figures it’s time to revisit this sci-fi heavy thought experiment. Together, they attempt to answer the question: Who is coming out of the transporter? Me? Or just a copy of me? And what if we both survive and continue to exist. Hopefully this episode won’t cause you to lose your sense of identity, but maybe that wouldn’t be the worst thing…</p>",
