  "description": "Everything humanity has ever created – the good and the bad – started with imagination. But what if we could harness the power of imagination to build a truly just future for Black people? To dream so big the world as it exists can’t even contain our vision? We spoke with adrienne maree brown, an author and activist behind many books, including \"Octavia's Brood\" and \"Emergent Strategy,\" that explore visionary ways to build a joyful, liberated future for Black people using nature, science fiction, pleasure, and afrofuturism as jumping off points. If we’re going to build a liberated Black future, we’ve got to dream big.
