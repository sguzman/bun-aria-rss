  "description": "<p>Few things change your life as much as finding out you're pregnant- it’s an exciting period of time, but it’s also slightly stressful! One of the reasons is because the clock is ticking and you know you’ve got less than 9 months to get your act together. It lights a fire under you and it’s an amazing period of transformation, for all parties involved! And similarly when it comes to our money, a special circumstance can often be the stimulus we need to make wiser financial moves, but what if it’s not enough? Or what if you don’t have any unique excuses to get your financial house in order? Well that’s where money challenges come in handy. Sometimes the reason that we’re not able to make any progress with our money is because we don’t have clear actionable steps that we can immediately take. Maybe you don’t have any accountability or you think it’ll be a load of drudgery. Whether you’re looking to spend less, boost your earning, or invest more of your money, this episode is all about jarring you out of your typical habits and routines. Sometimes what you need is a challenge that can serve as a wake up call to further you along in your financial journey.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Barrel Wild Sinister Kid by Trillium Brewing - a big thanks to Ali for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
