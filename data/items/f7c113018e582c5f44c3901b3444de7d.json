This can lead to a range of symptoms including heavy, painful periods, painful intercourse, infertility, hormonal issues, and more. In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Cindy Geyer to discuss how they use the principles of Functional Medicine to get to the root causes of endometriosis. They discuss why addressing chronic inflammation and supporting gut health are primary focuses when treating patients, genetic and lifestyle factors that can lead to endometriosis, and much more.</p><br><p>Dr. Cindy Geyer received her bachelor of science and her doctor of medicine degrees, with honors, from the Ohio State University. She completed residency in internal medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. and is triple board certified in internal medicine, integrative medicine, and lifestyle medicine. She joined The Ultrawellness Center in 2021 after practicing and serving as the medical director at Canyon Ranch for 23 years. She has served on the Board of Directors for the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and is a recently elected fellow of ACLM. Dr. Geyer has been a core faculty member at The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) for 20 years, teaching physicians and other healthcare professionals how to use food and lifestyle to address health concerns in their own lives and those of their patients. A clinician, educator, and avid hiker, she is passionate about collaborative approaches to health and wellness: from the integrative team model in working with individual patients, to community partnerships that together can affect healthy changes in the places people live and work.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Paleovalley and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Paleovalley is offering 15% off your entire first order.
