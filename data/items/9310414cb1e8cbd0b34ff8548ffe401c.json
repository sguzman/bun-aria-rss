  "description": "<p>This week’s guest is <strong>Brad Hargreaves</strong>, the founder of co-living company Common. Co-living is a relatively new phenomenon, sometimes oversimplified as “dorms for grownups.” But there’s a lot more to it than that, and in conversation with host Dennis Scully, Hargreaves explains the demographic changes and economic forces that have created a market for shared housing—at any age. In the first half of the episode, he discusses the similarities between education and real estate, why developers are getting tired of luxury housing, and how COVID might disrupt commercial real estate in unexpected ways. <i>This episode is sponsored by Buildlane and The Urban Electric Co.</i></p>\n",
