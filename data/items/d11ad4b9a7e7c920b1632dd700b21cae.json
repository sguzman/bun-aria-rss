  "description": "<p>In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made towards understanding\nthe exotic physics emerging from competition between various ordering\ntendencies in strongly correlated systems. Employing state-of-the-art quantum\nMonte-Carlo simulation, we investigate an interacting SU($N$) fermionic model\nwith varying interaction strength and value of $N$, and unveil the ground-state\nphase diagram of the model exhibiting a plethora of exotic phases. For small\nvalue of $N$, namely $N=2,3$, the ground state is antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nphase, whereas in the large-$N$ limit, valence bound solid (VBS) order is\ndominant. For the intermediate value of $N$ such as $N=4$, remarkably, our\nstudy reveals distinct VBS orders appear in the weak and strong coupling\nregimes. More fantastically, the competition between staggered and columnar VBS\nordering tendencies gives rise to a Mott insulating phase without spontaneously\nsymmetry breaking (SSB), existing in a large interacting parameter regime,\nwhich is consistent with a gapped quantum spin liquid. Our study not only\nprovides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body\nsystems, but also offers a novel route towards searching for exotic states of\nmatter such as quantum spin liquid in realistic quantum materials.\n</p>",
