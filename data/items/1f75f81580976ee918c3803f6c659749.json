  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, in Marx's time, some thinkers challenged his views, such as philosopher Richard M. Weaver author of \"Ideas Have Consequences.\" In today's times, we have pseudo-scholars who prolong conflict for the sake of argument. One example is the current push to continue President Trump's impeachment beyond his time in office. This is unconstitutional and reminiscent of Stalin and Trotsky who punitively chased down former government officials. This is not justice, it's the type of political stunt one typically sees in third-world countries.  Then, the media is ignoring the anti-trust violations alleged against Big Tech. The press hasn't mentioned tech censorship against one's speech. They simply don't care because Marxist corporatists only push a political agenda that eliminates their competition, even it if comes at the cost of 'We The People.'  Finally, Daniel Horowitz calls in to why he thinks free speech is about to criminalized.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
