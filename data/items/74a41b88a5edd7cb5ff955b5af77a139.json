    "media:description": "Two simulations of the three-body problem. The forces between the masses in the simulation on the left are proportional to 1/r². The forces between the masses in the simulation on the right are proportional to sin(r)/r². In both simulations, all three masses have the same starting positions and velocities.\n\nThe simulation on the right is basically nonsense - it's just for fun.\n\n- all masses equal\n- symmetric start\n- 25fps, 60s\n\n#Physics #PhysicsSimulations #ThreeBodyProblem #Gravity",
