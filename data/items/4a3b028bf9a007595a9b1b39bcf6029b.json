Actually, it's vicious, nasty murders that make very little sense, and that's only the start. We can't say \"why??\" quite enough during this episode, as the brutality is just so out of proportion. And can a 14 year old girl really be part of a couple of adult's murder plan? This one will keep you head shaking, for a while!</p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out moonshine & chili are probably bad to eat & drink, with no bathrooms around, that you can absolutely be too nice, and that some people seem to have zero moral compass!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
