  "description": "Today we wanted to talk about a home we dedicated to tiger oak that was in the Parade of Homes in Utah and won many awards for its beauty. We discuss the various designs and choices we went with for our client, which you can see in our portfolio on our website linked below. We chose the paint color and style before choosing the furniture or finishing, which helped guide us in deciding on how to approach these other aspects. One unique thing about this home is when you enter it, you can see all the way to the back end, which gives you a greater understanding of depth and how big the place is. In the kitchen there are two tiger oak islands, one of which was a butcher block top and the other was marble, and then we put a big service window which is such a great party trick. <br /><br />About Tiger Oak and the client 2:28<br />The entryway 6:26<br />The neon sign 12:31<br />The parlor 14:37<br />The family room 18:00<br />The dining room 21:08<br />The kitchen 23:01<br />The pantry 29:23<br />The pink heron powder bath 30:44<br /><br />“That’s the cool thing about color blocking. Do you know what I mean? When you’re just working with colors in general, once you figure out your color, then you have that out, and then all the other decisions can kind of help decide themselves, especially when you had the wallpaper. That was happy up there and it had so many tones to pull from.” 16:46<br /> <br /><a href=\"https://www.alicelaneinteriordesign.com/tiger-oak\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.alicelaneinteriordesign.com/tiger-oak</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
