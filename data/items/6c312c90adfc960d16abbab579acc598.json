  "description": "American’s pay double what every other developed nation in the world pays for healthcare. Does that mean that we are the healthiest? No. In fact, we are the worst of them all. American healthcare is plagued by things like preventable medical error, high taxes, and the tens of thousands of people that die each year from treatable illness due to being unable to afford the care they require. In his book The Purple World: Healing the Harm in American Health Care (Scrivener Books, 2018), Dr. Joseph Jarvis not only digs into how we got here and who is to blame, but he also lays out a solution for fixing the American healthcare system. In this book Dr. Jarvis explains how he feels a solution can be implemented both quickly and effectively. He has a very unique take on healthcare reform.\nJeremy Corr is the co-host of the hit Fixing Healthcare podcast along with industry thought leader Dr. Robert Pearl. A University of Iowa history alumnus, Jeremy is curious and passionate about all things healthcare, which means he’s always up for a good discussion!
