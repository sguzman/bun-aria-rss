  "description": "<p>The prospect theory's value function is usually concave for gains, commonly\nconvex for losses, and generally steeper for losses than for gains. The neural\nsystem is quite different from the loss and gains sides. Four new studies on\nneurons related to this issue have examined neuronal responses to losses,\ngains, and reference points, respectively. The value function with a neuronal\ncusp could have variations and behavior cusps with catastrophe where a trader\ncloses her position.\n</p>",
