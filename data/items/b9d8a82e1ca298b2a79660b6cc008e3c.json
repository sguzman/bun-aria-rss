  "description": "In this installment of Best Of The Gist, we listen back to Mike’s August 7, 2020 interview with Dr. Eddie Glaude, Jr. of Princeton University. The two discussed Glaude’s newest book and its release in the context of the recent civil uprisings. Begin Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own poses a fundamental argument around how getting it wrong culturally has hurt the fabric of our nation. Glaude helps make sense of where we are today and explains that Baldwin understood our messy and uneven economic, social, and political lives are simply a reflection of our individual selves.\nAnd then we listen back to Mike’s Spiel from last Friday, June 10, 2022, when he noticed that a particular world came up again and again when the media described the first January 6th hearing. Trust us…it’s powerful.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
