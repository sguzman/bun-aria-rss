  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 53, Whits checks in from Secaucus to talk about his riotous appearance on Barstool Radio, his years-in-the-making beating from Tim Jackman, the Pulitzer-worthy photo it produced, and his Internet redemption when a listener posted a clip of him defending Colby Armstrong after a hard hit. The boys also talk about Wednesday's donnybrook (by today's standards) between Detroit and Calgary, Matthew Tkachuk becoming a modern day Claude Lemieux at such a young age, the NHL players in this year's HHOF class, and much more. The fellas then answer #AllRightHamilton questions and discuss the excellent doc ICE GUARDIANS.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
