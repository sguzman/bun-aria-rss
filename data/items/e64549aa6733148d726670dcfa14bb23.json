  "description": "This Norwegian fairy tale told by Emily Hennessey is about a little boy who is tricked by a troll. He nearly ends up in the cooking pot,\nbut luckily he outwits the scary troll. You have to be brave to listen to this story, because it’s about a troll who eats children. But it’s only a story troll and it’s a great story. If scary stories aren’t for you, then try The Spinning Sisters which we’ll post at the same time as an alternative ‘happy ending’ fairy tale.\n\n\n\nSee acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.",
