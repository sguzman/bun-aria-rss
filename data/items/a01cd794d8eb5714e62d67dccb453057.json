  "description": "Not since Chevy Chase's European Vacation has an American brought so much mayhem to U.S. Trans-Atlantic Relations.  Perhaps new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can start to make amends on his first trip as America's chief diplomat.  But if the recent visit of French President Macron is any indication, it seems unlikely.  For all the diplomatic foreplay between the two leaders, Macron achieved none of his goals...and the outlook for German Chancellor Merkel's trip is worse if anything.  And don't even get us started on what's likely to happen when Trump visits the U.K. in a couple months.  Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Julie Smith and Evelyn Farkas discuss...and throw in a few words on Kim Jong Un, Ric Grenell and Bill Cosby as well.
