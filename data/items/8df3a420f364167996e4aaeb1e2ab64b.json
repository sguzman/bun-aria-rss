  "description": "<p>We’re entering a time of year where gratitude is on our minds.

There’s even powerful research on the psychological and physiological effect of gratitude and appreciation, both as a state and a willful intervention.</p><p>So, we wanted to take the occasion of this week to explore a few different takes on gratitude, appreciation, and generosity-of-spirit, drawing upon conversations I’ve had over the years with famed author and social-observer extraordinaire, Anne Lamott, writer, producer, and big thinker, Janice Kaplan, and I’m also weaving in a few thoughts from one of my books, <em>How to Live a Good Life.&nbsp;</em></p><p>I hope you enjoy this exploration of gratitude, attentiveness, and appreciation, how it changes us, and why we might want to bring more of it into our experience of life.</p><p>You can find Anne Lamott at: <a href=\"https://sites.prh.com/dusknightdawntour\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/annelamott/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rYhHB5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dusk Night Dawn</em></a></p><p>You can find Janice Kaplan at: <a href=\"http://www.janicekaplan.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/janice.kaplan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oUOCH7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Gratitude Diaries</em></a></p><p>You can find the audiobook Jonathan's book at: <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Live-a-Good-Life-Audiobook/B01M69L7BP?source_code=AUDFPWS0223189MWT-BK-ACX0-071935&ref=acx_bty_BK_ACX0_071935_rh_us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Live a Good Life</em></a></p><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode:</strong></p><p>You’ll also love the full-length conversations we had with <a href=\"https://pod.link/goodlifeproject/episode/6e786611b48cc0003e29aab6c515b658\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Lamott</a> & <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/janice-kaplan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Janice Kaplan</a>.</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
