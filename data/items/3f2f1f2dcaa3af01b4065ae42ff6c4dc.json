    "media:description": "When people started realizing that the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes were not just promoting culture and language, Confucius Institutes closed down all around the US. By 2022, only about 14 colleges and universities still had their original Confucius Institute programs. But that doesn't mean they went away. Similar programs and/or partnership with China remained intact. In this episode of China Uncensored, we look at how China rebranded Confucius Institutes to hide their subversive past, what US legislation has been passed targeting Confucius Institutes, and how the CCP-administered Confucius Classrooms have survived the Confucius Institute shutdowns. \n\nYouTube demonetizes our channels, we need your support!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ChinaUncensored\nhttps://chinauncensored.locals.com\n\nWe also accept bitcoin!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin\n\nBuy our merchandise!\nhttps://chinauncensored.tv/merchandise\n\nMake sure to share this video with your friends!\n______________________________\nSubscribe for updates:\nyoutube.com/ChinaUncensored?sub_confirmation=1\n\n______________________________\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaUncensored\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/ChinaUncensored\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/ChinaUncensored\n\nAnd check out the China Unscripted podcast!\nhttps://youtube.com/chinaunscripted\n\n#China\n______________________________\n© All Rights Reserved.",
