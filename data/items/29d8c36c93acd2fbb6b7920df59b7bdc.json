What appears to be ‘safe’ is sometimes the most dangerous thing you can be doing for your life”</p><p>Guru Singh</p><br><p><br></p><p>Welcome to yet another edition&nbsp;Guru Corner featuring Guru Singh, my favorite teacher on all things mystic and metaphysical.</p><p>Fusing Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism, Guru Singh is a celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi and master spiritual teacher who has been studying and teaching&nbsp;Kundalini Yoga&nbsp;for more than 40 years. He is&nbsp;the author of several books, a powerful lecturer and&nbsp;behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.</p><p>A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also an accomplished musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960's. When he isn’t laying down tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.yogawestla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoga West,</a>&nbsp;his Los Angeles home base.</p><br><p>Today we spin the wheel on positivity. Not your typical disquisition on the benefits of adopting a positive mental attitude, we take a more nuanced approach to self-awareness. Focusing on receptivity over repression, it's a call to embrace the power of both negativity and positivity as important forces to be experienced without getting lost in either extreme. And we discuss how to break free from the entrenched, looping stories we tell ourselves about ourselves that don't serve the lives we aspire to lead.</p><p>Note: If you missed my previous conversations with Guru Singh, start with episode <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll267\" target=\"_blank\">267</a> and then enjoy episodes <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll332\" target=\"_blank\">332,</a><a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll368\" target=\"_blank\">368</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll393\" target=\"_blank\">393</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/guru-corner-400/\" target=\"_blank\">400</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/guru-corner-418/\" target=\"_blank\">418</a>.</p><p>Final Note: You can watch our conversation on YouTube at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/gurucorner434b\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/gurucorner434b</a>&nbsp;and the show is also now available on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>I love this beautiful being.
