  "title": "Ep 271 | Phil Shows an Unwelcome Visitor What Happens to Mayhaw Thieves",
  "description": "Phil learns that a Facebook commenter \"strongly dislikes\" him, and he's thoroughly amused. It's mayhaw season, and Phil is feeling his age after picking fruit. Jase is feeling it too after taking on his archnemesis — a fly. Phil is not about to let a furry little trespasser stand between him and some mayhaw jelly. The guys discuss trees and fruit in the Bible, free will, why God allowed evil into the world, poisonous plants, and the intelligent design of trees. Jase chuckles at weather people who mispronounce the names of parishes. And Phil asks the audience for advice on transplanting his mayhaw trees.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
