In my opinion, adopting a plant-based is the single most powerful and impactful thing you can possibly do as a conscious, compassionate consumer. It is the medicine that will prevent and reverse chronic lifestyle disease, preserve our planet's precious resources for future generations, and put an end to mass animal cruelty.</p><p>Vegan has indeed gone mainstream. That's awesome. But let's not be naïve.
