  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie and Tony jump back into the Petersburg Campaign of 1864. The guys pick up where they left off with Part 1, when the first Union attempts to take the city by direct assault failed on June 18th. The topic for this episode are the events that took place during the rest of June and July of that bloody year around the railroads of Petersburg. The guys discuss the fighting at Jerusalem Plank Road, the Wilson-Kautz Raid, the diversionary fighting at Deep Bottom and most notably, the bloody and atrocious debacle at the Crater, where Confederate soldiers committed heinous war crimes against Black Union soldiers that were trying to surrender following the failure of the attack. Strap in for the next installment in the Petersburg series and stay tuned for more to come. Enjoy!</p>",
