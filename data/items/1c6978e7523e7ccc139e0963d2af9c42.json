  "description": "<p>This week we’re launching a new series called “Choosing Significance.” In this first episode, John Maxwell shares that selfishness and significance are incompatible. John discusses the three elements that will determine whether we live out of selfishness or significance: motives, maturity, and mindset.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Richard Chancy follow-up with a discussion about how motives, maturity, and mindset play out in our day-to-day lives, and they share examples of what these elements look like in their own lives at work and at home. They discuss the role of accepting responsibility in becoming a mature leader and end with a challenge to create meaning for someone in a way they can’t do for themselves.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Choosing Significance Worksheet that includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
