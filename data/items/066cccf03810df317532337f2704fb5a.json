  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Pod, Digs continues to reluctantly accept his role as the host of the show, the guys reminisce about a road trip to Pittsburgh that comes back to one memory, and they introduce a few new segments. On this week’s “Sh*t I’ve Seen on the Internet” the guys discuss a tweet going around that asks what movie traumatizes you as a kid and the guys have some interesting answers. They also try to choose what fruit or vegetable is the easiest to throw the farthest distance, decide whether or not tomfoolery was involved in making Foxy’s legs look like toothpicks in a green screen photo, cover news you need to know with Nick, and give some movie/TV show picks in the new segment Check it AHT or Don’t check it AHT. Don’t forget that St. Paddy’s day merch is now available on <a href=\"http://patmcafeeshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">patmcafeeshow.com</a>, and we’re opening the search for a new original theme/intro so DM submissions to @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram. Enjoy the show, and have a great weekend.</p>\n",
