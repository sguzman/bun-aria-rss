  "description": "In this episode, Sharon talks with Dr. Becky Kennedy, a clinical psychologist who was recently named “The Millennial Parenting Whisperer” by TIME Magazine. Dr. Becky and Sharon have a conversation about communicating the tough topics with our kids; how and when to share current event news so they feel safe. Dr. Becky argues that it’s not always the information that feels scary and off-putting, but the act of having to process it alone. As parents, it's our responsibility to support our children through our loving, supportive presence and guided conversations. Children need to learn distress tolerance in order to accomplish big, meaningful things, and we help by teaching them AVP: acknowledge, validate, and permit. Acknowledge that something is happening inside of you, tell your feelings why they make sense, and give your body permission to feel what it’s feeling.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
