  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in one of the most pathetic and cowardly displays we’ve seen in a long time, a comedian issues a lengthy written apology for taking a picture with Dave Chappelle. What can we learn from this sad spectacle, if anything? And is it time to stop our obsession with taking COVID tests? The Florida surgeon general thinks so. Plus, a school district in Virginia stops grading homework assignments in the name of racial equity. And an NFL player storms off the field in the middle of a game, but is he really a victim in the middle of a mental health crisis? Is anyone responsible for their actions anymore or is every bad thing just the result of poor mental health? \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
