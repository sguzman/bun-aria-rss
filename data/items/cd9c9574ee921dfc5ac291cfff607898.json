  "title": "Kirk Minihane Gives Mercy to Blind Mike",
  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is a benevolent man. He displayed it today with his motherly gentleness towards Blind Mike after yesterday's outbreak of fake news. We learn how fond Minihane is of dead air... when he hears it on his old station. Kirk enjoys some Big Time Baseball. Blind Mike impresses us all with his super human grasp of American history. A still unshaven Steve Robinson sneaks in a honeymoon story. Now, more than ever, the crew needs sensitivity training.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
