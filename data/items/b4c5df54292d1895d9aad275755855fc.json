  "description": "<p>Our buddy Biz Nasty didn't let a little surgery keep him from joining the Chiclets crew once again. This week, the boys have a lengthy chat about Sidney Crosby's latest concussion, talk about why P.K. Subban is a lightning rod on both TV and Twitter, catch up on the playoffs, and tell some more hilarious war stories. I don't think Mike Babcock will be joining us anytime soon.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/schiclets\">barstool.link/schiclets</a></p>",
