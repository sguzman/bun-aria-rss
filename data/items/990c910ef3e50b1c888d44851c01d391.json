  "description": "Martin Mull has many job titles in front of his name: Actor, musician, painter, writer, comedian. But when he was younger, struggling to make it as any of those things, he couldn't afford heat for his apartment and had to borrow an electric blanket, which he also could not afford. Martin tells Marc how things turned around, how he found himself in music circles with the likes of Harry Nilsson and John Lennon, how his comedy performances led him to friendships with the likes of Steve Martin and Fred Willard, and how he wound up acting in everything from Roseanne to Sabrina the Teenage Witch to his new show The Cool Kids. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/nightflyers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nightflyers on SYFY</a>, <a href=\"http://newyorker.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New Yorker</a>, and <a href=\"http://ziprecruiter.com/maron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZipRecruiter</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
