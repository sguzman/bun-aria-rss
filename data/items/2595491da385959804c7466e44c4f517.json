His first big break came in the mid-70s as Bruce Springsteen’s right-hand man, guitarist, and occasional co-producer in the E Street Band.

On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Van Zandt about the budding New Jersey rock n’ roll scene in the ‘60s, and what it was like recording with legendary R&B singers like Ronnie Spector and Darlene Love. He also reminisces about first meeting Springsteen—who Van Zandt says he saw go from a shy kid who was too timid to speak, to one of the greatest entertainers of our time.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Stevie Van Zandt songs<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iIxpIqSKgsFTYL946R0JV?si=875e29872abf4999&pt=1b0a821bebff57824077e99277ea87b6\"> </a><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/30TikyLvlrXyeNThyPe3yi?si=602fdbcfad44442d&pt=62329ebab953a5d13b4d4de6d7cd03d5\">HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
