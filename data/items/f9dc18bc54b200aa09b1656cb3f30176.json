    "media:description": "For over a century, the idea of building a tunnel across the Atlantic ocean has fascinated the minds of visionaries. However, due to cost and feasibility concerns, the idea was always dismissed. Then, in 2003, engineers announced that a transatlantic tunnel was within the realms of possibility. Using a submerged floating tunnel, a connection across the northern Atlantic could potentially be built, linking New York City and London. If constructed, a transatlantic tunnel would be the largest construction project in world history. It would cost approximately 12 trillion dollars, take a century or more to build, and require thousands of workers. It would unite the Old and New Worlds, increasing tourism, business and international cooperation. Unfortunately though, it would come with a list of problems. Construction difficulty, safety hazards and cost issues would make the project incredibly challenging. Despite these issues, one day, a transatlantic tunnel may finally be built.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/04/29/the-case-for-transatlantic-undersea-trains/?sh=7c9518a84630\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/193551/atlantic-air-traffic-passengers-travelling-to-or-from-the-us/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_tunnel\nhttps://fossbytes.com/54-minutes-to-travel-from-london-to-new-york-through-a-vacuum-transatlantic-tunnel/\nhttps://www.industrytap.com/transatlantic-meglev-train-would-be-largest-project-in-human-history/16108\nhttps://www.offshore-energy.biz/video-theoretical-transatlantic-tunnel-between-north-america-and-europe/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/04/29/the-case-for-transatlantic-undersea-trains/?sh=24823d684630\nhttps://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6134/is-a-transatlantic-tunnel-technically-possible-today-how-feasible-would-it-be\nhttps://www.maglev.net/transatlantic-maglev\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nStatens vegvesen\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ZpOWroNv0&t=1s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trwd3AhJJB0&t=2s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7en6etg2Mk\nCrossrail Project\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z38JIqGDZVU\nFemernAS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7C5DiEVpA\nCRRC\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAykxyA2pYI\nVirgin Hyperloop\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zSWagCyWio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQIihCOrvZY\nDelft Hyperloop\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTPH6CUcXT0",
