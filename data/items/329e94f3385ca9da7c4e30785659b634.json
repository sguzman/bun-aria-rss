They were Jimmie Penick, Mark Goodwin, brothers David and Keith Lawrence and William “Tony” Ault. Everyone but the latter boy already knew each other, they had long been interested in invoking the powers of satan and decided to start a cult together under the name, Satan’s Disciples. When William “Tony” Ault met them at the carnival he realized that they had some things in common and just really wanted to be part of their group. Unfortunately William would not make it through what his new friends called the “initiation process.” Instead they would torture and kill the 21 year old.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
