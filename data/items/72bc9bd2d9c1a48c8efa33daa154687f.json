  "description": "<p><p>Logan Paul comes by Barstool HQ to talk about the Challenger Games, how Ochocinco doesn't stand a chance against him, his boxing career, his brother Jake Paul's engagement to Tana Mongeau and their alleged pregnancy, aliens, what happens when you die, and how he got pink eye. Kathy Griffin also stops by to discuss her new movie, Hell of A Story, her famous picture with Donald Trump's severed head, and whether she thinks the President has treated her fairly. Summer gets canceled. The guy who called out Dina Hashem sucks. Voicemails: one haircut for life, swapping babies, switch lives with a guest.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
