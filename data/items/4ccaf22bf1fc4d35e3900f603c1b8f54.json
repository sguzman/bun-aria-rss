  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, Rudy Giuliani said that President Trump has no intention of pardoning himself but he does have the power to do so. The left has determined that Trump Constitutionally can’t pardon himself – the same leftists that despise the Constitution. But they have no constitutional background and can’t point to a single thing at the Constitutional Convention or any of the ratification conventions to support this. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment, is vested in the president. That includes federal criminal acts or possible federal criminal acts. The Constitution does not say the president cannot pardon himself, and the subject never came up in the framer’s notes. To claim that the president cannot pardon himself is rewriting Article II, Section 2. Also, the mainstream media isn’t talking about the Supreme Court ruling protecting religious liberty, but rather how a gay couple got denied from having a same-sex wedding cake baked. The couple knew the baker was an evangelical Christian and targeted him to force their agenda. Later, voting for the 2018 National Radio Hall of Fame inductees is live!
