  "description": "<p>Industrial ranking systems, such as advertising systems, rank items by\naggregating multiple objectives into one final objective to satisfy user demand\nand commercial intent. Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval,\npre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational\ncost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and\ncalculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The\nmulti-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the\nranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that\nshould be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of\nprevious stages. In this paper, we focus on the \\textbf{ranking consistency}\nbetween the pre-ranking and ranking stages. Specifically, we formally define\nthe problem of ranking consistency and propose the Ranking Consistency Score\n(RCS) metric for evaluation. We demonstrate that ranking consistency has a\ndirect impact on online performance. Compared with the traditional evaluation\nmanner that mainly focuses on the individual ranking quality of every\nobjective, RCS considers the ranking consistency of the fused final objective,\nwhich is more proper for evaluation. Finally, to improve the ranking\nconsistency, we propose several methods from the perspective of sample\nselection and learning algorithms. Experimental results on one of the biggest\nindustrial E-commerce platforms in China validate the efficacy of the proposed\nmetrics and methods.\n</p>",
