  "description": "If you had to sum up the NFL’s Week 5 in one word, it would have to be bizarre. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off the Atlanta Falcons, thanks in part to a bewildering roughing the passer call against the Falcons on a crucial third down in the fourth quarter. The Chargers survived the Browns, even after head coach Brandon Staley decided to go for it on a fourth down at midfield late in the game – with a two-point lead – and left many people, even Chargers receiver Keenan Allen, scratching his head. Matthew Stafford was sacked for the 21st time this season as the Rams still couldn’t get on the right track. So we called up our Monday morning QB, Alex Smith, and he gives us his insight on what it’s like to be in the shoes of Stafford and Allen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
