    "media:description": "Jake Paul is one of the most hated creators on YouTube. Done strategically for more revenue, at just 19, his infamy was used to get more views and money. Though he may be wealthy, he exchanged his credibility and likability for this wealth. Now he is trying to mend his image by disowning and explaining the actions of a younger Jake Paul; his struggle to shake his prior persona.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/dpevqTK\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JoonTheKing1 (@joontheking1)\n\nInspiration for the thumbnail: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbxqgEmVVm62Wo-C0ZfD_1w\n\n \nMusic Used:\n\n0:00 - 1:36\nIn My Mind - Deoxys Beats\nhttps://soundcloud.com/deoxysbeats1\n\n1:36 - 5:18\nShizuka - AERØHEAD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aerohead\n\n5:25 - 8:27\nStreet Dreams - LAKEY INSPIRED\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\n8:40 - 11:02 \ngood morning - Amine Maxwell\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aminemaxwell\n\n11:15 - 14:53\nWonder - LAKEY INSPIRED\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\n14:58 - 19:16\nThe Dreamer - LAKEY INSPIRED\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\n\n19:40 - 24:06\nSunset by - e s c p\nhttps://escp-music.bandcamp.com\n\n24:06 - 26:37\nIt's Near -  Dj Quads\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\n\n27:00 - 30:56\nsave my life again - Barradeen\nhttps://soundcloud.com/barradeen\n\n31:32 - 34:04\nyou’re thinking about that person again - Barradeen\nhttps://soundcloud.com/barradeen\n\n35:59 - 38:04\ncan i be part of your life - Barradeen\nhttps://soundcloud.com/barradeen\n\n38:16 - 40:16\nMorning Routine - Ghostrifter Official\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official\n\n41:59 - 45:17\nOcean - DeeTunez \nhttps://soundcloud.com/deetunez\n\n45:32 - 47:12\njust chilling out - Barradeen \nhttps://soundcloud.com/barradeen\n\n48:11 - 50:06\nUnder the trees - BLVK.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/yungmai\n\n50:47 - 57:34\nsakura Hz - chill \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6x1zYZR6PXhEmDY89G4rzg\nttps://soundcloud.com/sakurahertz\n\n57:49 - 1:01:35\nMe 2 - LAKEY INSPIRED (Feat.
