  "description": "<h2>1,000 Acres Of Ancestral Land Returned To Onondaga Nation</h2>\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/landback-onondaga-nation/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,000 acres of land in central New York were returned to the Onondaga Nation</a>, the original steward of the land. This decision stems from a 2018 settlement between the Natural Resource Trustees and Honeywell International, Inc., which previously owned the land and polluted it with dangerous toxins, such as mercury and heavy metals. Under this agreement, Honeywell will fund and implement 18 restoration projects, and the Onondaga Nation will lead the restoration and preservation of its land.</p>\n<p>“It is with great joy that the Onondaga Nation welcomes the return of the first substantial acreage of its ancestral homelands. The Nation can now renew its stewardship obligations to restore these lands and waters and to preserve them for the future generations yet to come,” Onondaga Nation Chief Tadodaho Sid Hill said in a statement. “The Nation hopes that this cooperative, government-to-government effort will be another step in healing between themselves and all others who live in this region which has been the homeland of the Onondaga Nation since the dawn of time.”</p>\n<p>Roxanne Khamsi, science writer based in Montreal, Canada, joins Ira to talk about this “landback victory,” which marks one of the largest returns of land to an Indigenous nation in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>Roxanne and Ira also discuss <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/landback-onondaga-nation/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">other science news of the week</a>, including why pulse oximeters aren’t inclusive of people with dark skin, how some mosquito-borne viruses trick their hosts into attracting more mosquitoes, the discovery of a one-of-a-kind carnivorous plant that hides its traps underground, why some flowers act as cesspools for bumblebees, and how relocating sea turtle eggs can lead to health issues for newborn turtles.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>A New COVID Wave Is Here, Raising The Risk Of Reinfections</h2>\n<p>Coronavirus is surging again in the United States.
