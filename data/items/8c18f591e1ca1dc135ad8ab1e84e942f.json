  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the outside report that blasted the USOC's handling of the gymnastics sex abuse case involving Larry Nassar. Also discussed is the American Athletic Conference's decision to ask its member schools to sign what's called a ``grant-of-rights'' agreement that theoretically would lock them into the conference for the length of the next media rights deal. It's a way for the conference to protect itself against marquee schools like the University of Central Florida moving to another conference. Also talked about is the city of Oakland's lawsuit against the Raiders, who are leaving for Las Vegas. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Bob Bragg</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
