  "description": "<p>The Ellis Hotel sits along Peachtree Street NW in downtown Atlanta. The original hotel here was the Winecoff Hotel and it was a grand place that dwarfed the other buildings. A devastating fire would change all of that in 1946. Over a hundred people would lose their lives in what has been dubbed the worst hotel fire in American history. Contractors can rebuild walls and slap on new paint, but they can't cover over the energy and residue left behind by such tragic circumstances. That residue seems to have fed paranormal activity and there are many experiences that people have shared throughout the years that just can't be explained. Join me as I share the history and hauntings of the Winecoff Hotel. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Jannae McCabe and features her grandfather being buried with bent legs and This Month in History features the trial of Marie Antoinette.
