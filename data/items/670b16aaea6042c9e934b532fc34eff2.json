Conservative media figures in particular slammed him for this, calling for him to be deplatformed.  Ethan defended the joke, noting that he made it to point out the guests that Ben platforms on The Daily Wire. Later doubling down during his podcast with Hasan Piker, but now both that podcast and the one with his original joke about Ben Shapiro have been removed. Hasan later saying they got hit because Ethan was being “spicy” with his jokes. \n——————————    \nProduced by: Cory Ray, Philip DeFranco\nEdited by: Christian Meeks\nArt Department: William Crespo\nWriting/Research: Maddie Crichton, Philip DeFranco\n————————————\n#EthanKlein #BenShapiro #Shorts",
