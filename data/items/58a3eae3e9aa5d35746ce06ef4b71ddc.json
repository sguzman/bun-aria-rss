One of the most significant changes for me this year was in my romantic life. I went from being in a relationship that wasn’t working to being with someone who is a force multiplier in my life. I had to be aware of my relationship patterns to break them. Are you taking the time to investigate your past and envision your future? Or are you just going to work and coming home and putting on Netflix? It’s time to wake up to your dreams. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the 13 lessons I learned this year. This has been a year of transition for me, and I’m so happy with where I am right now. I’ve gone all-in on love. I can’t wait to see what big things are around the corner.
