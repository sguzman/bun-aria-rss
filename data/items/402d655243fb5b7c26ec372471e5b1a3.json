I was recently down with the dreaded virus and never did I expect to have a robot help me during my period of illness. That very robot is the Roborock G10 – a robot vacuum/mop cleaner.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, Roborock is a technology company that is known for its range of intelligent robot vacuum cleaners and mops. The Roborock G10 is one of the latest innovations to come from the company.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31898\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31898\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/roborock.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/roborock.jpeg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/roborock-300x254.jpeg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/roborock-300x254@2x.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo © Roborock</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The arrival of the Roborock G10 at my doorstep could not have been timelier. I happened to come down with COVID-19. Of course, the two events got nothing to do with each other. Being sick means it’s all the more imperative that I keep the home clean. Yet, when one is sick, the last thing on your mind is having to do household chores. So yes, words cannot express how grateful I am to this inanimate object called Roborock G10, strange as it may sound.</p>\n<h3><strong>Setting Up </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being a non-techie person and one who hates reading instruction manuals, getting the Roborock G10 up and running was surprisingly a breeze.</p>\n<p>The Roborock G10 comes with a docking station, ramp and a cable. The vacuum unit weighs about 5kg. Upon unboxing, one will find a pictorial quick start guide that is very easy to read and understand. The instructions include how to pair your G10 with the app too. Within minutes, I got my G10 up and running.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31892\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31892\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9632.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9632.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9632-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9632-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The big chart of instructions makes a set-up a breeze. Photo © Asia 361</p></div>\n<p>In terms of design, I initially felt that the docking station is too big and takes up too much space but I got used to its size after a while. After all, the docking station needs to house the 2.9-litre clean water tank and the 2.5-litre dirty water tank. The former is for housing water to wash the mop while the latter is for housing the dirty water after washing the mop.</p>\n<p>The vacuum unit itself is white in colour and sleek in design, reminiscent of a UFO to me. The docking station is a mix of black and white. The clean white design goes well with my predominantly white home décor.</p>\n<p>Another small design feature that I appreciate is the cable management at the back of the docking station. I could coil the excess cable so that it looks neat.</p>\n<p>Here’s a look at the specifications at a glance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vacuum suction power: 2,500 Pa</li>\n<li>Sonic mopping: 3,000 vibrations per minute</li>\n<li>Water tank capacity of robot: 200 ml</li>\n<li>Dustbin capacity of robot: 470 ml</li>\n<li>Battery capacity: 5,200 mAh</li>\n<li>Mop lifting height: 5 mm</li>\n<li>Clean water tank capacity of docking station: 2.9 litres</li>\n<li>Dirty water tank capacity of docking station: 2.5 litres</li>\n<li>Docking station cleaning module: 600 rpm</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Ready, Get Set, Mop!</strong></h3>\n<p>Once the set-up is done, the Roborock G10 is pretty ready to embark on its first journey – mapping of the home layout. The G10 has a mopping range of up to 300 sqm or 3,230 sq feet, a range that should suit most homes in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The G10 works on common flooring such as marble, parquet and vinyl. Before starting the G10, I had to make sure that the floor area was clear of obstacles. I have no carpets at home but the G10 is supposedly able to surmount carpets up to 2cm thick to continue cleaning. The VibraRise technology allows the G10 to lift its mop when a carpet is detected.</p>\n<p>Everything is controlled via the mobile app and the mobile phone pretty much acts like a remote control. I didn’t have to touch the G10 unit at all. All I had to do was tap the buttons on the app.</p>\n<p>Once the G10 has scanned the layout of your house, you can view the layout on the app in three formats – 2D, 3D and Matrix.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31894\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31894\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"771\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pp.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pp-300x289.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pp-300x289@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The app shows the scanning and cleaning area of the layout. Photo © Asia 361</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am impressed by how intelligent the G10 is in detecting obstacles and navigating around them. The sensors and omni-directional wheel of the G10 helps it to slow down and avoid obstacles when necessary. If there are certain areas where you do not want the G10 to cover, it is possible to mark those no-go zones on the mobile app.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31895\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31895\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9629.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9629.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9629-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The G10 navigates between rooms easily. Photo © Asia 361</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Between my living area and my toilet, there is a groove. I had expected the robot to get stuck there but the G10 skilfully navigated in and out of the toilet without my interference. I also loved how it moved under my sofa – a hard-to-reach area that I normally dislike having to mop usually. Splendid.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31893\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31893\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9631.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9631.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9631-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9631-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The G10 can cover hard-to-reach areas such as under the sofa. Photo © Asia 361</p></div>\n<p>Now the important question – did the Roborock G10 do a good job vacuuming and mopping the floor? Yes, it did. There was no place that the G10 did not conquer at my home, except the areas with furniture, of course. It swept all dust and debris in its way with its 2,500 Pa of suction power while the sonic mop vibrates at 3,000 vibrations per minute to loosen dirt and pick up stains from the floor.</p>\n<p>The G10 also goes over each area more than once. For my cosy little abode, the G10 took 26 minutes to clean an area of 24 sqm. Once all cleaning is done, the G10 automatically returns to the docking station for the mop to be washed and cleaned – all without me lifting a finger or getting out of the bed, for that matter.</p>\n<h3><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_31896\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31896\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9645.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9645.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9645-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DC1B9645-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The G10 is perfect for homes with furkids. Photo © Asia 361</p></div>\n<p>Do I recommend the Roborock G10? As someone who does all the manual housework without help, the answer is a resounding yes. The Roborock is an immense help especially when you are busy or sick, in my case. Granted, it cannot be compared to elbow grease in cleaning out those stubborn stains, but for day-to-day cleaning, it does a very decent job. It warrants a &#8220;Domo arigato, Mr Roboto&#8221; from me.</p>\n<p>The only downside I can think of is the price. At $1,699.90, the cost might be a bit prohibitive to some people. However, time is money and if you are the sort that values your time over money, I would say go get the Roborock G10 pronto.</p>\n<p><em>You can now get the Roborock G10 at a promo price of S$959.90 on <a href=\"https://www.lazada.sg/products/new-launch-international-roborock-g10-self-washing-mop-robot-vacuum-cleaner-auto-lift-up-mop-smart-technology-sweep-i2396454588-s14079802907.html?clickTrackInfo=undefined&search=1&spm=a2o42.searchlist.list.3\">Lazada</a>. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://asia361.com/2022/10/27/roborock-g10-the-robot-that-helped-me-when-i-was-down-with-covid-19/\">Roborock G10: The Robot That Helped Me When I Was Down With COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://asia361.com\">Asia 361</a>.</p>\n",
