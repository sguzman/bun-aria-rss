  "description": "Doug Pederson is out in Philadelphia. Wait, what!? Who saw this coming a week after Black Monday?On this emergency episode, Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and producer Deebo to react to the surprise move by the Eagles. What does this signal about the future of Carson Wentz and the future of Howie Roseman? Pederson reportedly wasn't happy with control in Philly and that doesn't bode well for whoever fills the role next. Mike Kafka is a name that immediately emerged but also comes from the Andy Reid coaching tree, just like #DOUG. Would the Eagles pursue that route again? Would those attached with the Chiefs even be interested? The Pick Six Superfriends continue to evaluate where Pederson could land and where the Eagles slot on head coaching vacancy rankings.
