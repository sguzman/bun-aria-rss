  "description": "Molly Baz did not grow up in a foodie family. As a teen, she realized “food could be delicious,” as she describes it. For Molly, learning how to cook became a passion that took her from her own supper club to the kitchens of several restaurants, and to a job at Bon Appétit. Now, teaching others how to cook is what drives her. She’s been sharing recipes with fans via Patreon and on April 20, her debut cookbook drops. Titled 'Cook This Book,' it’s a brightly designed collection of signature Molly recipes, from roast chicken to jammy eggs to Caesar salad. Learn how the cookbook came together, why Molly moved to L.A., and whether she’ll return to YouTube any time soon. \n\nThank you to Crate & Barrel and Sitka Salmon Shares for supporting this episode!
