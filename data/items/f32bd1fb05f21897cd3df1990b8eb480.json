  "description": "It's time!  Today we are going to give you tips on how you can get your decorations to stand out this season. We take a tour of each space, starting with the entry scene:  We vote using real garlands outside around your door so as people arrive they can see and smell it when they arrive. Put a diffuser near the entryway with a nice seasonal fragrance to invite the holiday spirit. In the entertaining area and kitchen, we like to use a large bowl of winter fruit such as oranges and other citrus for a colorful accent and festive feel.  Don't forget some great smelling & looking soaps at your sink.  For your tree, get more ornaments than you think you need so you have plenty to work with. We love to put garland on mantles, draped asymmetrically to give it a very designer look and feel. Don't forget the music, it will be the bow on the whole package.  We have made a playlist for you here:<br /><br /><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/brkqp1d7p0h900puf7eygwo4h/playlist/3wt3i1XUY2oKhoJRatwtkA?si=CBhp_3olQxOHjqJpVhKAkQ\" rel=\"noopener\">https://open.spotify.com/user/brkqp1d7p0h900puf7eygwo4h/playlist/3wt3i1XUY2oKhoJRatwtkA?si=CBhp_3olQxOHjqJpVhKAkQ</a><br />grove.co/dearalice<br /><br />Grove.co/dearalice 1:20<br />The entry scene 3:57<br />Ornaments 10:12<br />The mantle 21:35<br />Stockings 26:38<br />The entertaining area 28:24<br />Some favorite foods, recipes, and traditions 33:06<br /><br />“And it’s just so fun when you have someone come over to make them a beautiful drink.
