And underneath my yes\nAnother yes, the yes to my body,\nJust beginning to show signs\nOf slack, and another, my grasping\nIn the dark for affirming flesh\nThat in turn says yes, yes\nLet’s rot together but not until\nWe’ve drained what sap\nIs left in these trees.\nAnd I wake in the morning\nAnd think of the coroner\nCalling to ask what color\nMy father’s eyes were,\nAnd I asked, Why? Why can’t\nYou just look — and the coroner,\nMatter-of-factly says, Decay.\nDo you want some eggs, my love?\nI have a new way of preparing them.\nAnd look, look outside, I think this weather\nHas the chance of holding.",
