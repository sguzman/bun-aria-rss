  "description": "<p>In this week’s episode, we begin a new series on “Questions I Ask Myself as a Leader.” In this two-part series, John Maxwell shares the questions he poses to himself to make sure he is continually growing and adding value to others. When we don’t ask ourselves good questions as leaders, we miss out on identifying potential blind spots in our leadership and opportunities to grow.</p> <p>For the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow talk about how John’s questions have made them better leaders. They will also challenge you to think about the last time you invested in yourself, and to examine the questions to ask yourself in order to keep growing.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Questions I Ask Myself as a Leader Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Questions and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://l2l.johnmaxwell.com/\">Live2Lead 2021</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Good-Leaders-Ask-Great-Questions-Hardcover_p_1107.html\"> <em>Good Leaders Ask Great Questions</em> by John C.
