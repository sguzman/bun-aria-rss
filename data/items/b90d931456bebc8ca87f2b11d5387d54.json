  "description": "<p>IT’S OUR 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY! CELEBRATE! This week is very special for me as I bring on Daryl Taberski, the vocalist from Snapcase. They are one of my favorite bands of all time and I never would have had an excuse to talk to Daryl if it wasn’t for this podcast but we discuss many incredible things like the formation of the band, the days where the band was courted by major labels and the evolution of the bands sound. It’s a lengthy conversation but well worth your time. Please spread the word on this show and tell your friends about it. I want to make this one of the largest episodes in the shows history. Thanks for listening all of these years, I really appreciate all of you.
