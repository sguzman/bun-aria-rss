  "description": "Today's show is highlighted by a couple of incredible conversations. First, 9x MMA Journalist of the Year at the World MMA Awards, ESPN MMA Insider, Ariel Helwani joins the program. Pat and Ariel chat about some of the top fighters in the UFC not being happy and whether a union is possible after Conor McGregor announced his retirement for the third time in three years, they cover what he has heard about fight island and where it potentially could be at, and breaks down the different situations for fighters like Jorge Masvidal, Jon Jones, Justin Gathje, and Khabib (:42-18:55). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ chat about if they've ever felt like they lost a game when seeing the other team get off the bus, their different pregame rituals and warmups, the PGA Tour coming back this weekend and Pat trying to rent AJ's house for a couple of weeks for some upcoming PGA Tour action in Columbus, and why they think baseball might be officially dead (20:50-1:22:19). Later, former 2nd round draft pick of the New England Patriots and former Colts Defensive Back, host of the Everything DB Show, friend of the program, Darius Butler. Pat and Darius chat about everything that has been happening in the world and where Darius sees things going from here, his thoughts on the whole Drew Brees situation and ensuing fallout, and Darius also giving a few examples of what it's like to be a black man living in America in an incredible conversation that everyone needs to listen to (1:24:01-1:43:20). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, friend of the show and one of the most entertaining dudes around, Ike Taylor joins Pat and the boys. They discuss how he feels about Roger Goodell addressing the video the young stars of the NFL put out in response to the protests of the last two weeks, whether it caught Ike off guard or not, why he thinks this next generation will be a big part of the movement for change, his days of playing flag football in college which got him noticed by the actual football team, and what his coach told him before he switched positions going into his senior year, plus more, all while Ike runs a workout program from his garage (1:45:48-1:57:50). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
