  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Nicholas J. Roske, armed with a handgun, a knife, and a bag filled with tools and zip ties was arrested outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after admitting he was there to murder Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh's home address was published online after being doxed by pro-abortion groups in May. Two years ago Sen Chuck Schumer threatened two Supreme Court Justices, is this not seditious? Yet, no one called for his resignation or for a televised congressional hearing during prime time. Then, Speaker Nancy Pelosi failed to secure the Capitol building and has sat on legislation to protect the Justices. No action was taken. Merrick Garland hasn't prosecuted a single public official for their actions, yet Pelosi will hold a hearing to smear President Trump. Later, The House passed a bill that will ambiguously ban high capacity 'assault weapons.' This bill faces a difficult fate in the U.S Senate. The term 'assault rifle' is misleading and has not been defined. Whereas machine guns or automatic weapons are already banned and have been banned under the assault weapons ban. AR-15's are semi-automatic just like a revolver or pistol that only shoots one bullet at a time and then reloads. Afterward, Bill O'Reilly calls in to discuss his new book \"Killing the Killers: The Secret War Against Terrorists.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Killing-Killers-Against-Terrorists-OReillys/dp/1250279259/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1651691996&refinements=p_27%3ABill+O%27Reilly&s=books&sr=1-1\nO'Reilly added that what we're witnessing is leftists out of control and engaging in an ideological civil war. Noting that even liberals are tired of the progressive wokeness.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
