  "description": "<p>“WHEN YOU HAVE A BIG DREAM, LIFE IS GOING TO CHALLENGE YOU.”<br />\nI am so excited to share something really big with you. It’s something I’ve been working on for a long time now.<br />\nI have a new Facebook Watch show that’s available to view now: Inspiring Life with Lewis Howes.<br />\nThis is something I created for you. I wanted to help improve the lives of 100 million people. In order to do so I knew I needed to team up with one of the biggest networks to make it happen.<br />\nBy that I don’t mean a traditional network that’s burning out, like one on TV. I meant the next big network.<br />\nThat’s why I teamed up with Facebook to make this happen. They have more users than any other network, and I knew I could be on the forefront of something truly special.<br />\nOn top of it all, I have something exciting that can directly affect you personally. I’m having a contest for you to come out and hang with me in LA.<br />\nThat’s right, I’m looking to have 5 lucky viewers come out to LA to hang out with me. I’m going to pay for your flight, I’m going to pay for your hotel room. On top of that, you’ll be on the School of Greatness. You’ll have lunch with me and a very special guest (who will remain nameless for now).<br />\nI’m not stopping there either.<br />\nYou’ll also get two free tickets to the Summit of Greatness (which isn’t cheap) and a School of Greatness Grab Bag, which will come with some of my favorite products and goodies. Plus, more bonuses and surprises.<br />\nHonestly, I don’t know exactly how much this all comes to but I know it’s a value of thousands of dollars to five lucky guests.<br />\nSo listen to this episode to hear the 4 simple steps it takes to win all of these prizes, and I’ll give you some behind the scene details on what my show is, how I made it, and everything it took to get it started.<br />\nLearn all about my new Facebook Watch Show, Inspiring Life with Lewis Howes, on Episode 676.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nThe contest to hang out with me (5:37)<br />\nHow many winners I’ll be picking (7:14)<br />\nAn extra special bonus (9:11)<br />\nThe four steps to win (10:21)<br />\nWhat it was like to make the show (11:50)<br />\nHow I sold the show (14:53)<br />\nA lesson on making a big move in your life (18:45)<br />\nHow I recovered from being a people pleaser (21:48)<br />\nWhat you need to find (26:21)<br />\nWhat our first practice round was like (30:08)<br />\nWhy I created the show (34:22)<br />\nWhen I will be announcing the winner (38:32)<br />\nThe vision of this show (40:38)</p>\n",
