  "description": "As the economy teeters on the brink of collapse, and many Americans are already finding themselves having to choose between paying their mortgage or feeding their kids, some government officials are hinting that the shut downs might last many more weeks. President Trump, on the other hand, is suggesting that we should get the economy going again soon. I think Trump is on the right path here. And I'd like to talk about what opening up the economy again could look like, and what steps we might take in order to protect the vulnerable as we get back to our lives. Also, Five Headlines, including Madonna’s insightful video, shot from her bathtub. And in our Daily Cancellation, I cancel yet another media outlet for maybe the most egregious fear mongering headline we’ve yet seen.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
