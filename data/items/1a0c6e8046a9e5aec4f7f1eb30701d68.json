  "description": "<p>Dr. Kerry Muhlestein continues to discuss the restoration of the New and Everlasting Covenant, and they discuss the importance of personal revelation and corporal revelation. Hiram Page (who marries a Whitmer) has proclaimed he is having revelations for the entire Church. Emma’s confirmation is disturbed by riotous crowds, and the Joseph Smith Translation begins with Moses 1. The JST process is vastly different from the Book of Mormon translation and the word transformation (think: transfiguration). Join us as we discuss the sacrament, the Abrahamic Covenant, revelation, transformation, and how the Tabernacle Choir can be like a seer stone.<br/><br/>Shownotes: followhim.co<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast/<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast</p>",
