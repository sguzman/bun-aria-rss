  "description": "With many Americas fearing that democracy itself is in trouble, the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent explores remedies to reserve the democratic decline in An Uncivil War: Taking Back Our Democracy in an Age of Trumpian Disinformation and Thunderdome Politics (Custom House, 2018). Sargent first diagnoses the problem, arguing that democracy was in trouble well before the ascent of Donald Trump. He delves into the substantive debates among academics and activists regarding how best to restore representative democracy, focusing on combatting voter suppression, expanding voter registration, eliminating partisan gerrymandering, and protecting the independent media from attempts by politicians to discredit it. Sargent also considers the question whether Democrats should be seeking to restore “fair play” or zealously pursuing and wielding power to achieve its policy goals.\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News among other publications. He is author of Wait! Don’t Move to Canada, published by Rodale in 2006.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
