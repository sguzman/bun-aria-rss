  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show harkening back to their youth as a result of Dr. Drew observing a TV guide in the studio from 1980. This leads to a larger examination as to what was considered 'healthy' at that time by Adam's mom and many others advocating for limiting egg consumption while promoting things like brown sugar. Drew brings it back to the TV Guide as he marvels at how much it transports him back to that time period. They also speak to an Australian listener who calls in to report on the Covid insanity going on in her neck of the woods. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCon-Cret.com/podcast\nTrueBill.com/ADS\n",
