In today’s episode, you’ll not only discover that it’s possible, but you’ll see exactly how it was done.

Ryan shares with us the exact strategies he’s using to more than double the number of deals he’s doing each year—and how he’s done that for the past four years. You’ll learn how he’s finding enough leads to flip 10 deals a month, how he’s able to buy long-distance, how he’s leveraging others so he can get more done, and much more.</p><p>In This Episode We Cover:</p><ul><li><strong>Ryan’s background</strong>&nbsp;and how he got into flipping</li><li>How he started&nbsp;<strong>flipping everything</strong>&nbsp;(including couches!)</li><li>Closing&nbsp;<strong>100 deals</strong></li><li>The details of his&nbsp;<strong>first deal</strong></li><li>The difference between&nbsp;<strong>hard money and private money</strong>&nbsp;lenders</li><li>What his&nbsp;<strong>business</strong>&nbsp;looks like</li><li>Using&nbsp;<strong>relationships</strong>&nbsp;to find deals</li><li>How&nbsp;<strong>agents</strong>&nbsp;can influence a deal</li><li>Finding great&nbsp;<strong>wholesalers</strong>&nbsp;and getting deals from them</li><li>How Ryan’s&nbsp;<strong>funnel</strong>&nbsp;works</li><li><strong>And SO much more!</strong></li></ul><p>Links from the Show</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/forums\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Forums</a></li><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/attend\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Webinar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/events\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Events</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/biggerpockets-podcast-264-gary-vanyerchuk-finding-deals-social-media-crushing-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\">BiggerPockets Podcast 264: Gary Vaynerchuk on Finding Deals Through Social Media & Crushing It as an Entrepreneur</a></li><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/7years\" target=\"_blank\">7 Years to 7 Figure Wealth</a></li></ul><p>Books Mentioned in this Show</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PdeIlV\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Will You Be My Mother</em></a>&nbsp;by Sally Huss</li><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2vM5eGm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Flip Your Future</em></a>&nbsp;by Ryan Pineda</li><li><a href=\"http://biggerpockets.com/nomoneydown\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Investing with Low or No Money Down</em></a>&nbsp;by Brandon Turner</li><li><a href=\"http://get.biggerpockets.com/flippingbook/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Book on Flipping Houses</em></a>&nbsp;by J.
