  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane recaps an epic movie night with the Minifans, but not everyone has positive reviews of Bicentennial Man. Steve is sorry. Kirk provides an update on the status of the Wilbur Theater show (0:30:23).  Ryan Minihane joins the show to talk about his brief hiphop phase (0:41:46). WGBH's Jim Braude reaches out to Steve in the middle of the show (0:56:26) and two old friends of the show get together for some radio magic. Kirk finishes off the weekend, almost, with phone calls from Minifans across the country. Plus: A special Coronavirus Era version of War of Roses.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
