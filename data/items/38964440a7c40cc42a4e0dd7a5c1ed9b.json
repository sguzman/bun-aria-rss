  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, the response from Republicans should be - of course, the President will accept the peaceful transition of power, which the Democrats refused to do in 2016. But first, we have to make sure there is a transition of power given the institutionalized corruption and vote fixing that is going on in battleground states. Democrats are the ones who are changing election laws in these battleground states. Democrats are telling Joe Biden not to concede on election night if he is losing. Democrats are practicing for scenarios that they will trigger should they lose the election, they have no intention of accepting a Trump victory. Later, Democrats are preparing a bill to limit Supreme Court justice terms to 18 years. This is similar to what Mark proposed in the Liberty Amendments. The constitution will have to be amended to do this, this cannot be done by statute. Then, Sen Lindsey Graham calls in to talk about his Senate race in South Carolina and his thoughts on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. Finally, Bill O’Reilly joins the show to discuss his new book, Killing Crazy Horse: The Merciless Indian Wars in America and what to look for at the Presidential debates next week.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
