  "description": "<p>Monday 9/4 - Today on the show we flashed back to some classic interviews such as we when Issa Rae came on, where she spoke about “Insecure”, her first experience in the strip club and more. We also flashed back to some classic “Shoot Your Shot” such as the time when Devante tried to shoot his shot at Latavia, but some how it turned out that he was stalking her more than having a innocent crush on her. Also we flashed back to the time comedian DC Young Fly came by and spoke about hosting TRL, being a new dad, robbing people back in the day and more. Moreover, we replayed the time Charlamagne gave “Donkey of the Day” to Tariq from Power.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
