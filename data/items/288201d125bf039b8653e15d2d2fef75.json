  "description": "Volcanoes are \"talking\" to us all the time. Scientists say the sooner we learn to interpret their normal chatter, the quicker we'll know when something unusual — and potentially dangerous — is happening. But volcanoes often sit on protected land, so that detection work sometimes brings scientists into conflict with conservationists. Today, the tug-of-war over a sleeping giant in the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>This episode is part of our series about the science happening on public lands, dropping every Friday the rest of the summer.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>As we continue our road trip, we also want to hear where in the world you are — especially if you're at a national park! To be featured in an episode, send us a recording saying your name, location and \"You're listening to <em>Short Wave</em> — from NPR.\" Our email is <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>.
