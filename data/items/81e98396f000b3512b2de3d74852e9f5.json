  "description": "How did the financial crisis of 2018 change politics? In British Think Tanks After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019), Marcos González Hernando, an Affiliated Researcher at the University of Cambridge and Senior Researcher at Think Tank for Action on Social Change (TASC), explores how think tanks were impacted by the 2008 crisis. Drawing on the sociology of intellectuals, as well as field theory, the book shows how four think tanks responded in complimentary and contrasting ways, some taking advantage of the crisis, some changing radically, some seeing continuity in their themes and practices. The book offers a theory of the think tank and its role in politics, alongside the rich and detailed case studies. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary politics!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
