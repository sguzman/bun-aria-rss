Often though, we forget to actually do this! \n\nThis episode is a deep dive into the practice of doing just that, how to develop your definition of good. We will also explore in real time how this process makes all the difference. \n\nAndy works as an illustrator but credits much of his creative practice to his design training. So, in this episode, we are joined by the Adobe Wireframe Podcast host designer Khoi Vinh as well as the Wireframe co-hosts Dominic Girard and Pippa Johnstone to help bring design tools that can help us in this process.",
