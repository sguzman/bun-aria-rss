  "title": "Ep 147 | 'White Knights' ROB Black People of Their Honor | Delano Squires | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Two years after the death of George Floyd, are America and the black community actually better off? When Delano Squires first looked at Black Lives Matter’s principles, he realized that they weren’t at all what he believes in: nothing about God or families and plenty about the opposite. Now, as a contributor to BlazeTV’s \"Fearless with Jason Whitlock\" and a scholar at 1776 Unites, he’s unafraid to call it as it is: Leftists are robbing black people of their dignity and honor and treating them like children. Meanwhile, self-sufficient black men are painted as white supremacists. This week on \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Delano breaks down how far America has gone — in the wrong direction — since the riots of 2020 and why the abortion debate is a clear example. And he explains why faith in God, not the “Biden blackness” of the Democratic Party, is the true solution. \n \nThis Week’s Sponsors:\n\nIf you’re looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then you need to check out Good Ranchers.
