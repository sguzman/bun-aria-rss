  "description": "At competing rallies in El Paso Texas, President Trump rhetorically gelds poor Beto O’Rourke. And the President is continuing to cut down his opponents as Democrats scramble after a particularly disastrous week. What a time to be alive, and the 2020 race has just barely begun. Then, do animals feel pain? Finally, on this day in history, Rev. Henry Highland Garnet becomes the first black man to address the U.S. Congress. We will remember his excellent sermon.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
