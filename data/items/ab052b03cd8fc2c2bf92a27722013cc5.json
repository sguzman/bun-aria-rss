  "description": "We have endured one of the most massive cyberattacks in history this year. While the US Secretary of State, Attorney General and the intelligence community attribute it to Russia, the president does not. When he has not been silent on it, he has been deflecting attention to the Chinese. All this means we can count on the Trump team doing very little in response to this attack. So the burden shifts to the incoming Biden team. They have no playbook to call upon as the Obama Administration also was not strong on these issues. A response is called for. What should it be? What will make us safer? We discuss with cyber experts David Sanger of the New York Times and Dmitri Alperovitch, former CTO of CrowdStrike. Don't miss this special edition.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
