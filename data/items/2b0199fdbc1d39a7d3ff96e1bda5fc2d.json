I’ve certainly become less active on blogs since I’ve joined Tesla, but\nwhenever I do get a chance to post something I have recently been defaulting\nto doing it on Medium because it is much faster and easier. I still plan to come back \nhere for longer posts if I get any time, but I’ll default to Medium for everything short-medium in length.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tldr\">TLDR</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Have a look at my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/\">Medium blog</a>.</strong></p>",
