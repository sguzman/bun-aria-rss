  "description": "<p>David Archuleta (<i>American Idol</i>, <i>OK, All Right</i> Tour, author of <i>My Little Prayer</i> ) opens up about discovering his sexual identity and the aspects of his religion he continues to hang onto as he navigates it. David discusses how taking time to step back from his musical career to go on his mission amidst fears he was sabotaging his career and an urge to keep American Idol fans proud of him led to deep introspection and transformation. After Mayim breaks down the process of dissociation as a coping mechanism, David details what it felt like to fight his attractions, the isolation that comes with carrying a huge secret, and the process of finally confronting his feelings. He recalls the unexpected reaction his church elder had after he opened up about his sexuality, what he thinks God wants for his life, and the responses he’s received since coming out. Mayim considers the value of getting to know oneself and David reveals the song that came to him in a dream.</p><p><a href=\"https://davidarchuleta.com/home/tour/\" target=\"_blank\">David Archuleta Tour</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Prayer-David-Archuleta/dp/1952239540/ref=asc_df_1952239540/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=509032833742&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17507090992768210645&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061096&hvtargid=pla-1254667977337&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">David Archuleta Book</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbKMiKX_CUo\" target=\"_blank\">David Archuleta New Single</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul><p> </p>\n",
