  "description": "<p>On the road for the first time in the Cullinane era, the audio seems to be better than ever. A fan in Colorado allegedly tried to get the attention of the Rockies mascot by screaming the name “Dinger” over and over. The media is convinced that he was instead yelling a racial slur. Gary Tanguay claims the craziest radio person he’s ever worked with is Kirk. We're still not sure who farted on Thursday's show. . OJ Simpson believes pretty much anyone would trade lives with him if given the chance. Justin and Dave have almost no ideas for the Saco show. Jeff D. Lowe has a terrible top 10 Bruce Springsteen song list. Justin is slated to write jokes for Kirk on Wednesday’s episode.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
