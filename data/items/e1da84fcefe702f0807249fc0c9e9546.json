This week, they discuss a topic Connor hates (Time) through the lens of something Dan barely understands (Quantum Physics). How will our two intrepid heroes fare on this rocky journey? Not well probably! But damnit, they're trying their best. And, at the end of the day, all the time you spent listening to the episode is just an illusion anyways. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
