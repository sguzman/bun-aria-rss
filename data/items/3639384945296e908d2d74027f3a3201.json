  "description": "I gave a talk last night at the Berlin machine learning meetup on learning graph embeddings in hyperbolic space, featuring the recent NIPS 2017 paper of Nickel &#038; Kiela. Covered are: An illustration of why the Euclidean plane is not a good place to embed trees (since circle circumference grows only linearly in the radius); &#8230; <p class=\"link-more\"><a href=\"https://building-babylon.net/2018/04/10/graph-embeddings-in-hyperbolic-space/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Graph embeddings in Hyperbolic Space\"</span></a></p>",
