  "description": "Phoebe Lickwar and Roxi Thoren's book Farmscape: The Design of Productive Landscapes (Routledge, 2020) situates agriculture as a design practice, using a wide range of international case studies and analytical essays to propose lessons for contemporary landscape architects who are interested in integrating agriculture into their designs. Agricultural processes, technologies, and cycles have long shaped landscape architectural projects, from the ornamented farm of the eighteenth century, to contemporary projects that integrate agriculture and ecological restoration. The book describes the history of agriculture within landscape architecture and reveals the diversity of current design practices that use the rhythms and forms of agriculture to create productive farms that are also sites of beauty, community, ecological conservation, remediation, and pleasure. Highly illustrated in full colour, this book provides essential context, resources, and best practice examples of rural and periurban designed sites for professionals and students alike.\nPhoebe Lickwar is an Associate Professor in Landscape Architecture at The University of Texas at Austin. She is founding principal of Forge Landscape Architecture, an award-winning critical design practice based in Austin.\nRoxi Thoren is an Associate Professor of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of Oregon. She studies the integration of second nature, productive landscapes, in landscape architectural design through research and design projects around agriculture, forestry, and power.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
