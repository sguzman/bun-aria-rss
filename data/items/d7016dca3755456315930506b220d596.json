  "description": "<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/books/review/bewilderment-richard-powers.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Bewilderment,”</a> Richard Powers’s first novel since he won a Pulitzer Prize for “The Overstory,” an astrobiologist named Theo Byrne looks for life on other planets while struggling to raise his highly sensitive 9-year-old son, Robin. On this week’s podcast, Powers compares Theo’s work in the galaxy with his relationship on the ground.</p><p>“If there are all of these millions of exoplanets out there are and they are all subject to radically different conditions, what would life look like in these conditions that are so very different from Earth?” Power says that a similar question “is also the preoccupation of most literature. Books themselves are empathy machines and travels to other planets. They’re ways that we have of participating in sensibilities that are not ours. So when Robin asks this question — which is bigger, outer space or inner? — that question of where are we going, who are we, why are we the way we are, gets turned inward, to this question of how do I understand someone who’s so profoundly different from myself? And in that way, travel to other planets always becomes travel to other people.”</p><p>Honorée Fanonne Jeffers visits the podcast to discuss her best-selling debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/books/review/the-love-songs-of-web-du-bois-honoree-fanonne-jeffers.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois.”</a> Among other subjects, Jeffers talks about why the book’s main character, Ailey Pearl Garfield, who comes from a long family line of physicians, becomes a historian herself.</p><p>“It’s a gesture to the way that I grew up learning about African American history,” she says. “I’m an English professor, a creative writing professor, but when I was a little girl I would sit up underneath the old people. I never really was a child that liked to play with other children. I would sort of scoot into a corner so I wouldn’t be noticed and I would listen to the old people talk about the way they grew up, growing up in segregation, growing up in Jim Crow, and then some of the stories that they remembered from the old people who had been born into slavery, like my great grandma Mandy Napier, so it had a great impact on me, and I think that’s why I made Ailey an eventual historian.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; and Gregory Cowles and John Williams talk about what they’ve been reading. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/books/review/benjamin-labatut-cease-understand-world.html\" target=\"_blank\">“When We Cease to Understand the World”</a> by Benjamín Labatut</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/books/review/on-juneteenth-annette-gordon-reed.html\" target=\"_blank\">“On Juneteenth”</a> by Annette Gordon-Reed</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237113/congratulations-by-the-way-by-george-saunders/\" target=\"_blank\">“Congratulations, by the Way”</a> by George Saunders</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780875801636/motor-flight-through-france/\" target=\"_blank\">“A Motor-Flight Through France”</a> by Edith Wharton</p>\n",
