  "description": "<p>This is THE most emotional conversation of my lifetime...<br /><br />We have flipped the script this week. I’ve asked one of my truly dearest friends, Jamie Kern Lima, to GUEST HOST the show and interview ME about my highly anticipated new book, THE POWER OF ONE MORE, coming out June 1. (You can pre-order now).<br /><br />As you might guess, Jamie knows me really well, so not only am I fielding some questions that only Jamie knows to ask, I’m also going to REVEAL things I’ve never told anyone before, publicly or privately.<br /><br />Nothing was off the table!<br /><br />Jamie and I are going to give you a big sneak peek on some of the things you’ll read in my new book, THE POWER OF ONE MORE, coming out of June 1.<br /><br />I WROTE THIS BOOK TO HONOR MY DAD. He was a KIND AND LOVING MAN who battled alcohol addiction early in my life. Throughout the years, my dad became the person who had the most profound influence on my life. After he beat his addiction, for 35 years, HE TAUGHT ME LESSONS, many of which are in the book… lessons that I still use to this day.<br /><br />I wasn’t expecting her to ask me about what I struggled with the most growing up. I had to think about it and like a lot of people I know, I had to fight through so many kinds of CONSTANT FEAR.<br /><br />Fear I wouldn’t fit in. Fear that I wasn’t good enough. Fear that I’d be found out as an imposter. Fear my dad would get hurt while he was drinking, or God forbid, he would accidentally hurt someone else.  <br /><br />I’m also going to tell you how I’ve leveraged a life full of ONE MORES to become successful.<br /><br />I’m especially grateful to Jamie for asking me about HOW MY DAD SPENT HIS LAST DAYS and what I learned after he passed that had a huge impact on me.  <br /><br />I hope there are no rules about shedding a few tears on your own show because I definitely broke them...<br /><br />Let’s just say when I get to the end of my life, I’m praying that I turn out to be half the man my father was.<br /><br />This week’s guest host unpacked a lot in the 90 minutes we spent together. THANK YOU, JAMIE… my friend who got me to say things I never thought I would.</p>\n",
