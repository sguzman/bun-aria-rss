  "description": "Ben worries to Josh about Beth; she hasn’t gone to work and is hardly speaking.   Ben knows it’s all his fault.  He also needs to know how Chelsea’s doing, which will hurt Beth even more.  He half wishes Beth would dump him, then she could start again with someone better.  Later Beth tells Josh she knows that Ben’s made a stupid mistake, but she can’t get over him sleeping with Chelsea and the idea of a baby.  Beth knows it would be easier if she left, but she also knows Ben’s really trying to do the right thing.  Later Ben tells Beth he needs to speak to Chelsea.  Beth respects him for that and says Ben needs to tell her everything even if it hurts her.  It’s the only way they might survive this.\nKenton gives Eddie a pint on the house to make up for all the hurt he’s caused.  Eddie’s surprised when Tony mentions that Jolene and Kenton are selling up.  When he checks it out, Kenton and Jolene ask him to keep it secret.  Kenton can’t live in the same village as Eddie, having caused such disruption to his marriage.  Distraught Eddie owns up that it was just a scam to get a free pint or two.  Kenton tries to keep up the pretence but ends up admitting the joke’s now on Eddie.  They’re not selling the Bull – it was just a wind up as revenge for Eddie’s scam.  To make up for it Eddie will have to buy drinks for the winning side!",
