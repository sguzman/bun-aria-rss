  "description": "<p>As the UK lockdown continues, we discuss the unfolding situation and the continual emotional shifts we are all experiencing. Here in Britain we are seeing some of our most well-known artists responding in different ways. Tracy Emin wrote an online diary; David Hockney is making new paintings; and Grayson Perry is filming a new TV show designed to encourage people to make art. We ask whether these are helpful reactions. In troubled times, what is the point of it all? Is art relevant? And is this an opportunity for us to switch from a focus on producing work for shows to a new emphasis on creativity and exploration? We also discuss the importance of mental health for our physical well-being, debate potential societal changes, and ask whether we are currently in the midst of a global existential crisis.</p>\n<p>Mentioned</p>\n<p>Mark this time on Instagram &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/markthistime2020/?hl=en\"><u>https://www.instagram.com/markthistime2020/?hl=en</u></a></p>\n<p>Mark this time on Facebook &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/markthistime2020/\"><u>https://www.facebook.com/markthistime2020/</u></a></p>\n<p>Tracey Emin - online diary <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?hl=en\"><u>https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?hl=en</u></a></p>\n<p>David Hockney paintings <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52109901\"><u>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52109901</u></a></p>\n<p>Grayson Perry/Anthony Gormley art kit home.<a href=\"https://firstsite.uk/art-is-where-the-home-is/\"><u>https://firstsite.uk/art-is-where-the-home-is/</u><br>\n<br>\n</a>Lewis Howes podcast with Dr. Joe Dispenza <a href=\"As the UK lockdown continues, we discuss the unfolding situation and the continual emotional shifts we are all experiencing.
