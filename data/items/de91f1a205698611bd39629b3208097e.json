  "title": "Chang-rae Lee on His New Novel: ‘It’s Kind of a Crazy Book.’",
  "description": "<p>Chang-rae Lee’s new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/books/review/chang-rae-lee-my-year-abroad.html\" target=\"_blank\">“My Year Abroad,”</a> is his sixth. On this week’s podcast, Lee says that his readers might be surprised by it.</p><p>“It’s kind of a crazy book, and particularly I think for people who know my work,” Lee says. “I’m sure my editor was surprised by what she got. I didn’t quite describe it the way it turned out.” The novel follows a New Jersey 20-year-old named Tiller, who is at loose ends, as he befriends a very successful Chinese entrepreneur. “They go traveling together,” Lee says. “They have what we might call business adventures, but those adventures get quite intense.”</p><p>Maurice Chammah visits the podcast to talk about his densely reported first book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/books/review/let-the-lord-sort-them-death-penalty-maurice-chammah.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Let the Lord Sort Them,”</a> which is a history, as the subtitle has it, of “the rise and fall of the death penalty.”</p><p>“One of the fascinating parts of researching this book was revisiting a time that I kind of dimly remembered when the death penalty had a role in the culture war pantheon, along with gun control and abortion,” Chammah says. “Starting around the year 2000, it feels like that was a high-water mark where something broke, and over the 20 years since, the death penalty has declined, both in the number of people who support it, but I think more importantly, in relevance. It’s less of a thing that people feel matters to their daily lives.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history during this year of its 125th anniversary; Elizabeth A. Harris has news from the publishing world; and Tina Jordan and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p>The books of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/books/john-le-carre-dead.html\" target=\"_blank\">John le Carré</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/books/review/read-me-leo-benedictus.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Read Me”</a> by Leo Benedictus</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review/liane-moriarty-nine-perfect-strangers.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Nine Perfect Strangers”</a> by Liane Moriarty</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/books/romy-hausmann-dear-child.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Dear Child”</a> by Romy Hausmann</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316406/winterkeep-by-kristin-cashore/\" target=\"_blank\">“Winterkeep”</a> by Kristin Cashore</p>\n",
