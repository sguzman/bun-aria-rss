  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Although restrictions related to COVID 19 may have lessened around the country, the risk has not gone away. Vaccines have been an important part of protecting our health throughout the pandemic but so far they haven’t been available to children under the age of 5 which has left parents and caregivers in a very difficult position. Last week, the FDA authorized use of the vaccine in this age group so we can expect administration in this group to start soon but if you’re a parent or caregiver, you probably have lots of questions. Joining me this week to help answer some of these questions is board-certified pediatrician, Dr. Nina Ford Johnson. </p>\n<p>Dr. Johnson has been serving the families of the Mobile, Alabama area for 10 years. With her expertise in serving children of all ages Dr. Ford has been a  go to voice for Black children’s health during the pandemic. Her recent national campaign “I’m a Mom First”  is by moms and for moms who have concerns about vaccinating their children.</p>\n<p>Our conversation explores what’s in the COVID vaccine and how it works, breaking down common concerns and debunking myths around the vaccine, how to identify covid symptoms at home, and she shares advice to caregivers who might be struggling with the decision to have their children vaccinated. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Johnson</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aClHb5d5tN8\">I’m A Mom First Campaign</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ninasheree\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nina-ford-johnson-md-faap-484b2138\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
