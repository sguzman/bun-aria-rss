  "title": "Ep 66 | The Miracle of Loving Yourself | Kamal Ravikant | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "On the surface, Kamal Ravikant has lived an impressive life. He’s traveled the world, served in the U.S. Army, and started several companies and a venture capital firm. But when his business ventures took a steep nosedive, he spiraled into a wild depression, fueled by drug addiction and an abusive childhood. But instead of giving in to destruction and suicide, he wrote a vow: “I’m going to love myself.” Those simple words transformed his life. And he wrote a best-selling book to teach others how to do the same: “Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It.” Kamal and Glenn sit down for an honest conversation about self-help, mental health, the reason why addiction exists, and the importance of having a purpose bigger than yourself. \nThis Week’s Sponsor:\nLosing your hair sucks!
