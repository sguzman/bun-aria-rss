  "description": "Songwriter and producer Nate Butler doesn't take himself too seriously, but he's dropping some serious wisdom as he and Sadie take on the tough issues of 2020. Nate reveals what God taught him during his intense experience with COVID-19, and he shares the advice he gave Sadie about never allowing the enemy to stoke racial fear and division. They discuss how to fight the good fight of faith — one that's not mixed with unforgiveness and hatred — and the difference between putting on your armor and putting on God's armor. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
