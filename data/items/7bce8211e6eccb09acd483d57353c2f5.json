  "description": "Our lives follow the direction of our thoughts.  Not every thought that comes to mind is positive. Some thoughts are destructive if we dwell on them long enough. We need to recognize which thoughts are dragging us down and guard our hearts against them. One way to guard our hearts is to push out thoughts of negativity, fear, and doubt. Then we can begin to dwell on good things that lift our spirits.  As we take control of our thoughts and turn them in the right direction then we’ll see our lives begin to change for the better.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
