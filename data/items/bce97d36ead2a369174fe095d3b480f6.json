  "description": "<p>For thousands of years, men's lives were structured by rituals -- rituals that helped them mark significant events, make sense of the world, and move from one phase of life to the next.</p><p>In our modern age, our lives are largely devoid of rituals, and my guest today says we're worse off for it.

We then discuss the history of the mythopoetic men’s movement kickstarted by Robert Bly and his book Iron John.

We discuss how to give your son a rite of passage as well. William also provides some ideas for daily rituals you can incorporate in your life to provide more meaning and enchantment to existence. We end our conversation with William’s advice on how to get started with a men’s group.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/ritual\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/ritual</a>.</p>\n",
