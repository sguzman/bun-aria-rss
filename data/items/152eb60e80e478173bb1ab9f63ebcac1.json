Here to do just that in today’s show, David Bryan talks about the book he co-edited with David Pao, titled Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts: New Explorations of Luke’s Narrative Hinge (Fortress Press, 2016); in this collection of essays, leading scholars discuss the ancient, literary, and theological contexts of the ascent-into-heaven accounts found in Luke and in Acts. David K. Bryan is an adjunct instructor and doctoral candidate at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, IL. He has published on the parables of Jesus, and his other research interests include authority in the ancient world, apocalyptic literature, and the kingdom of God.\n\n\n\nL. Michael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
