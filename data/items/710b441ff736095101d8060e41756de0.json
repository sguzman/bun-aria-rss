Then she connected with other parents who’d been policed by their community in harmful ways. Do Americans worry so much about the safety of children that they’re blind to common sense? Brooks explores this, and the dangers of involving the police too quickly, in her new book, Small Animals: Parenthood in the Age of Fear.\nIn the Spiel, no, the missionary to North Sentinel Island did not deserve to die, and it’s appalling to suggest he did.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
