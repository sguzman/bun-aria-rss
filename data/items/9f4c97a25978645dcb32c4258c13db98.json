  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as a concerned community member, I personally attended a Nashville School Board meeting yesterday to voice my opinion on the district’s universal mask mandate. Many others were there, on both sides of the issue. It was an illuminating experience. I’ll tell you about it and play some of the footage. Also, Andrew Cuomo is resigning. Conservatives are celebrating. But the Left is celebrating too, which tells me that maybe this isn’t the big win that we think it is. I’ll explain. And Dr. Fauci has some thoughts on freedom. He’s not a fan of it, apparently. No surprise there. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we ask the question: are master bedrooms racist? The answer might surprise you. \n\nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
