He warns her, \"the Fed is in a really big bind,\" as the central bank look to ease the pace of rates hikes currently underway. \"If we have a shallower recession in 2023 because the Fed arrests the pace of tightening right now,\" he believes the market could perform well over the next year. \"Equity markets are sniffing out a pivot in the inflation cycle,\" but Papic concludes it's purely political timing.\n\n#ratehikes #federalreserve #equitymarket\n\n⭐️ Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  https://danielacambone.com\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryRe... \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_...\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stan...",
