  "description": "<p>There have been a lot of conversations here on &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; about digital privacy. More folks are paying attention to things like encryption and the security of their messaging apps. Signal consistently ranks as one of the more popular choices for privacy advocates, and the app is increasingly being used by people beyond the cybersecurity crowd. Signal&#8217;s staff is small compared to that of messaging apps like Telegram, WhatsApp or iMessage — which comes pre-installed in iPhones — but it&#8217;s growing. Former Google researcher and digital privacy advocate Meredith Whittaker just signed on as Signal&#8217;s new president and today is her first day on the job. She&#8217;s been on Signal&#8217;s board since 2020 and says she plans to continue the company&#8217;s focus on encryption. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams recently spoke with Whittaker about the future of the company, how she&#8217;d like to grow Signal without monetizing its users&#8217; data and digital privacy issues at large.</p>\n",
