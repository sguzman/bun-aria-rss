  "title": "Presenting 'It's Been A Minute': Reassessing Janet Jackson's 'Control' and legacy",
  "description": "This year marks the 35th anniversary of Janet Jackson's <em>Control</em>. That album was her first real commercial hit and, looking back, helped redefine all of pop music. In the late '80s and '90s, Jackson was one of the biggest stars of our time — right up there with her brother, Michael and Madonna. And yet, Jackson isn't always given her due. In this special episode from NPR's <em>It's Been A Minute</em> podcast, host Sam Sanders explores why that is, how she made the album <em>Control</em>, and the incident — that lasted all but a second — that changed the course of her career.",
