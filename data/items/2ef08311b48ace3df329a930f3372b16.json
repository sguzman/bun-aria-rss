  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moms know that you don’t start reading a storybook in the middle! If you skip the first half, your kids miss important aspects of the plot and the character development. Instead, you start at the very beginning and view all of the parts as a whole. But for some reason, when it comes to the Bible, we often toss that concept aside and go straight for the easier-to-understand New Testament books. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the importance of reading the Old Testament, citing eight reasons why it really matters! Processing the entire Bible in light of the cross is critical for us (and our kiddos) to rightly understand God's epic redemption story.</span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re grateful to Christian Standard Bible, a Bible translation for everyone, for making this week’s show possible.
