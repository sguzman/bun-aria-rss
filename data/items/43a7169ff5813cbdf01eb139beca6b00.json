  "description": "This episode of The Sound of Economics focuses on labour mobility in Europe. Anti-immigration sentiment is on the rise due to the perception that immigrants are taking away jobs and benefits. But what is the real impact of migration on European labour markets? What are the economic challenges for migrants and how do these challenges impact on social integration? These are some of the questions we explore with our guests.&#13;\n&#13;\nAlessandra Venturini speaks about the perception of migrants and how it differs from research findings. Samuel Engblom argues that the impact of migration on labour markets depends on political choices, and that it varies between countries. Anna Ilyina discusses IMF research on the economic impact of emigration from Eastern Europe, and Maria Demertzis emphasises the effect of migration on sending countries.&#13;\n&#13;\nFinally, our guests debate what the ideal policy response to migration should be, and how perception of migration could be improved.&#13;\n&#13;\nSPEAKERS&#13;\nMaria Demertzis, Deputy Director, Bruegel&#13;\nSamuel Engblom, Policy director, The Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO)&#13;\nAnna Ilyina, Division Chief, International Monetary Fund&#13;\nAlessandra Venturini, Deputy Director Migration Policy Center,Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, European University Institute (EUI)&#13;\n&#13;\nCREDITS&#13;\nProduced and presented by Giuseppe Porcaro",
