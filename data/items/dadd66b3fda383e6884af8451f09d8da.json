  "description": "Reunited once again, Sofia is joined by her bestie for the restie FABBY F BABY! It’s been a while since Fabby has graced the Sloot airwaves so there is TONS to catch up on, especially being that Fabby is now living in New York City! How lucky is the Big Apple to be infiltrated by Utah’s finest? Today Fabby takes us on her latest journey from Las Vegas to NYC filling us in on ALL the trials and tribulations occurring along the way - including a story about an unhinged roommate and secret nanny cams… In more important news, the girls come to the conclusion that New York City MAY be the best place to find your future husband (while also unpacking Sofia’s peeping tom fetish…which is only a tad concerning). Of course we can’t talk about the glory of living in the best city in the world without discussing the harsh realities that come with it. With a second recession well underway Sofia and Fabby unpack some not-so-ideal childhood memories that actually helped shape them financially, followed by tips for the Sloots to help prepare for this rough time ahead of us. Since it IS 2022, we can’t talk about finances without also talking about the bane of our existence: CRYPTO. Sloots, we know you pretend to care about it when that cute guy is babbling on and on, AT LEAST listen to our very own Fabby’s tragic crypto experience. NFT, Bitcoin, Bathing Ape, ETH, - we don’t fucking get it either. Finally, Sofia tells Fabby about a slightly creepy instagram page that your boyfriend more than likely already knows about, and one you NEED to know about. Yeah, there’s more that can be put in this description but I’m pretty sure you don’t wanna read anymore, just tune the fuck in Sloots.\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nCerebral: http://www.cerebral.com/SOFIA for 65% off your first month\nFitOn: Join over 10 million people getting their FitOn.
