  "title": "PMS 2.0 208 - The Convo EVERYBODY's Citing With NBA Champ, JR Smith.. Jeff Passan, Adam Amin, & Legend, AJ Hawk Also Stop By For Some Chatter.",
  "description": "<p>Today's show features an interview being clipped and quoted nearly everywhere right now. Pat sits down with NBA Champion, former 6th Man of the Year, and 16 Year NBA Veteran, JR Smith. Pat and JR discuss everything that has happened in the last week or so with the protests and the riots and JR sheds some light on his feelings and where he thinks we can go from here, discusses the altercation he got into with a rioter who decided to shatter one of the windows of his truck that was caught on film, chats about the differences between Michael Jordan and LeBron having played with LeBron for a long time, looks at what might be next for his career, and explains the differences between the players of old and current NBA players (1:39-29:35). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ are joined by new FOX sports employee and the new play-by-play voice of the Chicago Bulls, Adam Amin. Pat, AJ, and Adam chat about how he ended up at FOX after a long, successful career at ESPN, how excited he is to be landing one of his dream jobs in the Bulls play-by-play gig, when he thinks he actually will be getting back to work, and Adam shares some stories from his time in the booth with Pat from this past fall (39:48-57:43). Pat and AJ also discuss the JR Smith conversation, everything that has been happening in the US and around the world, and try to figure out how much money George Kittle is going to make with his new deal (31:42-1:35:18). Later, MLB Insider and friend of the program, Jeff Passan joins the show to discuss all the new developments between the MLBPA and the MLB, whether any progress is being made, the new proposal sent by the players, if he thinks we're going to have an MLB season, and why not having a season could be catastrophic for the sport (1:37:44-1:48:44). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you rocking with us, stay safe out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
