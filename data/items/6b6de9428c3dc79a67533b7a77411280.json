Among her many accomplishments:</p><br><p>* the first woman to climb both Everest and its 8,000-meter neighbor, Lhotse, in a 24-hour period</p><p>* the first person to ski down all five of the Mongolian Altai’s “Holy Peaks”</p><p>* skied from the Himalayan summit of Cho Oyu in Tibet</p><p>* summited peaks and volcanoes&nbsp;in remote locations across&nbsp;Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Bolivia, Argentina, Lebanon & Tibet</p><br><p><br></p><p>I first came across Hilaree by way of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/136761532\" target=\"_blank\">Down To Nothing,</a> a stunning&nbsp;documentary by Renan Ozturk that&nbsp;chronicles a 2014 National Geographic expedition to be the first to ascend the summit of&nbsp;Hkakabo Razi in Myanmar to determine if it is indeed Southeast Asia’s highest point. It’s a gorgeous and gripping glimpse of Hilaree’s skill and tenacity in the face of a uniquely extraordinary challenge.</p><p>This is her story.</p><p>It’s an incredible conversation about fear, risk resilience, adventure and potential. It’s about balancing the pull of adventure against her responsibilities as a single mom to two boys.
