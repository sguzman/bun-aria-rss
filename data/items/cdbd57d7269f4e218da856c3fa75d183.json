  "title": "A Brazen Kidnapping in Haiti",
  "description": "Last weekend, 17 foreign missionaries living in Haiti were taken hostage by a criminal gang demanding million-dollar ransom payments. Kidnappings have become routine in Haiti over the past two years, as the national government has weakened in the wake of years of foreign influence, corruption, persistent poverty, natural disasters, and political upheaval. But the latest mass abduction of so many Americans is a provocation that could prompt an international intervention, in spite of the long history of botched foreign meddling in Haiti.   \nGuest: Jacqueline Charles, Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald. \nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
