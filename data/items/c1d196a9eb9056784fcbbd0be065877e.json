  "description": "<p>Bitches luuuuv to travel abroad: Shannon and Marissa’s Europe Recap (well the first half of it). When Marissa told Shannon about her upcoming trip, one thing led to another, and all of the sudden Shannon was crashing her trip to Spain. What started as a normal, fun girls trip, quickly turned into what may be a fairytale? Who could be too sure. Join the girls through all the twists and turns and alleyways of Barcelona. Did Shannon meet her Prince Charming? Will they ever see each other again? What blast from the past was randomly on their flight to Ibiza with them? You’ll just have to listen this week (and next) to find out! An episode full of happiness, self reflection, and shockingly bad accents. </p>",
