  "description": "If you've ever wanted to be a musician, chances are you dreamed of going on tour.\n\nThe romance of the road and everything that comes along with it. \n\nBut it's not as easy as you think. Not everyone is U2 and charters their own plane to get from gig to gig. Chances are you're going to be using a tour bus....or more likely....in a van.\n\nIt is such a grind that kills many a band. There are the hassles, the expense, the accidents, the weirdos, the arguing, the screw ups,  and more.\n\nMurphy's law is in full effect: whatever can go wrong...will go wrong.\n\nGet in the van. Let's hit the road. You'll see what I mean.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
