  "description": "Those looking for deeper understanding of why the socially conservative, evangelical Christian community has been so loyal of Donald Trump will find answers in the book God and Donald Trump (Frontline, 2017). Author Stephen Strang provides an insider’s perspective on how evangelical leaders who initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz for Senate were persuaded to get behind the eventual Republican nominee, and how some Pentecostal and Charismatic leaders had been quicker to get behind Trump than other Christians. Strang addresses why Trump’s reputation as “morally libertarian,” which troubled some evangelicals, was outweighed by what was considered a greater imperative to defeat the “secular Left,” “political correctness” and “global government.” And Strang sheds light on the belief by some in the evangelical community that God played a direct role in Trump’s election.\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News among other publications. He is author of Wait! Don’t Move to Canada, published by Rodale in 2006.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
