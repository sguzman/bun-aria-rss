  "description": "<p>How much personal choice do we really have when it comes to our food choices? The science is clear—our processed, sugary, starchy diet is the single biggest cause of disease and death. And health outcomes are disproportionately worse in minority communities. There are social and cultural inputs at play and many reasons we need to begin looking at health beyond the individual to a community and population-based level.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Sonia Angell about how when it comes to social determinants and what we view as cultural tendencies for food choices, much has been imposed from outside influences. He also speaks with Pam Koch about the need to move away from a system that overwhelmingly supports growing commodity crops such as corn, soy, and wheat, and move toward incentivizing the production and purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><br><p>Dr. Sonia Angell is a former Deputy Commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), where she oversaw the Division of Prevention and Primary Care. Dr. Angell is a practicing physician, board certified in internal medicine, and on faculty at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Hospital.</p><br><p>Pam Koch, EdD, RD. Pam teaches both Nutritional Ecology and Community Nutrition to master and doctoral students at Teachers College, Columbia University. She conducts research about the connections between a just, sustainable food system and healthy eating.
