  "description": "Many connected stories from Greek mythology. We'll start with story of Hades and Persephone, and learn why she's always hanging around the underworld (hint: it's not because she wants to). Then, I'll tell the story of the curse of the house of Atreus, starting with Tantalus and his questionable food choices. It's a long, dark episode, so get ready. The creature is the Nakki, from Finland, who just wants to drown you and look good while doing it. Is that too much to ask?
