  "description": "Robert Elmer, who is a communications specialist at Seattle Pacific University, a prolific writer of historical fiction, and the author of over fifty published titles, has published a ground-breaking anthology of prayers that he has collected from English and American puritans. The value of Piercing Heaven: Prayers of the Puritans (Lexham Press, 2020) is that it provides access into a world of religious practice that is otherwise lost – many puritans refusing on principle to put their prayers to paper. Trawling through published sermons and other sources, Elmer discovered prayers reflecting a huge range of contexts, situations, and geographical and denominational background. Piercing heaven: Prayers of the puritans organises these prayers in thematic sections. Tune in to find out why these prayers are so surprising – and what they tell us about the interior life of the hotter sort of English and American protestants.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
