In some parts of life and professional cultures, it's not only frowned upon, it is fiercely punished.</p><p>So, every day, a little bit at a time, we confine ourselves into a supposedly safer and safer, smaller and smaller box with the hope of avoiding failure. We stop taking risks, go only for the most certain options and, in doing so, we destroy any semblance of life, freedom, discovery and possibility in our lives.</p><p>It's bad enough when we make these choices for ourselves. But, what happens when we impose our failure-adverse lens on our kids, students or anyone others who might look to us to figure out how to live in the world?</p><p>We end up not only teaching them to avoid failure, we also erect cages around them. Ostensibly to \"protect them from both others and themselves.\" Sometimes, and on some levels, that may be necessary.</p><p>But, increasingly, it may do as much if not more harm than good. Because it protects them from outcomes we assume have a high-probability of happening, yet, in truth, have little or no place in reality.
