We can’t turn any part of this government over to these radical, hardcore Democrats and their mouthpieces in the media. There are 37 congressional races listed as \"toss-up's\" in the midterm elections. So they're in play, and If Republicans don't show up and vote we would be surrendering Republican seats in the US House of Representatives!  Then, people need to come to the United States in an orderly and legal way, otherwise the United States ceases to exist. We can’t successfully operate public education , or public hospitals this way.  We also need assimilation.  The media never mentions assimilation, they only use race-baiting tactics to frame the immigration issue. Later, a federal district judge denied President Trump’s appeal regarding the emoluments clause of the Constitution.  Regarding foreign dignitaries staying at Trump International Hotel when visiting Washington whereby potentially benefiting financially since he has an ownership interest in the Trump Organization. Of course, this is not a violation of the emoluments clause because that would suggest that any person serving as president that owned a car dealership, restaurant or any business that was patronized by foreign dignitaries is receiving gift.  Simply not true.  The emoluments clause was intended to prevent a President from being on the payroll of a foreign government.  After, Congressional candidate Yvette Harrell (R-NM) and Senate candidate Karin Housley (R-MN) call in to discuss their midterm elections.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
