Is it as bad as critics make out to be or is Harry Styles so miscast that not even Florence Pugh and Chris Pine can save it? &nbsp;Then, we'll open the 80's nostalgia time capsule and pull out a sequel I don't think anyone was asking for with ‘Confess, Fletch’. This one replaces Chevy Chase with Jon Hamm though so it can go nowhere but up, right? &nbsp;Right?&nbsp; As always, we'll run down the upcoming major releases on physical media, our Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week. Matt and Chris then finalize the latest notch on their podcast bed frame with our Top 5 Alternate Reality/Parallel Universes films.&nbsp; I realize now that even saying that may be a spoiler for one of the films.
