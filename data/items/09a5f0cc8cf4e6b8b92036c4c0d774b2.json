  "description": "<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Colossus of Rhodes. The Lighthouse of Alexandria. The Temple of Artemis. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. These are just SOME of the wonders we go over today. Get ready to want to explore the world. We are so surrounded by so many impressive man-made monuments. And also so much natural beauty - we also look at the seven natural wonders of the world today. And we look at the new seven wonders of the world. And at even more wonders. We also examine a lot of strange theories some questionable folk on the internet have postulated about many of these wonders in numerous Idiots of the Internet segments. Enjoy all this wonder! <br /><br />June charity TBD as of this recording date. </p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X42vSfTEGbU\">https://youtu.be/X42vSfTEGbU</a><br /><br /></strong><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
