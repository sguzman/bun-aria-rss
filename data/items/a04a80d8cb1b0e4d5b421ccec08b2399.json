  "description": "I love the smell and feel of recording studios…if you’ve been inside a proper one, you’ll know what i mean…\n\nThe air is kept clean and dust-free to protect the equipment…the a/c is usually cranked up to offset the heat generated by the electronics…there’s a slight whiff of ozone created by all the electrical circuits…and it’s usually very, very quiet…loads of isolation and baffling and sound-proofing…\n\nTo me, a recording studio is the musical equivalent of an operating theatre; a place that’s dedicated to one thing and one thing only…and what goes on within the walls is deadly serious…\n\nOkay, I’m not saying that recording a song is the same as a heart transplant or something, but there is the same sort of vibe…\n\nThere used to be dozens and dozens of these places around the planet…people would travel thousands of kilometers to work there because they were thought to be magical in some way…\n\nBut that’s when you needed a full-equipped recording studio to make a record…today, you can do a pretty good job with a laptop in your bedroom…\n\nMany of the legendary studios are gone, a victim of the changing economics of the music industry…a few of these behemoth still exist…\n\nThis is another look at the world’s legendary recording studios, both past and present…\n\n \n\nSongs in this Episode:\n\n\nDavid Bowie - Life on Mars\n\nSex Pistols - Holiday in the Sun\n\nThe Verve - Bittersweet Symphony\n\nMumford & Sons - Believe\n\nThe Clash - The Magnificent Seven\n\nThe Black Keys - Tighten Up\n\nThe Tragically Hip - Poets\n\nBob Marley and the Wailers - No Woman, No Cry\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
