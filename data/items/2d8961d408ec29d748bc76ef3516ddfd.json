  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the Supreme Court has done some horrific things that have led to horrific outcomes, and yet the Left wants you to believe the Court is better than the other branches of government. Sen Susan Collins says she would not support certain potential Supreme Court nominees because they have demonstrated a disrespect for the vital principle of stare decisis. She is an absolute radical on the issue. If Collins believes in stare decisis and legal precedent, does she believe in the precedent in the Dred Scott case or Plessy v Ferguson? They were abominations. We’ve had judicial precedent in slavery and segregation in the past that lasted longer than Roe v Wade. Activist Supreme Courts in the past have justified slavery, segregation, and racism, and rather than learn the painful lessons of the past we have several current Justices who are committed to the same kind of judicial activism. Also, it turns out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn’t quite the girl from the Bronx that she says she is. If you’re a Marxist you need to be dishonest about your background and pretend you’re like the commoners. Later, Mark speaks with Harris Faulkner about her new book, 9 Rules of Engagement: A Military Brat’s Guide to Life and Success.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
