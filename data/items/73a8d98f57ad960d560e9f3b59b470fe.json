But here’s the problem: it’s hard to know how to move forward and what steps you need to take if you haven’t reflected on the past. So during this episode we raise some questions that you can ask yourself before you start thinking about next year. This will not only help you to realize that 2020 wasn’t a complete throw-away year, but it should also directly inform the actions and goals you’ll set for yourself in 2021. These questions will help you to begin your financial year in review.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Montmorency & Balaton Cherry Sour by Westbrook Brewing!
