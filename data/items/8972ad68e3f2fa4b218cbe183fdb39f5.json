  "description": "Like we said before, from time to time we have the opportunity to get a band or a musician into a studio and have them walk us through their career. What comes out of these interviews can be  honest and pure conversations about the ups and downs, trials and tribulations, and challenges that come with being a musician trying to keep it all together in the madness and chaos of recording, touring and living.\n\nOn this second episode we pick up the story with Matt from the last days of the Matthew Good Band through the start of his solo career.  \n\nThis is Matt Good...in his own words.
