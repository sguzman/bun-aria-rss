We get up close and personal with some grapes and learn about the work that goes into turning those grapes into delightfully drinkable bottles of wine. And we uncover the secret behind all the great values you’ll find in our wine section (spoiler alert: it’s not actually a secret).</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/pdfs/transcript-pdfs/InsideTJs-Episode42-Transcript.pdf\"> Transcript (PDF)</a></p>",
