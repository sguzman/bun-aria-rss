  "description": "<p>Today's show is headlined by two incredible interviews. First, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, member of the San Diego Chargers 50th anniversary team, business owner, and now fight promoter, Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman, joins the show. He and Pat chat about his new mixed martial arts promotion \"Lights Out Xtreme Fighting,\" and dive into an incredible conversation about life after football. They also chat about what Shawne thinks of the new rule changes in the NFL, and which current NFL player he enjoys watching the most (3:54-35:15). Next, Pat's former teammate, current center of the Arizona Cardinals, and friend of the program, AQ Shipley joins the show. He tells a couple of hilarious stories about ruining his daughter's first birthday party, gives his thoughts on the Cardinals under Kliff Kingsbury, and chats about his new career as a podcaster for PMI (37:55-1:07:45). The guys also dive deep into some science talk as they discuss the possibility of an asteroid wiping out the earth and the tests that scientists are currently running to ensure that doesn't happen, they cover the NHL and NBA playoffs, and give their opinions on the Avatar sequels being pushed back even further. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
