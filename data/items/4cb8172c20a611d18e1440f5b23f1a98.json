  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that the Reaper botnet is still quiet, and looking like a booter-for-hire. BadRabbit shows some odd stealth, and some interesting strategic selectivity. A malicious Chrome extension steals everything you put on a website. Currency miners on phones seem to be the kind of crime that doesn't pay, but that's not stopping crooks from stuffing them into Google Play. First indictments in the US probe of Russian election influence operations are out.  Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs on third party breaches, what she describes as “Not your breach, still your problem.” And a class action suit is filed over the Equifax breach.\n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire.
