  "description": "Don't forget;) I am on tour! Get tickets at heathermcdonald.net\n\nI'm back from my Live Juicy Scoop Streaming show in NYC and bringing the scoop from attending BravoCon. Is Bravo done with RHSLC Jen Shah since pleading guilty? Why does Erika state PK and Dorit are the next to split up? Heather Dubrow got snubbed. Then I give predictions and tips on how to make Bravocon better for Bravo, the stars, and the fans. Then I talk to Lindsey Pelas, who has over 8 Million followers on Instagram. We get into sexual harassment in the restaurant industry and how her life changed after attending a Playboy mansion party. What it is like to date Dan Bilzerian and what those private jet and multi-girlfriend extravagant vacations are like. She shares how she has become one of the top creators on Only Fans, including some marketing secrets. Lindsey is humble, honest, intelligent, funny, and, of course, gorgeous so enjoy.\n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
