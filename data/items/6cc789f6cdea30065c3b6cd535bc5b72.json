  "description": "If life can feel at times like a challenging tightrope walk, how do we face life's difficulties yet remain resilient and open-hearted? Rather than seeking \"perfect\" balance, or tiptoeing on our journey, how do we learn to embrace life and \"dance,\" in order to live most fully?\nIn Dancing on the Tightrope: The Transformative Power of Ten Minutes  (Wellbridge Books, 2018), clinical psychologist and award-winning author Dr. Beth Kurland reveals five common obstacles--habits of the mind that get in the way of living your fullest life--and five tools to transform these obstacles into lasting inner resources for resilience, peace, and joy.\nThis practical yet inspirational book draws upon evidence-based psychology practices and what neuroscience teaches us about the evolution and hardwiring of the brain, as well as Beth's personal experience and her clinical expertise from over twenty years in the field. It addresses the challenges of being human and offers insights on how to bring greater awareness, self-compassion, meaning and authentic happiness into our lives.\nHer book was Awarded “Finalist” in the best Motivational book category by Next Generation Indie Book Awards and was recognized on the Top 12 Book Pick List by Spirited Woman.\nDr. Beth Kurland is a clinical psychologist, a Tedx speaker, and author of three books: Dancing on The Tightrope and Gifts of the Rain Puddle.
