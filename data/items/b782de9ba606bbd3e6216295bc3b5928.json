Between them, a transcript of AI-generated text is highlighted in yellow as AI-generated voices simulating those of Herzog or Žižek read through it. The conversation goes back and forth between them, complete with distinct accents, and you can skip between each segment by clicking the arrows beneath the portraits.</p>\n<p>Its creator positions the site as social commentary on audio <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/bruce-willis-sells-deepfake-rights-to-his-likeness-for-commercial-use/\">deepfakes</a> and upcoming technologies that may undermine trust in media in the near future. \"This project aims to raise awareness about the ease of using tools for synthesizing a real voice,\" Miceli writes on the site. \"Right now, any motivated fool can do this with a laptop in their bedroom.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895474#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895474&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"
