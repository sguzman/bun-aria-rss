This week marks the 5 year anniversary of the School of Greatness podcast.<br />\nI took a minute tonight to reflect on the incredible gift this show has been to me and I was overcome with gratitude.<br />\nI could never have imagined what this show and these conversations and these relationships and this audience would become when I started this little project.<br />\nI would love to hear from you this week -- how has the podcast impacted your life? How long have you been listening? What have been your favorite episodes? Has anyone listened to every single episode?<br />\nAt the end of the day, the best part of this whole experience is you -- the audience. There's no show without you. I'm so grateful you've listened and stayed with me on this journey.<br />\n\"It's all about living the adventure of life and doing it together.\"<br />\nWhen I think about the inspiration we've heard, the lessons we've learned, the value we've gotten, and the people we've met through this show, I am so humbled.<br />\nAnd this is just the beginning.<br />\nWhile I am always looking forward to what we can create even better, I knew it was important to take this moment and acknowledge what we have created together so far.<br />\nI am truly honored to be in this journey of greatness with you.<br />\nTo celebrate this milestone, I wanted to highlight one top episode from each year of the podcast. I added a little commentary before each one and shared my thoughts about the show as a whole.<br />\nSo thank you again and here's to another 5 years of greatness in Episode 593.<br />\nIn this episode you will learn:<br />\nHow Tim Ferriss prepared for big keynotes<br />\nTony Robbins' morning priming ritual and book recommendations<br />\nAlanis Morissette's definition of true success<br />\nWhy Chris Lee believes in the power of visualization so strongly<br />\nHow Mel Robbins became a confident master of her fear<br />\nPlus much more…</p>\n",
