  "description": "<p><strong>The Carnivore’s Manifesto</strong> by Patrick Martins & Mike Edison. The book features fifty ways to be an enlightened carnivore, while taking better care of our planet and ourselves. We have evolved as meat eaters, proclaims Patrick Martins, and it’s futile to deny it. But, given the destructive forces of the fast-food industry and factory farming, we need to make smart, informed choices about the food we eat and where it comes from. In 50 short chapters, Martins cuts through organize zealotry and the misleading jargon of food labeling to outline realistic steps everyone can take to be part of the sustainable-food movement. Tune in to get some insight into Patrick’s thinking and the writing process that went into creating this book.
