  "description": "<p>The Overland Campaign series continues on this episode of Battles & Banter, as it is just Avery & Codie on a nice, bromantic evening as they discuss the fighting that took place between the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia along the banks of the North Anna River, just 40 miles north of the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The guys discuss this mostly overlooked engagement of the Overland Campaign and why it is so important to the bigger outlook of things in 1864. There's also much talk of \"Hamilton\", as Codie's finally on the bandwagon (thanks Disney+), and Tony's presence is greatly missed. Enjoy!</p>",
