  "description": "<p>Maggie O’Farrell’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Hamnet,”</a> one of last year’s most widely acclaimed novels, imagines the life of William Shakespeare, his wife, Anne (or Agnes) Hathaway, and the couple’s son Hamnet, who died at 11 years old in 1596. On this week’s podcast, O’Farrell says she always planned for the novel to have the ensemble cast it does, but that her deepest motivation was the desire to capture a sense of the young boy at its center.</p><p>“The engine behind the book for me was always the fact that I think Hamnet has been overlooked and underwritten by history,” she says. “I think he’s been consigned to a literary footnote. And I believe, quite strongly, that without him — without his tragically short life — we wouldn’t have the play ‘Hamlet.’ We probably wouldn’t have ‘Twelfth Night.’ As an audience, we are enormously in debt to him.”</p><p>Judith Shulevitz visits the podcast to discuss Rachel Cusk’s new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/books/review/second-place-rachel-cusk.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Second Place,”</a> and to analyze Cusk’s literary style.</p><p>“In this review, I quote Isaac Babel: ‘No iron spike can pierce a human heart as icily as a period in the right place.’ There’s this kind of clinical accuracy to her writing,” Shulevitz says, “that she brings to bear on both the physical world and on the emotional world that is almost scary. Which is what I like.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary this year; Alexandra Alter has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/books/blake-bailey-philip-roth-biography.html\" target=\"_blank\">news from the publishing world</a>; and Dwight Garner and Jennifer Szalai talk about books they’ve recently reviewed.
