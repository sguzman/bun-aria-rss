  "description": "Texas’s Republican governor and attorney general are pursuing a new crackdown on trans kids and their families. Their directive compelling Child Protective Services to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse is raising alarms among trans rights advocates, who say the order, if enforced, will prove dangerous for a vulnerable population.\n\nWhy did Republican leaders pick this moment to trumpet an anti-trans effort? How does it fit into a wider culture war—or perhaps a larger effort to drive trans people from public life?\n\nGuest: Katelyn Burns, columnist at MSNBC and co-host of the podcast Cancel Me, Daddy.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
