Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is raising money for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in her home state …Let’s review exactly what CAIR is and what their parent organization, Hamas, stands for in Palestine …Tlaib’s speech contains subtle jabs at Israel, endless banter against President Trump, and a blatant historical inaccuracy …Would Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) speaking Hamas rhetoric (via CAIR) in Congress be grounds for a full investigation into her past? … Islamophobia should not happen in our country, but radical Islamists should not be in our country, let alone our government.\n\n \n\nHour 2:\n\nBill O’Reilly joins the program a day early …Why are so many Democrats afraid to call themselves capitalist when such a small fraction of Americans call themselves socialist? …Progressives all seem to be willing to put their money where their mouth is while the Right struggles to mobilize …Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) attended Boston University, Bill’s Alma mater, but she never showed any promise in a political sense while there …There is no way that she could have known, without outside influence, that the congressional seat in her district was there for the taking.\n\n \n\nHour 3:\n\nGlenn tells the story of a nightmare unfolding for the average Venezuelan every day – This is the inevitable result of a socialist utopia …A caller explains how a decades-old quote by Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi says a lot about the current state of Islamism in Europe and the U.S. …Author Joel C. Rosenberg joins the program to discuss his book ‘The Persian Gamble’ as well as his interactions with President Trump …Could arms deals between Iran and North Korea be going on right under America’s nose? …Is the true Axis of Evil comprised of Russia, Iran and North Korea?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
