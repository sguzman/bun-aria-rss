  "description": "<p>Why not start your body off each day in a fat-burning state? It’s as easy as drinking a glass of water… and here’s why.</p> <p>A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that drinking just 17 ounces of water can increase your metabolic rate by up to 30%. Wait, what?! So, this whole drinking water to lose fat thing actually works? In short, yes. But the real gold is in the details.</p> <p>The researchers in the study found that the total thermogenic response of drinking the water was a burn off of about 24 Calories. Just to be clear, this does not mean that chug-a-lugging gallons of water each day will have you burning massive amounts of calories. There’s an upper limit to this that easily gets bypassed by overdoing it on the aqua. Just like everything else in life, too much of even a good thing can quickly turn into a bad thing (unless it’s watching Game of Thrones… according to my wife, there’s no such thing as too much). Yet, the upper limit is definitely not the issue for the majority of people.</p> <p>The average person today does not give their body the real hydration it needs. Chronic dehydration goes hand-in-hand with chronic disease, and still it’s disappointedly overlooked in the medical profession. Most people are not giving their body the water-induced thermogenic benefits possible for them because they are missing out on small keys that open big doors of health and wellness.</p> <p>One, it’s water… not juice, not “vitamin water”, not gatorade, snakeade, or turtleade, not soda, not coffee… just WATER. Two, the actual quality of water matters. It matters in how it relates to your tissues. Specifically, the aquaporin channels that get the water from your belly into your cells. For more on that, make sure to check out the <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/best-water-filter-best-bottled-water/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hydration and Water Masterclass</a> episode right after this one. Third, it’s how and when they drink the water. Follow up studies found that drinking 1 - 2 ounces of water had no significant thermogenic effect. Sippy sippin on the water bottle throughout the day just isn’t going to cut it. You need to get in a nice oil change a couple of times a day. Target 16 - 24 ounces to make the magic happen. And, as you’ll discover today, getting that first drink in to start your day has even more advantage, and might be a game-changing cornerstone of a morning routine that transforms your life.</p> <p>Today you’ll learn how a consistent morning routine literally changes your brain and helps to set you up for success. You’ll also learn about morning routines of some of the most successful people on the planet, and real, tangible proof that their success (and having an effective morning routine) is not an accident.
