  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: Were Airmen denied hot meals, indoor toilets & other luxuries as they prepare for the fog of war?! An article floating around says so, and the Army & Marine Corps are collectively vomiting & rolling their eyes at it. </p><p>Round 2: General Mattis dropped an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. I havent read it yet but Id imagine it's about the benefits of the Thrift Savings Plan and the benefits of using a quality credit union like Ft Sill National Bank. </p><p>Round 3: The Marine Corps is FUCKIN LIT. Find out how a color sergeant used the element of fire to discipline his unit. </p><p>Round 4: We interviewed Stephen Machuga, CEO of Stack Up, things get nerdy in the best possible way</p><p>Round 5: Just when you thought challenge coins couldn't get any worse…. An Army Major has sparked controversy across the interwebs by using one to endorse Joe Biden in while she was wearing her uniform!</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
