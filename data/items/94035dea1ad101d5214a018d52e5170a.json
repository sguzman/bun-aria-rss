  "description": "<p>The 24 hour work cycle has become the worshipped paradigm for Americans. Crush it! Never Stop! But is it really the way to go? Also, I discuss ambivalence and how it can change your life! Did you know you can simultaneously love and hate something at the same time?! My shrink taught me all about that. The Mommy Myth and how it has made American Mothers feel like shit. Also some listener emails - one gal wants to get her life, but is afraid of being by herself. Why does she get freaked out when she's not doing something? A man has BBD syndrome (Bigger, Better Deal) with women. What's going on here and how can he get his love life? </p>\n",
