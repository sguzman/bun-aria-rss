  "description": "<p>We may be in the golden age of true crime television. Our latest obsession? The Silicon scammer. The bad entrepreneur. The failing founder. From &ldquo;Super Pumped&rdquo; (about Uber founder Travis Kalanick), to &ldquo;We Crashed&rdquo; (about WeWork founder Adam Neumann), to &ldquo;The Dropout&rdquo; (about Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes), it seems audiences can&rsquo;t get enough of the heart-pounding rise and gut-punching fall of these brilliant, young, white, mostly male moguls. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie explores what it was like to become one of the more enigmatic tech billionaires, Elizabeth Holmes. &ldquo;I got to go to work everyday and play this enigma and then go home to my family,&rdquo; says Amanda Seyfried who stars as Holmes in the Hulu series, &ldquo;The Dropout,&rdquo; based on the podcast of the same name. Amanda and Katie talk about nailing the look, reaching the depths of Elizabeth&rsquo;s voice, and how Amanda found ways to identify with the now-convicted, former Theranos founder.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
