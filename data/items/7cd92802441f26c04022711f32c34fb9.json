  "description": "Hey Listener! This week Melody is joined by Dani from Black Chick Lit and Ice Planet Podcasts to recap the film Sylvie's Love. It stars Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomughda and is supported by Regé-Jean Page (from Bridgerton!), Aja Naomi King, and Eva Longoria! It is such a beautiful and cozy watch and it was everything we needed! \n Bonus Content: New year, new president, holy vintage fashion, Batman, The Duke of Hastings is in this!, but Mel knew him from his lesser-known role as an ambitious prosecutor in We The People (weird flex), what is a French Light?, how say \"saxophonist\"?!, husband Lacey was Cato from the show Underground, silly champagne/fish sounds, ALIEN SEX BOOKS, and so much more! \n Self-Love Recommendations (Lady Loves): \n Dani: Playing Stardew Valley and creating Ice Planet Pod\n Mel: an amazing musical podcast called In Strange Woods. It's like the best investigative podcast meets Broadway and she's obsessed.\n Find Dani on https://blackchicklit.com/ (Black Chick Lit) and https://iceplanetpod.com/ (Ice Planet Pod).
