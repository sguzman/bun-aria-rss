  "description": "With the transition to remote work, we often hear the term remote access used in unison. Typically, remote work application access is facilitated via a remote access mechanism and, presumably, local work application access is facilitated via a local access mechanism. But I argue that this connection does not really hold true. Sure, remote work does require the use of a remote access mechanism, but the mechanism can and should also be used for local work. There's really no such thing as local access.",
