    "media:description": "In this data visualization video I look at the most popular search engines based on average monthly users, the industry standard when comparing search engines and websites. It does not take into account page views nor unique visitors. Some of the data includes approximate numbers as the data available skipped years. The data comes from Wikipedia, Google Books, Alexa PR, and a few search engine trackers. \n\nI also include screenshots of certain search engines as they looked during that particular year.\n\n\nThe songs are all from MelodyLoops.com:\nBattlefield by ArtIss \n\nAbove the Ocean by Infraction\n\nEpic Motivation by Roman Cano",
