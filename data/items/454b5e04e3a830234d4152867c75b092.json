  "description": "<p>In episode 4 we discuss AG’s intense (and hilariously terrible) journey in Sedona.. on mushrooms. You can gain some insight on what to do when your friends face melts off and get advice on how to avoid charges for rearranging landscape at 5 star resorts. Spoiler alert: AG has none for you. Is her bad trip worse than the time Shannon accidentally did meth? Who could be too sure. The girls explain their “Desperado scale” and how Shannon managed to reach an all time new high on it. Will she have to get the authorities involved in her liquor store crush?  Shannon gives the 411 on Malibu with Bridgerton and you’ll find out if she finally “gave those titties a chance” on another date now that it’s autumn. Stay in school and off drugs kids. </p>",
