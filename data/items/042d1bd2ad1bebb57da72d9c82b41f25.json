  "description": "<p>Hey everyone! Hope Thanksgiving went safe and smoothly for all of you out there. On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery and Codie discuss one of the most harrowing and incredible battles in American military history: The Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 70 years ago on the shores of a man-made lake in North Korea, 15,000 U.N. forces, most of which were U.S. Marines, were attacked and surrounded by over 60,000 Chinese soldiers of the 9th People's Liberation Army. From November 27th to December 17th, the UN X Corps troops had to fight for survival in subzero temperatures against an enemy who attacked at night and outnumbered them almost 4 to 1. Avery & Codie discuss the fighting around the reservoir itself, the breakout of the UN X Corps from encirclement and one of the most successful military evacuations in history at the port of Hungnam. This battle would become noted for its extraordinary circumstances and along with the debacle at the Ch'ongch'on River, would change the war in Korea forever. Enjoy!</p>",
