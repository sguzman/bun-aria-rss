  "description": "<p>Who killed Sister Cathy Ceznick in Baltimore, MD in November of 1969? Two former students--our heroes Gemma and Abbie--launch a dogged investigation into the decades-old cold case. The horrors they uncover include stories of sexual abuse by Priests, a possible cover up by the Catholic Church, and a potentially corrupt city government. \n In pursuit of the truth, we meet crooked cops, gay uncles, pregnant drag queens (you heard me), a detective named \"deep throat,\" and a whole bunch of bad-ass ladies who are getting to the bottom this thing, no matter what. \n This is part one of two. \n Yellow Tail Chardonnay is the EXCLUSIVE sponsor of this episode. </p>\n",
