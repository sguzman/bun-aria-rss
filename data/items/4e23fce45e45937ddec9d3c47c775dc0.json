  "description": "<p>Neglected and ignored by the medical establishment throughout most of its history, sickle cell disease remains one of the most common (and commonly misunderstood) genetic conditions in the world. In this episode, we break down the myriad effects that one nucleotide substitution can have on the human body and discuss the basics of what it means when blood cells sickle. Continuing with the theme of the seen and unseen, we then turn to the history of sickle cell disease, a history of long-standing injustice and the unending fight to raise awareness and provide support for those impacted by the condition. And as always, we wrap up with a discussion on the current global status of sickle cell disease and some exciting new treatment options on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>We are so honored and thrilled to be joined this episode by not one, not two, but three incredible guests! You’ll hear first from Marsha Howe and Sharif Tusuubira, who share with us some of their firsthand experiences living with sickle cell disease. And then in our current status section, Dr. Megan Hochstrasser from the Innovative Genomics Institute walks us through the mind-blowing genome editing approaches being used to treat genetic conditions such as sickle cell disease.</p><p>You can follow Marsha on her website for her non-profit organization and blog&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mylifewithsicklece.wixsite.com/mlwsc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“My Life With Sickle Cell”</a>&nbsp;as well as through her social media channels: Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marshamlwsc?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@MarshaMLWSC</a>,&nbsp;Instagram:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marsha_h181/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@marsha_h181</a>, Facebook:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marsha.algar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marsha Howe</a>.
