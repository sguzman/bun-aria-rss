  "description": "<p>In an industry where most startups go up, down, and disappear, Danielle Guizio is a New York-based fashion designer on <em>Forbes&rsquo;s </em>30 under 30 list. If you think of the biggest celebrities on the style pages today, you&rsquo;re likely to find a photo of them wearing her designs.&nbsp; She describes the line &ndash; which shares her name, Danielle Guizio &ndash; as &ldquo;celebrating the modern-day woman who aims to deviate from the traditional and push boundaries in all aspects of life.&rdquo; She has even revived the corset, which Ariana Grande wore in black satin on the set of her music video for &ldquo;7 Rings.&rdquo; Because of her age, one might assume Danielle came to her success in a straight line. But as we hear in her interview with host Kevin Burke, Danielle&rsquo;s coming of age was more jagged and uncertain, filled with experiences that brought her face-to-face with some scary and ugly sides of life.&nbsp; Out of all this, she placed her big bet on designing clothes that make young women like her, as she says, feel confident and strong.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Your Hometown </em>is a show where the local is the epic.
