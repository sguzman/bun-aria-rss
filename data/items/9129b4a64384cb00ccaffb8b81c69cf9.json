  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Traveling Salesmen, the first episode in a two episode arch directed by Greg Daniels (Upload, Space Force). Greg sends in some amazing memories from this episode, the ladies give a little TV production crash course, and discuss those really fun character pairings. Then we get a hilarious laundry call back from The Coup (or should we say laundry and betrayal?), and the ladies share their memories of those Pam and Angela scenes in the coffee shop. Finally, we get a Dwangela Heartbreak In The Break Room moment with a song submitted by Michelle Ferguson. </p>\n",
