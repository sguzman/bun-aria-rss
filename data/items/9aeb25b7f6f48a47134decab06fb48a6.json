    "media:description": "The complexification of a real vector space. The complexification of an operator on a real vector space. Every operator on a nonzero finite-dimensional real vector space has an invariant subspace of dimension 1 or 2. Every operator on an odd-dimensional real vector space has an eigenvalue. The characteristic and minimal polynomials of an operator on a real vector space.",
