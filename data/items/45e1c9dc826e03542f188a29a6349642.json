  "description": "<p>The double-copy construction for form factors was reported in our previous\nwork, in which a novel mechanism of turning spurious poles in Yang-Mills theory\ninto physical poles in gravity is observed. This paper is the first of a series\nof two papers providing the details as well as various generalizations on the\ndouble-copy construction of tree-level form factors. In this paper, we\nestablish the generic formalism by focusing on the form factor of ${\\rm\ntr}(\\phi^2)$ in the Yang-Mills-scalar theory. A thorough discussion is given on\nthe emergence of the \"spurious\"-type poles and various related properties. We\nalso discuss two generalizations: the Higgs amplitudes in QCD, and the ${\\rm\ntr}(\\phi^2)$ form factors with multiple external scalar states.\n</p>",
