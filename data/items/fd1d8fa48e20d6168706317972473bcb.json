  "description": "<p>The concept of causality plays a significant role in human cognition. In the\npast few decades, causal inference has been well developed in many fields, such\nas computer science, medicine, economics, and other industrial applications.\nWith the advancement of deep learning, it has been increasingly applied in\ncausal inference against counterfactual data. Typically, deep causal models map\nthe characteristics of covariates to a representation space and then design\nvarious objective functions to estimate counterfactual data unbiasedly.\nDifferent from the existing surveys on causal models in machine learning, this\npaper mainly focuses on the overview of the deep causal models, and its core\ncontributions are as follows: 1) we summarize the popularly adopted relevant\nmetrics under multiple treatments and continuous-dose treatment; 2) we cast\ninsight on a comprehensive overview of deep causal models from both timeline of\ndevelopment and method classification perspectives; 3) we also endeavor to\npresent a detailed categorization and analysis on relevant datasets, source\ncodes and experiments.\n</p>",
