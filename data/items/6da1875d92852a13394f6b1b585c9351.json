  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the podcast making film writing superhero KEVIN SMITH!</p><br><p>SNOOGINS! Yes indeed folks, genuine goodness right here this week as Brett is joined by the master! As you will have absolutely seen, Kevin is out on promo duty for his new film ‘Jay & Silent Bob Reboot’, which is killing it with audiences who joined the Smith crew on the ground floor or a little further down the road. Brett had a chance to kick it with the man and of course he took that chance and now we can enjoy the results in full! And a full slightly shorter one it is too - you know Kevin can talk and while you get the full benefit of that, you also get to hear his personal movie choices too which is a rare treat! But on top of that, hear everything else including his notice of the UK’s hunger for podcasts, his recent brush with death and how his outlook on life has changed entirely - not to mention the cinematic choices he’s made since, serenity in the hospital, his ‘cinematic gravestone’, how his films are passed down the generations, the impracticality of a drive-in movie, being a good cryer, the three act pornography structure, working with his wife and walking out of films. And SO so much more. A treat. Please enjoy!</p><br><p><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=E3221FF6-30F8-47EA-AC13-5192D8D839F7&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=87E83585-2F38-4CFC-AA66-402211DF8D24\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>UPCOMING SHOW @ THE BFI •&nbsp;DECEMBER 19th!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong><em>EPISODE LINKS:</em></strong></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>KEVIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.viewaskew.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>VIEW ASKEW!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.smodcast.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SMODCAST!</strong></a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHvaWulHk5E\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>JAY & SILENT BOB REBOOT!</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlfn5n-E2WE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLERKS﻿!</strong></a></p><br><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrbrettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on INSTAGRAM!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/brettgoldstein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BRETT on PATREON!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.podcastmerch.co.uk/films-to-be-buried-with\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FTBBW PODCAST MERCHANDISE!</strong></a></p><p><strong>• </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyHN3_ZUyuA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'SUPERBOB' - Brett's 2015 feature film!</strong></a></p><p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/75576061\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>'CORNERBOYS' with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP!</strong></a></p><br><p>• <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/distractionpiecespodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK</strong></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/distractionpiecesnetwork\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM</strong></a></p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith\">http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
