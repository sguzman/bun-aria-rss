  "description": "<p>A week before the 2020 US Presidential election, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo joins us to tell the story of a company that has impacted all of our lives (political and otherwise) like none other. While it's easy to forget now, a very viable alternate history exists where it's Twitter, not Facebook, who owns Instagram, and Vine, not TikTok, that's the global platform for mobile video. We dive into it all on this episode — and of course while we had Dick, we also had to discuss his controversial recent deleted tweet.<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show, the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our live Book Club discussions with top authors. <strong>Join here at: <a href= \"https://acquired.fm/lp/\">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website. You can read them below or at: <a href= \"https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/twitter-with-dick-costolo\">https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/twitter-with-dick-costolo</a><br />  <br /></p> <p><strong>Playbook Themes from this Episode:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Sometimes early advantages matter. A lot.</strong> In a network economy industry (like social media), it's almost impossible to chase down someone with an established lead. The only way you can hope to compete is by changing the game. And even that is a long shot. <ul> <li>Once Facebook — and then Instagram within Facebook — had established a meaningful active user lead over Twitter, there was no \"down the middle\" play Twitter could run to catch up. Twitter recognized this and attempted all sorts of orthogonal strategies: video (Vine), live (Periscope), music (Twitter Music), syndication (Moments), exclusive content (the NFL deal). In each case either Facebook was able to copy and co-opt the innovation, or the attempt simply failed.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sometimes reach matters. A lot.</strong> If you're operating in a network economy, your service MUST deliver a first-class experience on every platform that matters. <ul> <li>Vine launched on iOS and immediately went to #1 in the App Store. But they didn't get a good Android experience out fast enough, which fractured the social graph that users could share across. Instagram was able to respond aggressively with a first-class video experience across both iOS and Android before Vine could stop the bleeding — and the rest is history.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Network Resiliency.</strong> Some network graphs are more inherently defensible than others. How easy it is to \"rehydrate\" your network somewhere else should drive how closely you guard it. <ul> <li>Facebook, LinkedIn and WhatsApp all have relatively low defensible networks — if you were to exfiltrate their graphs, you could recreate their value quickly. This is why all of those companies / products significantly restrict connection exporting, and also why they were able to bootstrap quickly in the early days by importing users' address books.</li> <li>By contrast, the Twitter graph is about interest, not social connections. Even if you exfiltrated all its connections, it'd be very difficult to recreate Twitter (people have tried). This dynamic made it more difficult for Twitter to scale quickly, but also has made it more resilient over time. The core Twitter product is just as robust — if not more — today than it was in 2010... the same can't be said for the blue Facebook product, which has bled out to Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Snap, iMessage, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Balancing forest fires and forestry management.</strong> As a leader of a rapidly growing organization, you face two types of challenges: \"forest fires\" (this crazy thing just happened and we need to respond), and \"forestry management\" (this set of crazy things will keep happening until we figure out a solution that scales). You need a different mental state to approach each, and balancing between the two is incredibly difficult when you're see-sawing back and forth every day.<br /> <br /></li> </ol> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ashish Goel at Stanford: <a href= \"https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/twitter.html\">https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/twitter.html</a></li> <li>Dick and Adam's new firm, 01 Advisors: <a href= \"https://01a.com/\">https://01a.com/</a><br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Carve Outs:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Vote! <a href= \"https://www.vote.org/\">https://www.vote.org</a></li> </ul>",
