  "description": "Topical Smoothie is adding a double drive-thru restaurant that could help drive franchising growth for the brand. Existing franchisees are also behind 70% of the company’s total cafe openings this year, and have helped increase its year-to-date opening by 25% compared to the first three quarters of 2021. The chain also is one of the rising stars in consumer sentiment, growing to #28 on the Foodable Labs top 150 list.<br /><br />In 2021, the company opened its 1,000th location and reported same-store sales growth of 22%. Last year, digital sales made up 76% of the company’s sales growth, after it introduced customizable online and mobile ordering. <br /><br />Sales Rising<br /><br />In the first three months of the pandemic, NYC taxable sales from bars and restaurants dropped over 50% (70% in Manhattan) since restaurants were not allowed to offer outdoor seating. This trend changed once Open Streets launched in June 2020, with a continued uptick in sales.<br /><br />The uptick in sales compared to pre-pandemic levels reflect the growing impact of inflation and rising menu prices on company operations. Full-service meal prices were up 8.8% during the last 12 months compared to an increase of 7.1% for limited service, according to the Consumer Price Index.",
