  "description": "<p>In this episode, John Maxwell concludes his lesson on earning trust––the number one responsibility of a leader. John discusses the important roles that competent leadership, empowerment of others, courage to risk in relationships, and integrity all play in gaining the trust of your team.</p> <p>John also digs into a common misconception that many leaders have about empowering others: Empowering others does not mean giving up control. It means giving others the ability to do more so that you can accomplish what you alone can achieve.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Earning Trust Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Trust and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://johnmaxwell.com/greatestreturn\">The Leader’s Greatest Return by John C.
