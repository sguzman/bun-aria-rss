Rickson Gracie is a living legend with over 450 wins in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. As much of a warrior he has become over the years as a 9th degree red belt, he is also kind, spiritual, and connected in mind and body.

He shares the importance of the breath and what it takes to be uncomfortable, seek out discomfort and learn to master and control yourself in that discomfort. Though you may not be on a mission to become a jiu jitsu competitor, you will still benefit from the lessons shared byu Master Rickson Gracie in this episode.   Order Rickson Gracie’s new book, Breathe: A Life In Flow: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CGVz4C\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3CGVz4C</a>   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction Rickson Gracie 2:10 | Kindness of a True Warrior 4:26 | Tools of Martial Arts 7:34 | Control Mind Body & Spirit 15:32 | Spiritual Power of a Warrior 17:35 | When the Fight Comes 24:55 | Developing Moral Values 37:18 | Elements Needed for Mindset 40:09 | The Gift of Being Present 46:37 | Allow Kids Their Own Path 50:24 | Uncomfortable Breathing 54:26 | Help Non-Fighters Fight Life   QUOTES: “Martial arts gives you tools. The tools are connection, base, deflection,  strategy, emotional control, the capacity for you to use visualization, and other elements.” [5:44]   “So just being prepared, just being talented is not enough. Just being able to focus and be strategically correct is not enough. I have to have the spirituality to say today is a great day to be in a battle.” [9:04]   “I was accepting death in order to be comfortable in hell.” [9:28]   “I noticed my worst enemy at this point was my own mind, playing tricks on me. It tells me I don't have enough, tells me I was tired, tells me that I’m [gonna lose]. So my mind was completely against my purpose.” [14:24]   “I cannot be just a jiu jitsu teacher, I had to be a psychologist. Because I have to approach a guy who stands insecure in a different way, than approach a guy who's just lazy and completely off.” [36:08]   “The real learning of your breathing system is to learn how to maximize your hyperventilation, to cope with the activities you plan to do.” [39:17]   “If you try to hide the emotions from yourself, and try to show everybody you're okay, you're just making a patch which is not working.
