  "description": "<p>Well after a bit of a stutter with no episode yesterday (damn COVID) it's time bring you an episode worth of a double dose of action as we recap two action packed days of Beijing 2022 and be sure to crown a queen and everything else in between! Why are we just not worthy of Ester Ledecka and her amazingness? Why is it only going to get better for her and our love for her? Who else over the last two days has gotten our love worthy of queen status? Are we sick of hearing the word GOAT? What new nickname have we developed for Mikaela Shiffrin? How sorry for the US do we feel that they had to suffer such a gold medal drought? What the hell is a screaming seaman? And do we all survive this episode with or without COVID? Strap yourself in and cough away for another entertaining episode you can't miss!</p>",
