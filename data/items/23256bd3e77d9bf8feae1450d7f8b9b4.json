  "description": "All this week on the The Gist, we’re down with O.P.P.: Other People’s Podcasts. One of our favorites is Alex Blumberg’s StartUp, which  tells the story of his startup, Gimlet Media. Blumberg explains the anxiety involved in pulling back the curtain each episode: “There’s this giant pit in my stomach before it drops. Like, have I said too much this time, or are people going to hate me, or am I going to embarrass myself?” For the Spiel, meet the podfather. We speak with Christopher Lydon from Open Source about the first audio weblog.\n\nGet The Gist by email as soon as it’s available: slate.com/GistEmail\n\nSubscribe to the podcast in iTunes: itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slate…id873667927?mt=2\nLearn more about your ad choices.
