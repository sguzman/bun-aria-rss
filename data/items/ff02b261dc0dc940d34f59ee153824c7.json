  "description": "When your child says things like \"I only love mommy\" or \"Go away, I want daddy to give me a bath!\", it's easy to feel like you're doing something wrong. Remember this: Your child's rejection is not a barometer of your parenting. In these moments, there's nothing wrong with the in-favor parent, the out-of-favor parent, or the child. In fact, your child's rejection is a sign that they feel safe enough in your presence to even express their displeasure. In this week's episode, Dr. Becky hears from three parents who are struggling with phases of parental preference. She gently reminds each parent of their goodness and provides actionable strategies to manage these tricky and often triggering moments.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
