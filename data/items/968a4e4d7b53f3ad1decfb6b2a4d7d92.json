  "description": "<p>Ari Shaffir comes to my apartment to tell you about Passover. All of it. Not just what you're supposed to do, but also where the holiday comes from, all the laws, the seder, what matzah tastes like. Everything. It's probably the best I've ever been in terms of not interrupting the guest. I still managed to do it a few times, but way less than normal.</p> <p> </p> <p>This episode is brought to you by the Australian leg of my wandering Jew tour:</p> <p>Perth April 13-14</p> <p>Melbourne April 17-21</p> <p>Adelaide April 26</p> <p>Sydney April 28-29</p> <p>Brisbane May 1</p> <p>Get tickets at arithegreat.com/tour</p>",
