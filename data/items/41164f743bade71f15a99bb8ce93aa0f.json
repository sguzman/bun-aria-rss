CUE THE WINE MUSIC!<br/> <a href='https://www.dryfarmwines.com/homemakerchic%20'>https://www.dryfarmwines.com/homemakerchic </a>Today’s “What We’re Sipping” segment is brought to you by Dry Farm Wines is an online wine subscription that pairs organic, biodynamic, naturally yeasted, low-sugar, lower-alcohol wines from all over the world. As Dry Farm customers, we get to share in their love for organic, natural, and traditionally made wines.  “better, not more.” So check out their better wines.

Drink Dry Farm Wines with Ang and Shaye!<br/>Try our new Rose special for Spring!   Three bottles of rosé plus a bonus bottle for a penny! <a href='https://www.buzzsprout.com/804512/episodes/%20https://www.dryfarmwines.com/homemakerchicrose'> https://www.dryfarmwines.com/homemakerchicrose</a><br/><br/>Today’s episode of the podcast is brought to you by The Elliott Homestead Cooking Community. This is for those home cooks out there who would love some new inspiration, ideas, and motivation in the kitchen. Each month, I create five brand new, whole-food, price-conscious, from-scratch recipes each month and either ship them to you physically in the mail or deliver them to your inbox - whichever you prefer. Recipes will range from entrees to side dishes, to desserts, to breads, to breakfast, to vegetables and salads, to soups - and everything in between. I’ll also guide you through the month’s recipes with a long, in-depth cooking video showing you new skills and encouraging you as you give the recipes a try in your own kitchen! And lastly (but certainly not least) is our private, exclusive community of like-minded home cooks who are looking to learn and grow in their kitchen - this is a place for you to ask questions, share your successes, encourage others, and gain inspiration from women just like you! The Elliott Homestead Cooking Community is here to inspire and nourish your family! We’re going to teach you to bake! To use sourdough! To try new ingredients!  Visit cook.theelliotthomestead.com for more information. <a href='http://cook.theelliotthomestead.com/'>cook.theelliotthomestead.com</a></p>",
