  "description": "<p>On this edition of the Bloomberg Business of Sports podcast, Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discusses a host of issues, including Discovery's Inc.'s $2 billion contract to show the PGA Tour internationally. The 12-year deal begins next year and includes TV and online rights to the U.S.-based circuit and the development of a Netflix-like video service. The trio also discuss a brewing battle between the New York Yankees and ESPN, which moved one of the Major League Baseball team's games to night from the afternoon, even though the club has a rainout-forced doubleheader the following day in another city. Also discussed is Serena Williams pulling out of the French Open prior to her much anticipated match against Maria Sharapova. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
