  "description": "<p>Joyce Vance was an Assistant United States Attorney in Alabama for many years. Rising through the ranks in Birmingham, she was confirmed by the Senate as United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. She handled a wide variety of fascinating cases, including one in which the police preyed on vulnerable immigrants in a small Alabama town. <br />\nHer path to public service was borne partly of tragedy. In 1989, her father-in-law and federal appellate judge Robert Vance, was murdered by a mail bomb. That event set Joyce Vance on her path to federal prosecutor in her adopted home of Birmingham. <br />\nJoyce is also an avid knitter and a well-known contributor of legal analysis to MSNBC. <br />\nEmail us any thoughtful feedback at theoathpodcast@gmail.com. </p>\n",
