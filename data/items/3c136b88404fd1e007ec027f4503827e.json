    "media:description": "There's a bit of a dodgy cut at 59 mins due to a manual copyright claim after my video went live, so it's had to be trimmed out in the youtube studio.\n\nHello, it's great to be back with my analysis of the Markle Debacle. It feels like it's taken me a million years to rummage through every single article & video to figure out what happened, but we're here, baby!! This video is going to be focussed on how the tabloids, in my opinion, basically manipulated an entire country (and people in other countries too) to believe a certain narrative for profit, and for the next video in this series I'm going to be analysing the Oprah interview, picking apart the alleged lies they told and the fall-out following, plus more overall analysis of the tabloid industry's relationship with the Royal Family and its women, and women in general - and the social media conspiracy theories about Meghan's pregnancies, and Archie and Lilibet being either fake dolls or born by surrogates, plus loads of other CRAY CRAY stuff like that. It is a journey.
