  "description": "<p>On this podcast, we occasionally like to have guests with at least three full-time names. This week, we have that guest: the great Adam Cayton-Holland. He’s the co-creator and star of <em>Those who Can’t </em>(formerly of TruTV and soon to be on HBOmax) as well as a published author and nationally touring comedian. We were supposed to be doing shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this month, but since we can’t, we decided to do something even better: have him on our podcast! Check out all things Adam Cayton-Holland, and thank us later. Or thanks us now if you’d like. Here are five words to describe this episode: always listen to the villagers.&nbsp;</p>",
