  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Senator Chuck Schumer made comments on climate change alleging that it is destroying our country, however, there was no mention of the crisis at our border. Suggesting that laws can somehow regulate how hot or cold the climate is, is absurd. Schumer noted that this June will be the hottest June on record in his attempt to use the government to control the climate. Then, Mediate has made a grotesque abuse of this program's comments and they should be ashamed of trying to capitalize on any condition that Robert Mueller may, or may not, have. Later, Andrew McCabe takes to the cable news shows to criticize Mueller despite being himself under investigation for allegedly illegally leaking classified information to the media. Afterward, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile and the code pink Republicans will probably blame America first.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
