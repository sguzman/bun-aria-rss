  "description": "<p>Kevin Christy and I sat in his backyard and talked about relationships. Everybody has one friend who jumps from long term relationship to long term relationship and Kevin is that guy for me. As long as I've known him he's been with somebody. This is the first time in his life that he is single and it's a strange place for him to be. It's an interesting conversation on how to make relationships work and how to make them fail.</p>",
