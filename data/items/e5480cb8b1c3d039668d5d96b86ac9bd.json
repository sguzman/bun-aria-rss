Many of our current pharmaceuticals stem from compounds discovered in plant medicines. And many beneficial plants that were discovered decades ago still have huge potential for changing modern medicine—ibogaine is one of them. Today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I’m excited to sit down with Dr. Deborah Mash to discuss the use of the African plant ibogaine and its metabolite, noribogaine, in the treatment of addiction and how it could impact the devastating opioid epidemic.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Deborah Mash is one of the world's foremost experts on ibogaine. She is the CEO and Founder of DemeRx Inc., a clinical-stage drug development company advancing ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine for the treatment of opioid use disorder. DemeRx has partnered with ATAI Life Sciences—a global biotech platform with a special focus on psychedelic medicine—to develop ibogaine for those suffering from opioid use disorder. Building on the extensive human data available around ibogaine, DemeRx and ATAI are conducting a Clinical Phase I/II trial in opioid-dependent patients. This landmark trial will advance screening procedures, dosing guidelines, and best practices for opioid withdrawal management and relapse prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Cozy Earth, InisdeTracker, and Rupa Health.</p><br><p>Cozy Earth makes the most comfortable, temperature-regulating, and nontoxic sheets on the market.
