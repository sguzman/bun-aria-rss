  "description": "We have a great interview today! But first, Molly and Jason cover one of the craziest stories of the year. A couple has been charged with conspiring to launder ~$3.6B worth of crypto from the 2016 Bitfinex hack (2:14).\n\nToday’s Guest is Peter Reinhardt, the co-founder of Segment, a customer data platform that sold to Twillio for $3.2B. Peter discusses his new company, Charm Industrial, which is focused on carbon capture and removal.  In addition to his takeaways from selling Segment (42:00), you will learn:\n1. How they turn agricultural waste and biomass into a high-carbon fuel\n2. The carbon-removal benefits of injecting the bio-fuel into old oil wells\n3. Why carbon capture is an important piece of getting to Net Zero\n4. The potential impact of Charm Industrial if it succeeds (total CO2 tonnage)\n5. Why this process differs from more passive ways of carbon offsets\n6. How he landed customers like Shopify & Stripe (and why he thinks companies will continue to do this, even without government regulation)",
