  "description": "<p>The Shilo Inn in Salt Lake City has been through a series of name changes. It started as the International Dunes Hotel, then became the Shilo Inn and is today a part of the Holiday Inn Express chain. From the outside, the building appears to be a non-distinct hotel, but it carries the heavy burden of a horrible family tragedy. And that tragedy seems to have led to hauntings. Kaz Linza created the Cemetery Society on Facebook, which is a page dedicated to cemeteries, haunted history, conspiracy theories, serial killers and Halloween. He joins us to share the story behind the hauntings at Shilo Inn and experiences that people claim to have had there. Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Bob Sherfield and features Gobekli Tepe pillar depicts comet strike and This Month in History features the birth of Explorer Robert E.
