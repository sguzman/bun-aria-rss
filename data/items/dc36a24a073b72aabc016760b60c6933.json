  "description": "<p>Hail is easily one of the biggest enemies that exist on our homestead.  As some of you might know, last year a hail storm destroyed one of my gardens (and our trampoline).  While there are many different solutions to this problem, we had to be mindful of not only the hail but also the extremely high winds that occur in this part of the country.  Because of this, we knew we needed a heavy-duty, permanent structure, and not some of the lesser solutions that might be fine in other regions.  Listen today to find out how Christian and I put together our hail defense unit, and how you can prepare yourself if hail is an issue in your area.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Makerplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps. They’re the perfect way to reduce plastic waste and make your pantry more functional, all at the same time. Grab a 5-Piece Starter Set from Mason Jars Makerplace while they're at an introductory price-- and, bonus, you won't even pay shipping!
