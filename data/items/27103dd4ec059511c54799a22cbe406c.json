In this French lesson, we first clarify what adverbs and adverbial phrases of frequency are. We then discuss the French adverbs of frequency along with their pronunciation. I then go on to tell you about my morning routine, in French, to illustrate how both adverbs and adverbial phrases of frequency are used in context. We then do a little reading / listening exercise, for you to see how many French adverbs of frequency (and adverbial phrases) you can find in the text.\n\nDon't forget to download your PDF (linked above) to get the list of French adverbs & adverbial phrases of frequency, as well as the transcript and translation of my morning routine.&#13; Hope you find the lesson useful!
