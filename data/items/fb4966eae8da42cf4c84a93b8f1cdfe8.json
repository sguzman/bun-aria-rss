  "description": "Holiday football provided a couple of gifts with one coming in the form of Fitzmagic. On this episode, Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech recap the Friday and Saturday Week 16 action highlighted by Ryan Fitzpatrick coming on in relief of Tua Tagovailoa and Alvin Kamara leading fantasy managers to the promised land. The Dolphins are now in prime position to reach the postseason, courtesy of a quarterback switch and a late-game blunder from Jon Gruden (3:00). The guys analyze Brian Flores' thought process and the QB reliever approach. They also break down the Bucs dominant playoff-clinching victory over the Lions (23:30), who were dealing with a depleted coaching staff and lost Matthew Stafford to injury pretty quickly as well. The Cardinals blew their chance against the 49ers as the Pick Six Superfriends question Kliff Kingsbury's coaching and Kyler Murray's play (29:30) Finally, we revisit Saints-Vikings on Christmas and that all-time performance from Alvin Kamara (40:30).\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
