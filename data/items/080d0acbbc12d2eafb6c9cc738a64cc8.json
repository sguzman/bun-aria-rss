  "description": "<p>Computed tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging technology that assists\nclinical decision-making with high-quality human body representations. To\nreduce the radiation dose posed by CT, sparse-view and limited-angle CT are\ndeveloped with preserved image quality. However, these methods are still stuck\nwith a fixed or uniform sampling strategy, which inhibits the possibility of\nacquiring a better image with an even reduced dose. In this paper, we explore\nthis possibility via learning an active sampling policy that optimizes the\nsampling positions for patient-specific, high-quality reconstruction. To this\nend, we design an \\textit{intelligent agent} for active recommendation of\nsampling positions based on on-the-fly reconstruction with obtained sinograms\nin a progressive fashion. With such a design, we achieve better performances on\nthe NIH-AAPM dataset over popular uniform sampling, especially when the number\nof views is small. Finally, such a design also enables RoI-aware reconstruction\nwith improved reconstruction quality within regions of interest (RoI's) that\nare clinically important. Experiments on the VerSe dataset demonstrate this\nability of our sampling policy, which is difficult to achieve based on uniform\nsampling.\n</p>",
