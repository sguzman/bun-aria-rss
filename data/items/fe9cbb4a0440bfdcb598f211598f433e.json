If you haven’t heard it before: it just means sharing pictures of our kids online.) Whether we have a small, private account for friends and family or share lifestyle content for thousands of eyes to see, let’s at least ask the question—why are we posting this? What are the rewards? What are the risks? In this episode, Emily and Laura chat through questions to consider the ‘why’ behind our sharenting. While the takeaway will look different for everyone, when the gospel guides our thinking, we’ll share with love and wisdom.</span></p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mini-series is brought to you in part by</span> <a href= \"https://www.crossway.org/plus/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Crossway</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">, publisher of</span> <em><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bread of</span></em></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life: Savoring the All Satisfying Goodness of Jesus Through the Art of Breadmaking</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Abigail Dodds.
