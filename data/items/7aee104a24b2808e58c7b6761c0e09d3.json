  "description": "<p>It's time for arguably one of our biggest ever interviews today as we sit down with the icon that is Kieren Perkins to learn more about his incredible career and legacy he has left on not only Swimming in Australia but also for the Olympics too! We find out just why he wasn't the most sporty kid growing up and how a freak accident helped set a path for him to his incredible and record breaking career. We also learn which other legendary Australian sporting icon helped give him a boost ahead of that famous race in Atlanta and just how he was able to cope with his vastly different Olympic experiences at each of the events he attended. Added to this we find out what he thinks about a unique idea we have to involve him in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics and whether or not he still writes his name on his milk. It's one epic chat that you simply can't afford to miss! So get to listening to avoid disappointment!</p>",
