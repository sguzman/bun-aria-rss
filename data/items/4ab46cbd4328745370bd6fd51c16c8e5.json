  "description": "Our audiobook this week is WYNTER’S CAPTIVE by New York Times Bestselling Author Milly Taiden! \n\nNarrated by Kit Swann\n\nLili&#039;s life had never been very exciting, so she hoped her cousin&#039;s wedding would provide some entertainment in her life. What she didn&#039;t expect was to almost kill a man on her way to the ceremony. She definitely didn&#039;t expect to get chased by naked men in middle of the forest. Oh, and she sure as hell didn&#039;t foresee a hot mountain of a man giving her the hottest sex of her life. But, hey, shit happens.\n\nCade Wynters wants revenge. He&#039;s got the perfect plan: Abduct his former friend&#039;s fiancee and keep her past the wedding date. He never thought he&#039;d find his mate in the abducted, sassy-mouthed, curvy goddess. Lili&#039;s giving him a run for his money and he loves every second of it. Shit definitely hits the fan when he realizes he took the wrong woman, and she doesn&#039;t handle being lied to very well.\n\nCade&#039;s brother is working behind the scenes to take control of his pack. Someone&#039;s trying to hurt his mate and he still hasn&#039;t told Lili she&#039;s probably going to grow fur out of her ass. It&#039;s the final countdown and Cade needs to get Lili to forgive him while keeping her safe. Easier said than done. He&#039;s ready to give up his pack to keep his mate...and he might have to.\n\nFAE KING by Milly Taiden: https://amzn.to/33JyQTI\n\nWALL STREET TITAN by Anna Zaires: https://amzn.to/2CJBahJ\n\nTHE REBEL KING by Kennedy Ryan: https://amzn.to/2CKZiQW\n\nHITCHING THE COWBOY by Kennedy Fox: https://amzn.to/377aHZi\n\nALPHA HEROES by Fiona Davenport: https://amzn.to/36YzRt4\n\nHIDDEN TRUTHS by Nikki Aash & K Webster: https://amzn.to/2phS0B5\n\nMilly Taiden Giveaway!: http://readmeromance.com/books/wynters-captive-by-milly-taiden/\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
