  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/add-symptoms-in-women-20394\">this</a> article, ADHD symptoms in girls are often explained as character traits rather than ADHD. Girls might be thought of as spacey, as day-dreamer, forgetful, or chatty. Later in life, a woman might reach out for help for her ADHD, only to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety instead. To help us explore what it might look like to have a diagnosis of ADHD later in life, I am joined today by two very special guests. Inger Shaye Colzie, LCSW and René Brooks. During our conversations we chatted about the impact of being diagnosed with ADHD later in life, why Black women are commonly misdiagnosed, how a later in life diagnosis impacts things like self esteem and identity and some helpful tools and resources for anyone who may need them. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources Mentioned</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><a href=\"https://chadd.org/\">Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://translatingadhd.com/\">Translating ADHD Podcast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://adhdgoodlifepodcast.buzzsprout.com/\">The ADHD Good Life Podcast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.additudemag.com/self-test-adhd-symptoms-women-girls/\">ADHD Self Evaluation for Women</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Inger Shaye</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ingershaye.com/\">http://www.ingershaye.com/</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/ingershaye\">@ingershaye</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://facebook.com/ingershaye\">@ingershaye</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ingershaye\">@ingershaye</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackwomenwithadhd\">Facebook Group</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find René Brooks</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://blackgirllostkeys.com/\">https://blackgirllostkeys.com/</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/blackgirllostkeys\">@blackgirllostkeys</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/blackgirllostkeys\">@blackgirllostkeys</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/blkgirllostkeys\">@blkgirllostkeys</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
