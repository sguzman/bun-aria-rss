  "description": "<p>In this new series, John Maxwell discusses the price tag of leadership. If you’re familiar with John at all, you’ve likely heard him say, “Everything worthwhile is uphill––all the way.” That means there is always a cost associated with leadership and success. The hard truth is that the cost is self-discipline. </p> <p>As John says, the hardest person to lead is yourself. But self-discipline makes all the difference. In part one of this series, John walks through the first three of five truths about self-discipline so you can see what makes it the biggest gamechanger in your own leadership.</p> <p>After John’s lesson, Mark Cole (CEO of The John Maxwell Enterprise) and Richard Chancy consider the role that discipline plays when leaders face criticism. Then they share how self-discipline determines whether your habits serve you or whether you serve your habits.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Price Tag of Leadership Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/PriceTag and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>This series comes from a portion of John’s Developing the Leader Within You online course. Listen through to the end to hear an exclusive offer on the course for our podcast listeners!</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Developing-the-Leader-Within-You-Hardcover_p_671.html\"> <em>Developing the Leader Within You 2.0</em> by John C.
