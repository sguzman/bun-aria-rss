She knows what the reaction is for most people, it is not positive. But, that doesn’t have to be the case. What if influence could be a force for good? That’s what Chance all about. Her course on influence is one of the most popular at Yale School of Management, her behavioral economics framework is the foundation for Google’s global food policy guidelines and her work is often covered in places like The Economist, The New York Times, and the BBC. In today’s conversation, we also take a step back in time, explore Zoë’s personal journey, which started in a very different place. Prior to teaching at Yale, Zoë managed a $200 million segment of the Barbie brand and received her doctorate from Harvard Business School.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
