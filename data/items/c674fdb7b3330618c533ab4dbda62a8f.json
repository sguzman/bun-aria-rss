  "description": "<p>Days before Christopher Dickerson disappeared from his Adrian, Michigan, home in January, he sent a photo to his mother showing injuries from being jumped. Tracena Dickerson feared her 27-year-old son's disappearance was related to his testimony against a man who was charged with trying to kill him in May 2018. Dickerson's body was found in a wooded area in rural Michigan on February 22, 2019, the apparent victim of a fatal stabbing. His mom is now convinced there is a connection, considering the defendant in the attempted murder case had been quietly released from jail near the time her son vanished. Nancy Grace digs into the case with the mother. They are joined by a panel of experts including former detective Steven Lampley, North Carolina family & divorce lawyer Kathleen Murphy, and psychologist Caryn Stark.</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
