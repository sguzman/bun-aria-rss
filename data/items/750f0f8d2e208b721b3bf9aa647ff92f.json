  "description": "<p>Cancel culture, double standard for Rogan and Howard Stern. Clay says, \"Howard Stern was wildly more offensive than anything Joe Rogan did.\" But Stern has created some \"woke insurance\" so they won't come for him. Is America still a free country? Buck eloquently questions that and wants to push everyone to do some hard thinking about it. 2022 must be a denunciation of the authoritarianism of the left. Even The View rips Stacey Abrams. ESPN commentator J. A. Adande compares China's genocide to voter ID laws in red states. Buck says people must not stop listening to sports media people no matter what they say. Bill Maher correctly analyzes Democrat confusion.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
