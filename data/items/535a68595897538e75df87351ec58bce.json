Growing up biracial in West London’s Southall neighborhood, which has been known to many as little Punjab or Little India since the 60s, she was surrounded by different cultures, developed an early curiosity for people and community, and a passion for acting that led her to the iconic Brit School of Performing Arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually heading to LA to build her career in the business, she became increasingly called to both create her own roles, focus on producing positive media, and take control of her career, founding Uplifting Content, a social media platform followed by over 1.4 million people, hosting the Uplifting Content Podcast and most recently writing the book, Uplifting Stories (<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y39e7ju6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/y39e7ju6</a>).
