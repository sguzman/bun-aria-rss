  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the guys are joined by starting Center for the Arizona Cardinals and great friend of the show, AQ Shipley. They discuss how the Cardinals are quietly coming back to life, what his thoughts are on Kliff Kingsbury and what makes him so creative in terms of play calling. He chats about his budding relationship with Kyler Murray, and what he's starting to figure out about the NFL game which is leading him to more success. AQ also tells a couple stories from this past week in preparation for a tough game in New York against the Giants, including being singled out at practice by an authentic New York heckler, and also chats about what life is like as a new dad (3:01-35:50). The guys also discuss everything of note that happened this past weekend in the NFL and Pat breaks out his power rankings for the AFC and the NFC, and dives into what the Bears need to do with the Mitch Trubisky situation, as it seems to have reached it's boiling point. To close out the show, Golden Globe winner, 3x Emmy Winner, accomplished actor on both stage and screen, and the man responsible for one of the greatest characters in TV history, Jeremy Piven joins Pat and the guys in studio. They discuss his career as an actor, what Entourage did for it, and whether or not he knew it was going to be a massive success when it first came out. Jeremy also recounts a hilarious story from his time on Seinfeld, goes in depth on what school of acting he went to and what he's most comfortable with, and chats about his standup comedy and why he is such a perfectionist when it comes to the craft (1:04:14-1:30:39). Today's show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
