  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys dive into the dilemma of trying to get Gump into this country legally with a working visa or green card. He and Todd break down their tussle with ICE as they went for a sit down with an immigration lawyer to see what the odds are that Gump gets to stay in the country in what is a much more complicated situation than anyone realized. The guys also chat about whether or not it's possible to separate any of Michael Jackson's music from his deplorable actions or if we are deep in #MuteMike season, give their best wishes to Alex Trebec as he prepares for a battle with pancreatic cancer, debate the hypothetical sports teams that @ZitoThoughts set up for the office, discuss how much better Nickelodeon's programming was when shows like Double Dare and Legends of the Hidden Temple were on TV, and chat a little bit about the World's Strongest Man competition and who some of their favorite strongmen were to watch, plus a lot more. As is tradition, each of the guys picks a song for Friday Bangerz to help send you into the weekend in fabulous fashion. This one goes off the rails a little bit, but it's a great time. Come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and our Canadian brother @GumpSox10.</p>\n",
