  "description": "<p>In this 110th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we talk about Covid from different rooms, because one of us has Omicron. It’s fine, very minor really. And having had it will provide lasting immunity to the virus! We discuss vaccine mandates, this variant compared to the last, and how some people have viewed the mRNA vaccines as a raft in a shipwreck, while others of us have not. We read a tiny bit from Kary Mullis, discuss brisket and the power of onions, and honor David Bowie on his birthday.<br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is available from https://darvillsbookstore.indielite.org, (and everywhere books are sold), but they have sold out of signed copies.<br/><br/>Check out our store!
