  "title": "Yannic Kilchner - The Man and the Legend",
  "content": "<p>&nbsp;I recently stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew\">Yannic's Youtube Channel</a>&nbsp;and I was totally blown away. Yannic is a fresh PhD out of ETH Zurich and he has few dozens of recent deep learning papers explained amazingly well. Both the selection of papers is smart, as well as the explanation of the content. In addition for some of the papers he adds personal comments and critics about the papers claims which really make sense. The audience for those tutorials is advanced deep learning audience and they cover advanced topics which Coursera courses mostly did not catch up yet. For example great coverage of transformers for both language and image models.&nbsp;</p><p>According to his LinkedIn, Yannic recently started a company along with 3 other ETH PhDs called <a href=\"https://deepjudge.ai/\">DeepJudge</a>&nbsp;which deploys deep learning NLP models in the legal domain. The company is 4 months old and according to CrunchBase raised a small seed round.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the brains of the DeepJudge team, I call all the VCs, headhunters, university recruiters and everyone else to wake up! I am pretty sure we will here a lot of those guys.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>",
