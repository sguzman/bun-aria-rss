  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast we ask ourselves one question - Why?\nWhy do we do what we do every day? This conversation was inspired by a Ted Talk from Simon Sinek called Start with Why. We have been doing a lot of thinking around our purpose as creatives and trying to better understand our own personal reasons why we want to make videos for a living. In this episode, we record an open and honest conversation about our choice to work together and take on a challenging and time-intensive career path.\n\nI’m sure some of you have listened to Simon Sinek’s Ted Talk, but if you haven’t, definitely look it up on youtube - just type in Start with Why and it will come it - watch the 18 minute video, Colin and I liked it so much that we both ended up buying his book, Start with Why. \n \nLet us know what you think about the episode and about Simon Sinek's talk, tweet at us @colinandsamir",
