You need to spend the next 6-12 months actively acquiring new users. Then the answer is YES. It's totally fine to be making an ad once every 7 Instagram videos (remember, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook). But you need to make the stuff entertaining. Think like 1950's advertorial-style commercial starring you using the product. Like when they used to bring dogs onto Jonny Carson to eat Alpo dog food. All of that is clearly coming back into vogue. </span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Now here is what I would do if it were me: You need to basically google all of the news and media relating to your specific niche, and you need to reach out to every single person in the first 80 pages of results to let them know what you're doing and see if they can get you exposure. You need to absolutely be pounding all 879 influencers who matter in your niche to make sure they know who you are.
