  "description": "<p>You all remember the 1994 movie Speed, the huge hit with <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> and <strong>Sandra Bullock</strong>?  Ten years later, with the public clamoring for more Keanu and Sandra, they shot another movie but got completely upstaged by a co-star built of glass and steel.  The Lake House was a romantic fantasy film about a magic time-traveling mailbox for a particularly beautiful Modernist house.  Joining us today are the architect and structural engineer for that house, <strong>Nathan Crowley</strong> and  <strong>Fritz Hengge</strong>, as we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the birth and death of one of cinema's most amazing homes. <span class=\"auto-style5\">Ready to be swept off your feet? Get ready for celebrated jazz singer and Modernist homeowner, the poetic, soulful, unicorn-producing <strong>Heather Rigdon,</strong> singing from her album Young and Naive.</span></p>",
