  "description": "On today's episode, the guys discuss Todd going on Bob & Tom, Pat's time on Get Up, and what some of their weekend plans are. They also chat about some news stories including artificial intelligence taking over the London police department, a blind man suing Playboy because their website isn't accessible, the entire crew gets into a debate about what is and what isn't an assist in basketball, and find themselves having a lengthy discussion about The Rock. Todd wants the guys to essentially write a movie around a couple of actors, they answer some listener questions including who they'd all choose to be with if they were deserted on an island where the natives where cannibals, and as always, send you into the weekend with a couple of Friday Bangerz. It's a good time. Come and join us.\n\nThis episode features @PatMcAfeeShow, @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas.\n",
