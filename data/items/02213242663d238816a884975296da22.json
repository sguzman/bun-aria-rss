  "description": "<p>We have returned from a break - except was it really a break? We both seem to have been almost as busy and this realisation sparked a discussion about time management, priorities, and what we want from our art - including how important it is to make sales. Over the break, Alice has been developing new ideas in a supportive group while Louise has been considering how she wants to share her work. But we've also been reconsidering where we spend our time (we even allow ourselves a little moan). This isn't an episode with \"how to\" tips or a focused message - it's an honest conversation about the artist life, including throwing paintings on bonfires, managing \"to do\" lists, paring back our ideas, and finding time for ourselves. There is also a bonus discussion on finding the perfect coffee mug - you're welcome lol.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Courtyard Pottery Grassington <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/david.ashby.ceramics/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/david.ashby.ceramics/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Linda Bloomfield mugs <a href=\"https://lindabloomfield.co.uk/product-category/handmade-porcelain/mugs-cups/\">https://lindabloomfield.co.uk/product-category/handmade-porcelain/mugs-cups/</a></p>\n<p>John Hall obituary <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/rip-john-hall-perfect-mancunian-21348415\">https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/rip-john-hall-perfect-mancunian-21348415</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
