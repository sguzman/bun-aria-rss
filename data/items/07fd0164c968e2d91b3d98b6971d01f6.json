  "description": "VOX Podcast LIVE Questions from Facebook Live March 30th, 2017\n\n1. I am curious. What do you say to a parent whose son committed suicide and this has produced real sorrow and anxiety re whether their child will go to heaven or not.\n\n2. Does God speak to us? If so, how do we discern His voice?\n\n3. I have always heard masturbation is wrong because it causes a person to lust and so I was always scared to do it. I recently discovered the benefits of it and I literally do not think of sex at all. Why is it wrong to want to feel pleasure?\n\n4. I hear a lot about how Eve was the first sinner, yet the Bible states over and over that it was Adam. My belief is that because Adam was right there and watched his wife be deceived and did nothing, that his passiveness and lack of concern in protecting her from deception was the first sin. I think this shows us our responsibility in warning others when we see them being deceived. Thoughts?\n\nTune in  to Facebook LIVE on Thursday mornings around 1130AM and say hello or ask a question.
