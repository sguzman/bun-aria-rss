  "description": "<p>Being a storytelling comedian is a challenge, because you have to completely engulf the audience in your words and have them breathing in your every syllable. Being a great performer also helps. This week’s guest is all of the above. Aside from his hour special on Showtime (which is a hilarious special), you’ve seen him on Netflix’s <em>Disjointed, Fam </em>on CBS, and have heard him on <em>Bojack Horseman</em>. We have a all around discussion of the protests of the murder of George Floyd and the state of racism in the US, as well as a brighter look at what the future may hold for us all. Here are five words to describe this episode: be careful what you sign.</p>",
