  "description": "<p>Ohio University in Athens, Ohio has been open for over 200 years and today has over 28,000 students enrolled. This was the first institute of higher education to be chartered by an Act of Congress and was founded by American Revolutionary War veterans. The university is the home of the Bobcats and apparently, quite a few ghosts. A ghostly bobcat might be a more appropriate mascot. There are few buildings on the campus that don't have some kind of ghost story connected to them. Join us as we explore the history and haunts of Ohio University. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Breanne Sanford and features The Screaming Mummy Museum of Mexico and This Month in History features the event that inspired Les Miserables. Our location was suggested by Ashley Struz and Katie Meeks.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/05/hgb-ep-339-ohio-university.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>In the Gutter by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
