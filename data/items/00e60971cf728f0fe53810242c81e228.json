  "description": "<p>Born on December 18, 1948, in Burbank, California, Edmund Kemper, at age 15, killed both his grandparents to \"see what it felt like.\" He turned himself in and was sentenced to a state mental healthy facility where this killer with a genius level IQ manipulated psychiatrists into thinking he was cured. The 6'9\" 280lb murderer almost immediately began a gruesome murder and necrophilia spree.
