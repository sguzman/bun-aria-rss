  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Lt. General Micahel Flynn joins the show for the first time in nearly four years to discuss today's decision by the federal court of appeals to dismiss all charges against him. Flynn thanked this program and the Levinites for seeing through this set-up from day one and for the overwhelming support he received. Flynn was grateful that the rule of law prevailed but warned that the battle isn't over because Judge Sullivan still has to move forward with the circuit court's order. Then, in breaking news, Attorney Sidney Powell representing General Flynn calls in to explain that Judge Sullivan ordered a stay on his order instead of dismissing the case outright. This is a very odd and rare course of action for any federal judge to take. Despite Sullivan's reticence to honor the circuit court's order, there is still no conceivable way to put Flynn in prison. Later, newly released FBI notes indicate that Barack Obama himself ordered James Comey to investigate Flynn and to withhold information from President -Elect Trump. Later, the Democrats' militant arm of Marxist-anarchist militia men and women, known as ANTIFA have trained with domestic terrorists. Breitbart News reveals that BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors was personally mentored by radicals affiliated with Bill Ayers. The Weather Underground and others of these groups specialized in fire-bombing police stations and government buildings and were subsequently classified by the FBI as domestic terrorists. Afterward, the infamous leftist academcian Noam Chomsky inflammatorily calls President Trump the \"gangster in the White House\" and \"worst criminal in human history.\" \nLearn more about your ad choices.
