  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin! July 4th, 1776 didn't just happen it was carefully planned. A lot of blood was spilled to achieve independence from England. There were protests and then massacres over taxation. In the Spring of 1774, following the Boston Tea Party, laws were passed to pay for the housing of British soldiers and demand restitution for the lost tea. Next, the British planned to take the gun powder of the militiamen and this led to Paul Revere’s famous midnight run warning that \"The red coats are coming!\" which set off the Revolutionary War. Later, the Democrat party doesn't support Roe v. Wade, what they really favor is infanticide. Americans must push back. Dishonest ideologically driven people who've taken over the Democrat Party want to take over this country by insisting that they destroy our Constitution and whatever they disagree with. Then, high school football Coach Joseph Kennedy was vindicated by the Supreme Court after he was fired for saying a prayer during high school football games. The Supreme Court ruled that this was not a government establishment of religion and that Kennedy's first amendment rights were being violated by the school. Justice Sotomayor, like many others, misunderstood Jefferson's call for a separation between church and state; the phrase appears in a letter he wrote, not in the Constitution. Incidentally, Jefferson was not at the Constitutional convention he was in France, and this very concept of the \"separation between church and state’ was later advanced by a lawyer for the KKK. Finally, former Pentagon Chief of Staff, Kash Patel, calls in to explain that he witnessed Trump, in the presence of the Sec. of Defense, authorized up to 20,000 National Guardsman to the Capitol which was declined by the Mayor of Washington DC and the Capitol Police and reported in the recent timeline released by the DC Metropolitan Police. Patel reiterated that the Oval Office is a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and that Cassidy Hutchinson was not even authorized to attend such a meeting let alone have access to any intelligence coming from it. Patel has submitted his testimony to the committee although the committee was not interested in publicizing his transcripts. Happy 4TH of July!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
