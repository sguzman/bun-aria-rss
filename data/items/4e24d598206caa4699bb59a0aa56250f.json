  "content": "<p>As people grow in their role in organizations or projects, they take on more\nownership over larger issues.  Ownership comes with both authority and more\nresponsibility.  This can be scary, especially when we’re put into the\nspotlight.</p>\n\n<p>Effective ownership requires confidence to fail comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>Ownership is easy when things go well, but we’re truly tested when things go\npoorly and we need to identify and fix a problem that happened on our watch.\nThis post goes through common reactions to things-going-poorly that I’ve seen\nin practice, focusing on fail cases (1-6) and finishing with a success case (7).</p>\n\n<p>We <em>all</em> fail at ownership in our career (I’ve personally done all of the first\nsix fail cases). This is reasonable for anyone who stretches themselves and\ntries to grow.  It’s only once we reach stage 7 that we’re ready for even more\nownership over larger and more important work.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1--unaware-of-the-problem\">1.  Unaware of the problem</h3>\n\n<p><em>“What problem?  I’m doing the same thing as I’ve always done.”</em></p>\n\n<p>You’re not measuring things well enough to actually know that things have\nchanged that that a problem exists.\nYou’re doing what you’ve always done, and what you’ve always done has\nhistorically been good enough, so you don’t see how there could be a problem\ntoday.</p>\n\n<p>But the world around you changes, and you weren’t tracking the world.  It’s not\nyour fault that a problem occurred, but you do need to become aware of it and\ntake ownership of it before you can improve things.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2--silently-ignore-the-problem\">2.  Silently Ignore the problem</h3>\n\n<p><em>“Can we cancel our regular meeting this month?”</em></p>\n\n<p>You see the problem, feel bad about it, and so avoid speaking about it to\nanyone, especially your team and management.  That would be really\nuncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>You hope that it goes away and that things get back to the way they were.  You\nstop making regular reports to anyone and wait for things to get better.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3--deflect-attention-and-redefine-your-mandate\">3.  Deflect attention and redefine your mandate</h3>\n\n<p><em>“Teammates Alice and Bob made 10 widgets today!  I’m so proud of how hard they’re working!”</em></p>\n\n<p>You see the problem, and feel bad about it, and don’t want it to reflect badly\non you so you decide to change the game.  You shift your mandate from “fix\nproblems” to something else like “defend teams and territory”.  This is\nespecially common in folks familiar with fiefdom cultures at larger\norganizations.</p>\n\n<p>You trumpet success even though things are flat or declining.  You’re genuinely\nproud of your team so this feels honorable.  However you’re setting your team\nup for failure when someone actually takes a look at performance.\nIf you think that your primary mandate is to build a team rather than\naccomplish goals then you should verify that first with management.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4--blame-other-people\">4.  Blame other people</h3>\n\n<p><em>“This isn’t my fault, this is Bob’s fault”</em></p>\n\n<p>You publicly acknowledge that the problem exists, but you vigorously avoid it\nreflecting badly on you.  You find anyone else around, ideally someone not on\nyour team (but you sacrifice a teammate if necessary), and put the blame onto\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>This may work.  It may even be true.  However it misses the point that your job\nis to own and fix problems.  Blame doesn’t matter.  Your job as an owner is to\nown responsibility, not point it at others or even care whose fault it is.</p>\n\n<p>Problems aren’t bad and don’t reflect badly on you.  They’re inevitable.  The\nquestion is if you’re the kind of person that can handle them or not.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5--defer\">5.  Defer</h3>\n\n<p><em>“There is a problem, what should I do?”</em></p>\n\n<p>You’re happy to manage a team when things are good and the path is clear, but\nwhen things are bad you quickly defer to other people.  You’re not entirely\nconfident that you know how to solve the problem and so you do not try,\ninstead you put this on your manager to solve, saving you from looking foolish\nin front of your peers.</p>\n\n<p>This is certainly better than making lots of bad decisions, but its also a sign\nthat either you’re out of your depth, or aren’t willing to take chances and\nlook foolish.  In either case you probably shouldn’t be owning or managing at\nthis level.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"6--charge-ahead\">6.  Charge ahead</h3>\n\n<p><em>“We had a problem and so I changed everything”</em></p>\n\n<p>You’ve read the situations above and they just aren’t you.  You take charge and\nfix things.  You don’t want to bother with bureaucracy (you’re a do’er) and so\nyou just go ahead and fix the darn thing.  You’re the expert here and know best\nanyway.</p>\n\n<p>While it may be true that you’re the most well-informed on this topic, you may\nnot have the full picture.  It’s great that you weren’t daunted by the problem\nor afraid of failure, but by charging ahead you may have broken something else\nthat you weren’t aware of.  It would have been better to let people know and\nhave a chance to weigh in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"7--effective-ownership\">7.  Effective ownership</h3>\n\n<p><em>“We have a problem.  Here are some options for us to consider.  I think we\nshould choose option B, but there are tradeoffs.  I’d like to hear some other\nperspectives”</em></p>\n\n<p>You …</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>quickly become aware that the problem exists because you’ve set up active measurement</li>\n  <li>quickly inform your team and management of that problem</li>\n  <li>use your expertise to identify possible solutions to that problem</li>\n  <li>publicize those solutions, along with your (admittedly flawed) opinions about where the team should go</li>\n  <li>listen to feedback and engage in discourse</li>\n  <li>commit and execute after a group decision is made</li>\n  <li>report back on progress</li>\n  <li>check in in the future on how the fix is holding up</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You put yourself out there by acknowledging the problem, and either take on all\nthe blame yourself (“I should have seen this coming”) so that everyone around\nyou feels safe and can engage with their full brain.  You think about the\nproblem and use the expertise that you have to propose some ideas.  Those ideas\nmight be bad, but at least having some ideas out there will make other people\nmore comfortable speaking up.  You sacrifice your pride and esteem so that the\ngroup can move forward faster.</p>\n\n<p>Then, before charging ahead you ask for input because you acknowledge that\nyou’re not omniscient.  This doesn’t mean that you give up thought.  You engage\nin rigorous discourse on the subject with the group.  Eventually a decision is\nmade and you commit to leading a fix for the problem.</p>\n\n<p>When things go poorly with that fix (and they will) you speak up quickly to\nmake sure people are aware of updated timelines and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>After the fix is in place and you move on to other issues you still come back\nfrom time to time to check on that fix, even though it’s no longer your\nexplicit responsibility.  You feel a sense of ownership and responsibility over\nyour work.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3>\n\n<p>The people that I trust to own things typically have two main attributes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They lack ego, and have enough self-confidence that they take on blame without caring.</li>\n  <li>They’re organized and organizationally minded so that they can work with and communicate with others</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We <em>all</em> do this, just at different levels and in different situations.\nPersonally I think I’m pretty good at owning technical problems because I\nalready feel comfortable in that space.  My ego is secure and I can focus on\nsolving problems.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you ask me to own a dinner party I get really defensive and I defer as\nmuch as I can “Should we serve this dish or that one?  How about the wine?”\nThis is because I feel like an impostor.  That’s OK.  Everyone does this in\ndifferent spaces.  The solution is to start smaller and build up until I have\nmore confidence.  No one jumps directly to stage-7.  Everybody grows.</p>"
