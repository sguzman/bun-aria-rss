  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys are joined by AJ Hawk early to chat about Pat's crazy weekend in Pittsburgh for his brothers bachelor party, and how it was nice going back and catching up with people and places he hadn't seen in awhile, plus they chat about all the different NFL preseason games and how the rookie quarterbacks played including Justin Fields putting on a show, Jordan Love looking good in his first game time as a Green Bay Packer, Zach Wilson looking good in New York, Tim Tebow having a tough time blocking in Jacksonville, and all the other biggest takeaways from the first week of the NFL preseason (:30-27:35, 58:17-1:12:53). Later, the voice of College Football, going into his 26th year on College GameDay, and author of a new book, Kirk Herbstreit joins the program to chat about how the landscape of college football is changing, what he thinks is going to happen with all the conference realignment, how NIL is running wild and what he thinks is going to eventually happen with that, how deeply personal his new book is and how he shared a lot of things that he'd never talked about before, why he doesn't think we're going to a 12 team playoff anytime soon, and much much more (29:35-58:15).
