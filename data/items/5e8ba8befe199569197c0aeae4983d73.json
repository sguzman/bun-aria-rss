  "title": "92 - Knights Templar pt 1 of 2: License to Kill (Rise of the Pope's Army)",
  "description": "<p>The Knights Templar was founded in 1119 CE on the principles of chastity, obedience and poverty - but they soon, ironically became immensely wealthy and obedient to almost no one but themselves and the Pope. The Templars financed wars, built castles, ran cities, raised armies, and so much more. From meager beginnings they became as mighty an outfit as existed during the later Middle Ages. They were more powerful, wealthier, and better armed than some entire medieval kingdoms. Today, more than seven hundred years after their demise, the Templars remain an object of fascination. And we do our best to begin the telling of their legendary, awe-inspiring tale, today, on Timesuck! </p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by the <strong>Wild Card Podcast!</strong> Check it on iTunes or anywhere you listen to podcasts<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wild-card/id1392652002?mt=2\"><strong>https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/wild-card/id1392652002?mt=2</strong></a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you today by <strong>AmeriGas! </strong>Go to <a href=\"https://mytimesuckgrill.com/\"><strong>MyTimeSuckGrill.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>between now and July 4th<strong> </strong>and enter your name and email to register to win a free Weber Spirt II – E 210 grill ($400 value).</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you be <strong>Leesa! </strong>We love Leesa!<strong> Get $160 off when you go to </strong><a href=\"http://leesa.com/timesuck\"><strong>Leesa.com/timesuck</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
