  "title": "Google Ads Scripts migration office hours",
  "content": "The new experience for Google Ads scripts has been available for a while, so hopefully you've had a chance to try it out and enjoy all the benefits it has to offer. There are a few differences from the old scripts API, which we've documented in our <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-ads/scripts/docs/migration\">migration guide</a>.<br /><br /> If you've given those a go, reached out on our forum or to our support alias for assistance, and are still having any difficulties understanding the changes or having problems migrating a particular script, we are launching a limited series of office hours sessions on a first come, first serve basis.<br /><br /> If you're interested, check out more information on our <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-ads/scripts/docs/workshops/office-hours\">office hours information page</a>.<br /><br /> <a href=\"https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2022/03/new-google-ads-scripts-experience.html\">As a reminder</a>, we will begin migrating scripts automatically to the new experience starting in  September of this year, and will be migrating all scripts to use the new scripts experience in October.<br /><br /> If you have any questions or feedback regarding the new experience, please leave a post on our <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adwords-scripts\">forum</a> or send a message to our support alias <a href=\"mailto:googleadsscripts-support@google.com\">googleadsscripts-support@google.com</a> so that we can help.<br /> <span class=\"byline-author\"> - Mike Cloonan, Google Ads Scripts Team</span>",
