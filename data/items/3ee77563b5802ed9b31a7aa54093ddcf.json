  "description": "<p>The Penitentiary of New Mexico has the dubious distinction of being the site of the worst prison riot in American history. Prisons are already notorious for being havens for paranormal experiences, but what ensued during that riot, left behind a residue just begging to feed negative spiritual energy. There are those who claim the land here is cursed. Join me as I explore the history and hauntings of the Penitentiary of New Mexico! The Moment in Oddity features The Earling Possession and This Month in History features St. Columba's account of the Loch Ness Monster.</p> <p>This episode brought to you by the Executive Producers and Care Of.
