  "description": "Hey HBs! It's part 2 of Flirting with Forever! Mary and John and have a lot of misunderstandings, but BOY are they going to figure things out and rub up on each other. Sometimes they rub up on each other before things are technically figured out! Cara Bastone delivers a second half complete with silly (sexy) dancing, public clownfishing, and a sex scene that made Erin and I lose our minds. It's a must read AND listen! \n Bonus Content: Rooster hangs out with Treestump Todd, Erin is ruined by this hero, Mel's stance on morning breath, lots of flailing over how good this book is, Mel thinks something pretty mundane is a varsity move, and so much more! \n If you sign up for or increase your pledge to our patreon by June 10th, 2021, we will double it and donate to AAPI Women Lead! \n Lady Loves:\n Melody: Walking dinner! Cook you up some finger foods and eat on the go to soak up the nice weather. Ants can't catch you if you walk!\n Erin: If that doesn't sound appealing, try recliner/electric blanket dinner. Watch out for danger coziness, though. \n Episode Sponsor: \n https://books2read.com/houseofhearts (House of Hearts) by Jaimee Bell!
