  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi's January 6 committee failed miserably. It found not a shred of evidence tying Donald Trump to any kind of \"insurrection\" or violent attack on the Capitol Building, despite all the emails, texts, witnesses, and, most of all, the complete control of the entire apparatus and narrative without any opposition. The show-trial hearings proved nothing. Then, Muslim parents continue to be enraged by the hyper-sexualization of school children. America's children are on the ballot and the pornography industry is taking over their classrooms. Later, critics are calling for the Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire to fire Candace Owens because of her friendship with Kanye West in response to his grotesque comments about Jews. Conservatives must be secure in their views and don't need to hitch themselves to figures in popular culture. Afterward, Congressional candidate Yesli Vega joins the show to discuss why Rep. Abigail Spanberger must be defeated for her tax and spend policies and support for radical gender teaching in public schools and laws that allow the prosecution of parents who disagree with a school's woke agenda. Finally, US Senate candidate from Alaska, Kelly Tshibaka, calls in with an update on her race against Sen. Lisa Murkowski who is oftentimes the deciding vote for the Democrats even though she claims to be a Republican. Tshibaka says that shared American values are on the ballot and Alaskans must rally against Sen. Mitch McConnell's choice in this election. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
