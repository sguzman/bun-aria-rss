  "description": "Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office this weekend discussing whether to send in US troops to declare martial law and nullify a legitimate election. The idea was rebuffed. Perhaps it's the last we'll hear of it. But looking back at the past four years it is clear that we had a president with strongman aspirations and they were far more successful than many imagined possible in the US. How do we respond to that so our system does not face another near death experience like we've just been through? We discuss with Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of \"Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,\" Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law Center and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Tune in for this thought provoking discussion.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
