  "description": "In this episode of The Relentless, we look at how the people we surround ourselves with can help us move fearlessly on the road to success. Host Kristen Meinzer is joined by two inspiring guests who know that turning visions into reality means pushing past fear and, to do that, you need a solid support system.\n\nFirst, she talks to Aida Rodriguez, a comedian, writer, and actor, whose career took off when she stopped listening to critics and started aligning with people who resonated with her authenticity. Aida is unafraid to be vulnerable in her comedy, often talking about her own life story from surviving two kidnappings to experiencing homelessness. With an HBO stand-up special under her belt and another HBO comedy series in the works, Aida’s comedic talent is undeniable, but the real key to her success lies in the trusting relationships she’s built with people who help her stay fearless.\n\nLater in the episode, we hear from Dan Kruse. As President of the number one CENTURY 21 affiliate in the world, Dan takes an immense amount of pride in the support network he’s built for his agents and brokers. If he’s succeeding, so are they. \n\n\nGuests\nAida Rodriguez: Comedian, Writer, and Actor\nDan Kruse: President, CEO, and Owner of CENTURY 21 Affiliated in Madison, Wisconsin\nLearn more about your ad choices.
