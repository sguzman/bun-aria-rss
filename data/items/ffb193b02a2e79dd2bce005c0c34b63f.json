Likewise, it might be easy to assume that the only way to do so is through sophisticated AI algorithms and data science.<br /><br />Incredibly, Jane McGonigal and her colleagues at Institute for the Future have been able to predict several of today’s most disruptive trends as much as ten years in advance.<br /><br />Through her innovative use of alternate reality games, hyper-specific journaling techniques, and something called “future backcasting”, Jane continues to not only lay out seemingly impossible future scenarios, but also help prepare people to be proactive in building the future they want to see.<br /><br />If you like what you see in today’s episode, then I highly encourage you to check out Jane’s latest book, Imaginable: How to See the Future Coming and Feel Ready for Anything―Even Things That Seem Impossible Today<br /><br />Order your copy by clicking here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JwImO2\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3JwImO2</a> <br /><br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br />00:00 | Introduction<br />01:40 | A New Approach to Futurism<br />13:23 | The Psychology of Predicting the Future<br />22:50 | Rehearsing Catastrophes<br />32:56 | How to Practice for the Future<br />38:18 | Crypto, Government, and Privacy<br />48:31 | Future Backcasting<br />53:54 | The Future of Web3 Gaming<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br />“The brain normally assumes things will continue as they are. But what that means is it can be very hard to wake up and realize this thing that used to be true is no longer true, or this assumption I had is no longer helpful.” [09:54]<br /><br />“We do try to have this balance of positive and shadow imagination, because really, any future is going to have complications, but also perhaps unexpected benefits where people use it as an opportunity to create positive change.” [15:31]<br /><br />“To start your process of having to adapt or deal with a crisis or disruption from a state of confidence and clarity, rather than anxiety, confusion, feeling helpless - it really changes the way that you emotionally experience things that can create a lot of suffering.” [26:53]<br /><br />“Try to backcast all the way to as far as what could you do in the next 24 hours to make this future more likely. Just force yourself to roll up your sleeves and do something to start trying to have an impact on this future.” [51:51]<br /><br /><br />Follow Jane McGonigal:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://janemcgonigal.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://janemcgonigal.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avantgame\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/avantgame</a> <br />LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3jpyRpj\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly/3jpyRpj</a> <br />Urgent Optimists: <a href=\"https://urgentoptimists.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://urgentoptimists.org/</a> <br />Order your copy of Imaginable: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JwImO2\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3JwImO2</a>",
