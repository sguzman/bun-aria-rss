  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the CDC numbers online indicate that in the week of July 4th there were very few deaths nationwide. While some may find this celebratory, the leftists in the media want to focus on infections instead of a significantly decreased mortality rate. Yet, in a look back at 2009 during the Barack Obama presidency, the media forgot that Obama and Biden called for states to end testing and stop counting individual cases during the H1N1 pandemic; citing the resources it would take to accomplish such widespread testing — a goal that President Trump is making more headway on than did his predecessor. Then, the domestic terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera, leader of the FALN group that bombed police buildings and killed people, was given a Presidential Pardon by both Presidents Clinton and Obama. Yet, Trump is being scrutinized and criticized for his commutation of Roger Stone, who didn't kill anyone. Finally, Rick Harrison calls in to discuss Obama's use of Hydroxychloroquine in 2008.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
