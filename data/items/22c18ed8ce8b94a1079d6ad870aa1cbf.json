  "description": "<p>The. Study. Of. Laughter. It exists, and it's called gelotology. In one of the oddly more somber episodes, Alie sits down with Dr. Lee Berk, a doctor who is \"serious about laughter\" and has dedicated decades to hunting down how humor affects the body. Learn about what makes a joke a joke, the science behind happiness, why you laugh when you're nervous, if comedians are naturally depressed or if that's a myth, and why some people get paid to tickle rats. Gelotology is an actual science and as Alie learns, it really is no laughing matter.</p><p>Dr. Lee Berk’s <a href=\"https://www.dr-lee-berk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/gelotology\" target=\"_blank\">More episode sources and links</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Support Ologies on Patreon</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Editing by Steven Ray Morris</p><p>Music by Nick Thorburn</p>\n",
