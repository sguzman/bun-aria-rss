  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing a tweet that Dr. Drew saw accusing him of being 'Fox News-centric' leading to a larger conversation about groups and paranoid assumptions. Adam also recalls his experience appearing on 'The Doctors' and how a civil disagreement is still a very real thing that can occur without larger conflict. Drew also recounts a recent experience he had at a party that led to a life long decision regarding cannabis. They also review the game film on a recent interaction between President Biden and a reporter asking about student loan relief and discuss the general problem with politicians of an advanced age. They also speak to a caller who is looking for advice to support a friend with an addiction issue. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nBlindsGalore.com tell them we sent you\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast",
