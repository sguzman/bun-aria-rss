  "description": "We’re so excited to have Jesse Carrier and Mara Miller with us today. They are the great Carrier and Company and have the whole meal deal. If you’re an interior designer, you want to be them. They have collections through Loloi rugs, Century Furniture, Visual Comfort, Lee Jofa, and Soicher Marin. They’re also named on Architectural Digest AD100, Elle Decor’s A list, Deluxe Gold list, and they’ve been published in Vogue, Town and Country, Elle Decor, House Beautiful, Oprah, World of Interiors, and many others. These two are married, live in Upstate New York and share 2 children. <br /><br />Working together and their roles in the company 2:24<br />Their love story 8:21<br />Where they find their inspiration 17:25<br />What they find most fulfilling 22:53<br />The most challenging and most rewarding part of their job 26:50<br />Favorite thing to collect 32:56<br />Defining luxury 36:18<br /><br />“Because life is getting so busy, I really enjoy the fact that we really do a deep dive with our clients and I kind of live vicariously through them, like figuring out what the fantasy is for their home and their property, and when we’re lucky enough to do projects that are vacation homes where I think there’s always an added element of kind of romance or fantasy. It’s I think what keeps it really fun.” 19:03<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.carrierandcompany.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.carrierandcompany.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
