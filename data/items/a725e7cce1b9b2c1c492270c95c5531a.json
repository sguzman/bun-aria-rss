  "description": "<div>This week, the gals get paranoid exploring the many ways strangers can watch you, even in the privacy of your own home (or Porta Potty). Topics include the perks of porn, lawyering loopholes for perverts, and one real shithead poopy offender. Twist open a box of Naked Grape Merlot, close the blinds, and enjoy some twisted tales of Peeping Toms.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
