  "description": "<p>How do you make the placebo effect work for you?</p> <p>We talk a lot about the power of mindset. Before you can achieve any goal, you have to believe it’s possible and change your inner self-talk to support that belief. There’s powerful science that shows that the way you choose to see the world can physically affect your mind and your body, but you can even change your business, your brand, and beyond.</p> <p>I’m excited to have this conversation today with our guest Erik Vance. Erik is a science journalist and an editor with The New York Times Well desk. He’s also the author of the book, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3EKAmdz\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://amzn.to/3EKAmdz\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\">Suggestible You: The Curious Science of Your Brain’s Ability to Deceive, Transform, and Heal</a></em>.</p> <p>Research into the power of suggestibility shows that your brain relies on analyzing the past to make predictions about the future.
