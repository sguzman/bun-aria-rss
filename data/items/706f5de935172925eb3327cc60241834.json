  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Congressman Jerrold Nadler has questionable ties to a Russian propagandist through his campaign consultant, according to the Daily Beast. This was supported by U.S intelligence agencies affirming that independent Russian-owned broadcasters were integral parts of the Kremlin’s American disinformation campaign in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Therefore, Nadler should recuse himself from Congressional investigations into Russian collusion. Rep. Adam Schiff is a leaker and a liar and should also be investigated, yet no one questions them. Of course, the media has turned a blind eye to this. Then, Judge T.S. Ellis sentenced Paul Manafort to 47 months and the Democrats are up in arms that the sentence was too short, despite the fact that even the Judge said there was no evidence of campaign collusion with Russia. Also, the House has voted today to defend illegal aliens voting in local and state elections. This creates an issue of giving official government ID to illegal aliens so that they may vote. Later, President FDR turned a recession into a depression nearly destroying capitalism in America. Despite FDR's suppression of the media, the press loved him, JFK, and LBJ as well for their progressiveness. Afterwards, Ilhan Omar criticizes President Obama, but skates from getting criticized by the Democrats.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
