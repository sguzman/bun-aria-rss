    "media:description": "I originally took this photo illustrating stereographic projection in 2014. \nSoon after, someone attached a click-bait caption to the image, and it has been bouncing around the internet ever since. Here, I explain what the image is really about.\n\nYou can buy these stereographic projection spheres from https://www.shapeways.com/shops/henryseg?section=Stereographic+Projection, or download and print yourself from https://www.printables.com/social/246633-henryseg/collections/309464\n\nI used a Mini Maglite AAA LED Flashlight (in \"candle mode\") for this video. Cellphone flashlights also work well.",
