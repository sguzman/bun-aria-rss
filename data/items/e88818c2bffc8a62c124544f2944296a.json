Kurt Suzuki is now banished from polite society because he wore a hat. We read every FCC complaint about Minihane's old show on WEEI. The dickhead Des Moines Register reporter who tried to ruin Carson King's life is on his comeback tour and the blue-checkmarks are loving it. Martin Scorsese is defending his criticism of Marvel movies. Robinson, who famously ruined MHB by uncovering his old poetry, turns out to himself be a poet. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
