  "description": "David Cicilline is one half of Rhode Island’s two-member delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives, and while he may have been sent to D.C. by a small state, his contributions to the impeachments of Donald J. Trump were huge. Cicilline discusses his new book, House On Fire: Fighting for Democracy in the Age of Political Arson, and about growing up as the son of a criminal defense attorney who occasionally represented the mob, (and did so very well), and how his father’s work shaped his sense of justice. Also, why we don’t eat dogs, but we do eat pigs. And a guest Spiel from Dan Savage, host of the Savage Lovecast, about the word “women.”\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
