But just as God used Jesus to raise Lazarus from the grave, He is counting on us to run after the hurting and go after the broken.It’s easy to judge others, but beneath the dirt, the mess and the bad decisions, there is a son or a daughter of the Most High God. God is counting on us to represent His love and redemption to those in need. They may be bound on the outside, but like Lazarus, on the inside they’re a person of destiny. They just need someone to help remove the grave clothes. Will you be that person? Take time to make a difference in the lives of those who desperately need it.
