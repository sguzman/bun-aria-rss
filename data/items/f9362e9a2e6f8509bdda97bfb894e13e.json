  "description": "<p>I will be speaking to Skip who is from Texas. He shares with us his encounter he had almost 28 years ago. He was at the river with his friend and they decided to pack up and head home. Skip was carrying items back to his car and as he walked up the hill away from the river he says “This big black thing that was covered in hair bursts out of the brush and I watch it run upright…like a man but WAY too fast to be a man. In one leap the creature jumps about 12 feet across the river. My friend walks up because she saw it too and say who…..what….was that?!” Skip is a pastor in Texas and this encounter has always stuck with him.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Jack McCarty who is the author of “<a href= \"http://www.amazon.com/Bigfoot-Evidence-I-Cannot-Deny-ebook/dp/B00JVZES9O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440863540&sr=8-1&keywords=JACK+MCCARTY+BIGFOOT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bigfoot Evidence – I Cannot Deny It</a>.” Jack writes “Twenty-three years ago I saw my first Bigfoot footprint in the woods. Ever since then I have studied additional evidence and documented it with photographs and journals. This book is a compilation of my experiences in the forests where Bigfoot lives.”</p>",
