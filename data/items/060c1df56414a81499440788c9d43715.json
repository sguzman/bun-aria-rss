  "description": "A look at early ADP has some head-scratching stuff! We'll tell you our favorite values after we look at a few somewhat surprising ADPs (3:25) like Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs as RB5 and RB6, respectively. Plus you might be surprised by who the second WR off the board is and where Rob Gronkowski is being drafted. Also, we have a very interesting FAAB question to debate (15:00) ... A look at our favorite QB average draft positions (18:50), don't sleep on Jared Goff. Dave makes a case for Dak Prescott and Jamey likes a sophomore QB late. On to RBs (30:00), a number of the rookies look like good values right now ... WR values (42:00): D.J. Moore is ridiculously undervalued! Who else looks like a steal right now? Any of the Giants WRs? And we finish with our favorite TE values (53:00) ...
