  "description": "<p>“NEVER LET ANYBODY GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR DREAMS. NOT EVEN YOURSELF.”<br />\nSo many times in this world we let others dictate our lives. We listen to our parents, our friends, even our neighbors on what we “should do” with our lives.<br />\nNo one knows our true purpose -- that’s something we have to find on our own.<br />\nOur passions and our love should be what guides us in life, not just logic.<br />\nLife’s too short to spend precious moments chasing something we don’t care about, something that doesn’t make us feel fulfilled.<br />\nSure, you could be a doctor or a lawyer and make money fast: but what good is the cash if you’re miserable?<br />\nWhen you follow your passion and master those skills, the money will follow, and it’ll be worth the delay.<br />\nThat’s why for today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I brought on a truly inspirational woman: Michelle Waterson.<br />\nMichelle is a wife, a mother, and an amazing UFC fighter. She had a passion for martial arts even as a child but pushed her passion aside to listen to what her parents wanted.<br />\nShe went to college and studied things she didn’t really care about.<br />\nOne day she was hired to work as a ring girl at a UFC fight and watching the action up close made her decide she wanted to continue her childhood passion.<br />\nAs soon as the semester was over, she left school and started training to be a fighter - but there was only one problem.<br />\nAt that time there were no UFC women. In fact, the UFC was very clear they were never planning to let women into the UFC.<br />\nShe didn’t let that stop her. She continued to train and take small fights any chance should could.<br />\nFinally, all the hard work paid off. The UFC started letting in women fighters, and she’s had an incredible career that didn’t exist not too long ago.<br />\nIf you’re wondering if you should actually pursue your passion, no matter how unconventional it may be, you need to hear Episode 655.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat has being a fighter taught you about femininity and masculinity? (7:36)<br />\nYou were a ring girl and then thought it would be fun to be in the ring punching people? (11:27)<br />\nWhat’s a smoker? (14:11)<br />\nIf there were no women in the UFC at the time, what was your vision? (16:02)<br />\nWhat does it take to be a champion in the UFC? (19:44)<br />\nWhat’s the challenging part for you mentally and physically from the moment you get the phone call to the moment you step in the ring? (22:36)<br />\nWhat has your biggest loss taught you about yourself? (26:44)<br />\nWhat was the most challenging emotional wave you had to experience leading into a fight?
