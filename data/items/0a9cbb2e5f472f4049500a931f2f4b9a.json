  "description": "We have all experienced shame before: the feeling that we are not enough, or that we do not live up to certain standards or ideals. But what happens when this shame spirals out of control? What happens when it overtakes our life, and affects the way we think and behave?\nIn this week’s podcast I speak with Megan Bruneau, a psychologist and registered counselor who specializes in crisis support, compassion-based therapy and executive coaching, about the problem of shame, learning how to love yourself despite your imperfections, how to help someone with an eating disorder, the danger of medicalizing normal human emotions and why positive affirmations often fail. \nMegan has been featured on national television programs like Good Morning America and The T.D. Jakes Show) and is a regular contributor to Huffington Post, MindBodyGreen and Forbes. Using both her personal and professional experience, her goal is to teach people to face and learn to live with their imperfections and be kinder to themselves. As Megan says, we are all a journey, and we are all worthy of being loved, and there is room for both joy and sorrow in life. You don’t have to wait till you feel happy or look a certain way or have a particular life or succeed at something to feel like you belong and that you matter, because you are worthy, right here, right now. \nMegan’s website: https://meganbruneau.com\n\nFollow Megan on social media:\n \nhttps://www.instagram.com/meganjbruneau/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/meganbruneauma\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5EC_tOiVRKk3ftpqTdviuw\n \n\nPodcast Time Highlights:\n3:00 Megan’s background and her personal battle with perfectionism and shame\n5:30 Why positive affirmations don’t work\n10:18 Why the happiness industry is dangerous\n12:43 Why we need to deal with difficult emotions\n20:00 What are some of the major issues we face today?\n25:00 How to heal eating disorders\n54:45 The importance of self-compassion and purpose \n\n\n \nFor additional resources to help you on your mental health healing journey:\nGet my new 21 day brain detox program here: https://theswitch.app \nRegister now for my 2020 Mental Health Summit Dec 3-5 in Dallas, TX!
