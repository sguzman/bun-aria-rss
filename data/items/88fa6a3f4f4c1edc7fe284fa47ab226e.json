  "description": "The Akamai Foundation was set up in 2018 to improve the impact and focus of our long-term philanthropic activities. Importantly, we wanted to support the next generation of technology innovators; promoting the pursuit of excellence in STEM education amongst school children. Our work had an incredible impact in 2020 and I'm thrilled to announce the release of the Foundation's first Annual Report.",
