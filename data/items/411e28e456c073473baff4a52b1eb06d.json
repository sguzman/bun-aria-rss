  "description": "Bandcamp Recommender (BCRecommender) is a web application that serves music recommendations from Bandcamp. I recently switched BCRecommender&rsquo;s data store from MongoDB to Elasticsearch. This has made it possible to offer a richer search experience to users at a similar cost. This post describes the migration process and discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Elasticsearch instead of MongoDB.\nMotivation: Why swap MongoDB for Elasticsearch? I&rsquo;ve written a few posts in the past on BCRecommender&rsquo;s design and implementation."
