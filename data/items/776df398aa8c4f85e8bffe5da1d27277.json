In our first Friday show of the new year, our hosts take a look at the anticipated response to a new rule that says private insurers will have to cover the cost of at-home rapid COVID-19 tests. With insurers not quite ready to implement the changes, we take a look at what you can do to get those costs covered when the rule goes into effect this weekend. Then, we&#8217;ll discuss the impact of a major settlement against the NFL. And as always, we&#8217;ll end the show with a another round of our favorite game, Half-Full/Half-Empty!</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything we talked about on the show today:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/upshot/free-rapid-covid-tests.html\">&#8220;Insurers Say Saturday Is Too Soon to Meet White House Goals on Rapid Tests&#8221;</a> from The New York Times</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/14/dc-vaccine-mandate-bars-clubs/?itid=sf_local\">DC mandate will require proof of vaccination at bars, venues, Capital One Arena</a> from The Washington Post</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dc-vaccine-mandate-republicans-2022-1\">GOP lawmakers pressure DC to ditch indoor vaccine mandate despite Omicron wave</a>&#8221; from Business Insider</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/we-just-slew-the-dragon-lawyers-analyze-st-louis-nfl-settlement/article_3d99a0d5-ddee-5357-8c75-05492bc293fc.html#tracking-source=home-top-story\">&#8216;We just slew the dragon&#8217;: Lawyers analyze St. Louis&#8217; NFL settlement</a>&#8221; from St. Louis Today</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/11/irs-tax-refund-questions/\">How long will it take to get my tax refund?</a>&#8221; from The Washington Post</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/theres-a-lot-of-money-in-health-tech-but-what-about-femtech/\">CES awards honor &#8220;femtech&#8221; solutions in women&#8217;s health</a>&#8221; from Marketplace</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/01/07/are-there-marketing-opportunities-in-inflation/\">Can inflation be a marketing opportunity?</a>&#8221; from Marketplace</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/fan-sues-giants-jets-for-6-billion-demanding-both-teams-leave-new-jersey-and-play-home-games-in-new-york/\">Fan sues Giants, Jets for $6 billion demanding both teams leave New Jersey and play home games in New York</a>&#8221; from CBS Sports</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/01/10/what-might-canadas-vaccine-border-mandate-mean-for-the-economy/\">Canadian border vaccine mandate might worsen trucker shortage</a>&#8221; from Marketplace</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://defector.com/we-have-come-full-circle-on-novak-djokovics-visa/\">We Have Come Full Circle On Novak Djokovic&#8217;s Visa</a>&#8221; from Defector</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n",
