  "title": "Ep. 878 - The Left Attacks Dr. Phil For Allowing Me To Speak",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is now going after Dr. Phil for allowing me onto his show in the first place. But if they are confident in their position, and if they really believe in their own gender ideology, why should they be so afraid of having the debate? Also, the March For Life takes DC by storm and the Biden Administration has to trot out Tom Hanks to convince the public that his first year in office wasn’t a complete disaster. Plus, an old clip of an MSNBC host saying that your kids don’t belong to you goes viral again. What might we learn from it? And M&Ms are getting a more progressive and inclusive rebranding for the year 2022. With this final piece in place, Utopia awaits. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
