  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, it’s Super Tuesday and we have a Marxist, an oligarch, a moron, and a fake Indian vying for the Democrat nomination and not a single one of them is a person of color or a member of the LGBTQ community. These four stooges are all straight white people. The appearance of moderates in this race is a misnomer; it’s the center that keeps shifting left. Elizabeth Warren is hurting Bernie Sanders because she is splitting the progressive vote and if Bernie has a bad night, it'll be her fault. ​Later, it is the Democrats that trash America, focusing on racism and inequality as an excuse to turn the country inside out as they eviscerate the Constitution. Meanwhile, it is President Trump who embraces the flag, supports the constitution and stands up for all people. Then, a horrific tornado has killed at least 22 people in Tennessee meanwhile the Coronavirus has killed nine people nationwide. Both of these situations are serious and should be considered in context.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
