  "description": "<p>A listener contacted the show and said he never believed in these creatures until he came face to face with one in the Florida swamp. After the creature \"Screamed and Roared\" at him he became terrified and shot it twice in the chest and ran for his life. The listener said he wasn't sure what kind of a creature he was looking at but the beast was massive and appeared to be half ape and half man like. We will also be having a few other guest including a Native American who will be sharing his Sasquatch encounters with us.</p>",
