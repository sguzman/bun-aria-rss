  "description": "<p>We had planned to take break this week, but we just couldn't do it! So, here we are with a bonus episode all about preparing for a new year. This year, we are taking very different approaches - Alice is relaxing into letting things happen in an easy way, while Louise has spent some time defining clear goals and then breaking them down into scheduled tasks. This is a reversal of roles from prior years and so in this episode, we dive into what is driving both of us. Why has super-organised Alice not yet started to develop a plan? Why has laissez-faire Louise suddenly &nbsp;decided to create highly structured plans? It turns out that we have both made these changes to address what didn't work for us in prior years and to suit our individual preferences. And this is so important ... there are many different ways of approaching new year's planning and there is no right or wrong. What most matters is to find a way of working that is right for you.</p>\n<p>We also share what has excited and inspired us ... for Alice it was watching Brian Rutenberg's YouTube videos (specifically Studio Visit 48) and for Louise, it was realising how important social media has been in finding her target audience.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Find out about Alice's Connected Artist Club and join the interest list here: <a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artists/\">https://alicesheridan.com/artists/</a></p>\n<p>Brian Rutenberg: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp3017D6Tkc\"><u><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp3017D6Tkc</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>The book recommendations episode: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e6chml\">https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e6chml</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
