  "description": "In her new book The Faculty Lounges: And Other Reasons Why You Won’t Get The College Education You Pay For  (Ivan R. Dee, 2011), Naomi Schaefer Riley, former Wall Street Journal editor and affiliate scholar at the Institute for American Values, critically examines the tenure system. She believes “tenure . . .  is eroding American education from the inside out” and places too much emphasis on research and not enough on teaching. In our interview, we talked about why tenure does not help students get a better education, why faculty donations went 8:1 in favor of Barack Obama in the 2008 election, and how much the government spends to subsidize academic articles. Read all about it, and more, in Riley’s provocative new book.\n\nPlease become a fan of “New Books in Public Policy” on Facebook, if you haven’t already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
