  "description": "You're probably at least a little familiar with the WNBA, and even if you never actually seen <em>A League of Their Own</em>, everyone knows there's no crying in baseball. But did you know there was a whole professional women's football league in the 1960's? NPR's A Martinez spoke with Britni de la Cretaz about their book <em>Hail Mary: The Rise and Fall of the National Women's Football League</em>, which they co-authored with fellow sports writer Lyndsey D'Arcangelo. And, disappointingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, de la Cretaz says it was homophobia and sexism that undermined the league's success. ",
