  "description": "<p>Why Small Stressors Can Actually Be Good For Us | This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://uqora.com/doctor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uqora</a></p><br><p>We know that chronic, long-term stress can wreak havoc on our health. However, short-term and/or mild stressors can have the exact opposite effect. For instance, when you practice resistance training by lifting heavy weights and inflicting damage on your muscles, your body responds by repairing the damaged fibers, thus creating bigger and stronger muscles. This is called hormesis, a phenomenon that demonstrates the beneficial effects of low-level stressors. A similar process called xenohormesis also occurs in plants, making them stronger and richer in phytochemicals that are good for us. Dr. Hyman recently spoke about these topics in his conversations with Ben Greenfield and Dr. Frank Lipman.</p><br><p>Ben Greenfield is a human performance consultant, speaker, and New York Times bestselling author of 13 books, including the wildly popular titles, Beyond Training and Boundless. A former collegiate tennis, water polo, and volleyball player, as well as a bodybuilder, 13-time Ironman triathlete, and professional obstacle course racer, Ben has been voted by the NSCA as America’s top Personal Trainer and by Greatist as one of the top 100 Most Influential People In Health and Fitness. Ben hosts the highly popular fitness, nutrition, and wellness website bengreenfieldfitness.com, a site with over a million monthly visitors, featuring articles, podcasts, and product reviews. His latest book, Boundless, is all about creating more energy to live the life of optimal health and happiness you deserve.</p><br><p>Dr. Frank Lipman is recognized as a vocal pioneer of integrative and Functional Medicine (or what he calls “good medicine”). Dr. Lipman is the founder of Eleven Eleven Wellness Center and the Chief Medical Officer at The Well. He is a sought-after international speaker and the best-selling author of six books—How to Be Well, The New Health Rules, Young & Slim for Life, Revive and Total Renewal—and his newest book, The New Rules of Aging Well: A Simple Program for Immune Resilience, Strength, and Vitality.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Uqora.
