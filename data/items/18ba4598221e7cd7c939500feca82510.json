  "title": "Slowing and reversing ageing with Dr David Sinclair, Phd",
  "description": "In Episode 98 I sit down with Harvard Professor Dr David Sinclair, PHD to discuss the information theory of ageing and in particular how we can slow down and perhaps even reverse the ageing process.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\n\nDavid's back story and how he found himself in the field of anti-ageing science\n\nHis information theory of ageing\n\nChronological age versus biological\n\nThe Horvath clock.\n\nThe role of genetics versus epigenetic in the ageing process\n\nHow long he thinks we can may be able to live to\n\nHow our nutrition affects the ageing process\n\nHormesis and ageing - including periods of hunger or 'intermittent fasting'.\n\nOther lifestyle factors that affect the ageing process\n\nNAD\n\nNMN supplements and other medications/supplements that may slow down the ageing process\n\nand much more\n\n\nThis is a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms occurring at a cellular level that take place as we age. An exchange that I thoroughly enjoyed and hope you do too. Of course, in two hours it's hard to cover the topic of ageing in entirety so I look forward to having David back on to dive even deeper in the future. You can also grab a copy of his book Lifespan online or in most book stores - it's a fascinating read.\n\nPlease also note, as mentioned in the introduction this was recorded days before NYC went into social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. So if you see videos of us online from this episode, they were shot well and truly before there was any advice to practice social distancing.\n\nHope you enjoy friends. As always be sure to let David know how this one lands for you on Instagram or Twitter.\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
