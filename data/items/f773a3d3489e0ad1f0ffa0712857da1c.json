Perhaps this year inflation will rise faster, so in real terms prices may dip, but in the long run, he reckons, the direction will always be north. Prof Steve Keen on the other hand, maintains that, at some point, things will rapidly head south. Why?

And they get locked into a feedback loop, where valuations are based on previous valuations. Your house is worth more because all the other houses around you are worth more. This, recons Steve, will come unstuck, possibly in a big way. He says we don’t accept it because it’s not happened in recent history. Just as we didn’t expect a pandemic because we hadn’t seen one like it for 100 years.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
