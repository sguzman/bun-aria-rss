  "description": "<p>This month, events in Minneapolis captured the world’s attention. The recent death of Daunte Wright and the conviction of Derek Chauvin sound a significant shift in the civil rights movement and the country at large.</p><p>Today, artist, activist, and politician&nbsp;<strong>Jeremiah Ellison</strong>&nbsp;is here to help us make sense of this historic moment.</p><p>As some of you may know, I spent the week of April 13th, 2021 (pre-Chauvin verdict) in a very tense Minneapolis. Motivating my visit was an intention to better understand the events and circumstances that brought the world’s focus upon this city—not from what I read online or saw streaming endlessly on cable news—but rather from a first-hand, experience-based perspective.</p><p>In addition, my objective was to&nbsp;conduct meaningful, nuanced conversations with Minneapolis civic leaders who are grappling with the important issues that have recently dominated national news coverage. Issues that include police misconduct and public safety reform; the roots of civil unrest and the purpose of protest; and of course the role social activism has played in all of this.</p><p>This conversation, the first in a series of Minneapolis-themed episodes that I will be releasing over the coming weeks, is one powerful result of that good faith inquiry.</p><p>Representing Ward 5 on the Minneapolis City Council, Jeremiah sits at the vortex of the many complicated issues that concern his community, and from the start has been one of the leading and most prominent voices calling for the reimagination of public safety.</p><p>On the one hand, Jeremiah is a very unlikely elected official. An artist at heart and painter by trade, he’s both a muralist and a comic book illustrator. He’s into Silver Surfer. And Batman.</p><p>On the other hand, he is the son of former 6-term Congressman Keith Ellison. Currently Attorney General for the state of Minnesota, the Ellison elder was also in charge of the Chauvin prosecution. In other words, it’s fair to say that Jeremiah was born for the role he currently inhabits.</p><p>My week in Minneapolis was extraordinary. There were so many experiences I will never forget. I learned much. I’m better for the trip. And my time with Jeremiah has much to do with that. I’m grateful that he took the time to share his truth and for his trust in my ability to share it.</p><p>FULL BLOG & SHOW NOTES:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Frichroll597&token=d33c1d-1-1660509571220\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/richroll597</a></p><p>YouTube:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fjeremiahellison597&token=91da24-1-1660509571220\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/jeremiahellison597</a></p><p>This is a powerful exchange.
