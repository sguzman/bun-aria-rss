  "description": "<p>On December 7, 1971, 16-year-old Jamie Grissim left her home in Vancouver, Washington, to catch the bus to school. Jamie attended classes but got out early because she only had two classes scheduled on that particular day. Jamie had told her foster mother that she would walk home and expected to be there around 1 PM. Jamie never made it home and was never seen or heard from again. Jamie’s family was concerned, but local police assumed she was simply a runaway. Months later, in the spring of 1972, some of Jamie’s belongings turned up strewn alongside a country road in rural Clark County, Washington. Then, as the years wore on, more young women began to disappear from the area, and it became apparent that this was much more serious than a teenager who had run away from home.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Jamie Grissim or the other unsolved cases we discussed in this episode, please contact the Clark County Sheriff’s Office at 564-397-2211.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Boll & Branch</a>- Experience the best sheets you've ever felt at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bollandbranch.com</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Get 15% off your first set of sheets with promo code&nbsp;MIA.</p><p><a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moink</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://moinkbox.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moinkbox.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;to get FREE filet mignon for a year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://sleepnumber.com/VANISH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sleep Number</a>- Proven quality sleep is life-changing sleep.
