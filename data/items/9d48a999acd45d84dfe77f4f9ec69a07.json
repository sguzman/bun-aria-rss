  "description": "In the newest episode of The Readheads Book Club the girls are recapping and discussing Twice In a Blue Moon by Christina Lauren. It was Snitch's choice and it was a VERY Snitchy choice. As always they're casting the movie version of the book and giving it their overall rating. The next book is Jackie's choice and she chose American Duchess: A Novel of Consuelo Vanderbilt by Karen Harper.
