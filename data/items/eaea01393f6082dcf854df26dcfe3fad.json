  "description": "<p>As moms, we all fall short of the glory of God day after day. So we need to preach the gospel to ourselves again and again. But how do we actually do that? In this episode, Emily and Laura share how reminding yourself of the gospel is an important part of the Christian walk—but it requires some practice. To preach the gospel, we have to know the gospel. It’s the only thing that keeps us from being defined by the time we yelled in the car or hid in the pantry stress-eating dark chocolate. Momma, your true identity is secure in Christ—offering peace, hope, and joy in every moment.</p> <p><em>We’re grateful to <a href= \"https://christianplanner.com/products/2021-christian-planner?variant=32291994927170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christian Planner</a> for helping make this week’s show possible!
