  "itunes:summary": "A one-year-old boy shattered his back falling down a flight of stairs. He spent his childhood and youth in and out of hospital. Gavin Reid, the former Bishop of Maidstone, interviewed him in church. The boy remarked, &#039;God is fair.&#039; Gavin asked, &#039;How old are you?&#039; &#039;Seventeen,&#039; the boy replied. &#039;How many years have you spent in hospital?&#039; The boy answered, &#039;Thirteen years.&#039; Gavin asked, &#039;Do you think that is fair?&#039; He replied, &#039;God has got all of eternity to make it up to me.&#039;\nWe live in a world of instant gratification that has almost entirely lost its eternal perspective. The New Testament is full of wonderful promises about the future: all creation will be restored. Jesus will return to establish &#039;a new heaven and a new earth&#039; (Revelation 21:1). There will be no more crying, for there will be no more pain and suffering. Our frail, decaying mortal bodies will be changed for a body like that of Jesus&#039; glorious resurrected body.\nSuffering is not part of God&#039;s original created order (see Genesis 1–2). There was no suffering in the world before rebellion against God. There will be no suffering when God creates a new heaven and a new earth (Revelation 21:3–4). Suffering is, therefore, an alien intrusion into God&#039;s world.\nThis, of course, is not a complete answer to the question &#039;Why does God allow suffering?¹&#039; As we saw yesterday there is no simple or complete solution, but each of today&#039;s passages gives us some further insight.",
