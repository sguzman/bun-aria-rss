  "description": "<div>Based on <em>The New York Times</em> best-selling book of the same name, <em>The Most Dangerous Animal of All</em> is a documentary series that explores one man's search for the father who abandoned him, only to uncover the worst: he believes his father is the Zodiac killer, one of the most infamous serial killers in American history. In this episode, the evidence is presented, and it's compelling. From a near identical photographic match, to a finger print, to DNA evidence, it seems possible that the Zodiac has finally been unmasked.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.disappearedpod.com/\">FAM!
