    "media:description": "In 2010, after 25 years, the ATI brand was phased out. Replaced by its owner AMD. \n\nATI was a survivor. They started off in Toronto. Far from Silicon Valley, but somehow thrived and started making graphics accelerators.\n\nThey transitioned from 2D to 3D, competed head to head with market leader Nvidia, struck a deal with Nintendo, and survived the graphics card wars. \n\nWhat a journey! In this video, I want to take a look back at ATI.\n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
