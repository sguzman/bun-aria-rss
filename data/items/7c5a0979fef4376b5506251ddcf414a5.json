Will the things we buy become more expensive? Will businesses do better or worse under new trading rules?\n\nThis week, Ayeisha Thomas-Smith is joined by Annie Quick, Subject Lead for Inequality at the New Economics Foundation and Sam Lowe, who leads on trade and Brexit at Friends of the Earth.\n—\nEnjoying the show?
