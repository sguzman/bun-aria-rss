  "description": "Don Lincoln‘s new book, The Large Hadron Collider: The Extraordinary Story of the Higgs Boson and Other Stuff That Will Blow Your Mind (Johns Hopkins UP, 2014), presents an insider’s view of the largest physics experiment of our time and the discoveries that have come out of it over the past few years. A senior scientist at Fermilab and collaborator on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Lincoln provides a thorough and personal account of its assembly and early years of operation, including a disastrous malfunction just days after turning on, the unfolding saga of the Higgs boson, and the emergence of exciting new questions that can now be asked. Throughout the chapters, he weaves in relevant scientific details to explain the operation of the accelerator, its massive detectors, and everything they can tell us about the universe. Packed with rich analogies and approachable personal anecdotes, this book will be of interest to anyone curious about modern particle physics and the enormous international collaboration that is currently underway to further our understanding of this exciting field.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
