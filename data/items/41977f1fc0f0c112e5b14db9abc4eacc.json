  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hi Wes! Been listening to the show for a few years now. I had an encounter in northern MN back in 2012 while guiding canoe expeditions on the boundary waters. Myself and my crew of 8 other boy scouts/scout masters had several consecutive days worth of encounters and we weren’t the only crew that did.” I spoke to Chuck and he and his crew of boy scouts endured several nights of encounters with a creature. He said “I heard what sounded like crying coming from the bush. I kept hearing what sounded like someone walking through our camp. I sleep under a tarp to keep dry. I could tell this thing was standing over me. I thought maybe it was a bear so I swiped my hand out and hit this thing in the chest. It felt like a hairy bodybuilders chest and this thing ran off. I think it is important to note that I am 6’2 and I tie my hammock up at eye level so when I hit this thing in the chest it had to be at least 8 feet tall. I didn’t really know what to think until later when one of the scout masters told me he got up to use the bathroom and while he was taking a squat this 9 foot tall gorilla ran past him.” Chuck talked about how they encountered this thing several nights in a row and it seemed to get more and more aggressive.</p>",
