  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, our hosts chat with Wes Callihan, founder of <a href=\"https://scholatutorials.org/\">Schola Tutorials</a> and primary instructor in the <a href= \"https://romanroadsmedia.com/old-western-culture\">Old Western Culture series</a> by Roman Roads Media. Thomas starts off our interview today asking Wes what he remembers about stories and reading as a young person. Wes shares how he came to be a teacher and how his literary life developed as he became an adult. Angelina asks Wes about his approach to challenging literature when he started out reading the great books. He shares the joy of reading aloud, even to yourself, rather than silently whenever possible. Wes also talks about how learning languages enhanced his reading as well.

So I have striven to complete this composition to inform your love, oh child, and as I have put together a copious and accurate collection, so I have emulated the most wise bee, gathering up the spiritually beneficial deeds of the fathers.</p> <cite>John Moschos</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The fact that various persons have written angrily to say that the Judas I have depicted seems to them to be a person of the utmost nobility, actuated by extremely worthy motives, confirms my impression that this particular agent of hell is at present doing his master’s work with singular thoroughness and success.
