  "description": "<p>In our culture, we’re always striving for more—a fitter body, a more Instagrammable house, or a more substantial paycheck. And while there’s absolutely nothing wrong with having aspirations, cultivating those goals is a meaningless pursuit unless it comes from a strong foundation of self-worth. You are capable of achieving your goals because you are deserving of them, not because you are lacking in some way.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>This can be a hard skill to master because many of us have a laundry list of skills and traits we believe we could improve upon. But you’ll find that your life will change if you can simply believe that you are enough, that you are deserving, and you are worth it.</p> <p>That’s why I’m excited to share this conversation with Marisa Peer. Marisa is a world-renowned therapist, a best-selling author, and a specialist in teaching simple steps that produce life-changing results. On today’s show, she’s sharing the transformation that’s available to you by simply believing you are enough.
