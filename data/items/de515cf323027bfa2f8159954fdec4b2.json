  "description": "Within the climate tech world, technology hype is all over the map. In this episode, Lara Pierpoint, director of climate at Actuate, and Stephen Lacey, host of The Carbon Copy and executive producer of Catalyst, join Shayle for a game of “buy sell hold.” They take bets on which technologies are either overhyped, underhyped or just right.\nThey cover a range of topics, including:\n\n\nAdvanced nuclear, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s rejection of Oklo’s reactor designs and shifting opinions around nuclear\n\n\nWhether the concern around hydrogen leakage and its greenhouse effect is overblown\n\nHeat pumps, including the Biden administration’s efforts to boost production with the National Defense Production Act and a new report on how a proposed federal program to incentivize heat pumps could save Americans over $27 billion\n\nNon-lithium-ion batteries for stationary storage, which may see an opening in the market as lithium-ion batteries become expensive due to rising commodity prices and backedup supply chains.\n\nThe state of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies and fleet electrification\n\n\nBattery recycling, which is picking up speed due to concerns about the environmental impact of production and a shortage of materials\n\nWhether web3- and crypto-climate startups are solving the right problem\n\n\nCatalyst is brought to you by Arcadia.
