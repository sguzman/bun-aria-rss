  "description": "Episode 116: Trae Young\nDarth Vader. The Joker. The Terminator. Trae Young? Hey, being a villain isn't easy, but some people just do it so damn well. Enter Trae Young. He'll drain a three from the logo, tell the defender how good he looked doing it, all the while giving the crowd a little shimmy just to drive home the point. On the court, he fears no one and seems to relish the villain role. But has it always been that way? In this wide ranging interview, you'll learn much more about Trae Young than his edge on the court. He delves into topics such as how he creates so much offense for a relatively small NBA frame, or how he reacted the first time the vitriol really started raining down from the stands, or what really gets him going on the floor. Plus, the guys dig deep into the X's and O's of the game and nerd out for a while as well. It's an outstanding interview that shows you a side of Trae that people don't often see. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
