  "description": "Depending on your view of history and human life, the Michael Cohen circus on television this Wednesday was the third or fourth most important story of the day (that we know of). Certainly, a shooting war between two nuclear powers like India and Pakistan has got to rank first. And the possibility of a breakthrough between the US and North Korea might rank second (if it actually happens and it is not all for show). Global warming is probably always a bigger story. So we got Katie Phang, Joe Cirincione, and our own Rosa Brooks to cover them all (except global warming...but we'll get to that again soon). Tune in!\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
