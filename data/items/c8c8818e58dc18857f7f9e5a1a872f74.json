  "description": "Gawain, Kay, and Bishop Baldwin are road tripping, but it's starting to rain. Kay won't camp out in the rain, so that only leaves one option: Carl's house. The knights are in for one of the strangest nights of their life. The creature this week is the mantindane, from Kenya, maybe an evil poison monkey...or an alien trying to create a race of alien-human hybrids. -- Sponsors: Pet Cemetery comes out in theaters April 5th!
