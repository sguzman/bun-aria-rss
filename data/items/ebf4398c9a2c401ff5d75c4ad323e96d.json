  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, When you have the biggest political party in the country that insists on fundamentally transforming America, especially through the tools of immigration, and when you have a Republican Party that is shifty and unprincipled, is it too late? Is it too late to secure the border and to have a lawful immigration system? Rather than the Democrat party responding to the will of the people, the Democrat party has decided to change the people through immigration so they respond to the will of the Democrat party. And many Republicans are on board, because they buy into this notion that it’s humane to destroy your own country. Also, what does this mean for American children when the government advances open-ended immigration instead of assimilation? The Democrats make the case that family separation is akin to camps in Nazi Germany, despite the fact that children are always separated from their parents when their parents are arrested. Later, SCOTUS hands a court victory to the Trump Administration citing that the SEC infringed upon powers assigned to the president in the U.S. Constitution’s appointments clause regarding the appointments of certain federal posts. This echoes the argument made by Law Professor Calabresi and Mark about Special Counsel Mueller's appointment being unconstitutional based on that same precedent. Then, damning testimony from Michael Daniel former cyber-security chief under Obama testified that he was given a stand-down order regarding combating the Russian threat against the 2016 campaign. Finally, Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer passed away today. He was a brilliant man that put a lot of effort into writing his columns. Mark really respected Krauthammer despite his critique of President Reagan during the 1980 campaign, and he never tried to sabotage Reagan and eventually embraced his presidency and philosophy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
