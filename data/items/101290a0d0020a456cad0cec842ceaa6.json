  "description": "<p>Our snake venom episode last week took us down some fascinating roads, from the pathophysiological effects of these compounds to the snake detection hypothesis and from the development of antivenom to the incidence of snakebite around the world today. But how did we make it through that whole episode without discussing how and why these venoms evolved in the first place? It’s because we were saving it for this one, where we enlisted the expert help of <a href=\"https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-nicholas-casewell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Nick Casewell</a>, Professor of <a href=\"https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/research/departments/tropical-disease-biology\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tropical Disease Biology</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</a> and Director of the <a href=\"https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/the-centre-for-snakebite-research-interventions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Snakebite Research & Interventions</a>. In this bonus episode, the last in our series for now, Professor Casewell takes us through the remarkable world of snake venom evolution, covering such topics as the genetic basis for venom evolution, how snake venom is related to prey type, why spitting cobras spit, and so much more. Tune in wherever you get your podcasts to gain an even greater appreciation for these venom-producing snakes as well as the brilliant people who research them!</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
