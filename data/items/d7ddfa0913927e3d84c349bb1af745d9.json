  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the impending \"seismic change\" in talent in the NFL and chat about the different players potentially on the chopping block as we head into next week. Joining the program is ESPN NFL Insider, Dianna Russini to chat about being the only one on the JJ Watt situation, and dropping a massive bomb the Seahawks are shopping Russell Wilson that has quite a few people talking (22:41-41:58). Next, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the 100 Greatest Bears of All-Time Team, 49ers Kicker, Robbie Gould joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about his career, his current situation in San Francisco, what he's thinking he wants to do post playing career, and much more (44:17-1:12:45). Later, Predictive NFL Analyst and owner of SharpFootball, Warren Sharp joins the program to give some ideas on what he thinks is going to happen with all these marquee players getting cut and why teams that usually spend big in free agency don't often win (1:12:47-1:25:27).
