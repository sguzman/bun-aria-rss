  "description": "<p>In this 139th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>This week, we discuss whether reality is going to be tolerated—by internet randos, by magazines supposedly devoted to disseminating scientific findings to an interested public, and by actual scientific journals. A new editorial in Nature Human Behavior is breath-taking in its rejection of the scientific process and values, and, therefore, of reality. Then: what anti-scientific buffoonery is behind not allowing unvaccinated-against-Covid Novak Dvokovic, argued by some to be the best tennis player ever, to compete in the U.S. Open? And: what is the New York Times up to?</p><p>*****</p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p>Wisdom Health: Get your health back by working with functional medicine practitioners.
