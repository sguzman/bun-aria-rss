  "description": "<p>EPISODE 152 - ALWIN KUCHLER - Cinematographer</p> <p>Team Deakins converses with cinematographer, Alwin Kuchler (THE MAURITANIAN, STEVE JOBS, DIVERGENT). We cover a lot ground including his work with directors Lynne Ramsey and Danny Boyle. We talk about his intentions behind using both spherical vs anamorphic lenses, how he loves intense challenges and how he came across THE MAURITANIAN. We learn about his experience on RATCATCHER, working with Lynne Ramsay and how they worked instinctually since they had trouble understanding each other’s accents! He also shares his experiences working with Danny Boyle. And lots more! A great conversation that shouldn’t be missed!</p> <p> </p>",
