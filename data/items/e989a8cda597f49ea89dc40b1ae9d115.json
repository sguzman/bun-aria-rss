  "description": "Today I will be reviewing 'Maps of Meaning' by Jordan B. Peterson. Deriving meaning from the world around us is what enables us to live the life that we choose. In this book, Peterson explores how we have formulated maps during our existence to create meaning. The central proponent of the book is that myth creates an action which creates a language which we can then derive meaning. The author focuses heavily on the power of ancient myth in exploring how we have obtained meaning in the past. An in-depth exploration of the Mesopotamian derivation of how myth constituted the formation civilisations where our actions could accurately define the world around us, is explained in this book. The book is complicated and requires the full attention of the reader. It is full of complicated concepts that will need re-reading at times. However, if you want to explore the power of how we create meaning from the past as well as the world around us, I suggest you read this book.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
