  "description": "Parenting is hard—and parenting as a cycle-breaker is even harder. After all, if you’re raising your kids differently than you were raised, you’re carrying the weight of how generations before you were parented and acting as a pivot point for all the generations to come. That’s what it really means to be a cycle-breaker: The bravery and strength to say, “This family story… It ends with me. I’m starting something new.” The good news? You don’t have to do it alone. This week, Dr. Becky offers support to three parents who share their struggles around being cycle-breakers—from exhaustion to confusion to loss. She offers practical scripts and strategies, and reminds everyone to lean on each other, too. Remember: You are part of this community of intentional, cycle-breaking parents. Together, we can change the world, one person at a time.<p/>\n<p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
