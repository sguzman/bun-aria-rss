Kristie also offers some great tips for Scripture memorization and provides us with the encouragement we need to start memorizing verses—or even whole books of the Bible! The three women consistently come back to one theme: God’s Word is for God’s people, and we are meant to delight in it. </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 1 of the She Reads Truth Psalm 119: We Delight in Your Word reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a></p><p><b>Shop the </b><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/psalm-119'><b>Psalm 119: We Delight in Your Word</b></a><b> collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Save 20% on your first </b><a href='https://subscription.shopshereadstruth.com/'><b>Subscription Box</b></a><b> when you use the code SUB20.
