  "description": "<div>In today's episode I look at two members of the Royal Navy who disappeared in very different circumstances. And we meet a murderer who describes killing someone as: \"It was such a feeling. I have never, ever had that feeling. It was a feeling of power. I would say it was better than sex.\"Â <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uktruecrime.com/\">https://www.uktruecrime.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKTrueCrime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/UKTrueCrime\">https://www.patreon.com/UKTrueCrime</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
