  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP has a boyfriend who's really into cars. He wants to enter a lottery to win a $300,000 car, but he doesn't have the money for a ticket. OP buys a ticket for herself, and ends up winning! Suddenly, the boyfriend starts treating the car as if it's his and says that they have to share everything. OP doesn't want to give him the car (or even half of the car), so does that make her the butthole in this situation?
