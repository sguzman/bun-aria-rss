  "description": "<p>Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly rely on wireless\ncommunication standards. In a common industrial scenario, indoor wireless IoT\ndevices communicate with access points to deliver data collected from\nindustrial sensors, robots and factory machines. Due to static or quasi-static\nlocations of IoT devices and access points, historical observations of IoT\ndevice channel conditions provide a possibility to precisely identify the\ndevice without observing its traditional identifiers (e.g., MAC or IP address).\nSuch device identification methods based on wireless fingerprinting gained\nincreased attention lately as an additional cyber-security mechanism for\ncritical IoT infrastructures. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of a\nlarge class of machine learning algorithms for device identification using\nwireless fingerprints for the most popular cellular and Wi-Fi IoT technologies.\nWe design, implement, deploy, collect relevant data sets, train and test a\nmultitude of machine learning algorithms, as a part of the complete end-to-end\nsolution design for device identification via wireless fingerprinting. The\nproposed solution is currently being deployed in a real-world industrial IoT\nenvironment as part of H2020 project COLLABS.\n</p>",
