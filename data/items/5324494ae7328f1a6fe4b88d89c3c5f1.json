  "description": "<p>On this episode, the regular Bear Grease Render crew is joined by Rick Spicer, a bushcraft expert and flint knapper who was on the last Bear Grease Podcast. Rick talks about flint knapping and about being on the show \"Alone: The Beast\" where he spent thirty days in the Louisiana woods \"sort of\" alone. Misty gives a full on expose of her squirrel hunt when Clay gave her shooting advice and didn't buy her candy (JERK!). The crew ponders if the fluting of the Folsom point was utilitarian or had deeper meaning. Finally, we get to the end and answer the question we started with - why does the information about these ancient people matter? This episode is a great ending to a great series. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
