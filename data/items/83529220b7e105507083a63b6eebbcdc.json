I’ve spent years wondering whether or not I have ADHD. Every time I hear someone talk about the symptoms or describe their lives, I immediately think that they’re talking about my life. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when one of my business mentors released a podcast episode describing their journey with ADHD, I decided it was time. I took several self-assessments and they all told the story of my ADHD. I then made an appointment with a psychiatrist to formalize my diagnosis and to be prescribed medication. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My doctor agreed that I do indeed have ADHD, specifically inattentive ADHD, but unfortunately I cannot take any medication at this time. Now I’m looking for ways to treat this in a naturopathic way, but my goal is to elevate my overall health so that I can, someday soon, be placed on medications to help me with my activities of daily living. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that’s not all. This hiatus was a necessity for my life and business. Listen in to hear all about my revelations and what I focused on during the hiatus.
