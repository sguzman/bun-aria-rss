  "description": "Today, on the podcast we talk with Paul McLaughlin. He might not be known to you yet, or his cooperage, but the story he shares and how they hone their craft is like no other. We had the opportunity to check out Kelvin Cooperage and get a behind the scenes tour of their barrel building process. It’s amazing how everything is still very labor intensive and they use machines and tooling that have been part of their process since the beginning. We dive into toasting on a natural fire and what makes their barrels different from other cooperages around the country. We also discuss the economics of a cooperage and how they are trying to satisfy the growth of a world-wide demand for used barrels.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about faulty pipe systems at distilleries.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nHow did you get into the barrel making business?\n\nHow did you get into bourbon?\n\nHow does Kentucky compare to Scotland?\n\nWhen did you join the family business?\n\nWas it hard to have your brother as your boss?\n\nHow is your process unique?\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind toasting?\n\nTell us about the natural fire.\n\nHow long does it take a new cooper to get the hang of the process?\n\nDo you rotate positions?\n\nDo you have a high employee turnover?\n\nHow many used barrels are you buying per day?\n\nWhat other barrels do you get besides bourbon?\n\nWhat's the craziest barrel you've made?\n\nTell us about selling barrels in Asia and Japan.\n\nLet's discuss the economics of barrel making.\n\nWhat is your quality control process?\n\nWhat makes your cooperage appealing to customers?\n\nIs it harder to make a 25 gallon barrel?\n\nHow do you see this business growing?\n\nHow do you source oak?\n\nHow do you determine pricing?\n\nWhat about secondary finishing?\n\nWhere do you see the business in 10 years?",
