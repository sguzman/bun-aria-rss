  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, my guest is the gallerist James Birch - whose new book <em>Bacon In Moscow</em> describes how he achieved the seemingly impossible: taking an exhibition of Francis Bacon's work to Moscow in the late 1980s. James tells me how he negotiated between the volatile artist and the implacable Soviet bureaucracy with the help of a suave but menacing KGB middleman; and how, along the way, he nearly acquired an original Francis Bacon painting and nearly acquired a Russian wife.Â </div>\n",
