  "description": "Taylor Swift unveils a new, darker identity on her latest album \"Reputation,\" and many have read the lyrics on her latest as not-so-subtle volleys in an ongoing celebrity feud. Still, a question remains: how does Swift cast this dark personality in music? Two songs offer evidence. Melodic drops and temporal gaps in \"I Did Something Bad\" signal the album's themes of descent and decay. On \"Getaway Car,\" however, some of Swift's old songwriting tricks may betray her new persona.\nWe also dug into Reputation and other great listener questions in our Reddit AMA.\nFeaturing:\nTaylor Swift:\n• I Did Something Bad\n• Getaway Car\n• Trouble\n• Love Story\n• You Belong With Me\n• Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys - Away Out There\n• Imogen Heap - Hide and Seek\n• The Weeknd - Can't Feel My Face\nLearn more about your ad choices.
