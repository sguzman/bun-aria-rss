  "description": "<p>To help celebrate its 60th anniversary, the Guggenheim Museum teamed up with 99% Invisible to offer visitors a guided audio experience of the museum.

From the outside, the building is a light gray spiral, and from the inside, the art is displayed on one long ramp that curves up towards a glass skylight in the ceiling. We’re going to take the greatness of this building as a given. What we’re going to focus on are the oddities, the accretions, the interventions that reveal a different kind of genius. Not just the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright, and his bold, original vision, but the genius of all the people that made this building function, adapt, and grow over the decades.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=30347&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Audio Guide to the Imperfections of a Perfect Masterpiece</a></p>\n",
