  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride! The Steve Harvey Morning Show is the funniest morning show on Planet Earth. Try and dispute it, the challenge is out. \"Just Bring It!\" (in our The Rock voice) The Chief Love Officer gets a question from a married man who can't stand his wife's mouth. There is a $350 problem in The Jackpot Joint of Jerusalem. \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" reunion gave us laughs and cries on its HBO Max debut this past Thursday. Bitterman strikes again with another Christmas song that contains absolutely no joy. Junior makes us run ten miles while he talks about his family at Thanksgiving. Sports Talk started a discussion about winning and losing as it centered around NFL week 11. Is there ever a good time to breakup during the holidays? Find out what common ground Steve and Santa share. Being a mack ain't it, btw. Today in Closing Remarks, Big Dog gives us his candor regarding 45's attempt to discredit the Black vote.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
