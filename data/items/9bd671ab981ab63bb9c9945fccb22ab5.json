  "description": "<p>Do you have any sandpaper kind of people in your life? You know, the ones that tend to always be negative and never seem to have a positive thing to say? If so, you’re not alone, sister. So while you may not be BFFs with all your coworkers, or totally fall in love with all of your sister in law’s tendencies, there are solutions to navigating those difficult people in your life. In this episode, Jordan dives into mindset shifts and tangible actions for these exact relationships and how to make certain the negative cycle doesn’t continue with you. You’ll learn why you should swap out the word ‘deal’ with the word ‘love,’ the importance of balancing the bonds in your life, and why distancing yourself is sometimes the most loving thing you can do. And, bonus, she’s also here to remind you that sometimes WE can be the difficult one in other’s people lives – and how that really doesn’t feel good to identify. Gal, we are cheering you on in these difficult, yet refining relationships because the negativity cycle stops with you – right here, right now.
