  "title": "#13 - That Episode About Growing Up in the Children of God Cult with Flor and Tamar Edwards",
  "description": "<p><br></p><p>How we grow up can dictate how we act in our relationships as adults, whether we consciously know it or not. We might learn about these habits the hard way.</p><p> </p><p>How would growing up in a religious movement that some describe as an apocalyptic cult affect you as an adult? Could you imagine that?&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Today, Matchmaker Maria speaks with author Flor Edwards and her twin sister Tamar Edwards. By age twelve, Flor and Tamar had lived in 24 different locations across three continents. Always on the move to escape the Antichrist and in preparation for the Apocalypse in 1993, their nomadic childhood prompted Flor to pen her memoir Apocalypse Child: A Life in End Times. Flor movingly describes her early life growing up with her family and 11 siblings as a member of The Children of God, a controversial religious movement that many describe as an apocalyptic cult. Tamar works in health and wellness and is currently in the process of receiving her certification as a sex and intimacy coach.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077Z55HMK/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Flor’s book, Apocalypse Child: A Life in End Times can be found on Amazon here.</span></a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/floredwardsauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find Flor on Instagram</span></a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://www.floredwards.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit Flor’s website</span></a></p><p> </p><p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/matchmakermaria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow Maria on Instagram</span></a></p><p> </p><p>Have a question for Maria?
