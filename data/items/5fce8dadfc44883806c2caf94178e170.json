Justin Pogue is our guest today and he’s an author and real estate consultant where he works with property management companies and investors. Since 2003, he has developed and managed apartments, rental homes, and student housing across the United States. ApartmentTherapy, Realtor.com, and FOX News have featured his insights, and we’re glad he’s now here with us on HTM to talk about ways to reduce rent. We talk about entering into a negotiation mindset, the best times of year to get a deal, putting yourself in the shoes of a landlord, protecting your deposit, and more!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Speltz Wrong by Dssolvr!
