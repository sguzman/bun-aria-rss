  "description": "<p>In this digital age, everyone’s taking photos, billions of them, primarily with their phones.  We talk today about architectural photography, and how both digital and social changes in photography affect decisions about the kind of buildings we see built, the design competitions where photos play a part, and how you can take better photos of architecture you love, like your own house.</p> <p>Our first guest is architect <strong>Harry Wolf</strong>, joining us from his home in Portugal.  Harry worked at Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill in New York and opened Wolf Architecture in North Carolina and later NY and LA.  If you were watching closely, Harry was in the documentary <em>Concert of Wills</em> about the making of the Getty Center.  Harry won five national AIA honor awards and over 30 regional and state AIA honors.  He is a frequent juror for the George Matsumoto Prize, North Carolina’s highest honors exclusively for Modernist houses.  </p> <p>Raleigh Architect <strong>Matt Griffith</strong> graduated in Architecture from the NCState College of Design. Before founding the award-winning design firm in situ studio with past podcast guest <strong>Erin Sterling Lewis</strong>, Matt worked in the offices of <strong>Marlon Blackwell</strong> and another past podcast guest, <strong>Frank Harmon</strong>.  Matt and Erin won twenty-two local and state design awards, including several of the <strong>George Matsumoto</strong> Prizes we mentioned earlier.  He lives in a mid-century modernist house and is Associate Professor at the NCState School of Architecture. </p> <p>Photographer <strong>Jim Sink</strong> has been shooting buildings, with his camera, for nearly 50 years.  He is a graduate of the US Naval School of Photography.
