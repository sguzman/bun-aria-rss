  "description": "<div>FAM!! Lady RuPaul (Charles) herself narrates this one!!<br>\n<br>\nThis episode is an affectionate look at everyone's favorite televangelist / Gay Icon / Face Tattoo-er, Tammy Faye Bakker. The eldest of eight children in rural Minnesota, Tammy Faye married Jim Bakker in 1960, and soon they found a following on the gospel circuit. Riding a tide of religious fundamentalism, the Bakkers reached their gaudy heights with the PTL Network and the spinoff Christian theme park Heritage USA. Then the roof caved in. Jim was forced to pay hush money to future Playboy centerfold , Jessica Hahn, and then was submitted to rival Jerry Falwell's hostile take-over of the network. Soon Jim was in jail for fraud, and Tammy was at Betty Ford for addiction to prescription drugs. You guys, We have A LOT to say about this one.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
