  "description": "The pandemic has upended the art and business of making music. Producing, performing and releasing — every aspect is new and uncharted. The need for social distancing means that it’s unsafe to collaborate in small studios or perform for large crowds — not to mention finding the right thing to sing about in such a charged moment. We’re telling three stories about how artists are working within these constraints: Ricky Reed and John-Robert have found a way to generate a creative spark remotely, Jacob Collier has defied the laws of physics to master live performance over the internet, and Dua Saleh has released a powerful new track that helps support the protests in Minneapolis. Everything is radically different than it was a few months ago, but these stories shine a light on why making music matters more than ever in 2020. \n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nLizzo - Juice\nJohn-Robert, Ricky Reed, Zach Sekof - Favorite Boy\nBill Withers - Lean On Me performed by Ty Dolla Sign & Jacob Collier\nJacob Collier - All I Need\nD’Angelo - Feel Like Making Love\nStevie Wonder - You And I performed by Tori Kelly and Jacob Collier\nDua Saleh - Body Cast\nDua Saleh - Sugar Mama\nDua Saleh - Moth\nDua Saleh - Smut\nSister Rosetta Tharp - This Little Light Of Mine\n\nMORE\nWatch Nice Live on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24tNtu1NuD9yZ9t2YUATIQ\nDua Saleh's \"Body Cast\" BandCamp campaign: https://duasaleh.bandcamp.com/track/body-cast\nListen to Dua Saleh's new album Rosetta: https://duasaleh.bandcamp.com/album/rosetta\nLearn more about your ad choices.
