  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We make so many decisions in motherhood. Daily, we consider things like, <em>what snack should I feed my child? How much screen time should they have? What discipline strategy should I use for this tantrum?</em> And we also ask deeper, bigger questions like, <em>how should we handle their schooling? What church should our family go to? How much time should we spend away from our kids?</em> In today’s episode, Emily and Laura discuss how they each process decision-making and the many factors that influence the final outcome. God calls each of us to a dependent life that aligns with our deepest desire—to love and live like Christ in all we do, big and small.</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re grateful to Crossway for making this week’s show possible.
