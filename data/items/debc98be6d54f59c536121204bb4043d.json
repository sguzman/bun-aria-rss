  "description": "<p>Over the past few years, people keep asking me if I'd read <em>The Way of the Superior Man</em>, by David Deida. Having long ago given up on being a superior man, I hadn't. Finally got around to reading it, and as you'll hear in this episode, I have some things to say about what I think Mr. Deida gets right and some equally passionate thoughts on what he gets very, very wrong.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://lelo.to/ChrisLELOFour\">Lelo</a>, maker of the world's best sex toys.
