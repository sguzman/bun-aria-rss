  "itunes:summary": "Robbie Williams once went on a shopping spree in Los Angeles. He bought five cars, including a brand new Ferrari, a brand new Porsche and a brand new Mercedes. Within a week he wished he had not bought any of them (as he didn’t even have a driving license!).\nI admire Robbie Williams’ openness about himself. He is ruthlessly honest about his self-obsession and addictions. In his song, Feel, he sings:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to feel real love…\n&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s a hole in my soul\n&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see it in my face\n&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a real big place.\nGod implants this desire ‘to feel real love’ in humanity. This ‘hole in my soul’ is common to all human beings. It cannot be filled by cars, wealth, success or drugs. It is a God-shaped hole. It is a spiritual hunger and thirst for God which Jesus told us could only be filled by his wonderful Holy Spirit (John 7:37).",
