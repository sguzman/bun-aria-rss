  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss Fountains of Wayne with Cam Edwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Introducing the Band</strong>:<br />\nYour hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Cam Edwards. Cam is the editor of <a href=\"https://bearingarms.com/\">Bearing Arms</a>, the host of Bearing Arms’ <em>Cam & Co</em>, and the <em><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-blaze-radio-network/40-acres-and-a-fool\">40 Acres & A Fool</a></em> podcast. Find him online <a href=\"http://twitter.com/camedwards\">@camedwards</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>Cam’s Music Pick: Fountains of Wayne<br />\n</strong>Are you alone now? Did you lose the monkey? Good. Then you’re prepared for the <em>Political Beats</em> dive into the music of Fountains of Wayne. This special episode is in honor of the late Adam Schlesinger, the bassist and co-songwriter for the band. Nominated for the “Best New Artist” award at the 2003 Grammys, Fountains of Wayne had been active for nearly a decade prior to that point. Their output was remarkably consistent; power pop through and through, with bright chords, innovative rhymes, and huge hooks. The band had only one Top 40 song to their credit (“Stacy’s Mom”), but any number of these songs will remain in your head for weeks after listening to this episode.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all he did! Though FOW is the focus, we also touch on his work in movies and television, plus his creative efforts with other bands. Schlesinger clearly was one of the most prolific and talented songwriters of his generation and his absence will be sorely missed.</p>\n",
