Her husband Matt was arrested in June 2021, 9 months after the discovery of her remains and a prolonged autopsy. If you have not listened to the original episode or the first update, we encourage you to go listen to yesterday's episode, which contains the original story and initial update. Today, we're diving into the investigation into Emily's death, as well as the strange parallels between the details of her death and the passing of Matt's son, Joey, less than a year before Emily vanished.</p><p>You can find Jeff's song here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=nGy968j3rHc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The song is called \"Emily\"</a></p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;to save $15 off your first order plus free shipping.</p><p><a href=\"http://sarahflint.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Flint</a>- Get $50 off your first Sarah Flint purchase when you go to <a href=\"http://sarahflint.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sarahflint.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
