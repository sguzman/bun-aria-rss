  "description": "Data Dash host Nicholas Merten says Bitcoin and the crypto markets are setting up for a big parabolic comeback over the coming months as he’s becoming more and more convinced that a spring cryptocurrency rally is imminent.\n\nMerten makes the case that BTC will soon be back to $60,000, a price range not seen since November 2021. Merten also says the altcoin market, already gaining momentum, will rally in turn.\n\n“I want to make the case that, really, as soon as later in April, if this trend plays out here, we could be back up towards that $60,000 range for Bitcoin. We could be in for a spring rally… But it’s not just Bitcoin. I want to emphasize this big time – because I understand all the while Bitcoin is obviously the most recognized currency, it is the largest crypto in the crypto space – this is unlikely to be just a Bitcoin rally.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
