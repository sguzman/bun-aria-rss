  "description": "On this episode: Zak and Jamilah are joined by Ophira Eisenberg, stand-up comedian and host of the podcast Parenting Is a Joke. They share some funny triumphs and fails spanning from spoiled birthday presents to a dance recital mix up. Then they continue the birthday train and advise a parent who is looking for party alternatives for their son’s first birthday bash with friends. The problem? They live in a small house—too small to host a party—and don’t want to spend a fortune to rent a space. \n\nThen on Slate Plus, they play a trivia game to see how well they know parenting pop-culture.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
