  "description": "Check out Paul's podcast: Suiting Up with Paul Rabil\nToday on the Colin and samir podcast we’re incredibly excited to bring you a conversation with our great friend. Paul Rabil. Paul is a professional athlete, an entrepreneur a creator, a podcaster and the most driven individual we’ve ever met. He’s a professional lacrosse player and on the field is often times referred to as the Lebron James of lacrosse, and to tack onto that off the field he’s referred to as lacrosse’s first million dollar man.\nPaul has invested in and started multiple successful businesses both in and out of the sports landscape and most recently has launched his biggest venture ever - The Premiere Lacrosse League. With this new venture he’s not only looking to change professional lacrosse but he’s creating something that will undoubtedly change the way we view professional sports moving forward. \nWe first met Paul back in 2014 when we created a partnership with him to start a YouTube channel. Over the course of the past 5 years, we’ve created hundreds of videos together, amassed a subscriber base of over 160,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel and created an award winning docu-series - most importantly we’ve developed a strong friendship. \nPaul has been a great mentor to us throughout our Journey, he continues to inspire us with his creativity and ambition and we just couldn’t be more excited to bring you this conversation with our friend Paul Rabil. \nThe Wait but Why article Paul talks about on the episode: The Tail End",
