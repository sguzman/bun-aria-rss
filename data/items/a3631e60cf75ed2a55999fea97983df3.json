  "description": "<p>True Crime Tuesday Presents: The Beatle Bandit with Author, Nate Hendley !</p>\n\n<p>On July 24, 1964, twenty-four-year-old Matthew Kerry Smith disguised himself with a mask and a Beatle wig, hoisted a semi-automatic rifle, then held up a bank in North York, Ontario. The intelligent but troubled son of a businessman and mentally ill mother, Smith was a navy veteran with a young Indigenous wife and a hazy plan for violent revolution.<br>\n<br>\nOutside the bank, Smith was confronted by Jack Blanc, a former member of the Canadian and Israeli armies, who brandished a revolver. During a wild shootout, Blanc was killed, and Smith escaped ― only to become the object of the largest manhunt in the history of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force.</p>\n\n<p>Get Nate's Book, The Beatle Bandit, Here:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beatle-Bandit-Nate-Hendley/dp/1459748107\">https://www.amazon.com/Beatle-Bandit-Nate-Hendley/dp/1459748107</a></p>\n",
