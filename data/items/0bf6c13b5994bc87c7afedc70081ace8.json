Many of the original historical structures built in Tempe have survived and its one of the town's greatest attributes. One of these buildings was originally a family home that is now a restaurant named Casey Moore's Oyster House. Locals love to gather for a beer and seafood. Patrons and employees all claim that the restaurant is haunted by several spirits. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Casey Moore's Oyster House. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Michael Rogers and features killer exploding lakes and This Day in History features Thomas Paine writing the essay beginning, \"These are the times that try men's souls.\" Our location was suggested by Alicia Taylor.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-171-casey-moores-oyster-house.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/12/hgb-ep-171-casey-moores-oyster-house.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
