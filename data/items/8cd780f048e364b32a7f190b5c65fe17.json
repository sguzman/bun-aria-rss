Musical ideas can be explored quickly and composing songs is easy. Yet for many, these tools are overwhelming: An ocean of settings can be tweaked and it is often unclear, which changes lead to a great song. <strong>This experiment investigates how to use evolutionary algorithm and novelty search to help musicians find musical inspiration in Ableton Live.</strong></p><h3>Making Music With Computers</h3><p>In the past 30 years, the art of making music has dramatically changed. As computers gradually conquered most aspects of the creative process, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation\">Digital Audio Workstation</a> (DAW) Software has become the primary tool to produce music of all sorts: from Techno & Hiphop to Classical, Jazz & Doomcore.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gYmsP2QIilBvkaPIT5Bc8A.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.ableton.com/\"><strong>Ableton Live</strong></a> is as a leading DAW. It enables anyone even with just minimal training to compose professional sounding music. Simply by loading a few audio-samples or a synthesiser and then <strong>manually exploring possible combinations and settings, </strong>musical ideas start to emerge within seconds.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*JZo3mO4K-PY3Nqn_nWZ99A.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Ableton Live Clip View: <em>Play on Pad1 on Channel1 + Drum1 on Channel3 + Melody6 etc.</em></figcaption></figure><p>While manual exploration is enjoyable for small collections, imagine dealing with 1000 audio-samples or synthesiser settings. As the amount of total possible combinations <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion\">explodes</a>, manually searching for desired outcomes becomes very time consuming and thus, most <strong>musical ideas remain hidden.</strong></p><h3>Evolution & Novelty Search</h3><p>Using computational methods to find new music is intriguing: A algorithm could quickly search through countless sample & synth setting combinations, and give us a expansive, browsable map of truly novel musical ideas.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2kpd1gySE1aKCL6MS4YvPg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>The basic concept of a Evolutionary Algorithm</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm\"><strong>Evolutionary Algorithms</strong></a> (EA) have a long history of being used for such interactive music generation experiments. They are a family of optimisation algorithms inspired by the principle of <strong>Darwinian natural selection</strong>. EA’s generate many possible solutions for a problem and then tests how well the solutions solve the problem, using a given <em>fitness function</em>. The fittest solutions <em>procreate</em>.</p><p>When thinking about using a Evolutionary Algorithm to search through musical combinations, a key question is how to define the fitness function — or <strong>how to measure what is good music.</strong> A few years ago <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenneth0stanley?lang=en\"><strong>Kenneth Stanley</strong></a><strong> -</strong> a computer science professor at the University of Central Florida - published a series of papers outlining a concept which is relevant to this question: <a href=\"http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/noveltysearch/userspage/\"><strong>Novelty Search</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a evolutionary search strategy which <strong>rewards behaving <em>differently</em> instead of <em>progress</em> to some goal.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JupV4VGkX-ZfStOKZZ3ttw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Evolving Paintings by <a href=\"http://picbreeder.org/\">PicBreeder.org</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>In a search for novelty there is no pressure to be <em>better</em></strong><em> —</em><strong><em> </em></strong>it simply rewards those solutions that are different. Novelty Search and a group of related approaches are under active development since years and have found application in <a href=\"http://picbreeder.org/\">painting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjoh3lexiRQ\">robotics</a> & <a href=\"http://julian.togelius.com/Liapis2014Constrained.pdf\">games</a>. Watch Stanley’s fascinating talk “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQPL9GooyI\"><strong>The Myth of the Objective</strong></a>” for further infos on the topic.</p><blockquote><strong>“Surprisingly, sometimes <em>not looking for the goal</em> leads to finding the goal more quickly and consistently” — </strong><em>Kenneth Stanley.</em></blockquote><h3>Experiment: Novelty Search Live</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/samim23/Novelty-Search-Live/\"><strong>Novelty Search Live</strong></a> is a open-source tool that helps musicians find musical inspiration in Ableton Live. It uses a evolutionary algorithm to continuously evolve new audio clip and synth parameter combinations, guided exclusively by Novelty Search. Finally is takes the thousands of musical ideas it has discovered and generates a interactively browsable map with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\"><em>t-SNE</em></a>.</p><p>While this experiment is just a quick proof of concept, it hints at the option of a <strong>musical inspiration assistant</strong> which guides the creative process.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgcX5lez_Q9o&src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgcX5lez_Q9o&type=text%2Fhtml&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/186ff43f4f94a7a6526eea31eaf17315/href\">https://medium.com/media/186ff43f4f94a7a6526eea31eaf17315/href</a></iframe><h4><strong>Novelty Search Live — Features:</strong></h4><ul><li>Evolve Clip Combinations, Device & Synths Parameters in realtime.</li><li>Explore possible combination of a live set & discover new musical ideas.</li><li>Play with a interactive map (T-SNE) of generated combinations.</li></ul><h4>>> <a href=\"https://github.com/samim23/Novelty-Search-Live/\">Get Novelty Search Live on GitHub</a> <<</h4><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F324937944%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fsamim%2Fnovelty-search-1&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000224752249-h3ac17-t500x500.jpg&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=soundcloud\" width=\"800\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ae1b4f1bb7a41301091f9db71cfb8416/href\">https://medium.com/media/ae1b4f1bb7a41301091f9db71cfb8416/href</a></iframe><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F324948993%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fsamim%2Fnovelty-search-2&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000224760426-8viavm-t500x500.jpg&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=soundcloud\" width=\"800\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/6842eeb7bdfa406becca896dd23a447a/href\">https://medium.com/media/6842eeb7bdfa406becca896dd23a447a/href</a></iframe><h4>How does it work?</h4><ol><li>Control Ableton Live from Python code via the <a href=\"https://github.com/ideoforms/pylive\">PyLive</a> library.</li><li>Capture infos (clips/parameters/status) from Live & turn into Vector.</li><li>Evolve Vector with <a href=\"https://github.com/deap\">Deap</a> (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) (this should be replaced with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network\">CPPN</a> like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies\">NEAT</a> for better results)</li><li>Use Novelty Search as fitness function, run for X generations.</li><li>Send evolved vector to Ableton Live and play new music combination.</li><li>Loop 3–5 until user interrupt.</li><li>Show interactive T-SNE map of all evolved solutions.</li></ol><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FuBstLHqWjj4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuBstLHqWjj4&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FuBstLHqWjj4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/75f80dd97e1842137eb65470a0ab1ab7/href\">https://medium.com/media/75f80dd97e1842137eb65470a0ab1ab7/href</a></iframe><h3>Surprise, Curiosity, Motivation, Quality & Diversity</h3><p>While Novelty Search is useful for musical discovery, it is clearly only part of a bigger puzzle. In the past years, researchers have come up with many improvements, extensions and new ideas going beyond pure novelty search. <strong>Here is a selection of related research, worth checking out:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.autogamedesign.eu/surprise-search\"><strong>Surprise Search</strong></a><strong>: </strong>“a novel algorithm that takes inspiration from the notion of surprise for unconventional discovery”.</li><li><a href=\"http://antoniosliapis.com/research/novsearch.php\"><strong>Constrained Novelty Search</strong></a>: “A Study on Game Content Generation”</li><li><a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040/full\"><strong>Quality Diversity</strong></a><strong>:</strong> “A New Frontier for Evolutionary Computation”.</li><li><a href=\"https://pathak22.github.io/noreward-rl/\"><strong>Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction.</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html\"><strong>Novelty and Outlier Detection</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In scikit-learn.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.araya.org/archives/1306\"><strong>Recurrent generative auto-encoders and novelty search.</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00145/full\"><strong>The Emerging Neuroscience of Intrinsic Motivation</strong></a>: A New Frontier in Self-Determination Research.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3slKhzgPQrFc5PXr37u8Vg.png\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.autogamedesign.eu/surprise-search\">Surprise Search</a> system diagram</figcaption></figure><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p><em>Novelty Search Live</em> has transformed the way i compose music. Compared with manual processes, finding inspiration with computational assistance is joyful and often leads to unforeseeable outcomes. Combined with ideas such as surprise search and interactive training, a true <strong>musical inspiration assistant </strong>may become a reality soon. Such an assistant would allow us to compose high quality, yet unheard music much faster and inform us if what we are doing has been done a million times before. As such approaches have applications beyond just music, it is easy to imagine a world where there is an inspiration assistant for any thinkable creative processes.</p><blockquote>Get in touch here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samim\">twitter.com/samim</a> | <a href=\"http://samim.io/\">http://samim.io</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://tinyletter.com/samim\">Sign up for the Newsletter for more experiments like this!</a></blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PTyD4hY_Z_3DTh9jeaOuxA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Map of Evolved Musical Ideas with Novelty-Search-Live</figcaption></figure><h3>Follow up Discussion</h3><h3>Kenneth Stanley on Twitter</h3><p>@samim Great application of novelty search to music!
