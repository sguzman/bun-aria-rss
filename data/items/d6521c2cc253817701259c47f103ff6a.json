The board temporarily allowed Facebook to keep Trump off the platform, but criticized the slapdash way Facebook made that call and provided a long list of recommendations for Facebook to respond to.</p><p>Well, now Facebook has responded—announcing that it will ban Trump from the platform for two years. And though the response hasn’t gotten as much coverage as the initial ruling, it’s arguably more important for what it says about both Facebook and the Facebook Oversight Board’s role in the future of content moderation.</p><p>This week on the <em>Lawfare Podcast</em>'s Arbiters of Truth series on our online information ecosystem, Quinta Jurecic interviewed <em>Lawfare</em> managing editor Jacob Schulz and Arbiters of Truth co-host Evelyn Douek about Facebook’s response to the board.
