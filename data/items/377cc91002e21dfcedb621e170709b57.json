It will hide imperfections and create forgiveness for asymmetry. You can either do paint to hide it or a fun wallpaper to make it stand out. You will want to paint the bookcase all the same color in a satin finish and then style it very intentionally. Hardware on your doors will really help accentuate. Long, maybe gold or gunmetal, but definitely not stainless steel. The open space on the side? We really want to knock it down! If you can’t, you could use it to highlight a great piece of art using one of Ballard’s easels and place a large bust or urn in front of it to really fill the space. The key is to be intentional with your styling and consistent. Some examples are turning books horizontal, wrapping them in black or white, using the same baskets, vases, picture frames; or choose 3 different types of vignettes for some diversity. For each shelf, create the same vignette on both sides but at different levels. If the left side has adjustable shelves, you should even them out or even take out that top shelf and hang some art. For a rule of thumb, we say don’t decorate with anything smaller than a cantaloupe!\n\nFor furniture layout, we like what you mentioned with the L-shaped sectional and two chairs. Another option is to do two sofas facing each other and accent chairs across from the fireplace. You could even add a bench in front of the fireplace. We also recommend painting that fireplace white or even a German smear. The bookcases should really read as their own pieces of furniture and not blend…so make them stand out by painting them all one consistent color that’s different from the fireplace. There is a sheen on the walls that’s reflecting light; we recommend repainting with a flat finish. Also, the lights have sort of a blue tint and we would go softer to make it warmer. We also suggest some sheer drapery and maybe some wood blinds if you want extra privacy. Finally, not a must-have, but maybe a bigger TV?!\n\nThanks, Sarah, and good luck!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nForbes Masters Website\nForbes Masters on Instagram\nShop Forbes Masters on Instagram\nForbes Masters on Houzz\nForbes Masters Wallpaper on Mitchell Black\nForbes Masters on The Drew Barrymore Show\nKips Bay Show House",
