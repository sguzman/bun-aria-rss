This week the boys dial in their homie, Senior Digital Producer for “Desus & Mero” and one of the finest minds on the timeline, Rob “Young Costanza” McCrae. Rob is digging deep in his Serato for bangers and thoughtfully considering topics including, but not limited to: that first haircut after quar, gold teeth, being a stunt double, normalizing talking about race while hiring, squaring off against The Man, his hatred for stand-up comedy, missing the homies and much more.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits\n",
