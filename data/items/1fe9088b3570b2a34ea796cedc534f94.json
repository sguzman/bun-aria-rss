  "description": "<p>RELAX.<br />\nHow often do you say, “I’m just going to get through the day.” You’re running on adrenaline. But it’s not sustainable. If you’re not relaxed, you’re not breathing. If you’re not breathing, you’re not getting oxygen. It’s a loop. You’re going to be exhausted all the time.<br />\nOn today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the power of breathing to heal our mind and body with a man known as “The Iceman:” Wim Hof. Wim Hof got his nickname “The Iceman” by breaking a number of records related to cold exposure. His feats include climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts, running a half marathon above the Arctic Circle on his bare feet, and standing in a container while covered with ice cubes for more than 112 minutes. He developed the Wim Hof Method: a natural path to an optimal state of body and mind. He says that our brains have the power to guarantee us happiness, strength, and health. We can actually regulate our mind and the autonomous nervous system by breathing and being present. Shut Up. Go in. Feel. Be. Connect.<br />\nSo get ready to learn how to harness the power of the mind on Episode 799.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow does creating stress on the body prevent disease? (4:00)<br />\nWhat do you think about right before you get in the cold water? (8:30)<br />\nWhy did you get into the ice and breathing business? (16:30)<br />\nWhere do you feel the most loved in your life? (29:00)<br />\nWho was more influential? Your mom or your dad? (38:00)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nHow control of the autonomic nervous system in the brain can help depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders (10:00)<br />\nHow cold helps you still the emotion on your mind (25:00)<br />\nAbout your sixth, seventh, and eighth senses (32:00)<br />\nAbout the science behind the benefit of putting stress on your body (3:00)<br />\nFollow me on:<br />\nInstagram @LewisHowes<br />\nTwitter @LewisHowes<br />\nFacebook @LewisHowes</p>\n",
