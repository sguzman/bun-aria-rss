  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) with Jack Butler, host of Ricochet’s <em>Young Americans</em> podcast, sidekick of <em>The Remnant</em> with Jonah Goldberg, and a freelancer writer living in D.C.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the</strong> <strong>Band</strong></span>:<strong><br />\n</strong>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Jack Butler, host of Ricochet’s <em>Young Americans</em> podcast, sidekick of <em>The Remnant</em> with Jonah Goldberg,  and a freelancer writer living in D.C.  Jack  is on Twitter at @<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackbutler4815\">jackbutler4815</a></u>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Jack’s Music Pick: The Electric Light Orchestra</span></strong>:<strong><br />\n</strong>What began as a dream of Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne to fuse modern pop songs with classical touches became a hit-making machine through the mid-to-late-1970s and early-1980s. Wood left after album number one, leaving the creative direction to Lynne alone. And direct he did! From the prog-rock stylings of ELO II to the full-on, sugar-sweet, pristine production on OUT OF THE BLUE, to the synth-driven concept album TIME, ELO managed to sell more than 50 million albums in little more than a decade. The music has been used endlessly in the past 20 years in movie trailers and commercials, keeping the band in the public view. Heck, we also make time to discuss Lynne’s turn as “producer to the stars” in the 80s and 90s. Rev up the technicolor spaceship and set your vocoder to “high” — it’s time to dive in to ELO!</p>\n",
