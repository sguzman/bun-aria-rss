  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? \n\nRare performances from CS + Kreme, Maria Moles and efp will reignite our Ritual Community Music series for 2022. Circling bodies, hallucinatory sounds and luxury systems will take place at the Meat Market Pavilion on the 11th of February.\n\nefp is the performance moniker of Yuin artist and musician E Fishpool, whose highly crafted compositions are at once intensely expressive and also beautifully open-ended in their abstraction. Grounded in First Nations oral and sonic pedagogies, and the unbreakable obligation to listen to land and Country, efp’s work communicates across many layers, inviting the listener into complex worlds of sound and knowledge. Ahead of their performance for Liquid Architecture, efp talks through their process of collecting sound, finding rhythm within themself and their environment, and what to expect from their live performance. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/artists/efp\n\nRitual Community Music \n11 February 2022\nMeat Market, North Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
