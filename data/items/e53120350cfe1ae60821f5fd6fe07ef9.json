  "description": "When I looked up the synonyms of “a peacemaker,” it states “a diplomat, an arbitrator, a mediator, a calmer, a soother, a go-between.” It reads like the characteristics of Jesus, doesn’t it? It’s the attitude that He walked in while He was on this earth. He made peace for us so that we can make peace for others. We can be reconcilers of peace. We have to walk with the heart of a peacemaker.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
