  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the Roadhawks are back in Indianapolis after a week on the road leading up to Wrestlemania at MetLife Stadium in the shadows of New York City. They chat about the NCAA championship as they record right after the game finishes, and the guys all approve of the way things finished. Pat also chats about his week with the WWE from the NXT Preshow to NXT Takeover all the way up to his spots on the Wrestlemania Preshow and the Wrestlemania Watch Along. The Roadhawks also retell the now legendary story of their nest being absolutely obliterated by an awning at MetLife Stadium, and how each of them nearly lost their lives, and the aftermath that followed. The guys also dive into the recent comments made about Aaron Rodgers by some of his former teammates, the developing feud between Antonio Brown and Ju-Ju Smith Schuster, and they look ahead to the NHL and NBA playoffs and the Masters, as well as the Game of Thrones premiere, which Pat nearly found himself attending at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. This is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers</p>\n",
