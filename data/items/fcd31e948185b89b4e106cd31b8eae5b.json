Why is President Donald Trump going to court and why are people saying Joe Biden might not be president? What is the Electoral College and why do we still have it; why haven’t we changed to a popular vote? How does the president talk to the people without being on the news?</p>\n\n<p>Helping us answer these questions is political reporter Ayesha Rascoe, who covers the White House for NPR.
