  "description": "<p>In today’s episode, Bishop Barron fields questions from people all over the world, including:</p> <ul> <li>How do we reconcile love as willing the good of the other with more exclusive love, such as the love between a husband and wife?</li> <li>Some Protestant theologians say that John 6 is not talking about transubstantiation because this dialogue took place before the institution of the Eucharist. What do you think?</li> <li>What does the Catholic Church say about predestination and free will?</li> <li>Why does God need to be worshipped and glorified, and need sacrifices? On human terms, this sounds like his love is conditional and he is insecure.</li> <li>Can dogma be changed or overthrown?</li> <li>Was Jesus a socialist?</li> <li>What are the essential qualities/qualifications needed for evangelism? Degrees or degree program recommendations?</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
