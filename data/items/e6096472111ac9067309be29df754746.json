The <a href=\"https://www.gaymerconnect.com/\">GaymerX event</a> is meant to be inclusive of all people, but especially those harassed, marginalized, or ridiculed in mainstream gaming. The first GaymerX took place August 2013; the next happens in July. We talk about what it's like to help a community be part of birthing a new convention.</p>\n\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://lynda.com/tnd\">lynda.com</a>: Over 2,000 high-quality and engaging video courses taught by industry experts — with new courses added daily.
