  "description": "This week host Rumaan Alam talks to Javier Zamora about the truth-telling power of poetry. When Javier was 9 years old, he traveled to the U.S. from El Salvador without his parents. In his book of poems, Unaccompanied, Javier tries to make sense of his own experience and the experiences of his parents, who left El Salvador before him. In the interview, Javier describes the personal and political goals of his poetry and explains what it took for him to turn poetry into a career. \nAfter the interview, Rumaan and co-host Isaac Butler discuss whether they think all art is political. \nIn the exclusive Slate Plus segment, Javier recommends some poets to check out and explains why he thinks so many people are intimidated by poetry. \nSend your questions about creativity and any other feedback to working@slate.com or give us a call at (304) 933-WORK.
