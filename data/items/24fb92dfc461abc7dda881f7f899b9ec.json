A legend! Acting adjustments? He'll give them! (To Matt, on the set of I Love That For You.) So much importance is discussed such as the Be Real phenomenon, the illustrious work of Nancy Meyers (it IS complicated), how to elevate classic tropes on TV, the joy of retail therapy, the blegh-ness of QR code menus, Top Gun Maverick, and much more! And we must especially highlight the grandness of the Titanic and of course the the machinery involved in the sinking of Titanic!!&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
