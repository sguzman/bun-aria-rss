  "description": "<p>Mindfulness and meditation aren’t just about spirituality or stress relief.</p> <p>In today’s world of constant demands and digital distractions, mindfulness is about making your moments truly matter and living up to your full potential. It’s about your power to put your attention where you want it to be and not on what someone else dangles on a screen in front of you.</p> <p>This is just one reason why Tony Robbins incorporates a gratitude meditation into his daily morning routine to prime his mind every single day.</p> <p>If you’re familiar with any of Tony Robbins peak performance strategies, you know that your ability to maintain a <strong>peak state</strong> is a key component of living the life you desire. Your state is affected by the way you use <strong>your physical body</strong>, your ability to direct <strong>your mind’s focus</strong>, and the <strong>language or meaning</strong> you give to your experiences.</p> <p>Knowing this, it’s no wonder that we aren’t able to be the best version of ourselves when we are in a stressed state. The incoherence of our head and heart, the jitters in our nervous system and body makes us less effective and less resourceful.</p> <p>In this 1-hour episode you’ll hear from Tony Robbins, his wife Sage Robbins, and podcast host Mary B. as they discuss one of the most valuable skills to maximize your mindset and prime yourself for power, clarity, concentration, and focused attention.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>SHOW NOTES</strong></p> <p>[0:00] Hi it’s Tony Robbins…</p> <p>[1:15] I used to think meditation was a waste of time</p> <p>[2:00] We don’t experience life, we experience the life we pay attention to</p> <p>[2:39] Tony and wife Sage and traveled the globe together for 22 years</p> <p>[3:30] A podcast on meditation?
