  "description": "Watch the video version of this podcast: https://youtu.be/kzBU9gEHx_M\nCheck out our Online Storytelling Course: https://moment.8ocm68.net/keM6z\nEric Decker aka Airrack started uploading to YouTube in January 2020. He started this year with 50 YouTube subscribers and today he has over 500,000. He’s had explosive growth this year and his mission is to get to 1M youtube subscribers - in order to get there he’s had to do some pretty crazy things including taking out a $17,000 loan to pay for one video. He’s one of the most committed creators we’ve come across and we definitely feel like he has what it takes to get to 1M subs and probably even further than that - and once you hear this episode I think you’ll agree with us on that as well. If you aren’t familiar with his videos, just type in Airrack on YouTube, I’d recommend that you watch his Couch series, that’ll give you a pretty good understanding of who he is.",
