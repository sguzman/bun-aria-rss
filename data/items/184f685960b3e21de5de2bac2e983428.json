  "description": "<p>Soccer Stars Toni Pressley and Ali Riley are back with a new episode of their cooking series- Girls Gone Veg and this is one you don't want to miss!<br /><br />Joining the ladies this week, is one of their male counterparts, Orlando City's defensive midfielder, Uri Rosell. The Spanish footballer is not only a rockstar on the field, but proves to be one in the kitchen too! Sharing a passion for food, Uri is excited to learn from Toni and Ali as cooking is something the soccer stud explored during quarantine. <br /><br />Being athletes who rely on endurance, fueling up on carbs is sometimes the best approach to keeping their energy at a premium. The ladies introduce Uri to their version of the infamous TikTok Pasta but vegan style and much too his surprise, he doesn't even realize it's vegan. <br /><br />Breaking it down and having a little fun while they prep, Uri impresses Toni and Ali with his percussion skills, using pots and pans to create a fun vibe in the kitchen. Dancing around the stove, Toni and Ali create a playful environment which continues as the ladies gather around the table to enjoy their finished product. As the trio sit to enjoy the meal,  Ali comments on how much she loves noods while Toni breaks out into laughter because it catches Uri off guard not realizing they are referring to the pasta!  The nood conversation continues as the ladies share some funny 'nood' innuendos.<br /><br />Girls Gone Veg is a limited eight part series releasing a new episode every Friday at Noon eastern on the I Am Athlete Channel. </p>\n",
