  "description": "When Christopher Werth saw some paint chips falling off a radiator in his daughter’s New York City classroom, he picked one up and sent it to get tested. The results spurred him to launch a larger investigation into lead exposure in New York City classrooms.\nJust across the river in Newark, New Jersey, another city is dealing with its own lead troubles.

And what can be done about it?\nGuest: Christopher Werth, Senior Editor at WNYC\nSlate Plus members get bonus segments and ad-free podcast feeds. Sign up now.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
