First, the guys share some details about Staley's history, as he doesn't have the same pedigree as some of the other coaches out on the market. Based on that, Breech is a bit concerned that this might be a stretch by LA. The Chargers have Justin Herbert and likely will have playoff expectations next season, so Staley enters an attractive situation, but one that's also filled with pressure. \n\n﻿'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
