  "description": "<p><strong>Dexter</strong> and <strong>Byron Peart</strong> are the founders of Goodee—an e-commerce site focused on design products and home goods with an ethical mission. The Pearts are twin brothers and lifelong entrepreneurs—they created the renowned fashion and accessories brand WANT Les Essentials before selling it in 2017. For their latest endeavor, they wanted to focus on selling products that are not only beautiful, but good too—and to tap into a growing audience known as the conscious consumer. In this episode of the Business of Home podcast, the Pearts chat with host <strong>Dennis Scully</strong> about whether the mission or the design comes first, how the coronavirus has changed online shopping, and what makes a product good enough for Goodee. <i>This episode is sponsored by Buildlane and The Urban Electric Company.</i></p>\n",
