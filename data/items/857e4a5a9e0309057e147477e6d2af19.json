The creature this week is the only one who could resist those sinful apple slices...and it gets rewarded by being set on fire. -- Sponsors: Get $20 off your subscription to Storyworth at https://storyworth.com/legends With Kindle Unlimited, you can get two months of access to over a million books for just 99 cents by going to https://amazon.com/legends -- Music: \"Guild Rat\" by Blue Dot Sessions \"Betty Dear\" by Blue Dot Sessions \"One Quiet Conversation\" by Blue Dot Sessions \"Lupi\" by Blue Dot Sessions \"Hickory Shed\" by Blue Dot Sessions \"Tartaruga\" by Blue Dot Sessions<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
