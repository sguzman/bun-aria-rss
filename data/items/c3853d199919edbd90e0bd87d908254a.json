Her neighbours circled like wolves and, within two months, Frederick the Great had seized one of her most prized lands, Silesia, exploiting her vulnerability.  Yet over the next forty years through political reforms, alliances and marriages, she built Austria up into a formidable power, and she would do whatever it took to save the souls of her Catholic subjects, with a rigidity and intolerance that Joseph II, her son and heir, could not wait to challenge. \n\nWith\n\nCatriona Seth\nMarshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford\n\nMartyn Rady\nProfessor of Central European History at University College London\n\nAnd\n\nThomas Biskup\nLecturer in Early Modern History at the University of Hull\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
