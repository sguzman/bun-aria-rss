  "description": "This episode features Annie Duke, former pro poker player and author of the book Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts. Julia and Annie debate why people tend to ignore the role of luck in their decisions, whether expressing uncertainty makes you seem weak, and how people end up engaging in \"defensive decision-making,\" where they're not trying to make the best call so much as simply avoid being blamed for bad outcomes.",
