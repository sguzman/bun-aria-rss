  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin show, the economist Milton Friedman shows us that only the government can create inflation. This is why the government should not be in the business of ruining our economy; we must nip this in the bud now. Then, Doctors Birx and Fauci concede that the inflated death rates they initially cited were inflated due to the data they had and that they expect the actual death rate to be much lower. Later. where is the guidance for states that are going under due to the severe economic impact? Won't a broken economy break our healthcare system? When will we allow American small businesses to do what they do best and unchain the free market? Afterward, Glenn Beck joins the show to explain that Washington needs to wake up before fascism creeps into Congress. The federal government's socialistic approach to the coronavirus is similar to a catastrophic example from his new book \"Arguing with Socialists.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
