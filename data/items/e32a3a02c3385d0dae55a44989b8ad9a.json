  "description": "Cossacks in Jamaica, Ukraine at the Antipodes: Essays in honor of Marko Pavlyshyn (Academic Studies Press, 2020) is an impressive volume of essays on a variety of topics and issues pertaining to Ukraine and Ukrainian studies. The volume is compiled to honor the contribution of Marko Pavlyshyn to the development and establishment of Ukrainian studies in Australia, as well as across the globe. The diversity of the book, on the one hand, is a metaphor of Marko Pavlyshyn’s work and research that covers a myriad of specific topics, which, however, contribute to the multidirectional study of Ukraine. On the other hand, a number of essays of the volume interact with the representation of Ukraine on both local and global levels. In this regard, the bilingualism of the project is rather eloquent: not only does it introduce Anglophone readers to Ukraine, it also opens up the Anglophone community to Ukrainian voices. Cossacks in Jamaica, Ukraine at the Antipodes is a monumental academic project that helps outline the perception of Ukraine from multiple interdisciplinary angles. At the same time, the book is a significant educational endeavor that facilitates the establishment of inter-and trans-national dialogues.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
