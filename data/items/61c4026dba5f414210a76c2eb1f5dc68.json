What if it could fill you with meaning, purpose, and excitement like you're fully accessing and expressing all parts of yourself and stepping into your fullest potential? Like you're doing the thing you're here to do. We call this state being \"sparked.\" The first step isn't about big, painful or disruptive change. It's about knowing yourself better, discovering your unique imprint for work that makes you come alive - your Sparketype®.</p><p>In today's episode, we're taking you deep into the world of the Sparketypes and exploring how to discover yours, then tap it to reimagine and redesign the way you contribute to the world, whether it's the thing you get paid for, the thing you do because you're called to it, the thing you do on the side or some blend, on a quest to get as close as you can, or at least a lot closer than you are now, to this feeling of aliveness.</p><p>Also - today is the third and final installment in our 3-episode Good Life Launch Pack. The first one - To Succeed at Anything, Do This (Jan 2 episode) - focused on accomplishing big things. The second - How to Live a Good Life (Jan 9 episode) - well that's kinda self-explanatory. And, today, it's all about sparking your work. Be sure to download them and listen to all three, they work together in a sort of force-multiplier way to help set up this year as your best ever. After this week, we’ll deliver you back into our twice-weekly conversations with awesome humans.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
