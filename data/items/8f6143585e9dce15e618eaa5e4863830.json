  "description": "There are assholes everywhere you look these days, especially in positions of power.  The result is high assholery in our policies and our political debates which, frankly, is not only not good for us but it’s kind of hard to take.  When do we finally call an asshole an asshole and make sure the arc of history bends away from them.  Far away. On this episode of Deep State Radio Ed Luce of the Financial Times, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University and David Rothkopf of an undisclosed location join in and look for answers…or just a tiny hint of sanity.
