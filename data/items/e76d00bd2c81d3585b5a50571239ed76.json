  "description": "Women represent private parties in civil litigation just 18.5% of the time in New York according to a New York State Bar Association report released earlier this month. Judge Shira Scheindlin backed up those findings during a recent podcast recording: “what I witnessed in the courtroom was a great gender disparity in privately retained counsel.”\n\nJudge Scheindlin, a former Federal District Court Judge, was one of the members of the task force that prepared the report. Last week she also published, “Female Lawyers Can Talk, Too” an op-ed about the report that ran in The New York Times and clearly struck a nerve; it received 274 comments before the Times closed commenting.\n\nEarlier this week, Josh Block travelled to Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, the law firm where Scheindlin is Of Counsel, to record this podcast interview with her about the report, her own career experiences, and her thoughts about the continued disparity and gender imbalance in big law.\n\nBig Law Business \nhttps://bol.bna.com/\n\nSubscribe to the Big Law Business podcast on iTunes.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/big-law-business/id1074067483?mt=2\n\nPodcast Sponsors\n\nDMX\nhttp://www.epiqsystems.com/how-we-help/ediscovery/project-based-ediscovery/dmx-demo\n\nBloomberg Law\nhttps://www.bloomberglaw.com\n\nShow Notes\n\nIf Not Now, When?
