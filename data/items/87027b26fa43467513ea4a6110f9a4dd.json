    "media:description": "Let's introduce the remarkable connection that the ancient Greeks, in the school of Pythagoras, discovered between ratios or proportions between small natural numbers and pleasant sounding harmonic intervals.\n\nThe relation is perhaps best introduced by discussing notes on a guitar string, and applying some affine geometry (not metrical, or Euclidean!)\n\nHowever we need to realize that all is not quite so pleasant mathematically as the Pythagoreans would have liked, as such a tuning system ends up having some inconsistencies when we try to translate from one key to another. This is an obstacle that generated a huge amount of analysis in the history of Western music -- and we will be discussing this in our next video.\n\nThis video is one in a series where we look at the foundations of music from a mathematical point of view, and is complemented by my Tik Tok channel www.tiktok.com/@njwildberger .\n\n***********************\nHere are all the Insights into Mathematics Playlists:\n\nElementary Mathematics (K-6) Explained: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PL8403C2F0C89B1333\nYear 9 Maths:   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CcGpZpO542YLPeDIf1jqXK\nAncient Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Aqe2b4FBWUGJdYROT6-o4e\nWild West Banking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DB7CzoFWvA920NES3g8tJH\nSociology and Pure Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85A-qCypcmZqRvaS1pGXpTua\nOld Babylonian Mathematics (with Daniel Mansfield): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\nMath History: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316\nWild Trig: Intro to Rational Trigonometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C58498718451C47\nMathFoundations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB\nWild Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85BhzJ-oWNug1YtUjfWp1qAp\nFamous Math Problems: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Bfc-S4WHvTIM7E-ir3nAOf\nProbability and Statistics: An Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse\nBoole's Logic and Circuit Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CnIGIWb7tH1F_S2PyOC8rb\nUniversal Hyperbolic Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CN9oJ4gYkuSQQhAtpIucuI\nDifferential Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DWUiFYYGqJVtfnkUFWkKtP\nAlgebraic Topology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6763F57A61FE6FE8\nMath Seminars: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF39AFBBC3FB30AF\n************************\n\nAnd here are the Wild Egg Maths Playlists: (YES -- you can become a Member of this channel and access dozens of extra videos!)\n\nSolving Polynomial Equations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz7hk_Kzj4zDF_kUXBCtiGn6\nExceptional Structures in Maths and Physics via Dynamics on Graphs\" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5HBT_Yo1G4DfeqUfI9zkKM\nTriangle Centres: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBGXDSUohM&list=PLzdiPTrEWyz6VcJQ5xcuqY6g4DWjvpmjM\nSix: An elementary course in pure mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4KD007Ge10dfrDVc4YwlYS\nAlgebraic Calculus One: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB\nAlgebraic Calculus Two: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5VLVr-0LPPgm4T1mtU_DG-",
