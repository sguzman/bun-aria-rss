  "description": "<p>Chris Harrison, the longtime host of ABC's The Bachelor, is taking a leave of absence, likely to become permanent, after saying he thinks a contestant who once attended an \"antebellum\" themed party should be treated with grace and compassion, rather than having her parents targeted. Kirk has several bones to pick with various Minifans, but Steve fucks up the entire segment (0:21:20). Former friend of the show DEC defends his \"misremembering\" an exchange with Kirk (0:24:30). Kirk's old producers are shaking up with WEEI weekend lineup, but for some reason they don't want to talk to any minifans (0:40:30). Parody songs are back, including the ones Steve wouldn't play in the past (1:05:00). Gov. Andrew Cuomo, once celebrated as the greatest politician in America, is now skating free following the revelation that he lied for months about the COVID-19 death toll in New York (1:36:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
