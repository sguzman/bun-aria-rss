  "description": "<p>What is the best way to pay down debt? Americans are in tremendous amounts of debt (think over 400 billion on just credit cards alone)! Not only is this debt keeping folks from reaching their financial goals, but it’s also taking a toll on the mental health of borrowers. Knowing the best strategy to get out of this debt is a big deal and could be the difference between living paycheck to paycheck or achieving financial freedom. Listen as we cover both approaches so you can decide which is better for you: the debt snowball (popularized by Dave Ramsey) and the debt avalanche (also known as debt stacking).</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Maple Vanilla Copra Kai by Southern Grist Brewing which you can find on Untappd. Another big thanks to Jamie and friends up there in Nashville for donating these beers to the show!
