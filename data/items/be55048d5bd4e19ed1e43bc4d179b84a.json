  "title": "And Our Heart Goes to...Oscar Isaac!",
  "description": "We’re back, thirst-buckets! And we're starting our new season off with a sultry bang – it's the internet's boyfriend, Oscar Isaac! Whether you know him as Llewyn Davis, Star Wars' Poe Dameron, or from a thumb-licking reaction gif (!), you can’t take your eyes off him, and neither can we. Join us as we discuss Oscar’s career trajectory, how he navigates Hollywood as a Latinx, how he manages to look great with curls, shaven-headed, bestubbled, clean-shaven or full-bearded (like, is he a wizard?), and of course, those eyebrows! As usual, we have a couple of drabbles featuring Oscar in Fanfic Wars, and they're...intimate. *eyes emoji* Hit play now!\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
