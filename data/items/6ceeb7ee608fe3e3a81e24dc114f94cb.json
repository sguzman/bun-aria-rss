  "description": "<p>CHANGE STARTS WITH YOU.</p><p>Most of us have faced one big failure so far in our lives. A huge rock bottom. A super hard time. But Dhar Mann has faced 3 massive failures and he's only in his mid-30s. </p><p>I knew about Dhar years ago, when he was a mega-successful Instagram influencer living the life. Or so it seemed. </p><p>Dhar Mann is a serial entrepreneur who has experienced the highs and lows of success. From funding millions of dollars in real estate loans at 19, to his time in the medical marijuana industry, to scaling an eight-figure cosmetics business, he has a proven ability to build companies. Most recently he has become the fastest growing viral video creator in less than one year with over 3 billion views across Facebook, IGTV, and YouTube.</p><p>Recently, I became friends with Dhar in real life and was blown away by his story of shallow success, failure, rock bottom, reinvention, and true success today. </p><p>After disappearing from social media for 4 years, losing everything, including his reputation, and getting into legal trouble, Dhar has reappeared as a new man. I loved hearing him tell his full story, for the first time publicly, and the wisdom he has learned from losing everything to building it back the right way. I'm excited for you to hear this story yourself in Episode 898 with Dhar Mann.</p><ul><li>What was the final thing that made you pull away from social media for 4 years?
