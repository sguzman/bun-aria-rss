  "description": "This was posted on the Twitter Engineering blog a few days ago: Dimension Independent Similarity Computation (DISCO)\nI just glanced at the paper, and there's some cool stuff going on from a theoretical perspective. What I'm curious about is why they didn't decide to use dimensionality reduction to solve such a big problem."
