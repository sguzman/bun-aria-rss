  "description": "Hello, I am your host Aun Abdi and welcome to the monthly One Minute Book Review podcast, where I break down in more detail the books that I have read and reviewed in the previous month. \n\nIn this months episode, I will be discussing Deep Work by Cal Newport. This month was a hectic month outside my One Minute Book Review channel. Work and family pressures meant that only one book was reviewed last month. Many more books were read I am hoping I have the time this month in May to catch up on the reviews.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
