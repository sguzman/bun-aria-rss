  "description": "The Psalmist said in Psalm 56:9, “The moment you pray, the tide of the battle turns.” In the unseen realm, God begins to change things in your favor the moment you pray. But many times, when we’ve been praying for a long time for something, and don’t see anything happening in the natural, it can seem like God went on vacation and our prayers aren’t doing any good. Joel wants to show you that even when you can’t see behind the scenes, God is at work. He not only heard you when you prayed, but He took it one step further; He put the miracle in motion.Just because you don’t see anything happening doesn’t mean the answer is not on the way. The people that see breakthroughs and promises fulfilled are the people that keep praying, keep believing and keep standing in faith. This message will inspire and equip you to be one of those people!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
