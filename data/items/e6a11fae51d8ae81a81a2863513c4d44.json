  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. There is no attack on the free press, the attack is on fake news. Many in the media are liars and propagandists. President Trump has not arrested any members of the media like Abraham Lincoln did, nor has he used the FBI against the media like Barack Obama did. The left repeatedly tries to stop the likes of Fox News and Conservative talk radio through legislation because they can’t beat them in ratings. Also, the attacks against Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis are Alinsky tactics. His opponent Andrew Gillum cannot win if he comes out and exposes his socialism, so he calls DeSantis a racist. The more radical, the more Left the Democrat Party and its candidates are and become, the more they try to run their campaigns not on their radical ideology but on character assassination. They don’t want to run on socialism, they want to run on racism. Later, the media is hiding behind a false crusade for freedom of the press when they’re really just using that as an excuse to generate phony controversies about President Trump. The left and the right agree that Omarosa is known to be unreliable and the media wonder why we don’t take them seriously when they push her or Stormy Daniels. Omarosa’s book is a pseudo event but its driving the news and it’s not news. The press is interested in promoting their own agenda.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
