  "description": "This week, global financial expert and U.S. Gold Corp. CEO Ed Karr joins me again live from Italy to discuss the current state of the markets and the coronavirus.

In today’s education segment, I break down why there’s still a lot of risk—and opportunity—in today’s market, and explain the key metrics to focus on when investing in growth companies.
