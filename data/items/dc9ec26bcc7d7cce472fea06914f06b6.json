  "title": "A Birmingham Story by Ryan Sinclair",
  "description": "A Birmingham Story is a short narrative about some of the emotions that we face as humans at specific points in our lives. The feelings explored include trust, jealousy, anger and depression. It follows three characters, with differing circumstances, yet they have more in common than they initially thought. An argument eventually ceases their disagreement to shed light on how differing perspectives on the same situation causes misunderstandings more often than not. I have not read anything similar to this before. But, that does not take away from how much I connected with it. The themes addressed in the story do not get discussed openly enough, but the author does an excellent job telling his story while also explaining how these emotions have affected the characters. I can see the benefit of stories such as this as a medium for more discussion on mental health. This was a good read; I rate it three stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
