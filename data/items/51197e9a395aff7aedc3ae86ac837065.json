    "media:description": "What on Earth happened to the Circassians? The Caucasus is an interesting region with a load of many diverse and unique peoples such as the Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, but what about the groups that you probably haven't heard of? Thousands of years before the present day, different peoples inhabited parts of Europe and the Near East who, linguistically-speaking, are entirely unrelated to the groups we see there today. The Circassians are an example of such an ancient people.\n\nIn today's video we're going to be looking at the history and culture of the Circassians and some of the surrounding Caucasian natives like the Abkhaz, Chechens, Ingush and Dagestanis. Thanks for watching!\n\nSources:\nhttp://circassianidentity.blogspot.com/p/circassians-today.html\nhttps://abkhazworld.com/aw/abkhazians/culture \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Circassian\nhttps://www.circassianworld.com/circassians/who-are-they/1125-history-of-circassians",
