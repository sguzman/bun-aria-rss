  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Back in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas hearings Joe Biden stated that the FBI can not make conclusive nomination recommendations as part of their report in reference to Supreme Court hearings. Why did the media and Democrats refuse to bring this up? Either the media doesn't know how to do their job or they chose not to do their job in their reporting. They have large research operations. How did they miss this? Unless they wanted to or decided not to look. These people are un-American. It seems the FBI didn’t matter back then but now it’s worth everything to the Democrats today. Also, Biden went on to tell Judge Thomas in 1991 that the presumption of innocence belongs to the accused. Later, President Trump's spectacular speech at the United Nations in which he criticized Iran and the Obama-era nuclear deal. Finally, Texas Congressional Candidate Chip Roy callis in to give his thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh and the left mob that surrounded Ted and Heidi Cruz.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
