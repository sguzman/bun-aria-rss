  "description": "<div>Nineteen eighty was going to be Dorothy Stratten’s year. <br>\n<br>\nPlayboy’s Hugh Hefner thought it might even be her decade. She was just 20 years old, the girl next door with the shy smile and whispery voice who didn’t know her own beauty. But who was Dorothy really? And how did her rise to fame ultimately lead to her death? <br>\n<br>\nThis is a six-part series about love, sex and murder in 1970s Hollywood when glitter pants and roller skates were all the rage, and the Playboy mansion hosted the biggest party in town. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Listen today at <a href=\"http://wondery.fm/Starlet_UKTCcast\">http://wondery.fm/Starlet_UKTCcast</a> </strong>\n</div>\n",
