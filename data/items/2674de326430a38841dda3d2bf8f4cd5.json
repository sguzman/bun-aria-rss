    "media:description": "DARWIN CA OCTOBER 26, 2022 - Darwin resident Kathy Goss stands under the Darwin Stone Circle, a space created by Hal Newell in honor of his father, sculpture Gordon Newell. A steel canopy with a 48-foot diameter, is supported by 12 black dolomite boulders. Goss, who has lived in Darwin for more than 20 years, hopes the new district will give her town more support than the old one, which had included San Bernardino. \"We're still citizens of this district,\" she said. \"We're part of the tourist economy.\" (Thomas Curwen/Los Angeles Times)",
