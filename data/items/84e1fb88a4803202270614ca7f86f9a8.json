Becker<br/>\n     <b>category:</b>  Relativity and Cosmology<br/>\n     <b>type:</b>      submission<br/>\n     <b>date:</b>      2022-11-05 02:07:27 <br/>\n     <b>abstract:</b>  \nSeveral theoretical equations are derived which determine the vacuum permittivity, vacuum permeability, free impedance and speed of light to a highly convergent value on the order of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$. Their dependence is related to the particle horizon, Hubble horizon, Planck length, proton wavelength and the fine structure constant. Due to these highly convergent equations, an image of both the photon and the vacuum may start to emerge.\n  \n   "
