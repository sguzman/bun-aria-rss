  "description": "In the 2012 presidential race two major issues are ever present but never mentioned: Mormonism and homosexuality. According to opinion polls, a significant number of Americans either won’t vote or are wary of voting for a Mormon. Likewise, though opinions are rapidly changing a large plurality or slight majority (depending upon the poll you consult) of Americans oppose gay marriage.\n\nCraig Harline boldly takes on both controversial issues in his new book,  Conversions: Two Family Stories from the Reformation and Modern America (Yale University Press, 2011). Written in an innovative and accessible fashion, Conversions delves into both issues and discusses them in a subtle yet profound manner. In an age where partisans tune into the cable news show that best jibes with their pre-conceived notions Harline’s work is most welcome. Do yourself a favor, listen to our discussion and go out and buy the book.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
