Anthony Brown, (D-Maryland), Vice Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, with a distinguished military career behind him, joins our regulars to discuss how the military is responding to major challenges before it, from its need to address major diversity problems in its ranks to the current movement to rename military bases currently bearing the names of the Confederate leaders to the expanding Russian bounty scandal in Afghanistan. Brown has led the way on helping the military address its diversity needs--including promoting more women and people of color to being generals or admirals and reducing discrimination and mistreatment in the military justice system. He also states clearly on this podcast that if Trump were a military leader his dereliction of duty on the Afghan bounty matter would lead to his court-martial. Don't miss this discussion also featuring our regulars Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Edward Luce of the Financial Times.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
