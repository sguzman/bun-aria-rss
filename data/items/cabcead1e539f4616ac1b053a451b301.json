  "description": "In The Meritocracy Trap, Daniel Markovits argues that meritocracy — a system set-up to expand opportunity, reduce inequality and end aristocracy — has become exactly what it was set up to combat: a mechanism for intergenerational wealth transfer that leaves everyone worse off in the process.\nMarkovits isn’t only challenging a system; he is challenging the system that I (and probably most of you) have been part of for our entire lives. For better or worse, Meritocracy is the water we swim in. We implicitly accept its values, practices, arguments, and assumptions because they govern our everyday lives.\nThis interview was a chance for me to exit the water. Maybe it will be for you as well.\nBook recommendations: \nThe Rise of the Meritocracy by Michael Young\nThe Race between Education and Technology by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz\n\"Technical Change, Inequality, and The Labor Market\" (article) by Daron Acemoglu\nWant to contact the show? Reach out at ezrakleinshow@vox.com\nNews comes at you fast.
