  "description": "This week, it is the insane original story behind the popular holiday ballet. In this story for children, we'll get some contradictory lessons for the kids. Getting into a van with a stranger offering candy? Bad. Getting into a silver carriage with a man offering a whole magical world full of candy? Awesome (not really - seriously, kids don't do that). In a podcast full of problematic and wildly different original tellings of popular adaptations, this might be the most different and most problematic. The creature this week is a haggard old woman who travels from town to town letting kids know if they're on the naughty list...using her knife and a bag full of garbage. -- Sponsors: Get 25% off PLUS a free camera by going to http://simplisafe.com/legends.
