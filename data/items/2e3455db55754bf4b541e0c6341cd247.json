  "description": "At 15:45 UTC on July 22, 2021, a software configuration update triggered a bug in our Secure Edge Content Delivery Network impacting that network's domain name service (DNS) system (the system that directs browsers to websites for that specific service). This caused a disruption impacting availability of some customer websites. The disruption lasted up to an hour. Upon rolling back the software configuration update, the services resumed normal operations.",
