  "description": "<p>Convex clustering is a modern method with both hierarchical and $k$-means\nclustering characteristics. Although convex clustering can capture the complex\nclustering structure hidden in data, the existing convex clustering algorithms\nare not scalable to large data sets with sample sizes greater than ten\nthousand. Moreover, it is known that convex clustering sometimes fails to\nproduce hierarchical clustering structures. This undesirable phenomenon is\ncalled cluster split and makes it difficult to interpret clustering results. In\nthis paper, we propose convex clustering through majorization-minimization\n(CCMM) -- an iterative algorithm that uses cluster fusions and sparsity to\nenforce a complete cluster hierarchy with reduced memory usage. In the CCMM\nalgorithm, the diagonal majorization technique makes a highly efficient update\nfor each iteration. With a current desktop computer, the CCMM algorithm can\nsolve a single clustering problem featuring over one million objects in\nseven-dimensional space within 70 seconds.\n</p>",
