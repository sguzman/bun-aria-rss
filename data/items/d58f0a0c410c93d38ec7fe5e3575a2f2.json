  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Bucs and Giants, how the Bucs seem to be out of their slump, the Giants being awful, firing Jason Garrett, and what happens next with Joe Judge, Daniel Jones, and all the fallout from that game. Joining the program as he does every Tuesday is the reigning NFL MVP, Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about the tough loss in Minnesota and why he feels good about where the offense is going, what's going on with his toe injury as it's been reported that it's more painful than turf toe, he gives a lesson on playing football as a Quarterback in the NFL, discusses some of the toughest environments he's played in, and much more (25:17-1:07:37). Next, last year's NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, LA Chargers Quarterback and friend of the show, Justin Herbert joins the program. Pat and Justin discuss his development as a QB coming off a huge Sunday Night win over the Steelers where he absolutely showed out, how things have changed for him this year, what he attributes his continued success to, playing in SoFi Stadium, and more (1:07:39-1:24:53).
