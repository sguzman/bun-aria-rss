We take a moment to celebrate and the Ladies answer a few general fan questions. Then, we get into the episode with Andy's return, and we dig into the hilarious scene with Darryl, Michael and the baler. Finally, the ladies explain a Netflix old tech alert, Kentapedia (Kent Zbornak) gives us some good info about the watermelons on the roof scene, and yes, Creed did bite into that potato. </p>\n<p>We briefly mention depression in this episode, and we don't take it lightly.
