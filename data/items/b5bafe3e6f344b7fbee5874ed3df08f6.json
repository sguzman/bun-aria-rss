    "media:description": "While we have been naming some of the operations on vectors after operations on numbers, how far do these similarities go?  In this video, we go over many of the proofs of algebraic properties of vectors, showing that they do act in a similar way to numbers.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
