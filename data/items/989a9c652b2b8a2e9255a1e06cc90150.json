And we plan on working closely with developers over time to build a rich ecosystem of experiences that leverage Meta Quest Pro’s innovative mixed reality and social presence capabilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meta Quest Pro is available today for $1,499.99 USD.

You can see your real desk and use your physical keyboard and mouse. When you need to explain something to your team, you stand up and sketch it out on a giant virtual whiteboard for all to see. As you draw, you can see the expressions of understanding on your teammates’ avatars’ faces. That’s possible on Meta Quest Pro in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Horizon Workrooms</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> thanks to the headset’s full-color Passthrough, eye tracking and Natural Facial Expressions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or imagine channeling your inner Picasso. You’re in VR, experimenting with different painting styles, colors, and brushes, and each time you finish a picture, you hang the virtual art on the wall of your living room. And it stays in that exact spot so that whenever you put your headset on, it’s there for you to enjoy. You can even invite friends from across the world to visit your virtual art studio. That’s possible because of Meta Quest Pro’s color Passthrough and shared spatial anchors features, using an app called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Painting VR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you log into your new headset or access the Meta Quest mobile app, you&#8217;ll be able to find these titles on the Meta Quest Store. You&#8217;ll also find curated collections of mixed reality content, productivity apps that bring your workplace to life, apps and games that feature hand tracking and leverage social presence, and much more.

We know the Meta Quest community has asked for new ways to capture and share their awesome mixed reality experiences with this new device, so we’ll be adding recording and casting for MR in a future software update. </span></p>\n<h2>Ideal For the Future of Work</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meta Quest Pro was designed to support a wide range of collaboration and productivity tools that let you overlay your work on top of the physical world and give you a vast virtual space for multitasking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s ideal for builders, architects, engineers, designers, and others who want to augment their workflow and supercharge their creativity.
