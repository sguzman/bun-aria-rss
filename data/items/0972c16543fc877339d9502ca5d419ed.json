  "title": "Ron Fein, “The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump” (Melville House, 2018)",
  "description": "Is there a case for the impeachment of Donald Trump? Constitutional attorney Ron Fein says not only is there a case, but also that the case exists regardless of what happens with the special counsel investigation. The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump (Melville House, 2018), co-authored by Fein and two of his legal colleagues at Free Speech for People, articulates the grounds for at least eight articles of impeachment, most of which are unrelated to the allegations of a election conspiracy with Russian officials. They argue Trump has violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign governments through his Washington, DC hotel, using government agencies to pushing political enemies, undermining a free press and abusing the power to pardon. The book argues that political considerations for 2018 and 2020 should be set aside, and that the impeachment process should begin immediately strictly on constitutional grounds.\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine.
