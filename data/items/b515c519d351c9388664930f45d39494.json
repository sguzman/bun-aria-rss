    "media:description": "In a connected, global world there are a surprising number of problems with formatting text for our users. Did you know how many different ways there are to format a number? Or pluralise a noun? Or display a date? And let's not get into doing time zone maths for those dates. Internationalising an app by hand, and doing it correctly, could be a never-ending, full-time job.\n\nThe Intl namespace is home to the ECMAScript Internationalization API and contains the solutions to many of our formatting problems. In this talk we'll explore the available APIs that can make it easier to build a truly international application.\n\nWith Intl we can build apps that cater to all our users, wherever they are, however they write things down.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcmelbourne.com/",
