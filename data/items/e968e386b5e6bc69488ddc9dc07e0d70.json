  "description": "Restaurant digital menu's have recently relied on QR code enable digital menus consisting of an ugly webpage with the dreaded downloadable PDF link. Worse so, once PDF is downloaded it consists of one giant (zoomed out) image of the menu. While that basic user interface was necessary to ramp up quickly during the restaurant closures, the lazy design experience won't cut it any longer. A great alternative to native apps are hybrid apps (also known as Progressive Web Apps) which have all the functionality of an app but built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On this episode, we sit down with Donald Burns The Restaurant Coach to discuss ways to make a restaurants digital menu not suck, including using video elements and real-time dish ratings.<br /><br />Guest: Donald Burns - The Restaurant Coach<br />The Restaurant Coach Site ➜ <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/RestaurantCoach​<br />Book \"Your Restaurant Sucks\" ➜ <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/RestaurantSucks​<br /><br />Bookkeeping For Your Small Business ➜ <a href=\"https://bench.grsm.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bench.grsm.io</a>/paulbarron8134​<br /><br />#Restaurants​ #Menu​ #Technology​<br />~Your Restaurant's Digital Menu Sucks! w/ Donald Burns~<br />⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺<br /><br />Get the latest restaurant and hospitality insider tips and education on saving your restaurant business in our FREE Virtual Event Platform 🎓 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableVirtual​<br /><br />Subscribe on YouTube ✅ <a href=\"https://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bit.ly</a>/PBNYoutubeSubscribe​<br />Facebook 📱 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableFacebook​<br />Twitter 📱 <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" rel=\"noopener\">http://bit.ly</a>/FoodableTwitter​<br /><br />───────────────────────────<br />Want to start your own virtual event or education series?
