In this day and age where the negative minority is so much louder than those that are actually happy with their lives, we need to take it upon ourselves to spread positive vibes. Everything we're told, everything we're sold, is based on this lie that we all need to be fixed in one way or another and that's just not true. It's time to build on our strengths, focus on our perspective, and bring out in others the positivity that just doesn't get highlighted enough. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. It's time !! </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5303773.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
