  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, credit must be given to the U.S. military and President Trump on taking out ISIS Leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. During the Obama administration, then-president Obama had the exact coordinates for a targeted drone strike on Baghdadi but he refused to authorize the strike due to new rules implemented by the State Department during the Obama years. Yet, the media won't mention any of that, they're just too concerned with criticizing Trump and asking whether or not he told Speaker Nancy Pelosi and why or why not. Even though General Tony Thomas has noted that a previous lead on Baghdadi was leaked to the New York Times and the ISIS chief got away. This is a monster who kidnapped, raped and beheaded American aid-worker Kayla Mueller and countless others and his demise is good for the whole world. Later, the Democrats will do anything they can to impeach Trump from their secret hearings with no due process, to not taking a vote in the inquiry, to vilifying every single thing Trump has done or spoken. Thanks to the pushback of Republican Members, the House will take up a vote on the impeachment inquiry and announce new rules yet again, despite the lack of due process and the damage already done by it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
