    "media:description": "Tossing the iron filings from our magnetic zen garden at one of its magnets to visualize the field lines of magnet force. https://www.curiositybox.com/\n\n\"How do you clean the iron off the magnet?\" Good question. I would say that learning to accept the limits of your will is part of the meditative process.\n\nI would also say that if you remove as much as you can by hand, something sticky can do the rest. The putty included in the box works well. Its adhesion to the filings is stronger than the magnetic force from the magnet. Plus, the putty already contains small iron filings :)\n\n#shorts #slowmotion",
