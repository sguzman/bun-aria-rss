  "description": "<p>In this episode, we climb up, down and all around our evolutionary family tree. When did we branch off from our more ape-like ancestors? And will we evolve one day into a different species altogether? We'll meet a bearded scientist from 160 years ago (no, not Charles Darwin) and eat some sundaes (thanks lactase persistence!). Plus a brand new Moment of Um answers the question: Do insects have the same blood as humans?  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> Calm (calm.com/brainson)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Quip (getquip.com/brainson) </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The podcast Josie and Jonny are Having a Baby With You. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can support Brains On at brainson.org/donate</p>\n",
