  "description": "On this installment of Best Of The Gist, we listen back to an interview from November 25, 2015, which, sadly, is still relevant in the wake of recent mass shootings. Three years before this interview with Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, they experienced a parent’s worst nightmare, when their 17-year-old son was shot while Black Friday shopping with his friends. The HBO documentary 3½ Minutes, Ten Bullets tells the story of how they pursued justice for their son. After that, we listen back to this past Wednesday’s show, in which, Mike calls for a ban on the AR-15.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
