  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about a spyware case connected to Pegasus, a tool that can jailbreak an iPhone (they say) with a single click. Apple issues an out-of-band patch for the three iOS zero-days Pegasus exploits. Shadow Brokers leaks remain under investigation. Phishlabs and TrapX release anti-ransomware tools. Ramnit and Dreambot are after bank accounts (and Dreambot spreads over Tor). NIST has a de-identification standard out for comment. AT&T's Bindu Sundaresan looks at academic networks as students head back to school. Johns Hopkins' Joe Carrigan discusses option for safely backing up your photos. Industry news includes some interesting short-selling. And Russia isn't feeling the love in cyberspace.",
