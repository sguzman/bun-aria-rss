  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Today I begin the show by giving away a list of large-cap, well-managed, and durable companies. I'm talking about proven companies that have been around for decades… and the ones that have a history of increasing their dividend annually. More important, some of the stocks I uncover today are at value prices. Although some might be underperforming, buying them at current levels can prove to be monumental in the long-run. Again, these are stocks that investors can hold onto forever. Switching gears, I answer a question on stop-loss orders. This particular question asks what the difference is between \"Trailing stop-loss percentages\" and \"Trailing stop-limit percentages?\" My answer: It doesn't matter! Today, I explain the importance of \"handing you hand.\" And my favorite third-party tool that doesn't show the market your every move. Then, to end the episode, I'm taking another stock and looking under the hood. It’s a stock that might seem favorable from a glance... but today I point out all the negatives, giving as much analysis as I can. It's why I'm here. Special thanks to Larry, Jose, Chris, Mark, and Jack for all the great questions. Keep ‘em coming at frank@curzioresearch.com",
