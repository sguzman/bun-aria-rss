  "description": "Queue Cassie’s “Me n U” because this week it is just Sofia and the Sloots! That’s actually a good name if we ever decide to start a band. Anyway, Sofia is starting off strong by blindly (literally) explaining why the Venmo Friend, is the WORST friend. Next Sofia unpacks the heavy topic of dating someone struggling with mental illness and the harsh realities of it. Finally, a deep dive into why women RARELY initiate sex and how like everything else in life, it’s not our fault! Notebooks out and CashApps away (unless a man is sending you money), listen up Slooties.\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
