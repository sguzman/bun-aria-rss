  "title": "136 - The Moon Landing Conspiracy",
  "description": "<p>2019 is the 50th anniversary of the moon landing! Yip, yip, yaw! On July 20th, 1969, Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin, two American astronauts, landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on the moon. The Eagle has landed! And then, some six hours later, Neil became the first human to take one giant leap for mankind. And then Buzz followed Neil onto the moon's surface less than twenty minutes later. OR... did none of that ever happen? Did the several Apollo missions that followed NOT put ten other astronauts on the moon? This is what many people believe - that no one ever stepped foot on the moon. Today we examine a variety of moon landing conspiracies and also learn a lot about why landing on the moon was a cultural priority in the first place. And we go over so much more on this lunar-centric edition of Timesuck!</p>\n<p><strong>THE GATHERING 2019</strong> - Tickets go on sale <a href=\"https://timesuck.myshopify.com/\"><strong>HERE</strong></a> April 29th, Noon PST <strong>Only 55 tickets total!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Happy Murder Tour</strong> <strong>Standup</strong> dates:</p>\n<p><strong>April 26th Dallas, Texas</strong> The Texas Theatre <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dan-cummins-the-happy-murder-tour-tickets-53986076809?aff=aff0bandsintown&comeFrom=242&artist_event_id=100627234&appId=wf_qnaphzzvaf.gi\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!</p>\n<p><strong>April 27th Houston, Texas </strong>The Secret Group <a href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1806509/\"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a> for tix!
