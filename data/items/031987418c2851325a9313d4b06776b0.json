  "description": "As the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament heats up, on this week’s Best Of The Gist, we bring you a pair of stories from college sport. The first is part two of Mike’s interview with John Tauer, the head coach of the St. Thomas University's basketball team, which made an unprecedented leap ahead of this season from Division 3 to Division 1. Tauer discusses what changes when a team makes such a bold move. Then we listen back to our Monday show, when Mike Spieled about University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, who won the NCAA title in the 500. Other swimmers protested her inclusion in the women's division as unfair. Some swimmers, including ones she out-touched supported her right to swim as her true self. Mike looks at the arguments on both sides, points to many as ridiculous, but a few as legitimate and truly vexing.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
