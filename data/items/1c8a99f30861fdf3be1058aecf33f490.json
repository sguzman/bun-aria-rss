    "media:description": "In this video, we discuss the division algorithm in K[t], and use it to show that K[t] is a principal ideal domain. This property allows one to find a greatest common divisor of two non zero polynomials. \n\nWe also show that in an algebraically closed field K, non-constant polynomials can be factored into linear terms.",
