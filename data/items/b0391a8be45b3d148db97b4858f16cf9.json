  "description": "<p>A massive interview coming your way today as we chat with two-time Olympian and reigning World Champion in the sport of Aerial Skiing Laura Peel about her amazing career and her hopes ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics! We find out from Laura how much already knowing how to ski helped her transition into aerials from gymnastics, as well as just how it was in the early 2010s to be bunking with a soon to be Olympic Champion in Lydia Lassila. We also find out just how much her coach yelling during a routine actually helps her, what mental activities she likes to work on in order to help her better during competition and just what challenges are involved in transporting one of the most amazing sporting trophies in the world from Europe back home to Australia. It’s a flipping good time that you won’t want to miss, so get to listening! </p>",
