  "description": " <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) is at a pivotal moment. Once indispensable, the WTO finds itself struggling to settle disputes, negotiate new rules, and grapple with disruptive technologies and the re-emergence of mercantilism. While some predict the demise of the WTO, others see today’s uncertainty as an opportunity to reinvigorate the global trading system. Join CSIS on October 21 for a conversation on the future of the global trading system with Ambassador Alan Wm. Wolff, Deputy Director-General WTO and CSIS Senior Adviser and Scholl Chair holder Bill Reinsch.”<br />\n<br />\nThe Scholl Chair will also be highlighting its <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/wto-crossroad\">report</a>, <i>The WTO at a Crossroad.</i><br />\n<br />\n<i>This event is made possible by general support to CSIS. </i></p>\n ",
