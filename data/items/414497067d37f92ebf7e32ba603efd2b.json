The ring he forges grants the power to rule the world. The Siegfried Line was named after a legendary hero of Germanic legend who slew a dragon and was later was later murdered. He may have been based on Arminius of the Tuetoburg Forest.

The Battle at Bullecourt literally became the textbook example of how not to conduct a battle - it was taught in British Staff Colleges of the dangers of poor planning. Vimy Ridge is almost the perfect juxtaposition - Byng vs Gough, detailed planning vs big hands small map, artillery vs no artillery, CBSO vs little effective counter battery effects, ammunition allocation (50,000 tons were fired in pre H-Hour fires), vs an inadequate allocation, enough guns vs clearly insufficient numbers of batteries, and coordination and cooperation across corps vs little coordination. The Vimy Ridge battle was an exemplar of how to attack a strongly defended objective in the First World War and many of the techniques developed at Vimy would be used by Monash in 1918 in his first Battle as Corps Commander in the Battle of Hamel.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p> <!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":2747,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --></p> <div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><img src= \"https://theprinciplesofwar.com/wp-content/uploads/Usma_battle_of_arras_1917-332x512.png\" alt=\"The Arras Offensive Map\" class=\"wp-image-2747\" />The Bullecourt Battle was a support effort to Allenby's Third Army Arras Offensive.</div> <p><!-- /wp:image --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Join the conversation on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/surprisepodcast\">Twitter</a> or <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/Principlesofwar/\">Facebook.</a></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:create-block/libsyn-podcasting-block --></p> <div class=\"wp-block-create-block-libsyn-podcasting-block\"> <div class=\"libsyn-shortcode\"></div> </div> <p><!-- /wp:create-block/libsyn-podcasting-block --></p>",
