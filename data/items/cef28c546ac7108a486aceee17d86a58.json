Clint Eastwood's new movie about Richard Jewell is facing a second round of criticism for implying that a reporter might have slept with law enforcement officers in order to get scoops. Old audio of a Boston radio host's questionable comedy routine has surfaced and, as much as it kills Minihane to do it, he has to play it. Gerry Callahan and Dave Cullinane join the Kirk Minihane Show in studio to break major news about Callahan's forthcoming project: The Gerry Callahan Podcast.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
