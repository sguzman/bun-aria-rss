  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seth Humphrey has always been a hustler.  He focused on what he wanted, didn’t want to rely on anyone, and that got him into some trouble.  Selling pot in college led to Seth having to leave town.  Luckily a friend of his owned a gym and offered Seth a job.  Learning all that he could, Seth went on to open his own gym.  Plenty of hurdles followed, but Seth continued to go full force.  He’s always believed in not talking about your accomplishments, but letting them speak for themselves.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seth is now involved in the Gorilla Alliance, a group of men that are working towards being their best selves in 4 vital areas of life (family, faith, fitness, finances).  With that, he puts a heavy importance on self care.  Every morning he starts his day off by slowing down in the sauna and getting his day in order. He follows that with a dip in the ice barrel to bring his energy back up and curb his procrastination and stress.</span></p> <div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Show Notes:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" title= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-target-href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison\">https://underdogempowerment.com/seth-humphrey</a></span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <ol class=\"listtype-number listindent1 list-number1\" start=\"1\"> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" data-target-href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol> <p> </p>",
