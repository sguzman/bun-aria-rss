  "description": "<p>Gibbsian structure in random point fields has been a classical tool for\nstudying their spatial properties. However, exact Gibbs property is available\nonly in a relatively limited class of models, and it does not adequately\naddress many random fields with a strongly dependent spatial structure. In this\nwork, we provide a general framework for approximate Gibbsian structure for\nstrongly correlated random point fields. These include processes that exhibit\nstrong spatial rigidity, in particular, a certain one-parameter family of\nanalytic Gaussian zero point fields, namely the $\\alpha$-GAFs. Our framework\nentails conditions that may be verified via finite particle approximations to\nthe process, a phenomenon that we call an approximate Gibbs property. We show\nthat these enable one to compare the spatial conditional measures in the\ninfinite volume limit with Gibbs-type densities supported on appropriate\nsingular manifolds, a phenomenon we refer to as a generalized Gibbs property.\nWe demonstrate the scope of our approach by showing that a generalized Gibbs\nproperty holds with a logarithmic pair potential for the $\\alpha$-GAFs for any\nvalue of $\\alpha$. This establishes the level of rigidity of the $\\alpha$-GAF\nzero process to be exactly $\\lfloor \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\rfloor$, settling in the\naffirmative an open question regarding the existence of point processes with\nany specified level of rigidity. For processes such as the zeros of\n$\\alpha$-GAFs, which involve complex, many-body interactions, our results imply\nthat the local behaviour of the random points still exhibits 2D Coulomb-type\nrepulsion in the short range. Our techniques can be leveraged to estimate the\nrelative energies of configurations under local perturbations, with possible\nimplications for dynamics and stochastic geometry on strongly correlated random\npoint fields.\n</p>",
