  "description": "We learned Michael Thomas had a setback just before the show, and while we did not know at the time that he would miss the rest of the season, we'll still tell you what to expect from the Saints offense without Thomas moving forward. Then we'll talk trade (8:40)! Our favorite buy lows include Justin Herbert for Dave and the rookie WRs for Heath (13:10). We have a lengthy debate about Waddle, Smith and Toney. And how confident are we in the Chiefs offense bouncing back (23:30)? ... News and notes (28:50) and some sell high candidates to consider (33:40). What does the schedule look like for Damien Harris moving forward? We'll also tell you how to value (41:30) Deebo Samuel, Ja'Marr Chase and Cordarrelle Patterson ... Previewing Jets-Colts (49:00), discussing some of the most traded players in CBS leagues (57:30), hearing from the Fantasy Cops (1:02:00) and reading your Apple Podcast questions at the end of the show ...
