  "description": "<p>Thunder and lightning: very, very frighteningly interesting! Wildfire researcher and lightning scientist Chris Giesige answers questions about thunderclaps and lightning flashes in a laid back way that will put him at the top of your Fulminologist list. He explains everything from clouds to positive and negative charges, volcanic lightning, fire tornadoes, getting struck by lightning, fractal scars, sprites, elves, how many gigawatts in a lightning strike, and how to enjoy a storm without getting zapped. Also, heartbreak vs. heart damage from electricity.  </p>\n<p>Follow Chris at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cgiesige39?lang=en\">Twitter.com/Cgiesige39</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/chrisgiesige\">Instagram.com/chrisgiesige</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to International Relief Teams: <a href=\"https://www.irteams.org/\">irteams.org</a> and<a href=\"westcats.com\"> Westcats.com  </a></p>\n<p>Sponsors of the show: <a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\">www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors</a></p>\n<p>For more links:<a> alieward.com/ologies/fulminology</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and uh...bikinis?
