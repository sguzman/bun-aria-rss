    "media:description": "In this video, we talk about the painter's paradox, that describes an object that can't be covered with paint but can be filled with paint. How is it possible to have an object with an infinite surface area but a finite volume? Doesn't it make sense that the outside of an object always takes up less space than the inside? \n\nFollow Me!\nhttps://instagram.com/vcubingx\nhttps://github.com/vivek3141\nhttps://twitter.com/vcubingx\n\nThis video was animated using manim: https://github.com/3b1b/manim\nSource code for the animations: https://github.com/vivek3141/videos",
