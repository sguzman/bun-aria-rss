  "description": "<p>Microscopes in science class were always a hit for Nikki and Andrew but don't count on them zooming in on a cat's tongue. Nikki would do a whole set in the Elizabeth Holmes voice. Andrew gets the Met Gala all wrong and Nikki hates it until she's invited. Andrew gets the same advice you'd get about being on shaky bridge about period sex. Nikki is looking forward to being on the Wendy Williams Show with Michael Rapaport and never throwing a first pitch again. You Heard It Here First, don't expose yourself in the office. Nikki's Reddit Dump gets them talking about handwriting, plowing butterflies with a car and 3 wishes to be granted by a genie.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
