She is in conversation with Poetry Exchange team members, Al Snell and Andrea Witzke-Slot.  \n\n*********\n\nLove Song for Words\nNazik Al-Malaika\n\nWhy do we fear words\nwhen they have been rose-palmed hands,\nfragrant, passing gently over our cheeks,\nand glasses of heartening wine\nsipped, one summer, by thirsty lips?\n\nWhy do we fear words\nwhen among them are words like unseen bells,\nwhose echo announces in our troubled lives\nthe coming of a period of enchanted dawn,\ndrenched in love, and life?\nSo why do we fear words?\n\nWe took pleasure in silence.\nWe became still, fearing the secret might part our lips.\nWe thought that in words laid an unseen ghoul,\ncrouching, hidden by the letters from the ear of time.\nWe shackled the thirsty letters,\nwe forbade them to spread the night for us\nas a cushion, dripping with music, dreams,\nand warm cups.\n\nWhy do we fear words?\nAmong them are words of smooth sweetness\nwhose letters have drawn the warmth of hope from two lips,\nand others that, rejoicing in pleasure\nhave waded through momentary joy with two drunk eyes.\nWords, poetry, tenderly\nturned to caress our cheeks, sounds\nthat, asleep in their echo, lies a rich color, a rustling,\na secret ardor, a hidden longing.\n\nWhy do we fear words?\nIf their thorns have once wounded us,\nthen they have also wrapped their arms around our necks\nand shed their sweet scent upon our desires.\nIf their letters have pierced us\nand their face turned callously from us\nThen they have also left us with an oud in our hands\nAnd tomorrow they will shower us with life.\nSo pour us two full glasses of words!\n\nTomorrow we will build ourselves a dream-nest of words,\nhigh, with ivy trailing from its letters.\nWe will nourish its buds with poetry\nand water its flowers with words.\nWe will build a balcony for the timid rose\nwith pillars made of words,\nand a cool hall flooded with deep shade,\nguarded by words.\n\nOur life we have dedicated as a prayer\nTo whom will we pray . . . but to words?",
