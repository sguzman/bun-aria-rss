  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amy, 48, would like to be more present in her body but multiple life experiences seem to stand in her way. After having mostly recovered from a frightening journey with multiple sclerosis (MS), Amy may have regained her health, but is realizing that her relationship with her body and sexuality is now calling out for healing at a deeper level.¬†</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you‚Äôll hear, Amy‚Äôs story with food and body go way back to childhood, when she had the startling experience of rapid puberty-related changes. One day she had the body of a child, and the next, the body of a woman. She began attracting unwanted attention from men, and could tell that all her family and friends were highly uncomfortable with her body. This imprinted a deep sense of shame and a desire to hide her femininity, which has continued on into adulthood.¬†</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key concepts highlighted in this session is that ‚Äúimprint vulnerability,‚Äù something that often occurs during the hormonal shifts of puberty. And as Marc shares, this early imprinted experience can become something that negatively influences the rest of us our life until we identify it, and retrain our brains and bodies to experience life in a different way.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this episode demonstrates, it‚Äôs natural to ‚Äúzip up‚Äù our emotions in the face of traumatic life experiences. But it‚Äôs our job to learn how to not zip up, and instead metabolize the deep emotions that surface along the journey of life.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don‚Äôt miss this incredibly powerful episode exploring puberty, sexuality, illness, weight gain, and so much more.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">---------------</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch our special masterclass on the Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training to learn more about how you can positively transform your own relationship with food while helping others do the same. üëâTune into The Ultimate Health Coach webinar here:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/become-a-coach-h/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">¬†¬†</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow us on social:¬†</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- YouTube:</span> <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/c/Psychologyofeating</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Facebook:</span> <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IPEfanpage</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Instagram:</span> <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.instagram.com/eatingpsychology/</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Pinterest:</span> <a href= \"https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.pinterest.com/eatingpsych</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#sexuality #illness #weight #selfconfidence #bodyimage #healthysexuality #pubertychallenges #healingtrauma #feminineembodiment #multiplesclerosis #selfworth #innerchildhealing #relationshipwithfood #marcdavid #eatingpsychology</span></p>",
