  "description": "The Happy Face Killer. 1990-1995. United States. After a woman was beaten and strangled to death, another woman came forward to confess to having a hand in the crime. She gave authorities the name of her boyfriend as well as details on how and why the woman was murdered. The two are charged and both wind up in prison after evidence mounts of their guilt. Not long after, though, graffiti on a bathroom stall in Livingston, Montana and letters sent to a court and a journalist from someone claiming to be the actual killer appear. The first letter was signed with a happy face. As the years went by and the body count rose, even prosecutors had to wonder if the couple that were sentenced for the first crime were innocent. Luckily for them, the serial killer known as the Happy Face Killer was not about to let anyone else take credit for his brutal crimes.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
