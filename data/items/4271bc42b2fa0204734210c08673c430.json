  "description": "In this episode, Sharon and entrepreneur, author, and podcast host, Jordan Lee Dooley have a discussion about the lessons to learn in the almost spaces of our lives. For many of us, achievement of one goal leads us to feel like the finish line is always moving; we’re always reaching to complete the next goal. Jordan advocates for slowing down and redefining contentment, and to consider it active engagement in our lives no matter where we are in relation to our goals. We can find this active contentment by looking for ways to serve, finding a hobby, getting curious, checking something off our bucket lists, and plugging in to a good community. The “almost” space is also a great place from which to pause and evaluate; sometimes our dreams shift and change, but change does not mean we have failed.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
