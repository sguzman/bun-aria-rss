Download and subscribe anywhere you find Pick Six including Apple, Spotify, Stitcher and Google.\n-----------------------------------\nIt's not typical for a Super Bowl participant to sit down for an extensive conversation with the media the week of the big game. But we're not your typical media. On this episode, Bucs standout linebacker Lavonte David joins Patrick Peterson and Bryant McFadden to discuss his journey, Tom Brady, the Super Bowl and more! First, Lavonte clears up questions about his health heading into Sunday, before diving into his winding path that led him to this moment. With 3 South Florida guys on the show, we examine if Broward County (home of Pat and BMac) or Dade County (home of Lavonte) produces the better football players. Lavonte has somehow only made 1 Pro Bowl and he shares why he thinks he remains overlooked. He also speaks openly about some of the dark days with Tampa before the organization turned around with the signing of Tom Brady this offseason. Our guest was in complete shock when the move happened and even more surprised when the GOAT Facetimed him. Brady's will to win comes through clear in an example Lavonte gives us that happened after the Bucs NFC title game victory. Let's not forget about the addition of Antonio Brown... P2, BMac and Lavonte also cover keys to victory vs. the Chiefs, the odds of a defensive player winning Super Bowl MVP and pregame nerves that might occur. Of course, we wrap with Superlatives!\n'All Things Covered' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to All Things Covered on your smart speakers!
