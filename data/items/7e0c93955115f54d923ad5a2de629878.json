  "description": "What does it mean to be a Christian historian? Can there be such a thing as Christian history? In his new book, Christian Historiography: Five Rival Versions (Baylor University Press, 2015), Jay Green of Covenant College explores these and other related questions. Dr. Green manages to both objectively present different approaches to Christian historiography while providing his own helpful evaluations of their strengths and weaknesses gained through years of study and teaching. Dr. Green’s own approach, combined with his clear writing style and the tight organization of his book means that this work is not only of interest to historians (both Christians and non-Christians) but would be perfect for classroom use by undergraduates and graduates as well.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
