  "description": "Death Of Kathy Wangler. September 4th, 2006. Lima, Ohio. A man wakes up to the sound of an alarm. It's the carbon monoxide detector. He will hurry upstairs to check on his wife. She appeared to be having a seizure. He then called 911 to get her help. No one could save her, though. She was pronounced dead at the hospital after attempts to revive her had failed. While Mark moves on with his life, getting remarried 14 months after his wife Kathy's death, her family pressures police to investigate the anesthesiologist. More than three years after the death of his wife he is charged with her murder. Dr. Mark Wangler would profess his innocence. He would state that his wife's death was an accident. His two grown sons voiced their support for him as did his new wife, Esther. Kathy's family and friends did not believe him. They said Mark was verbally abusive to her and wanted to avoid a costly divorce. Was a faulty water heater to blame as Mark claims? Or did he set his wife up to die? Thank you to all of our listeners. Your support for this podcast is very much appreciated. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year to each and every one of you. We will return January 01, 2017.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
