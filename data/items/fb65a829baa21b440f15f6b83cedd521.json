  "description": "<p>In 1999, writer John Krakauer stopped at a gas station in Colorado City, AZ, a place he had never been. What he found was a town frozen in time, with women in long prairie dresses and hairstyles that rang of the 1800s. The curious sight led him on a journalistic investigation into a modern day 'prophet' named Warren Jeffs and the cult-like FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).\n When the investigation of Warren Jeffs sends him on the run, he winds up in the number two spot on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. The number one spot being occupied by Osama Bin Laden. The manhunt for Jeffs uncovers his 'religion's most vile atrocities including the forced marriages of underage girls, rape, and polygamy. \n Fun, right? But fear not, we play a LOT of \"The Book of Mormon\" in this one. </p>\n",
