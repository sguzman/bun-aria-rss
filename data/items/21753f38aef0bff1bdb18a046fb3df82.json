  "description": "In reinforcement learning, we are interested in identifying a policy that maximizes the obtained reward. Assuming a perfect model of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDPs), we can apply dynamic programming methods to solve reinforcement learning problems.\nIn this post, I present three dynamic programming algorithms that can be used in the context of MDPs. To make these concepts more understandable, I implemented the algorithms in the context of a gridworld, which is a popular example for demonstrating reinforcement learning."
