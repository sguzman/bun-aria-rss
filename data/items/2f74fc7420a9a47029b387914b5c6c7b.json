  "description": "On The Gist, a best-of episode to welcome new listeners who heard our host on Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me this weekend. First, the film Spotlight depicts serious investigative journalism without the usual guns, car chases, and explosions. We speak with subjects from the film, including journalists Walter “Robby” Robinson (played by Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo). They’re the authors of the book Betrayal: The Crisis in the Catholic Church. For The Spiel, New York City’s police commissioner explains why obvious errors in the terror hoax helped the city avoid another a school closing. \nToday’s sponsors:\nCredit Karma.
