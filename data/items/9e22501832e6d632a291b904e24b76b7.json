  "description": "In May 1992, the TV character Murphy Brown gave birth to a baby boy. The following day, Vice President Dan Quayle publicly blamed Brown for \"mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.\" But Murphy Brown wasn’t the first single mom on TV, or the first pregnant character to wrestle with whether to have a baby. Other shows tackled more controversial issues like abortion decades earlier. We look back at the feud between a sitcom character and a real politician to find out what that fight tells us about our culture, in 1992 and today.\nMusic credits:\nReach Out by James Copperthwaite\nMurphy Brown Theme by Steve Dorff\nVoyage (A) by by Jon Lorca and Peter James Quiney\nA Most Quiet Season by Richard Bone\nRue Montclare (A) by Joe Henson, Alexis Leon Smith, and Reinould Willem Rutger Ford\nWhen in the West by Landsman Duets (from Blue Dot Sessions)\nTwo Dollar Token by Warmbody (from Blue Dot Sessions)\nKitten by Podington Bear\nConstructions (B) by John Devereuax\nLearn more about your ad choices.
