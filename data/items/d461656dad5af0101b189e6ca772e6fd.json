  "description": "America's problems extend far beyond Russiagate.  In fact, they extend far beyond porn stars and having half the cabinet under investigation, failures in Puerto Rico and near nuclear war with North Korea.  They include unprecedented levels of overt corruption in the White House...but perhaps worse for a system that depends on checks and balances, they go further to the fact that no one in Congress seeks to call out or stop that corruption.  Or gun violence.  Or the war on science.  Or financial recklessness.  Or any of the other ills that currently plague the U.S.  How did we get here?  Who's to blame?  What's to be done?  Tune in to find out.  Or at least for therapeutic purposes.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
