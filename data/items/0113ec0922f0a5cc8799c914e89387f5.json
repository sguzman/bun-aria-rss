  "description": "<p>Who doesn’t love Springfield, Missouri? The home of cashew nut chicken and possibly where the Simpson’s live is also the birthplace of this week’s guest Kenny DeForest. Every now and again you meet someone and think, “I hope you run for president one day because I would vote for you… and probably end up hating you because presidents are just puppets on strings being jerked around by clandestine world powers, but I think you’d win a general election cause you got the goods!” And to us, Kenny is that guy. Intelligent, funny, and just fucking real as they come. He’s got late night killer sets on Seth Meyers and James Corden. Here are five words to describe this episode: ghosts are sexier than mushrooms.</p>",
