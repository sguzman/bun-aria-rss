  "description": "With entire states now locking down, the officials making these decisions need to start providing real answers. We need to know when this will be over and what the end game is. Instead we get vague platitudes while lives are destroyed. Meanwhile, some members of Congress have been dumping stocks based on information they receive in private briefings. How can we trust these people and their decision to lock down the whole economy? Plus Five Headlines. I will attempt to find five that have nothing to do with the China Virus.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
