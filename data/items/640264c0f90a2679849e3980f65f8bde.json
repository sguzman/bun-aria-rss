  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the great Norwegian playwright and poet, best known for his middle class tragedies such as The Wild Duck, Hedda Gabler, A Doll's House and An Enemy of the People. These are set in a world where the middle class is dominant and explore the qualities of that life, its weaknesses and boundaries and the ways in which it takes away freedoms. It is the women who fare the worst in this society, something Ibsen explored in A Doll's House among others, a play that created a sensation with audiences shocked to watch a woman break free of her bourgeois family life to find her destiny. He explored dark secrets such as incest and, in Ghosts, hereditary syphilis, which attracted the censors. He gave actresses parts they had rarely had before, and audiences plays that, after Shakespeare, became the most performed in the world.\n\nWith \n\nTore Rem\nProfessor of English Literature at the University of Oslo\n\nKirsten Shepherd-Barr\nProfessor of English and Theatre Studies and Tutorial Fellow, St Catherine's College at the University of Oxford\n\nAnd \n\nDinah Birch\nProfessor of English Literature and Pro-Vice Chancellor for Cultural Engagement at the University of Liverpool\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
