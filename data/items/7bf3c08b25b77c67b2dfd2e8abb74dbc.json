  "description": "This is the first part in a series of episodes exploring the historical roots of California Institute of Integral Studies and its foundations in Integral Yoga as brought to California in the 1950’s by Haridas Chaudhuri. In this episode we speak with Bahman Shirazi, who recounts the early history of Haridas Chaudhuri coming to the west, and the academic and cultural conditions which lead to what became CIIS. Bahman speaks about his dissertation completed in EWP in the 1980’s which develops Haridas Chaudhuri’s vision of Integral Psychology, asking what is the role of personality in spiritual development. We also discuss how the East-West Psychology department was formed to situate the intersectionality of Integral Yoga, spirituality, religion and transpersonal psychology.\nBahman A.K. Shirazi, PhD, has been an adjunct faculty in the Integral Counseling Psychology, and East-West psychology programs at CIIS since 1995. His doctoral dissertation, entitled Self in Integral Psychology, was supervised by ICP founder Dr. Paul Herman.\nIn addition, Bahman has worked in various administrative positions at CIIS for over twenty years, including several years as Director of Graduate Studies.
