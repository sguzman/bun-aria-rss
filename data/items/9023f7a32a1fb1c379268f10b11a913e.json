  "description": "<p><em><strong>Deconstruction, Death & Depression</strong></em>. Today we take a break to digest all of the content from the <strong>Image</strong> series so far to sit with a few listener questions. First, Mike speaks to a comment that rubbed him wrong on his own 'deconstruction.' How do you talk about New Creation and the Gospel with someone on Hospice? If the idea of being '<strong>saved' </strong>is so important and supposedly so easy to understand, why did it take us so many episodes and so much research to unpack? Can the ideas of New Creation and center focus be dialed down to a \"Romans Road\" style message of the Gospel?? All that and one long critique of both Mike and Tim from recent episodes. So much good stuff from the VOXOLOGY Community!!!</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
