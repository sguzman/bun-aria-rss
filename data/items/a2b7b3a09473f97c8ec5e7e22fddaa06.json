But what she found with her dog, Brio, shook the foundations of her physical and spiritual worlds, sending her on a quest to discover the nature of his spiritual origins and to contemplate and seek out the possibility of interspecies communication - even after death.\nSoon after bringing her puppy home, Mannes realized the master-companion relationship would not be possible with Brio, who quickly showed he had a mind - and a spirit - of his own. Mannes' growing curiosity about the intelligence, emotions, and consciousness of Brio and other dogs led her to contact an animal psychic in California who described, with amazing accuracy, Brio's favorite walks and the author's apartment from the dog's point of view. Mannes' skeptical journalist background compelled her to investigate further. She delved into the world of animal communicators, psychics, and scientists studying animal intelligence, including Rupert Sheldrake, to find answers to her multiplying questions: Do animals have thoughts and feelings? Consciousness? Souls? Is interspecies communication possible? Can animals reincarnate?\nSpanning the entire life and afterlife of Brio, including his last days and his messages to the author after he passed on, this audiobook also explores Mannes' investigations into the spiritual life of animals, offering a new understanding of the unbreakable bond between humans and animals. Mannes invites listeners to move beyond the owner-pet relationship and shows us how to see animals as thinking, feeling, spiritual beings whose connections with us extend far beyond life and death.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
