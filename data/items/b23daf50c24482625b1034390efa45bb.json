Meanwhile, other companies like theGlobe.com saw investment money pour in and their valuation skyrocket in the public markets, despite having weak business models and a tricky road to profitability.\nHow did venture capitalists choose which dot-coms to invest in, and how did their blueprint for investment tip the scales to certain types of companies? And how did the rush to ride the dot-com bubble lead to the crash?\nFrom Epic Magazine and the Vox Media Podcast Network.
