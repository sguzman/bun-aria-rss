  "description": "<p>Meditation - Relaxing Back into Living Presence (2016-12-07) - When we are lost in thoughts our mind contracts, our body tightens and we disconnect from true openheartedness. The pathway home is through “relaxing back” and reopening our attention to our senses, relaxing through our body, and gently contacting the felt sense in our heart. By repeatedly relaxing back, we become increasingly familiar with the vibrancy, tenderness and openness of true presence. </p> <p>Free download of Tara’s 10 min meditation: “Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease” when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
