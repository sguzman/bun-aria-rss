  "description": "<p>“Projectors have no energy.” “Generators are supposed to build someone else’s dreams. “Manifesters are aggressive.” “Reflectors don’t know who they are.” We constantly hear these narratives about the Human Design energy types which are simply NOT true. In this episode I wanted to bust the most common misconceptions I hear with Human Design experts Dana and Shayna of Dayluna so we can find the fluidity, opportunity and bliss in each HD type.</p> <p>We look at each energy type at a higher level of consciousness that goes beyond stereotypical narratives. We also discuss the shift happening in the collective as we find the importance of the individual within the collective. If you’re a HD nerd or newbie, you’re going to love this episode.
