  "description": "<p>Crispin points out that in modern academia, it is often assumed that Christ didn’t<br />\nconsider himself divine. Instead, academics consider that Christ’s divinity was<br />\nlater imposed on him by the early church.<br />\nCrispin points to some weaknesses in this argument and offers some refreshing<br />\ncritiques.<br />\nIncluded in his points are:<br />\n• The high priest is a new Adam.<br />\n• The high priest as “God’s image” is tied to the idea of the temple as a<br />\nmicrocosm.<br />\n• The high priest is, in a sense, “Israel.”<br />\n• Because the high priest is a representative of Israel, he is also a royal figure,<br />\nbecause one of the tribes of Israel is the royal line (the tribe of Judah).<br />\n• The high priest is an office, not a person.<br />\nAbout Dr. Fletcher-Louis:<br />\nDr. Crispin Fletcher-Louis is a biblical scholar and teacher.

He continues to<br />\nprovide informal teaching to local churches and consultancy to businesses<br />\ninterested in the optimization of material and spiritual value creation. His research<br />\nand teaching focuses on the overarching shape of the biblical story (its key<br />\nthemes and theological questions).
