Open borders.\nThese ideas may strike you as crazy, fantastical, maybe even utopian... but that’s exactly the point.\nMy guest today is Dutch historian Rutger Bregman, whose book Utopia for Realists is not only about utopian visions but about the importance of utopian thinking. Imagining utopia, he writes, “isn’t an attempt to predict the future. It’s an attempt to unlock the future. To fling open the windows of our minds.”\nHe’s right. And so this isn’t just a conversation about his utopia, or mine. It’s a conversation about how to think like a utopian, and why doing so matter most when the days feel particularly dystopic.\nCitations: \nThe Lost Boys by Gina Perry \n\"Socially Useless Jobs\" by Robert Dur and Max van Lent\n\"Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren\" by John Maynard Keynes \n\"I was a fast-food worker.
