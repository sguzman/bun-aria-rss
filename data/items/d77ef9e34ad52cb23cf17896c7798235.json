  "description": "<p>Other than Frank Sinatra, there are few people who are so tightly woven into the spirit of mid-century culture than 1950's Hollywood star <strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong>. Sometime later this year, plans call for a nearly 30 foot tall statue of her in the famous blowing white dress to return to Palm Springs as a permanent home.  In her day, Marilyn was as big as any celebrity you could name.  She was involved with some of the most well-known men in the world:  baseball great <strong>Joe Dimaggio</strong>, playwright <strong>Arthur Miller</strong>, and generally accepted nowadays, <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong>. And she has a connection to a very famous architect. Hosts <strong>George Smart</strong> and <strong>Tom Guild</strong> talk with three people who keep Marilyn’s legacy alive for the 21st century. First, it’s <strong>Sunny Thompson</strong>, who has been channeling Marilyn in her live shows and completely brings her back to life. Next, <strong>Greg Schreiner</strong>, who has one of the worlds largest collections of Marilyn’s costumes and also leads the annual memorial service in Los Angeles, and finally, <strong>Joshua Greene</strong>, son of photographer Milton Greene, who took some of Marilyn’s most memorable photos. Marilyn was, for a time, Joshua’s babysitter!  </p>",
