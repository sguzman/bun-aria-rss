  "description": "In this cyberwire special edition, my guest is Cisco’s Chief Privacy Officer Michelle Dennedy. We discuss what exactly a chief privacy officer does at a global organization like Cisco, why she thinks we’re in the early stages of a privacy revolution, why we all tend to shake our heads cynically when I company claims, “Your privacy is important to us” and how, maybe, respecting the privacy of your users and customers could be a competitive advantage.\n\nThis conversation continues on Michelle Dennedy's podcast, Privacy Sigma Riders. \n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/privacy-podcast.html",
