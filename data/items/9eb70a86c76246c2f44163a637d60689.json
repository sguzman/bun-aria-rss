  "description": "<p>The personal uniform is a look that you've settled on as your regular get-up. Today on the show I talk to two style writers, David Coggins and Michael Williams, about all things concerning this stylish-yet-bandwidth-saving approach to dressing. We discuss what a personal uniform is, how to develop one and why that development comes with age, and how to find inspiration for yours. We also talk about establishing the base pieces of your personal uniform, buying multiples of its fundamental components, and refining your look over time.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/xrVf5xejKMmuqkFP7\">Photo of David and Michael at the Masters</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/podcast-398-should-a-man-care-about-how-he-dresses/\">AoM Podcast #398: Should a Man Care About How He Dresses?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/clothing/alteration-guide/\">AoM article on tailoring</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/10-things-your-father-should-have-taught-you-about-style/\">AoM Article: 10 Things Your Father Should Have Taught You About Style</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/your-individual-style/\">AoM Article: 3 Steps to Building Your Individual Style</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sidmashburn.com/\">Sid Mashburn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.drakes.com/usa/\">Drake's</a></li><li><a href=\"https://putthison.com/a-buyers-guide-to-barbour-its-been-five-years/\">A guide to the Barbour coat</a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.crockettandjones.com/\">Crockett & Jones</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.gearpatrol.com/style/g37268945/chore-coat/\">The chore coat</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men\">Uniqlo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://dieworkwear.com/\">Die, Workwear!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nickwooster/?hl=en\">Nick Wooster</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.thewilliambrownproject.com/\">William Brown Project</a></li><li>David Coggins' previous appearances on the podcast:<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/outfit-guide/podcast-282-man-develops-sense-style/\">#282: How a Man Develops His Sense of Style</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/etiquette/podcast-422-men-manners-tipping-emojis-and-much-more/\">#422: Men and Manners</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/leisure/podcast-706-the-non-cliche-life-lessons-of-fly-fishing/\">#706: The (Non-Cliche) Life Lessons of Fly Fishing</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Connect With David and Michael</h2><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/03/style2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><ul><li>David's site <a href=\"https://thecontender.co/\">The Contender</a> and <a href=\"https://thecontender.substack.com/\">The Contender newsletter</a></li><li>Michael's site <a href=\"https://www.acontinuouslean.com/\">A Continuous Lean</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.acl.news/\">ACL newsletter</a></li><li>You can access their podcast, Central Division, by subscribing to either of their newsletters</li></ul>\n",
