  "description": "What does it mean to pursue true greatness? Is it defined by the amount of trophies, awards, or wealth you’ve accumulated? Or is it something less physical and perhaps only found deep under the surface of our character? On this episode of Conversations with Tom, bestselling-author Ryan Holiday joins Tom Bilyeu to discuss stoicism, character, and the philosophy of action and how it can be applied to your life today to create a drive towards your goals. They discuss how the stoics would interpret today’s political culture and identity politics, the power of moderation as a virtue, why character is crucial to play the infinite game of life, what true heroes look like, and equality in America.   Purchase Ryan’s book, ’Lives of the Stoics’:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lives-Stoics-Living-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/052554187X/ref\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Lives-Stoics-Living-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/052554187X/ref</a>=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lives+of+the+stoics&qid=1601318520&sr=8-1 This episode is brought to you by: Better Help: Get 10% off your first month at <a href=\"https://betterhelp.com/impacttheory\" rel=\"noopener\">https://betterhelp.com/impacttheory</a> Azlo: Sign up at Azlo.com/IMPACT and get a free copy of Azlo’s Small Business Starter Guide.  Blinkist: Go to <a href=\"https://blinkist.com/impact\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blinkist.com/impact</a> Try it FREE for 7 days and save 25% off your new subscription.    SHOW NOTES:   Stoicism | Ryan and Tom discuss how the ‘stoics’ would interpret today’s culture wars.
