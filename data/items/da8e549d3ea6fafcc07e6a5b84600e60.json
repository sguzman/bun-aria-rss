  "description": "<p>In this week's episode of The Literary Life, our host are back to discuss chapters 18-24 of Jane Austen's <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/38gZMga\">Northanger Abbey</a>.</em> Cindy, Angelina and Thomas start out sharing the things that struck them as they read this particular section of the book. Angelina highlight's Catherine's growing ability to judge between appearances and reality. We see the great contrast between Henry Tilney with John Thorpe throughout these chapters, and we learn how different the abbey is from Catherine's sentimental expectations.</p> <p>Another point that Angelina brings to the forefront is that Catherine is looking for hidden dangers, but she doesn’t see the real, ordinary dangers of people like the Thorpes. Cindy highlights the way Austen points to some problems with equating English-ness with Christianity and exceptionalism. Thomas underlines Henry Tilney’s own moment of naïveté about what evils actually do exist, even in his own family. Throughout this whole section, one main theme is the undeceiving of Catherine, and this is a big turning point for her.</p> <h3>Thanks to Our Sponsor:</h3> <p>Located in beautiful Franklin Tennessee, <a href= \"https://newcollegefranklin.org/\">New College Franklin</a> is a four year Christian Liberal Arts college dedicated to excellent academics and discipling relationships among students and faculty.
