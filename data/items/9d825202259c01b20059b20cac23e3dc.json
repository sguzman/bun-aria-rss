  "description": "<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Six</strong></em>. In this episode, we continue our conversation on the B-I-B-L-E. Today we dive deeper into accommodation and how the human / divine dance influences the text. How does God use culture, in every different era, to speak through the text? How are we, now, to associate and interact? Is everything literal? Is any of it? Does the Bible continually reveal or is it all there on first read??? What are we to do with all of this?</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
