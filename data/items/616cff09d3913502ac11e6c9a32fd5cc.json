  "description": "<p class=\"\">Meredith and Kaytee are recording with a special guest this week, Sara Hildreth of @fictionmatters on Instagram. We’ll chat with her about building a 70K follower account and how that affects her reading life.</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from each of us: a long-awaited pre-order arrives, a forthcoming release that we’re excited to read, and exploring a new literary scene.</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. We are each sharing two books that we’ve read recently. We’ve got some differing opinions about books we’ve all read, which is my FAVORITE thing.</p> <p class=\"\">We’ll move on to a short Slow But Steady update from each of us, with more observations about what Slow But Steady can be and doesn’t have to be.</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are going deep into the backside of #bookstagram, asking Sara about her history on the platform, how she keeps her reading life in balance, and her favorite and least favorite parts of being a BIG bookstagrammer.</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books Into Your Hands. Each of us is sharing a book that we can’t wait for you to read.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode.
