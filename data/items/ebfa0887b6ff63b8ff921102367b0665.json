  "description": "For my 400th show I want to celebrate doing new things. My friend and author Donna Desoto pushes many of us to do something ‘new’ with her challenges. She started with her collaboration book Inspired by the Beatles, she also did the National Parks, and now Inspired by Elvis. I took that challenge, Donna and I will talk about her project & book!\n----------\nI want to celebrate learning new things with my friend Mary Abreu today. You’ll remember she was my monthly guest one year and we all learned so much from her. She is an author, an amazing seamstress, a teacher and so creative. If you are in the Atlanta area, stop into Intown Quilters to say hello where she is one of the shop managers!\n-----------\nRoseann Kermes of Rosebud's Cottage has been a frequent guest on the show, if I had a permanent co-host my buddy Roseann would be it!  We have known each other forever and I love chatting quilting with her. We do a little 'back in the day' comparison to how quilting has changed and not changed much in the time we've both been making quilts. Then Roseann will help me celebrate my 400th show by asking me some trick questions..haha! Well maybe not trick but she'll interview me!\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
