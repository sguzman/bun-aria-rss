  "title": "80 - America's Guns: What is the Real Problem?",
  "description": "<p>Toughest topic I’ve tackled so far. Marches going on across the country to ban assault rifles. School walkouts. Gun rights advocates staging their own protests. Celebrities posting all kinds of feel good, emotional quotes. But are we looking at this issue the right away? After my research this past few weeks, I don't think so. Let's stop polarizing this discussion. The current issue runs a lot deeper than getting rid of a gun or class of guns. So let’s go deep, Timesuckers! Prepare to be bombarded with so many stats about guns. We deep dive into America’s history with firearms and explore what the real problem with mass murder is in this nation, today, on Timesuck!</p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
