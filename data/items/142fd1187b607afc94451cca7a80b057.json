  "title": "#78: The Myth of Following Your Passion With Cal Newport",
  "description": "<p>I talk to Cal Newport, author of the book So Good They Can't Ignore Ignore You. In his book Cal makes that case that \"following your passion\" is terrible career advice and can actually cause people needless anxiety and problems in their lives because they're constantly jumping from one career to the next.  Instead of \"following your passion\",  he argues that you should instead focus on developing mastery in a skill that will allow you to build up career capital,  which in turns opens up more opportunities for control of you work, which in turn allows you to cultivate a job that you're passionate about. Fulfilling work comes from cultivating your passion, not following it.  This is a must listen to podcast for our college-aged listeners as well as for folks who've felt a twinge of anxiety about whether they're in the right job.</p>\n",
