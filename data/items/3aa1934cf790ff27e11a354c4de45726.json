  "description": "In 2017, a retired firefighter went missing from his Texas home during a seemingly normal day. After searching his vast property, a strange trail of blood was discovered in his workshop, and it seemed to stop abruptly. While checking his cell phone records, some veeeeery unnerving information came forward that made this case even more bizarre - and it lead police to look at his inner circle even more closely.
