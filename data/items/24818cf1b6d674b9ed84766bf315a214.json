  "description": "<p>The Battle of Antietam was a twelve-hour fight that would go down in Civil War history as the bloodiest day of the war. Many would say this was the bloodiest day in American history. The setting would be a cornfield that contained a lonely little white church near the Antietam River. General McClellan's army would clash with General Lee's, sending the Confederates away in a draw not worth continuing to fight. This had been General Lee's first push into the North. The battle would leave President Abraham Lincoln the opening he needed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. It stands to reason that such a violent day would lead to stories of hauntings on the battlefield and in the surrounding buildings, including many homes used as field hospitals. Join us as we explore the events and hauntings of the Battle of Antietam! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features Royston Cave and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features the Lewis and Clark Expedition Start.
