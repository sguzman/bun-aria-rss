  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, how the hell will America have a general election if presidential candidate Joe Biden is hiding in his basement? No scrutiny from the media just scripted interviews and no serious questions on the sexual assault allegations by Tara Reade. Later, Stacey Abrams who claims she was robbed of her GA election, says she believed Biden because the New York Times had already done a deep dive into this accusation. But Biden gets a pass from the same media that skewered Justice Kavanaugh claiming all victims should be believed. Then, Democrats argue that voter ID laws are unconstitutional when in reality proving one's citizenship is very constitutional. Afterward, Gen. Michael Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, joins the show to discuss the latest bombshell documents that have been unsealed today further showing that Flynn was set up and that this whole FBI witch hunt was looking more and more like a cover-up.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
