You want to see the main character go through their perilous journey and come out on the other side victorious after the big battle or challenge that was seemingly impossible. When that story is real life, it causes you to pause and take inventory of your own story. What situation are you facing, how is your current situation in comparison to the underdog you just cheered for? Sometimes those questions can really sting, especially if you feel like or can see proof that you are not living up to your full potential. Wallo267, is an incredible entrepreneur, marketer, and self-made millionaire that joins me to discuss how his no BS mentality took him from a life of crime to a life filled with meaning, purpose, and unmistakable success. He was in and out of jail from the age of 11 and eventually served a 20 year prison sentence. What he’s accomplished in this time and came out of jail equipped and prepared to do will leave you speechless and questioning exactly how you’re using excuses and potentially clinging to a victim mentality.. From Philly to Hollywood, these are lessons on building an extraordinarily successful business from nothing.   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction Wallo 267 2:58 | No One to Blame 3:57 | Locked Up Age 11 7:29 | No Time for Excuses 13:25 | Serving Time, Not Mad 15:08 | Imagination & Potential in Jail 17:40 | Starts New Marketing Business 19:03 | Google & YouTube Universities 22:04 | Willing To Do The Work 24:23 | Free Marketing Available 26:04 | Wallo on Allow Self To Cry 30:31 | Exposure Is Everything 31:29 | Stop Copying Others 32:47 | Knowing Yourself 35:55 | Surviving Prison 38:39 | Adapting to the Real World 40:15 | Going to Atlanta & Business 48:38 | Next Level Application 51:41 | Positive Not Angry   QUOTES: “We go through some we're always looking for somebody to blame for our existence in a fucked up place.
