Without community, we can become isolated, which has been found to be connected with inflammation and can even negatively impact immune response. Moreover, whom you choose to be in community with also matters. Your immediate social circle—the four-to-five people you surround yourself with the most—has the greatest influence on your health. In today’s episode, I talk with Radha Agrawal, Dan Buettner, and Dr. Vivek Murthy about why community matters, what we have learned from cultures that prioritize community in their population, and how to take care of our needs first before giving to others.</p><br><p>Radha Agrawal is the Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Community Architect of Daybreaker, the early morning dance and wellness move-ment. Daybreaker currently holds events in 25 cities and more than a dozen college campuses around the world and has a community of almost half a million people.
