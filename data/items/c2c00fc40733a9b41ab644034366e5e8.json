  "description": "Do multi-billion-dollar investments from legacy players mean anything? Will consumers follow the lead of Detroit’s top brass? Can anyone take on Tesla?\nThe future of transportation is unequivocally electric...but there are more questions about what that future looks like than there are answers. Let’s see what we can do about that. \nToday on Business Casual, hear from General Motors CEO Mary Barra about the profitability, competitive pressures, and uncertain future of the electric vehicle industry. This is an episode you don’t want to miss.\nQuick note: We recorded with Mary on November 20, 2020, just before General Motors released a flurry of news about its electric strategy. Still, the episode is as relevant as they come. GM’s last couple weeks are plenty proof.\nWant more Business Casual? Check out my weekly op-ed column.
