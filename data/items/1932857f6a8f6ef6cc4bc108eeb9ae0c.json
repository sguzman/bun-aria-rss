  "description": "Our audiobook this week is A Bride Worth Fighting For by Tracy Lauren!\n\nNarrated by Leigh Allison\n\nAbducted by aliens, Evie thinks the only thing she has to strive for in her hellish new life is\nsurvival. Dragged halfway across the galaxy to the newly colonized farming world of Ipoch, she’s intended to be awarded as a prize to the winner of a barbaric gladiator fight. She hopes the champion isn’t cruel, she hopes he doesn’t have the capacity to harm her, but never once, does she hope to fall in love.\n\nSerif is done with fighting. He’s done with the threat it poses to his people. When he sees the beautiful Evie, however—there’s no turning back. He’ll agree to one last tournament to save the girl, and when he wins she’ll belong to him. Because this is more than just a battle, he soon realizes.
