It was a Belgian road...\n4:12 After 11 years of no-claim this stupidity damaged 2 rims and the front suspension (all fixed). In the end I only 1 shot made the edit...\n4:20 It is normal here to drive on the emergency lane, when indicated above the road. It is a solution to the rapid growing amount of traffic. This car seemed to have stalled.\n4:26 Here the open-to-traffic emergency lane changes to an exit. This car too ignored the open emergency lane and then took the exit very late.\n4:45 This is collected packaging material that was of course put into the plastic bin afterwards.\n\nPlease note: footage is copyrighted\n\"Sound Guy\" photo was taken in 2010 by a friendly lady who's name I've forgotten...",
