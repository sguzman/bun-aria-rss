  "description": "ONE man fits the whistleblower’s description perfectly – and it’s INCREDIBLE what he’s done. He worked closely with both Joe Biden and DNC operative Alexandra Chalupa AND helped set up the Russia collusion narrative! No wonder the Democrats want his name erased! But even the media is in on this cover-up, as Glenn proved in his special last night. Marion Smith, executive director of Victims of Communism, explains what Marxism actually is to the 70 percent of Millennials who would vote socialist. And in the spirit of Halloween, Glenn and Pat tell some eerily real news stories. And Glenn gives his rendition of “The Tell-Tale Heart” and reminds us of the REAL reason we’re paranoid about poisoned candy. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
