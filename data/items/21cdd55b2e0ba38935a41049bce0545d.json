  "description": "<p>We speak with ZED principal Engineer and CEO, Ahmed El Safty, the visionary behind the new technology. <br/><br/>He and his team of postdoctoral researchers and engineers have been developing the PowerCap technology for more than a decade. The PowerCap Hybrid Graphene battery is a sustainable energy storage system  that lasts two to three times longer than standard Lithium batteries. <br/><br/>It also provides up to ten times more power density – this means the energy is delivered instantly, important when powering mobile devices likes electric vehicles. <br/><br/>But how will this unique, new green technology change the way we live and work?</p>",
