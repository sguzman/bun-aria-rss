  "description": "<p>How much do you know about America's first documented serial killers, The Bloody Harpes? Micajah and Wiley Harpe went on a crazy murder spree out on the western American frontier, starting in late 1798. The murdered men, women, children, and even babies. And they'd been bad, murderous men long before their final year of terror. They'd ran with a gang of river pirates, they'd been members of a Tory rape gang during the Revolutionary War. They went on raids with a band of Cherokee warriors. They LOVED to try and split a skull in two with a tomahawk. Their entire crazy true crime story told this week.  <br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>: This month we donated $15,029 to Guide Dogs for the Blind, with an additional $1,669 added to our Scholarship Fund!
