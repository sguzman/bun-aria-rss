  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Jacksonville Jaguars, Pat's same game parlay that is available now on FanDuel, what other bets they like, and everything else around the league as we prepare for week 4 of the NFL season. Joining the program to chat about this weekend's game against Notre Dame is the Head Coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats, Luke Fickell. Pat and Luke chat about his quick turn around of Cincinnati, getting more national exposure, being mentioned for nearly ever head coaching vacancy in major college football, and how excited he is for this weekend's game in South Bend. Later 5x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, Safety for the Minnesota Vikings, Harrison Smith joins the show to chat about the team's morale after two heartbreakers, his style of play and how his play evolved once he was in the NFL, what it's like playing against the elite quarterback's in the league, his mutual respect for Aaron Rodgers and more. Later, Ariel Helwani joins the program fresh off a despicable deed committed on his own podcast today involving Pat, his Johnny Come Lately fanhood with the Buffalo Bills, everything going on in the MMA world, and more.
