  "description": "<p>Thursday 9/21 - Today on the show we had hilarious comedian Gary Owen stopped by and gave his thoughts about the Kevin Hart's sex scandal and even mentioned that with everything that is going on with him, he was not afraid to remind Kevin that he still owes him 2,000 from a bet that happened last year. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to two nurses who snapped pictures of themselves flipping off babies, and calling them mini satens.  Angela Yee helped some listeners out during \"Ask Yee\" and one in particular definitely needed to get out her relationship before it is too late. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
