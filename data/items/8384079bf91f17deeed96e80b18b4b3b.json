  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Manhattan District Attorney's office has been investigating Allen Weisselberg's private finances in an effort to cast an aura of guilt by association for his work in the Trump Organization and use of corporate apartments and company cars. This type of investigation is typically a civil matter but they are desperate to make it a criminal matter and put as many Trump associates in handcuffs as possible. Interestingly in the 2008 financial collapse, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office declined to prosecute many serious cases. New York State Attorney General Letitia James has sued Trump more than 70 times to try and make sure she kept her campaign promise to bring down Trump - this is the very essence of a political prosecution. After five years and millions of subpoenaed documents, this attack on corporate perks is the most egregious violation they could muster up. Then, Miranda Devine from the New York Post calls in to discuss how the media magnates are intertwined with the cover being provided to Hunter Biden. Devine explains how Hunter used his VP father's perks to pursue a deal with Mexican Billionaire Carlos Slim. Later, Arizona's State Attorney General, Mark Brnovich, joins the show to explain Arizona's win in the US Supreme Court regarding the States' laws on ballot harvesting. The Democrats challenged that voting outside of one's assigned precinct was discriminatory, however, the Court found that voting in your precinct was reasonable and did not impede one's right to vote.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
