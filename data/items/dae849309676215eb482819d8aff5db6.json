  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Today is Tax Day, the deadline for filing taxes (or an extension, gulp). To mark the occasion, the Treasury Department called on Congress to relieve some of the pressure on an underfunded, understaffed and ill-equipped IRS. Tens of millions of Americans are waiting for their tax returns to be processed &#8230; from the last year. We&#8217;ll also discuss speculation about how big the Federal Reserve&#8217;s next interest rate hike might be. And a gentle reminder following a federal judge&#8217;s ruling striking down the CDC&#8217;s public transportation mask mandate: Don&#8217;t be a jerk.
