  "description": "Ron Klain served as the chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. In 2014, President Barack Obama tapped him to lead the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. He successfully oversaw a hellishly complex effort preparing domestically for an outbreak and surging health resources onto another continent to contain the disease.\n But Klain is quick to say that the coronavirus is a harder challenge even than Ebola. The economy is in free fall. Entire cities have been told to shelter in place. And there’s no telling how long any of this will last. In this conversation, Klain answers my questions about the disease and how to respond to it, as well as questions many of you submitted. We discuss:\n\nHow to change the virus’s reproduction and fatality rates\n\nWhy you need to work backward from health system capacity\n\nWhat it means to “flatten the curve”\n\nWhy social distancing will be with us for a long time to come\n\nThe difference between “social distancing” and “self-quarantine”\n\nWhat the Trump administration needed to do earlier, and what they still can do now\n\nThe testing debacle\n\nThe economic policy necessary to make social distancing possible\n\nWhy we need to remember not everyone can work at home\n\nWhat it would take to surge health care capacity in the US — and how fast we could potentially do it \n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of America’s particular health care system in responding to a pandemic like this one\n\nWhether the coronavirus is showing authoritarian systems perform better than liberal(ish) democracies\n\nWhat Joe Biden is like in a crisis \n\n\nAnd much more. I’ve been covering the coronavirus nonstop, and this is one of the clearest, most useful conversations I’ve had. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, the clarity of Klain’s analysis will help.\n Also: We want to know what kinds of coronavirus conversations you want to hear right now.
