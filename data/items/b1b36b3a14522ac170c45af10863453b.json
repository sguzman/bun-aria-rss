  "description": "Buckle up! Short Wave is going on a road trip every Friday this summer. In this first episode of our series on the research happening in the National Park system, we head to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm\">Shenandoah National Park</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/great-dismal-swamp\">Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Some bats there are faring better than others against white-nose syndrome, a fungus that has killed more than 7 million bats in the last decade. Today — what researchers like <a href=\"https://cmi.vt.edu/Our_people_2/FTstaff/bio_DeLaCruz.html\">Jesse De La Cruz</a> think is enabling some bat species to survive. <br/><br/>As we road trip, we want to hear where in the world you are too — especially if you're at a national park! To be featured in an episode, send us a recording saying your name, location and \"You're listening to <em>Short Wave</em> — from NPR.\" Our email is <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>. We'd love to hear from you!",
