  "description": "This week, the gals break into a few cases about some daring folks with not much to lose and a whole lot to gain. Topics include some seriously sketchy landscapers, a braggadocios burglar with a YouTube channel, and the importance of good customer service. Pour a glass of Pheasant Run's Bank Robber Red Blend, map out your tunnel, remove your sunglasses, and tune in for Bank Heists.Â ",
