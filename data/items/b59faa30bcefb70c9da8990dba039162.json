And he's not schilling a book.</p><p>He's just an average dude living a pretty normal life.</p><p>But look deeper and you'll find a&nbsp;rather extraordinary story. The story of a guy who completely lost himself in the bleak darkness of drug and food addiction. Hopelessly hooked since high school on the superman rush provided by Adderall, Adam spent most of his twenties isolating and high — up all night playing video games and binging on fast food.</p><p>The heavier he got, the more he isolated, until he stopped caring altogether. Life shrank to a cycle of getting high, finding more Adderall, and repressing his increased depression and anger with more and more fast food — a lifestyle that left him over 300lbs with Type-2 diabetes on a crash course with an early grave. Out of cash, unemployable and alienated from friends and family, Adam finally faced a choice:</p><p>live on the street or&nbsp;reach out for help.</p><p>After extended stays in rehab and sober living facilities Adam found sobriety, peace of mind and a new lease on life.</p><p>Oh yeah — he also&nbsp;lost over 100 pounds, reversed his diabetes and repaired his physical health wholesale. How?</p><p>By adopting an active, plant-based lifestyle.</p><p>Today, Adam lives a conscious, purpose-driven life devoted to helping others achieve and maintain a holistic, healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Not surprisingly, this is a conversation about drug addiction, sobriety and nutrition. But it's also a conversation about cross-addiction, low self-esteem and an important issue rarely discussed — body dysmorphia and&nbsp;eating disorders in men.</p><p>I'm inspired by Adam's tale of everyman redemption and I think you will be too.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a> | <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a></p><p>Thank you to today's&nbsp;show sponsors:</p><p>Food Heals Podcast:&nbsp;Win a swag bag valued at $300 by subscribing to the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/food-heals-podcast-allison/id1031143256?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">Food Heals Podcast</a>,leaving a review on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/food-heals-podcast-allison/id1031143256?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> and tweeting a screenshot of your review to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foodhealsnation\" target=\"_blank\">@FoodHealsNation</a>&nbsp;on Twitter or e-mail your screenshot to info@foodhealsnation.com and tell them you heard about it from the RRP.</p><p>Bonobos.com: For a limited time, all new customers can get 20% off their first order when you go to <a href=\"https://bonobos.com/brilliant\" target=\"_blank\">Bonobos.com/brilliant</a> to discover the difference that an expertly-crafted, better-fitting wardrobe can make.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.storeus.foursigmafoods.com/#_a_roll\" target=\"_blank\">Four Sigma Foods:</a> combining fast-food convenience with superfood effectiveness in a revolutionary new way.
