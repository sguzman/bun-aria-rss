  "description": "<p>What can I say?  It’s no secret that my favorite thing about the homestead is without question the animals.  Whether you already have animals on your homestead or not, introducing something new can sometimes be intimidating.  Today we’re once again joined by my sister Jenna as she embarks on a chicken journey of her own.  We cover all of the basics including how many chickens you should buy, what you need to feed them, and the type of shelter they’ll need.  If you need to start from the ground up, this is the perfect episode for you.  If you already have chickens and just need a few laughs, Jenna and I are sure to keep you entertained. </p><p>A big thanks to our August sponsor— Union Wireless!
