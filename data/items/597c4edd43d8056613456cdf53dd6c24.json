  "description": "My amazing and talented wife Lisa released her new book Radical Confidence, which you can order - and get the bonuses she’s created for you - at <a href=\"https://www.radicalconfidence.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.radicalconfidence.com</a>. When you read this book, Lisa will teach you 10 No-BS Life Lessons to become the hero of your own life and take MASSIVE bold action to achieve your potential!<br /><br />What does it mean to live a good life filled with purpose? Obviously, the answer can only be personal to your individual preferences, values, and beliefs, but are you consciously deciding the quality of your life?<br /><br />Ryan Holiday is a best-selling author times 10, media strategist, influential speaker, and bookstore owner. He’s best known for his writings on ancient stoic philosophy and its application for everyday life. The New York Times credited Ryan for the increasing popularity of stoicism.<br /><br />In this discussion, Ryan shares his thoughts and lessons learned about how he came to see what living a good life is for him. Questioning the things you give your time and energy over is the beginning for any of us that want to unpack what we’re doing, who we’re doing it for, and how it adds value with meaning to us. It’s not enough to be a human doing any and everything without intention and clarity. Ryan points out that it's better to learn and practice what it is to just be a human “being.”<br /><br />If the day to day mindless actions of work, preparing dinner, and stressing over getting more clients to increase your revenue is part of your reality, then taking this time to thing through what the right goal is for your to focus on and what you want out of life may be the most important moment in your life thus far.<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Ryan Holiday<br />0:25 | How to Live A Good Life<br />10:35 | Choosing The Right Goal <br />15:35 | What You Want Is What You Value<br />21:42 | Time Between Stimulus and Response<br />28:20 | Using Feedback Effectively<br />34:26 | Check Your Ego for Success<br />43:03 | Get Out of Your Way<br />46:13 | Defining Success for Ryan<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“We seem to have a limitless capacity to steal time from ourselves.” [2:49]<br /><br />“We protect our physical space much more than we protect our time, even though physical space can be regained and time can never be regained.” [3:15]<br /><br />“If you think that action is the end all be all, you end up doing action for the sake of doing action, [...] sometimes you’re just supposed to just be.” [4:24]<br /><br />“It’s this balance. Once you’ve arrived, the thing that got you there is now in some ways your worst enemy.” [8:18]<br /><br />“Where ego comes in is like we've got the things that impress other people, and then the real meaningful impact that we're trying to have.” [12:12]<br /><br />“What do people do with their money? They buy freedom, but oftentimes, they give up freedom to get money. [17:47]<br /><br />“It's about sort of cultivating an awareness, and a process of continual reflection on the data that your life is creating all the time.” [23:39]<br /><br />“You're not trying to get to perfection right now. You're just trying to get a little bit better than you were yesterday or an hour ago.” [25:16]<br /><br />“If you're trying to be everything for everyone, and you read feedback, you're just going to get more lost.” [31:45]<br /><br />“If I'm going to use my emotions, I want to be calm internally, but projecting the emotional response that's going to be effective in that situation, but I don't want to be jerked around by those emotions unconsciously.” [40:30]<br /><br />\"We have a limitless capacity to steal time from ourselves.\" Tom Bilyeu<br /><br />Follow Ryan Holiday:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://ryanholiday.net/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://ryanholiday.net/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanholiday\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/ryanholiday</a> <br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ryanholiday\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/ryanholiday</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryanholiday/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/ryanholiday/</a>",
