  "description": "John Bolton’s first day as National Security Advisor presents him with the kind of opportunities he has waited his entire life for—a choice between worsening relations and possible military action against Syria, Iran and North Korea.  Where will he succeed in making Trump’s terrible instincts worse?  Or is there a chance he might become in his new role a more responsible voice creating a constructive meaningful process that produces wise policy outcomes.  (Nah.  There isn’t a Tiara of Optimism big or powerful enough to expect that outcome.)  Join us as we discuss with the Angels of Doom—Rosa Brooks and Sam Vinograd, the reigning holder of the Tiara of Optimism, Kori Schake and the wise (and therefore pessimistic) Julie Smith.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
