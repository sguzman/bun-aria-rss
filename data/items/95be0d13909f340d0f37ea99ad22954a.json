Because this ultimate acceleration is large, any effect related to &#946; will become easy to test, including quantum gravity tests. In this paper, an approach is put forward to connect the ultimate acceleration with quantum theory, and is applied to sunspot problems. The sunspot cycle is calculated to be 10.93 years due to the ultimate acceleration. Due to quantum effect of the ultimate acceleration, the atmospheric constructive interference condition takes place at certain latitudes where are traditional habitats of migratory birds, so this relativistic approach provides a direction guidance for bird migration.\n  \n   "
