  "description": "This week, the gals practice their curtsies and chat about some fancy ladies with a dark side. Topics include a very suspicious widow, a daring Irish activist, and the Texas Dip (and not one that involves queso). Pour a dainty sip of 90+ Cellars Sauvignon Blanc, ask your father's permission, and tune in for Delinquent Debutantes (Live from Dallas)!",
