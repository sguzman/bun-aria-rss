  "description": "<div>On this week's episode, the subject of many a late night with Laura and her boyfriend is made into a main discussion for MuggleCast as the hosts and Marc talk through the physics of <em>Harry Potter</em>! Surely magical objects don't come from 'nowhere,' and there must be a magical cost for doing magic somehow?
