  "title": "Karl Ove Knausgaard didn't mean to write a 666-page book",
  "description": "The Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard gained an international reputation thanks to his breakout autobiographical series <em>My Struggle </em>-- but he actually made his literary debut in the world of fiction. Now, he's returned to that world with his novel <em>The Morning Star</em>, a dark tale of the uncanny events that unfold after a new star appears in the sky. Unlike his previous series, the book features multiple perspectives and otherworldly incidents that seem ripped from the pages of the Bible. But as the author explains to NPR's Leila Fadel, those acts of God happen alongside the mundanity of everyday life, in true Knausgaardian fashion. ",
