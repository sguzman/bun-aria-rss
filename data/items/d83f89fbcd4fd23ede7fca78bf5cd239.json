Next, the guys assess winners & losers for all the trades that occurred on Monday (19:45), with a heavy focus on the Texans dealing away DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals, but without forgetting DeForest Buckner going from the 49ers to the Colts and the Falcons getting Hayden Hurst from the Ravens. The Pick Six Superfriends then issue more winners & losers for signings that took place (43:45), including a look a flurry of moves from the Dolphins and Browns. Finally, Will, Ryan, John and Sean offer analysis of the tags that were applied at the deadline (1:21:00), discussing who used them wisely and who did not.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Castbox, Bullhorn and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS @johnbreech, @seanjwagner\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
