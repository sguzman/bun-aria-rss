    "media:description": "Pennysavers were a free community periodical that advertised cheap items for sale, often with a description like '$30 Dresser for sale OB. Contact Lisa.'.\nAnd it was these women who would be targeted by Bobby Joe Long, earning him the name 'The Classified Ads Rapist'. But then he took it a step further, murdering at least 10 women in the Tampa Bay area before a brave 17-year-old girl named Lisa McVey escaped his clutches and assisted the police in bringing an end to Bobby Joe Long.\n\nSimon's Social Media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SimonWhistler\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/simonwhistler/\n\nLove content?
