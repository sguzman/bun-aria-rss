  "description": "The late 1960s were a golden age of air travel - spacious legroom, glamorous flight attendants, delicious meals on every flight... and a rash of violent hijackings. Some were politically motivated, while others were fueled by greed. The most famous and mysterious hijacker of all took control of a 727 with nothing more than a black briefcase, a handwritten note, and a pair of sunglasses. He got his money, and his parachutes, then disappeared into the night, never to be heard from again. Did he die in the Washington wilderness? Or did he manage to make an escape with his bag of cash?\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
