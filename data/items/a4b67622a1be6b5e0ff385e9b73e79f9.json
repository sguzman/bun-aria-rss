  "itunes:summary": "The 2020 US presidential election will take place amidst the background of a global pandemic, high unemployment, protests for racial justice, catastrophic wildfires wrought by climate change, and rising political polarisation. At stake is the direction of federal politics and policymaking for the next four years, as well as control of the Senate, the House of Representatives and a number of state offices. What can we expect from a Joe Biden administration or a second term of Donald Trump? In this panel discussion, four leading experts—Brian Klaas (Washington Post and UCL CUSP), Anne Joseph O'Connell (Stanford Law School), Colin Provost (UCL CUSP), and Sherrill Stroschein (UCL SPP)—will discuss politics, policy, and governance under Trump’s first term and what this election may bring after Election Day.",
