He is also the author of the international best-selling book Why We Sleep and the host of \"The Matt Walker Podcast.\" We discuss the biology of sleep, including its various stages and what specifically happens to those stages when we don't get enough sleep. We also discuss the effects of sunlight, caffeine, alcohol, naps, hormones, exercise, marijuana, sexual activity, and various supplements on sleep.
