  "title": "#308: The Case for Blue Collar Work With Mike Rowe",
  "description": "<p>My guest today is Mike Rowe, former host of Dirty Jobs, and current blue collar trade advocate.<br />On the show, Mike and I discuss where the idea for Dirty Jobs came from and why a show about blue collar workers became a surprise hit. We then explore why we devalue blue collar work, the societal and individual consequences of that devaluation, and what Mike is doing to make pursuing vocational and trade work cool and viable again.<br />If you’re a young man trying to figure out if college and an office job is right for you, or if you’re a guy in a dead end office job looking for an alternative, Mike’s going to make a strong case for why you should consider putting on a hard hat and getting your hands dirty.</p>\n",
