  "description": "<p>This week Matt and I are joined in the studio once again by friend of TST Rick Radcliffe. We start off with an off topic conversation on watches specifically Matt's new GuardsRed watch and my new Apple Watch. From there we cover Rick's cross country trip in the million mile Lexus and its likely former life as a roaming Floridian bass and ecstasy dispensary. From there all three of us discuss the various states of disuse and/or repair of our Corvettes and we wrap up with Matt's review of the Dinan BMW M4 and the 034 Motorsport TT RS.</p>\n",
