  "description": "My special guest is author and security expert Spencer Coursen here to discuss why we must take responsibility for our own personal safety. Get his book Safety Trap: A Security Expert's Secrets for Staying Safe in a Dangerous World on Amazon.\nThreat management expert Spencer Coursen offers proactive strategies to protect yourself and your loved ones in the event of hostile encounters and emergency situations in The Safety Trap: A Security Expert’s Secrets for Staying Safe in a Dangerous World. \nDespite what the news and social media would have you believe, we have never lived in a safer time than we are now. Unfortunately, we live under a false sense of security enforced by authorities that only alleviates fears without reducing risk. We have placed our personal safety, and our responsibilities of guarding it, into the hands of people trained only to respond to crises, not actively prevent them. Our blind faith in institutions to protect us has only dulled our natural survival instincts. \nThe truth is that when we feel safest is actually when we are in the most danger. This is the paradox of The Safety Trap. \nWhen you don’t expect danger, you simply fail to see the signs that something bad is about to happen. But the signs are always there, and staying safe is about training yourself to see them. In easy-to-implement methods of maintaining vigilance, assessing risk, and taking preventative measures, you’ll discover how to be alert without anxiety and know how to best protect and defend yourself on the job, in school, in public places, at home, and online.   \nWith Coursen’s simple formula of Awareness + Preparation = Safety as your guide - as well as real world examples of managing threats - you will learn how to develop the skills and confidence to reclaim your own security and avoid The Safety Trap. \n\nListen AD-FREE by subscribing to our channel on Apple Podcasts!
