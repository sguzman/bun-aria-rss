  "description": "Roger Stone was very upset the FBI made his dog anxious when they raided his home.  He also was unhappy he did not have chance to put on a nice suit before being hauled in court.  On the other hand, who cares?  He's a big time sleaze and deserves everything he gets.  Meanwhile, no one deserves to be abused as the people of Venezuela have been first by Hugo Chavez and then by Nicolas Maduro.  So the U.S. is helping to lead a push to oust Maduro.What does that have to do with Stone?  Listen in to Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law, Kori Schake of IISS, David Sanger of the NY Times and Ed Luce of the Financial Times to learn the answer (if the title didn't give it away.)Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
