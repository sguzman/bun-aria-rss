Our bodies are extremely intelligent, so why are they acting so dumb and having so many dysfunctions? Using the lens of Functional Medicine, we can see that a disease is so much more than its location. With inflammation smoldering throughout the body in many people, we need to zero in on the immune system, how it’s functioning, and what factors are negatively impacting it. We’re in an exciting time for research in this area, as we continue to learn how to fix the problems behind an aging immune system.&nbsp;</p><br><p>There’s no better person to talk to about this topic than the one and only Dr. Jeff Bland. Dr. Bland is the founder of Big Bold Health, a company on a mission to transform the way people think about one of nature’s greatest innovations—the immune system. Through Big Bold Health, Jeff is advocating for the power of immuno-rejuvenation to enhance immunity at a global level, often through the rediscovery of ancient food crops and superfoods. To get there, Jeff is building a network of small farms and suppliers throughout the US that take a clear stance on regenerative agriculture, environmental stewardship, and planetary health. Jeff’s career in health spans more than 40 years. A nutritional biochemist by training, he began in academia as a university professor.
