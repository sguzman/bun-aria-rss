  "description": "Today’s show is highlighted by three incredible conversations. First, Pat is joined by 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, Gold Glove Winner, member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, and friend of the show, Kevin Youkilis. Pat and Youk chat about baseball finally being back as the Yanks and Nats and Giants and Dodgers both kick off the MLB season tomorrow. They discuss who Youk thinks will come out hot, if he thinks Astros hitters are going to need to be worried about getting thrown at, what he’s heard about the MLB testing policy, and why this Opening Day is particularly tough for him (2:33-23:07). Next, Hall of Famer, 8x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, 2005 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, 2000 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, member of the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, one of the “Top 100 Bears of All Time,” former Middle Linebacker, Brian Urlacher joins the program. Pat and Brian chat about his current different business endeavors including being in an ownership group attempting to buy the New York Mets, his hair transplant company, RESTORE, what he’s been up to since he retired, his thoughts on Chicago acquiring Nick Foles after saying the job was Trubisky’s, his thoughts on the Packers drafting Aaron Rodgers’ replacement, who the toughest person he had to tackle was, and how he thinks playing linebacker has changed in the NFL since he was in the league (24:11-49:01). Lastly, is former Colorado Buffaloes basketball star, 38th overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft, and current Point Guard for the Brooklyn Nets, Spencer Dinwiddie joins the show. Pat and Spencer chat about what he has heard about how things are in the bubble, how disappointed he isn’t down there with the Nets after testing positive for COVID-19, what made Brooklyn so alluring for guys like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, his kickstarter campaign to raise money and let his fans potentially pick where he plays next, and who he thinks is going to have an advantage in the bubble, the younger players, or the vets (50:35-1:09:22). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch, and be sure to check out tonight’s livestream watch along of Yankees/Nationals on youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow.
