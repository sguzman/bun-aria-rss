  "description": "Part two of John Robinson is somehow crazier than part one! He stays on his bullshit: scamming people out of thousands of dollars, continuing to fake his philanthropist ways and he’s still trying to tell us that Lisa Stassi is happy and in Colorado with a man named Bill. Only this time, we’ve got people who are on to him… including the actual FBI. Somehow, even with them on his tail, John Robinson manages to murder 6 women in between prison stents.
