  "description": "<p>Kirk takes a moment today to honor the spectacular shitheads in the Minifan world, from Australia to Massachusetts. Intern Justin continues his one-man jihad against Benjamin Allbright, the Colorado radio host and fabulist who received some real sad news the other day (0:45:30). Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama have teamed up with Spotify, and about 10 million staffers, to produce \"Renegades: Born in America,\" a hit new podcast that Kirk really, really enjoys (1:01:00). Kirk has trouble deciding what he wants to defend more: Kevin Clancy's now-deleted Tiger tweets or Woody Allen's criticism of the new HBO Max documentary.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
