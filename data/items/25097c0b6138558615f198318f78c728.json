  "description": "<p>When I was 23-years-old I attended Malaika’s African dance class and knew I needed to learn from her. I trained under her in 5Elements Shamanic Dance Activation and she has remained a dear friend and mentor since. In this episode, we dive deep into connecting with Earth, our womb and our bodies during this time.</p> <p>We address the fears and concerns that are arising and why it’s more important than ever we tune into our bodies to feel what feels resonant for us. She then guides us through a meditation to connect to our wombs and anchor into our internal feminine energy. Malaika’s episodes are always amongst my favorite and I’m so glad to have her here on the podcast for the third time.</p> <p>Connect with Malaika at inmyelements.com/</p> <p>Being part of a conscious online community is more important than ever before.
