We strive to make education more accessible by creating programs to engage students around the world. As part of <a href=\"https://diversity.google/\">our initiatives focused on expanding diversity</a>, we offer academic scholarships and trips to Google offices to learn more about our company and culture, network with a community of fellow scholars, and participate in professional development opportunities. Our goal is to not only support academic pursuits, but also empower scholars to encourage and inspire others.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NpfsBQA1TmQ/XRus8yR4UJI/AAAAAAAAAnM/L4-IEW_foB43wpxOAOXH7NcpYs_bL_hcwCLcBGAs/s1600/D3BF3D86-C32F-4045-B637-F9E550600FEB.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1440\" data-original-width=\"1440\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NpfsBQA1TmQ/XRus8yR4UJI/AAAAAAAAAnM/L4-IEW_foB43wpxOAOXH7NcpYs_bL_hcwCLcBGAs/s1600/D3BF3D86-C32F-4045-B637-F9E550600FEB.jpeg\" /></a></div><br />We are thrilled to announce this years recipients who represent 77 universities in 17 countries.
