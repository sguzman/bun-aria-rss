  "description": "Compassion is powerful. Jesus didn’t just feel sorry for those in need. He didn’t say, “Oh well, that’s too bad.” No, His compassion moved Him to action. In the same way, 1 John 3:17 says about us, “If anyone…sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart of compassion against him, how can the love of God live in him?” We all have a heart of compassion that God wants to work through toward others, and it can either be open or shut. If it is shut off, God’s love cannot flow out of it, which I believe is the reason some of us are unhappy today. We’ve closed our heart of compassion. If we’re going to live the abundant life that God has given us, we need to stir up our heart of compassion and say, “God, open my heart and my eyes to see the people who need my love today.”<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
