They seek to destroy our healthcare system. The Democratic Party is a wrecking ball. Who's rooting for the Democratic Party? Our enemies. Is America really so bad that we need a party like this?

Later, high paid athletes earning hundreds of millions of dollars are rarely attacked by Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and the others. They always critique corporate CEO's for earning that kind of money, but athletes are off the table. Afterwards, the attack on Prime Minister Netanyahu continues despite his record of achievement.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
