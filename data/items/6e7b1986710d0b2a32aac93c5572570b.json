  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Chapter Ten - Election Cliches, Hypocrisy & Evangelical Politics. Matthew 6:1-4. This is the beginning of the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. In this episode we discuss phrases such as ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and how they are used during tumultuous times such as these. Are they helpful or even accurate? How do they reflect  action and here & now Kingdom of Jesus? This section starts with hypocrisy. How does Jesus define it? What are the implications? How are we to navigate service and spiritual disciplines? \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
