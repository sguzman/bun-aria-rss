After our last episode on Airbnb we knew we needed to address investment property broadly, as they’re a pillar of our future financial security. We’ll have more episodes where we’ll get more specific and discuss things like return on investment (ROI), insurance, and screening tenants. But for now, we’re just covering the basics. And at the beginning of this episode we cracked open an IPA – Scatterbrain by Bearded Iris Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to subscribe and review us in iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts!</p><p>For specific links and additional information about this episode, head over to our site: <a href=\"https://www.howtomoney.com/\">HowToMoney.com</a> .
