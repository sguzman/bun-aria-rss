  "description": "<div>The scientists took the show on the road for the first ever live episode of Stiff Socks at the Life Is Beautiful festival in Las Vegas. They riffed on the extreme lack of clothes at music festivals, shitting your pants at coachella, and Lewis and Clarking your asshole. They also talked to some fans about their OF accounts and surveyed the audience about the wildest places they've had sex in public. <br>\n<br>\nGet 4 bonnus episodes a month for $5 at <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod\">www.patreon.com/stiffsockspod<br>\n</a><br>\nThanks to Honey for sponsoring this episode.
