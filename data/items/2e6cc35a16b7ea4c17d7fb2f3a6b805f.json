  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never thought I would make this episode but here I am. My parents fled from the Islamic Revolution in Iran and it has created a great deal of trauma in my lineage. In this episode, I share the story of a beautiful country that was overtaken by tyrannical patriarchal dictatorship. I discuss why this moment is SO significant, especially as a woman, and why this is the time we need to be EMBODYING the divine feminine we preach about and showing up for our sisters being killed for basic human rights.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please share this episode to raise awareness. We need as many international eyes on this as possible.
