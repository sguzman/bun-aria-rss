  "description": "<p>On The Literary Life podcast this week, we will wrap up our series on Shakespeare’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn\">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a></em>. Our hosts, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas walk through the last two acts of the play, sharing their thoughts on the structure and ideas presented here. Angelina talks about why she thinks Shakespeare resolves the different conflicts the way he does. They discuss the importance of the play within the play, the fairy tale atmosphere, and the unreality of time and space. Cindy and Angelina both bring up plot points that feel slightly problematic to them. Angelina highlights the theme of harmonizing discord and bringing order from disorder.</p> <p>On February 8th, Angelina will be offering a webinar on Jonathan Swift: Enemy of the Enlightenment. Check it out at <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian. The live online conference will take place April 7-9, 2022, and you can go to <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/eventss/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Revolutionaries always hang their best friends.</p> <cite>Christopher Hollis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>It is easy to forget that the man who writes a good love sonnet needs not only be enamored of a woman, but also to be enamored of the sonnet.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>For the end of imagination is harmony. A right imagination, being the reflex of the creation, will fall in with the divine order of things as the highest form of its own operation; “will tune its instrument here at the door” to the divine harmonies within; will be content alone with growth towards the divine idea, which includes all that is beautiful in the imperfect imagination of men; will know that every deviation from that growth is downward; and will therefore send the man forth from its loftiest representations to do the commonest duty of the most wearisome calling in a hearty and hopeful spirit. This is the work of the right imagination; and towards this work every imagination, in proportion to the rightness that is in it, will tend. The reveries even of the wise man will make him stronger for his work; his dreaming as well as his thinking will render him sorry for past failure, and hopeful of future success.</p> <cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote> <h3>Earth’s Secret</h3> <p><em>by George Meredith</em></p> <pre class=\"wp-block-verse\">Not solitarily in fields we find Earth's secret open, though one page is there; Her plainest, such as children spell, and share With bird and beast; raised letters for the blind. Not where the troubled passions toss the mind, In turbid cities, can the key be bare. It hangs for those who hither thither fare, Close interthreading nature with our kind. They, hearing History speak, of what men were, And have become, are wise.  The gain is great In vision and solidity; it lives. Yet at a thought of life apart from her, Solidity and vision lose their state, For Earth, that gives the milk, the spirit gives. </pre> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HuExsp\"><em>Fossett’s Memory</em></a> by Christopher Hollis</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/34kNu9x\"><em>A Dish of Orts</em></a> by George MacDonald</p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/32YGQoG\"><em>A Preface to Paradise Lost</em></a> by C.
