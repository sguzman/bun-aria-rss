Seriously, they’re nothing but trouble - and an immediate report to the fashion police. Speaking of fashion (this is becoming a reoccurring thing, Vogue, watch out), we are giving you the IN’S AND OUT’S of how to not only get away with that fake designer bag of yours, but how to spot them as well! Because we ALL know that girl who has 11 different Chanels and you CANNOT wrap your head around how the fuck she got them. I mean, bartending at your local bar and doing lashes on the side only makes SO much money. Finally, Sofia gives her condolences to Gabby Petito, her loved ones, and ALL of the women around the world that are missing or battling domestic violence. Abuse does NOT discriminate and we must do what we can to protect each other, if no one is going to protect us. \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nEpisode promo codes:\nGrove: http://grove.com/SOFIA to receive a FREE starter set with your first order\nAZO: http://azoproducts.com promo code RADIO for 20% off AZO Dual Protection\nShip Station: http://shipstation.com promo code SOFIA for 60% off\nDipsea: http://dipseastories.com/SOFIA\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
