  "description": "<p>This week, we're prompting you to pause and think about what you want. So many online courses promise success through tag lines like \"Sell more art\" or \"Build a Six-Figure Art Business,\" and it's natural to assume that should be the goal for everyone. Of course there is nothing wrong with wanting to earn a good living from our work, but it isn't the only way to go. It's too easy to get sucked into pursuing things that others value without truly understanding if they are important to us. Perhaps you don't want to sell your art... or maybe you want to supplement your income in some other way. &nbsp;Maybe you want a gallery ... or perhaps you just want to sell online.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we discuss the importance of admitting our desires to ourselves. If we don't acknowledge and accept them, no-one else will! Alice then shares 5 key questions that can help you get to the root of your own desires and preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Self Care Club podcast: How to Have a Difficult Conversation<br>\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-to-have-a-difficult-conversation/id1505703522?i=1000578355383\"><u>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/how-to-have-a-difficult-conversation/id1505703522?i=1000578355383</u></a></p>\n<p>Gary Vee on choosing what you want: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB_6brOEEgM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB_6brOEEgM</a><br>\n<br>\nKen Spooner <a href=\"https://www.cornwallcontemporary.com/exhibition/ken-spooner-exhibition/\">https://www.cornwallcontemporary.com/exhibition/ken-spooner-exhibition/</a></p>\n<p>Joan Eardley Painting at Tate St Ives <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/eardley-salmon-net-posts-t04133\">https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/eardley-salmon-net-posts-t04133</a></p>\n<p>Find Alice and Louise at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
