  "description": "You ask your child to put on their shoes or brush their teeth, and you’re met with a flat-out “No!” If you’re like most parents, you’re familiar with the power struggle that follows: You insist, your kid resists or ignores you, you get frustrated, they get frustrated, and nobody wins. The good news? There’s another way. This week, Dr. Becky answers questions from three different parents about tricky moments of refusal with their kids. As always, she zooms out to consider the big picture: Why do our kids say “no” in the first place? Then, she offers actionable scripts and strategies to connect to your child’s experience, while embodying your authority as a parent. You’ll leave this episode with a game-changing framework for resistance and a ton of tools to increase cooperation in your home. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
