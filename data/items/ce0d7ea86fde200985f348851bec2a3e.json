  "description": "<p>Matt & Bowen guest on the latest episode of StraightioLab, the latest podcast to join the Big Money Players Network. In the first official episode of season three, George and Sam gab wistfully about missing each other’s company, Munchausen as an artistic practice, and The Chromatica Ball. Then, they are joined by network sisters Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang to address the two pillars of straight comedy: awkwardness and randomness. Is being awkward and random a response to fearing the unknown? Can you be one without the other? Was the movie Juno a slay? Plus: Everyone gets in touch with their feelings — for the last time EVER.
