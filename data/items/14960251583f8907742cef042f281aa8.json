  "description": "<p>In this episode of Architecture, Design & Photography we sit down with Linda Meyers, Co-Founder of Wary Meyers, a soap and candle company based in southern Maine. Husband-and-wife team Wary Meyers started out in Brooklyn designing interiors for their friends and artsy-types. After a magazine column for Time Out New York and a book, they relocated to Maine, decorated their own Portland apartment which would grace many magazines and countless blogs, and still created interiors and installations back in the city. Feeling the desire to make a tangible product, they've taken their design sensibilities and infused them into enticingly scented candles and soaps, which they hand-make in their Cumberland home- working in an attached former beauty salon built for the previous lady-of-the-house in the 1980's. Both the candles and soaps are informed with the Meyers' playful wit and panache, one candle fragrant with cannabis and suntan oil, and their boldly striped soaps, loosely inspired by Italian design icon Ettore Sottsass's \"Superboxes\" in fact look more like a design object than anything else. </p><p>More from Linda Meyers:</p><p>Website: https://warymeyers.bigcartel.com/ </p><p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/warymeyers/ </p><p> </p><p>More from us: </p><p>Website: http://www.trentbell.com </p><p>Instagram: http://instagram.com/trentbellphotography/ </p><p>Podcast: https://architecture-design-photography.simplecast.com/ </p><p>Sign up for our newsletter: https://mailchi.mp/trentbell/4gxv31ifsz </p>\n",
