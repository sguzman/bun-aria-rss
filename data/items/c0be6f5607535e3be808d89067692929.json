There are some really fantastic tips and some great encouragement in this episode, friends. Even if you don’t have kids (or don’t like kids), I’m guessing you know a reader in your life who would love to hear this chunk, so pass it along!</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands: we’ve got one that has been mentioned many times on the podcast but never “pressed” and one that should be in your box of Christmas books that you haul out every December.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode.
