  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, New York Attorney General Letitia James is attacking former President Donald Trump as a political stunt prior to her reelection to rile up her base. James is disgusting for abusing her power this way. She should be disbarred. Then, an FBI Whistleblower has come forward. Still, Democrats think the whistleblower law only pertains to leftists, so he's been fired after suggesting that the Washington, DC bureau is maliciously politicized. Later, Donald Trump, Jr. calls in to share that he was dragged into a deposition with 12 attorneys from the Attorney General's Office. Don Jr. says that there is no equal justice under the law anymore and this is more of the same witch hunt we've seen since Russia gate. Afterward, New York Attorney General candidate Michael Henry joins the show to discuss his campaign against Letitia James. Henry cites James' anti-police stance is failing the state and offers a law-and-order alternative. Henry is statically tied with James in recent polling. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
