  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden is trying to get in front of the coronavirus to create the appearance that he's ramping things up with vaccine production. Biden claims all adults will be vaccinated by end of May 2021. The reality is that Donald Trump bought hundreds of millions of vaccines from 7 different companies, including Johnson & Johnson and Merck to hedge against potentially ineffective vaccines from each vendor. Biden and his aide, Ron Klain, are clueless about what needs to be done and what was done by the Trump Administration. Then, if the left is offended by Dr. Seuss, Curious George, the Muppets, or Mr. Potato Head they can go to hell. Cancel culture is ruing our society and that is what must be canceled. Later, the left increase property taxes to pay for the salaries, pensions, and medical benefits of teachers that are not in class. Dr. Jill Biden knows Joe isn't capable of running the United States and she does nothing about it. Afterward, HR 1 bill is the actualization of the Cloward-Piven strategy to overwhelm the system. This new law would register multiple ineligible voters including illegal aliens since there'd be no voter ID requirements. The Democrats got it wrong on slavery, then the Holocaust, and now this.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
