  "description": "<p>As environmentally healthful and thoughtful eaters pile on the vegetables and fruits and push animal protein off their plates, the desire for more recipes showcasing fresh produce has gone sky high. On this week’s episode of <em>Eat Your Words</em>, Talia Ralph chats with Myra Goodman, author of <em>Straight from the Earth: Irresistible Vegan Recipes for Everyone</em>. Myra Goodman, and her husband Drew, founded Earthbound Farm on their 2.5 acre raspberry farm in Carmel Valley, California in 1984. They were the first to successfully market packaged salads for retail sale, and their farm grew to become the largest grower of organic produce in North America. Earthbound’s 200 growers collectively avoid the use of about 15 million pounds of conventional agricultural chemicals every year. Myra offers some great insight and perspective into vegan eating, diet choices and plant based foods.
