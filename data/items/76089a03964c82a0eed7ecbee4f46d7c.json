  "description": "<div>Niamh Maye was an adventurous teenager. She grew up in a large family in the northern New South Wales town of Armidale, in Australia. After finishing high school, she took a gap year in 2002 and embarked on a working holiday picking fruit in the rural town of Batlow. As Easter approached, Niamh made plans to travel to Sydney to meet her sister, Fionnuala, and brother Kieron, so they could travel back to Armidale to spend Easter with their family.<br>\n <br>\nBut Niamh never made it home.<br>\n<br>\nIf you know anything, please contact us. Something that doesn’t seem significant to you might help us put the jigsaw pieces together. Your information could be the missing piece. Please get in touch at <a href=\"https://missingniamh.com\">missingniamh.com</a>\n</div>\n",
