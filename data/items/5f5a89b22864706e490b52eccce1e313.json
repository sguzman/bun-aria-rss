  "description": "<p>You probably know Molly Shannon best from her iconic Saturday Night Live characters - quirky Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher, proud (and limber!) 50-year old Sally O&rsquo;Malley, and Delicious Dish co-host Terri Rialto. There&rsquo;s so much more to her story though. From losing her mom and sister in a tragic car accident at the age of 4 and growing up with her adventurous, fun-loving dad to coming into her own as a comedian and actor and becoming a mother herself, her life is proof positive that humor and joy can comingle with pain and sorrow. She shares it all in her new memoir, &ldquo;Hello, Molly!&rdquo; and in this week&rsquo;s episode of Next Question. It&rsquo;s a candid, heartfelt &ndash; and yes &ndash;<em> very</em> funny conversation you don&rsquo;t want to miss.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
