  "description": "This month, the gals daydream about travel by discussing some horrific tales from a certain Italian region. Topics include the most nightmarish flag on the planet, some very ballsy journalists, alleged spontaneous combustion by aliens, and a seriously brutal war between families with a shockingly high body count. Pop open a gorgeous bottle of Sallier de La Tour Nero d'Avola, keep a fire extinguisher on hand, and tune in for Sicilian Crimes.",
