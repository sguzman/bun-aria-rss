  "description": "Trey Zoeller makes his return and we are also joined by his father, Chet Zoeller. We go back in time, before Jefferson's Bourbon was established, to see how the Co-Founders sourced whiskey. We look at the current landscape to see if they feel pressure as sourcing becomes much harder when distilleries want to hang on to current stocks and people with deeper pockets enter the industry. We delve into Chet's past by talking about prohibition era whiskey and ask if he thinks Jefferson's Ocean is a gimmick. Trey and Chet provide knowledge behind growing a business and making pivots to find new opportunities.\nShow Notes:\n\nJoin Bourbon Pursuit on March 16th at The Louisville Bourbon Society meeting - http://www.thebourbonsociety.org/\n\n\nThe week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about getting caught up in the moment.\n\nTalk about growing up around bourbon.\n\nWhat made you think getting into bourbon was going to work?\n\nDoes 25 year old Irish Whiskey take on as much oak as bourbon in the US?\n\nHow did you go about sourcing barrels?\n\nChet, talk about your books and how you are a historian.\n\nDid you think Jefferson's would be as successful as it is today?\n\nWhat roadblocks did you hit?\n\nDid you feel like you were pricing it too high at first?\n\nWhat’s the next big hurdle for bourbon to take over scotch?\n\nAre many brands underselling themselves today?\n\nWhat flavor profile were you aiming for when you started Jefferson's?\n\nDid you start off selling in Kentucky only?\n\nTalk about the first blending experience.\n\nHow did you name Old Iron Skillet?\n\nDo you have any tips on blending?\n\nIf you tap into a barrel that isn't good, how can you know it will be better in a few years?\n\nTell us about all the moving parts of sourcing whiskey.\n\nDo you have a turf war problem when sourcing?\n\nWhat did you think of Trey’s Ocean experiment.
