  "description": "<p>This episode I get deep on a talk given by Alan Watts. He references Carl Jung and his \"Element of Irreducible Rascality\" - meaning Jung was a fully integrated deep ass bro who accepted all parts of his emotional world. He had a rascally twinkle in his eye because he accepted what was guilty, shameful and anxious in himself. Being someone who has all these feelings, I'd like to know how it's possible to feel all these things and not get all wound up over it. Also, why are people rude to wait staff? Jung may have some insight into that as well. Let's get deeeeeeep on it, bros. </p> <p>  </p>\n",
