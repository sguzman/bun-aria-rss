  "description": "An atheist cannot logically make objective moral claims. He cannot logically say that any action at all is objectively right or objectively wrong. Yet, many atheists do make such claims. Many atheists do believe that things like rape, murder, theft, etc., are not just subjectively wrong, but actually wrong. Atheists seem to recognize a moral code, even though no such moral code could exist without God. What does that tell us about atheism, God, and morality?
