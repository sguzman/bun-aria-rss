  "description": "<div style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What’s the most valuable asset to your organization? It’s the people, hands down. People are the driving force behind your organization’s success, which is why it’s so important to have a healthy culture. Culture is all about the people. In this lesson, John teaches that the culture is made up of the people and of the messages they receive from their leader. Today, John is going to talk about the three ways that those messages are received from the leader to the employee so that you can better understand, as a leader, how to cultivate a culture that will make both the business and the people thrive. </span><span data-ccp-props= \"{\"335551550\":1,\"335551620\":1,\"335559740\":259}\"> </span></p> </div> <div style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow join forces to dive into John’s lesson and discuss the cultures they are building within their own families and within the John Maxwell Enterprise.
