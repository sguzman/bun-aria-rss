  "title": "Martin Demant Frederiksen, \"An Anthropology of Nothing in Particular\" (Zero Books, 2018)",
  "description": "An Anthropology of Nothing in Particular (Zero Books, 2018) is an “exploration of what goes missing when one looks for meaning” (p. 1). The book is both an experimental ethnography and a theoretical treatise on how we can understand and represent absence of meaning. Its author, Martin Demant Frederiksen, approaches the meaningless seriously as an ethnographic and experiential fact, refusing to explain what its ultimate meaning could be.\nMartin Demant Frederiksen is postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Social Anthropology, University of Oslo. He holds a Ph.D. in anthropology from Aarhus University and has conducted ethnographic fieldworks in the Republic of Georgia since 2006, and more recently in Bulgaria and Croatia. His work focuses on subcultures (such as youth criminals and declared nihilists), urban development, temporality and socio-political change. He is author of the monographs Young Men, Time, and Boredom in the Republic of Georgia (2013), Georgian Portraits - Essays on the Afterlives of a Revolution (2017, with Katrine Gotfredsen) and An Anthropology of Nothing in Particular (2018). Aside from research and teaching, he is co-founder and co-editor of the independent art-zine \"a...issue\".\nCarna Brkovic is a lecturer at the University of Goettingen.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
