An anomaly is a predictable pattern in stock returns, or stated differently, it is a deviation from the efficient markets hypothesis. Their abstract reads as follows:</p> <blockquote>The anomalies literature is infested with widespread p-hacking. We replicate the entire anomalies literature in finance and accounting by compiling a largest-to-date data library that contains 447 anomaly variables. With microcaps alleviated via New York Stock Exchange breakpoints and value-weighted returns, 286 anomalies (64%) including 95 out of 102 liquidity variables (93%) are insignificant at the conventional 5% level. Imposing the cutoff t-value of three raises the number of insignificance to 380 (85%). Even for the 161 significant anomalies, their magnitudes are often much lower than originally reported. Out of the 161, the q-factor model leaves 115 alphas insignificant (150 with t < 3). In all, capital markets are more efficient than previously recognized.</blockquote> <p>We discuss the process of replicating these anomalies, issues involving the use of equal-weighted vs value-weighted returns, and the problems of p-hacking in finance research.</p> <p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p> <p><a href= \"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.00428.x/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Hamermesh, Daniel S. 2007. “Replication in Economics.” Canadian Journal of Economics 40(3):715–733.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhu068\" target= \"_blank\">Kewei Hou, Chen Xue, Lu Zhang; Digesting Anomalies: An Investment Approach.
