  "description": "Steve Bannister, from the University of Utah, is special guest on this week’s Debunking Economics podcast. He talks to Phil Dobbie about his approach to climate change modelling, based on GDP growth, energy use and carbon emissions. Steve Keen talks about the weakness of other modelling, including Nordhaus’ DICE model. Steve Bannisters model predicts things will even out eventually, but will we be alive to see it? Nope. The answer seems to be, there’s a need for a new source of energy. Clearly, its where science needs to focus its efforts, but is the sense of urgency strong enough to see if through?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
