  "content": "<p>I encourage my colleagues to write blogposts more frequently.\nThis is for a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>It informs your broader community what you’re up to, and allows that community to communicate back to you quickly.</strong></p>\n\n    <p>You communicating to the community fosters a sense of collaboration,\nopenness, and trust.  You gain collaborators, build momentum behind your\nwork, and curate a body of knowledge that early adopters can consume to\nbecome experts quickly.</p>\n\n    <p>Getting feedback from your community helps you to course-correct early\nin your work, and stops you from wasting time in inefficient courses of\naction.</p>\n\n    <p>You can only work for a long time without communicating if you are either\nentirely confident in what you’re doing, or reckless, or both.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>It increases your visibility, and so is good for your career.</strong></p>\n\n    <p>I have a great job.  I find my work to be both intellectually\nstimulating and ethically worthwhile.  I’m also decently well paid for it.</p>\n\n    <p>I have this job largely because a potential employer a long time ago read\nmy blog when I was just starting out.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>It focuses you towards tasks that are relevant to others.</strong></p>\n\n    <p>When you set an expectation of regularly publishing a blogpost, you find\nyourself seeking out work that will engage people.  This is a nice\nobjective to try to optimize, and keeps you on task serving the general\npublic.</p>\n\n    <p>Obviously, you don’t want to take this too far, but my guess is that most\ndevelopers could use a little more orientation towards public interest.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>It improves your communication skills</strong></p>\n\n    <p>Your effort is valuable only if people understand and adopt it.\nThis is true for technical programming, but also true for most efforts.\nWriting regularly encourages you to think about effective communication.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"but-im-too-busy\">But I’m too busy</h3>\n\n<p>Ah!  Indeed.</p>\n\n<p>How are we supposed to get work done if we’re writing blogposts all the time?</p>\n\n<p>We should <strong>reduce our standards</strong>.\nBlogposts don’t have to be big endeavors that solve a huge problem.\nThey are not scientific journal articles.  They can just be longer-than-average\ntweets.</p>\n\n<p>We can <strong>write short blogposts</strong> that we write in a fixed amount of time.\nPersonally, I like timing myself (I started this blopgost just 18 minutes ago)\nand time-boxing myself (I plan to publish this this afternoon before my next\nmeeting).</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite bloggers, <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/\">John D Cook</a>\nwrites an excellent blog that follows this concise approach.  Here are some\nrecent posts from his blog:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/06/17/keeping-accurate-dates/\">Protecting privacy while keeping detailed date information</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/06/19/why-regex/\">Why are regular expressions difficult?</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/06/20/bounds-on-the-nth-prime/\">Bounds on the nth prime</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are all about a page long, and are a great read.\nHonestly, I probably wouldn’t read a scientific journal on any of these topics\n(they’re not my field) but <strong>I know that John’s posts are concise, so I’m\nhappier to dive in</strong> than for someone that I know produces very long posts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>You should write more.  It can be easy if you don’t make a big deal out of it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"timings\">Timings</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>12:30: Talking to a colleague about writing short blogposts.  Decide that\nI should stop one-on-one communication, and just write a blogpost about\nthis.</li>\n  <li>12:51: Start writing</li>\n  <li>13:16: Finish first draft, render it to take a look and edit</li>\n  <li>13:25: Finish</li>\n  <li>13:26: Publish</li>\n  <li>13:27: Tweet</li>\n  <li>13:29: Back to work!</li>\n  <li>13:32: Oops! Typo.</li>\n</ul>"
