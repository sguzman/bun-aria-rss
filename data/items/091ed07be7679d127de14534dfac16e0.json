  "description": "<p>One of the things I’ve come to believe during the now 10-year journey of Good Life Project is that there truly is no individual good life, without there also being a more collective and inclusive path for a societal good life. We are all interconnected. And a key part of this more expansive aspiration is about planting seeds, starting with younger generations. So, how do you raise kids to create a more equitable and inclusive society? One where we’re not afraid to acknowledge and discuss beautiful experiences, while also addressing hard truths in a way that steeps us in reality, invites everyone into the conversation, and compels us to do the work needed to create more possibility, equality and opportunity for all, regardless of race, socio-economic status, religion, age, ability and beyond?</p><br><p>That’s where we’re headed with today’s guest, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi. He’s the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University, founding director of the BU Center for Antiracist Research, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, CBS News racial justice contributor, and the host of the Be Antiracist podcast. Dr. Kendi is also the author of many highly acclaimed books including Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, which won the National Book Award for Nonfiction, making him the youngest-ever winner of that award. He has also produced five straight #1 New York Times bestsellers, including <em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, and <em>Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You</em>, co-authored by Jason Reynolds.
