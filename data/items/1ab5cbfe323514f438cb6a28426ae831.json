  "description": "tZERO is the leader in digital securities trading… It’s also where our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token … And today, Solomon Tesfaye, the head of business development and capital markets at tZERO, joins the show to share where the industry is headed as adoption accelerates. [0:30] We discuss the evolution (and steep learning curve) of capital-raising in the sector—from initial coin offerings (ICOs) to security token offerings (STOs)... and why the latter will continue to see massive growth. [1:35] In September, crypto wallet provider Exodus began trading on the tZERO platform… successfully raising capital through a Reg A offering. Solomon explains why this is a huge deal for the industry—and individual investors. [4:45] Next, he breaks down tZERO’s extensive security token pipeline—from real estate to mining to tech to healthcare… how the firm is partnering with institutional investors… and its work with regulators—with a goal to bring stocks and digital assets onto a single platform. [7:25] We wrap our interview with Solomon’s predictions for the industry over the next three years. [16:35] By the way, you’ll need to open an account on tZERO in order to trade the CEO token (don’t worry, it’s super easy). [21:05] We’re ending the year with several special offers—including one for Crypto Intelligence. Even with the pullback in crypto, our average position is still up over 800%... Plus, the recent price declines create some great entry points to start scaling into positions. [23:17] We’ll also be releasing a special offer on  soon… Guys, this product is absolutely critical in today’s market.  There’s a fundamental shift taking place… We’re in one of the most leveraged markets in history—and the Fed must start raising rates to combat the current inflation crisis. In other words, it can’t keep throwing money at this problem. And we’ll continue to see massive volatility heading into 2022. [24:01] We launched Moneyflow Trader to show you how to hedge against conditions just like this. During the credit crisis, Genia recommended winners of 500%-plus. So keep an eye on your inbox for this special offer… It could save your portfolio. [28:28]  Enjoyed this episode?
