  "description": "We are ALL back to talk about the final days of the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Ben gives us more first hand experiences from his work at the Boxing events, while Jarrod tells us all about the extensive 2 hours of coverage he managed to see over the course of 11 days. Meanwhile Colin has mostly positive things to say about Canada's exclusive coverage from the DAZN (Da-Zone) app, including the CBC network deciding to throw a few time slots in there. Why are Australians so down on the Closing Ceremonies? What does Ben have to say about being one of approximately 13 people to attend the Closing Ceremonies in person (not including a slew of Australian Idol and X-Factor contestants).  Why do Australians get so defensive over trash talking the Campbell Sisters? Why do Canadians love Taylor Ruck and Erica Wiebe so much? Why should nobody touch Callum Hawkins when he goes down in the Marathon? Why should you never change the channel to Badminton at the 2:03:00 mark of a Marathon? And why how close (or far) did we all come in our medal tally predictions? It's a jam packed wrap up of the Commonwealth Games that will make all of the Commonwealth tweet out #TheseAreOurOlympics",
