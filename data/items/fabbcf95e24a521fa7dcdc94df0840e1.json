  "description": "<p>This week, we're returning to a listener question from episode 93, when Cherrie asked if we knew of any positive lockdown stories. As the UK enters a second national lockdown, we decided to talk with two artists about how they have made the most of this strange year. First, Alice talks to Faye Bridgewater, who has really stepped up her game in 2020, earning success after success as a result of her courage and hard work. Then, Louise chats to Gwynne Penny, who shares a heartwarming story of turning negative feelings into a beautiful and inspiring creative project. Both these conversations are a reminder that we cannot control what happens, but we can control how we react to it. We also discuss our progress on our work and send our best wishes to Tracey Emin as she recovers from major surgery following a cancer diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Faye Bridgewater <a href=\"https://www.fayebridgwater.com/\">https://www.fayebridgwater.com/</a></p>\n<p>Gwynne Penny <a href=\"//\">https://www.gwynnepenny.com/</a></p>\n<p>Gwynne's book <a href=\"//\">https://www.gwynnepenny.com/memories-of-st-ives-in-print/</a></p>\n<p>The Painter and the Thief trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ohk9IQrmSc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ohk9IQrmSc</a></p>\n<p>Pamela Caughey video <a href=\"//\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6CsWdF-854</a></p>\n<p><strong>Join us</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Connected Artist Wait List <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elh636/metadata/edit\">https://alicesheridanstudio.mykajabi.com/connected-interest</a></p>\n<p>Louise's Art Tribe sign-up page <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/elh636/metadata/edit\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
