  "description": "Author and National Review correspondent Kevin Williamson doesn’t fall neatly into any political box. He was a conservative diversity hire at The Atlantic – fired three days later for that exact reason. He wrote a book called “The Case Against Trump,” but is definitely not a fan of leftists. He isn’t afraid to speak his mind, and his not-so-family-friendly newest book, “The Smallest Minority: Independent Thinking in the Age of Mob Politics” hammers it home. In this interview, Glenn and Kevin sit down to discuss how capitalism has massively boosted the quality of life even in the last 50 years, why we’ve traded our sense of purpose for Twitter bickering, and the unimaginable freedom the future will bring – if we don’t mess it all up first.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
