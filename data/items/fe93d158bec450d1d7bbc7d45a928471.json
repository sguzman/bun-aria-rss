  "description": "<p>Existing federated learning models that follow the standard risk minimization\nparadigm of machine learning often fail to generalize in the presence of\nspurious correlations in the training data. In many real-world distributed\nsettings, spurious correlations exist due to biases and data sampling issues on\ndistributed devices or clients that can erroneously influence models. Current\ngeneralization approaches are designed for centralized training and attempt to\nidentify features that have an invariant causal relationship with the target,\nthereby reducing the effect of spurious features. However, such invariant risk\nminimization approaches rely on apriori knowledge of training data\ndistributions which is hard to obtain in many applications. In this work, we\npresent a generalizable federated learning framework called FedGen, which\nallows clients to identify and distinguish between spurious and invariant\nfeatures in a collaborative manner without prior knowledge of training\ndistributions. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets from different\ndomains and show that FedGen results in models that achieve significantly\nbetter generalization than current federated learning approaches.\n</p>",
