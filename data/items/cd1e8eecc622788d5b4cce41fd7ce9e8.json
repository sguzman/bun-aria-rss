  "description": "<p>One of the most revered names in Modernist architecture is <strong>Richard Neutra</strong>.  From coast to coast, but mostly in California, Neutra’s many Modernist houses set the standard for open, comfortable living – bringing the outside in, reducing clutter, and maximizing every square foot of a house and its usually beautiful site.  Host <strong>George Smart</strong> talks with Richard Neutra’s son, <strong>Raymond Neutra</strong>, about architecture, the passing of his brother Dion, and the future of Neutra Institute.  Next, <strong>Catherine Meyler</strong> bought a rundown Palm Springs Neutra house 20 years ago and brought it back to life after almost losing it to the elements.  Wrapping up, George talks with owner <strong>Ken Topper</strong> of the famous Lovell Health House in LA, the place that brought Neutra to huge public fame back in 1929.</p>",
