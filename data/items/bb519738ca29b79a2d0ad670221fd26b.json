Smith, who is not Jon Gruden\n- We ask why more coaches can't follow the Jon Gruden Guide to Eternal Wealth\n- We talk about goatees and who shouldn't have them; Jon Gruden would never have a goatee\n- We consider who's going to totally plummet next season and therefore be eligible for Grumors (Jon Gruden Rumors)\n- We talk about Road House; Jon Gruden is familiar with both roads AND houses.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
