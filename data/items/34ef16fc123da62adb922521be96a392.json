  "description": "In one of the most brazen flip-flops in recent history, the media finally admitted that Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop is real and damning. But they’re still playing defense for Joe Biden, argues New York Post reporter and columnist Miranda Devine. Having been there from the scandal’s start, Miranda joins Glenn to lay out what we know so far — from Hunter’s troubled childhood and disturbing adult life to his infamous business deals in Russia, Ukraine, and China, as documented in her latest book, “Laptop from Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.” But while the White House and media insist President Biden has zero connections to Hunter’s scandals, Miranda makes the case that he knows all too well how corrupt the Bidens have become. \n\nSponsors:\n\nDon’t settle with your eyesight.
