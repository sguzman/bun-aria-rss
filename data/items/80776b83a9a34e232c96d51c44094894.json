They discuss how his career has changed with the times over the last 30+ years, his relationship with his former co-host Chris \"Mag Dog\" Russo and what their relationship was like while they were on the air, some advice he has for Pat with the start of the radio show around the corner, what his relationship with Odell Beckham and the New York Giants front office is currently like, his philosophy on taking phone calls during his show and why his treatment of the callers is often misconstrued, his thoughts on the upcoming NFL season as well as some takes on some of the players that are making waves this preseason, and he answers some questions from the room. This interview is a MUST LISTEN (2:08-1:03:37). Pat also covers his weekend in Toronto with Foxy as they were in town for the WWE Watchalong at Summerslam. Pat breaks down why Toronto might be his favorite city on the planet, what the Canadian hospitality is like, how going to a Blue Jays vs. Yankees game resparked his idea to have live betting available before every pitch at a baseball game and how it would improve the entertainment value, some of his favorite moments from the Watchalong event including his growing friendship/rivalry with Adam Cole, and his post NXT preshow run-in with Triple H on Saturday night and how he thought it might have been due to another dress code violation, and what it's like being dropped back into the WWE Universe after being gone for a few weeks and getting caught up with everything that is happened throughout the business.
