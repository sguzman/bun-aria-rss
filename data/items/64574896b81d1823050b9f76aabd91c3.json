  "description": "<p>Rebecca Atwood started small. The RISD-educated textile designer began by creating a line of pillows out of her own apartment, dyeing fabrics in a tiny kitchen. Over the past five years she's grown considerably, with a full line of textiles and wallpapers, a SOHO showroom, and two books to her name—but she's done it at her own pace. On this episode of the Business of Home podcast, Atwood tells host Dennis Scully about building her business step by step, why she opened up her accounting books to her employees, and why her showroom wouldn't fit in at the D&D Building—but that's a good thing. This episode is sponsored by Crypton and Chairish.</p>\n",
