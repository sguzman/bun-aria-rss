  "description": "<p>WHERE MY MOMS AT!? It's the show by the Moms for the Moms. Hosted by everybody's favorite \"cool mom\" Christina P! Not only the most REAL show for moms, but the most interactive. An open place to admit no one really knows what they're doing.</p><p>Needing some inspiration this week? Christina has plenty of that for you on this episode with the return of her That's Deep Bro segment. In it, you'll hear her thoughts on being broke at 30, keeping your dreams a secret while you incubate your ideas, and the problem with playing it safe. She also discusses some of the bad advice she's gotten over the years and why she doesn't like giving notes to young comedians. Finally, she reveals how being heckled by someone close to her pushed her to accomplish more. Remember, you don't need anyone's support other than your own, it's okay to be a loser sometimes, and eagles fly alone so be an eagle! Enjoy.</p><p>Christina P. wants to hear from you since she is seriously lacking in cool mom friends. If you want to share a \"Pazsitzky Effect\" or \"Mom Hack\" please call into our voicemail (213)375-5184 and let Christina know! We want to talk to as many moms across America as we can.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:WhereMyMomsAt@gmail.com\">WhereMyMomsAt@gmail.com</a><br />(213) 375-5184</p><p><a href=\"https://christinaponline.com/tour-dates\">https://christinaponline.com/tour-dates</a><br /><a href=\"https://store.ymhstudios.com/\">https://store.ymhstudios.com/</a></p>\n",
