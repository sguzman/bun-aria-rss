  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today's guest is Tallene Hacatoryan, a PCOS Weight Loss Registered Dietitian and strong believer that you don't have to live with PCOS; you can thrive! Tallen was diagnosed with PCOS at 18 and unsatisfied with the generally accepted belief that birth control is the only way to manage this diagnosis. She had many failed attempts at weight loss through excessive exercising and dieting and was frustrated. She decided to take an alternative option by studying nutrition science and is now a dietitian. In this conversation, we're going to get more information on exactly what PCOS is, the symptoms, and the effects of it, but how changing your diet and eliminating just a few things could completely change the way you feel about your body and your weight loss.</span></p>",
