  "title": "ðŸ“¬ Mailbag Monday: Steelers QB plans, Eagles ceiling, time to give Bill O'Brien some credit? (Football 6/1)",
  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough for another edition of 'Mailbag Monday'. The guys discuss the Steelers plan at QB past Ben Roethlisberger before focusing on the other side of the state and looking at what the Eagles can accomplish in 2020. The Pick Six Superfriends also try to switch up their perspective on Bill O'Brien, the head coach. Sean then de-values running backs (again). Next, we toss it to a portion of last week's mailbag that never aired with conversations on narcissism, the Arizona Cardinals and staying in shape during quarantine.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts.Â \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS @johnbreech, @seanjwagner\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visitÂ https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
