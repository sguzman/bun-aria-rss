If you are looking for some new motivation for your fitness, mindfulness and eating then you will absolutely love Chris' program - it's extremely well put together and I feel very lucky to be a part of it as one of his handpicked experts. Of course my focus is on plant based food!\n\nAnyway, we digress. \n\nIn this conversation we cover:\n\n\nBit about some of the places we ate during our time in Byron Bay\n\nTorre's childhood years (what life was like for him etc)\n\nHis blood lines and what the Rastafari culture means to him\n\nWhat his diet was like growing up\n\nWhat his diet is like now (and yes I ask the infamous question about protein)\n\nWhen and why he got interested in working out\n\nHis journey to becoming a PRO bodybuilder\n\nWhy a vegan diet is important to him\n\nCoexisting with non vegans\n\nand much much more\n\n\nREVIEW/SHARE:\nIf you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners.
