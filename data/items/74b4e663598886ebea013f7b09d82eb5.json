  "description": "<p>We address the question of sensitivity analysis for model outputs of any\ndimension using Regional Sensitivity Analysis (RSA). Classical RSA computes\nsensitivity indices related to the impact of model inputs variations on the\noccurrence of a target region of the model output space. In this work, we\ninvert this perspective by proposing to find, for a given target model input,\nthe region whose occurrence is best explained by the variations of this input.\nWhen it exists, this region can be seen as a model behavior which is\nparticularly sensitive to the variations of the model input under study. We\nname this method iRSA (for inverse RSA). iRSA is formalized as an optimization\nproblem using region-based sensitivity indices and solved using dedicated\nnumerical algorithms. Using analytical and numerical examples, including an\nenvironmental model producing time series, we show that iRSA can provide a new\ngraphical and interpretable characterization of sensitivity for model outputs\nof various dimensions.\n</p>",
