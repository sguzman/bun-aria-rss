  "description": "Many of us know the basics of distillation, but only a few know the true science. Today, we’re joined by Tripp Stimson of Barrell Bourbon and we ask all the hard questions on distillation that we’ve always wanted to know. This is really for the geeks at heart because it goes into pH levels, yeast strains, malting processes, and so much more. Listen close to the expert because it’s definitely one show where you will learn something new about the distillation process.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about bourbon in the movies.\n\nWhat are your goals for the year?\n\nTell us about your background.\n\nLet's talk about grains.\n\nDoes it matter where the grain comes from?\n\nWhat happens after getting the grain?\n\nDoes the size of the mash tub matter?\n\nWhat is the percentage of mash to water?\n\nWhat's the best way to mix the mash?\n\nHow long is the process?\n\nHow do you know the mash is ready?\n\nWhat grain do you add in first?\n\nTalk about malted grain.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWhat is the consistency of the product when going from the mash tub to the fermentation tank?\n\nLet's talk about yeast.\n\nWhat about a mash rest?\n\nWhat is the chemical breakdown during fermentation?\n\nWhy do some people do closed vs. open fermentation?\n\nWhat determines the number of days for fermentation?\n\nDo different grains change the process?\n\nWhat is sour mash?\n\nLet's talk about the pH of the water.\n\nIs the flavor more consistent in a sour mash process vs. sweet mash?\n\nDo you use a bourbon backset in a rye mash?\n\nWhat happens after fermentation?\n\nTalk about the shape of stills.\n\nAfter the still where does it go?\n\nWhat happens in the doubler?\n\nWhat are heads, hearts and tails?\n\nWhat are the health risks of the process?\n\nWhat's the difference between the column still and pot still?\n\nWhen do you get the waste out?\n\nHow do you control the proof coming off the still?\n\nWhat is the argument for a low entry proof?\n\nDoes it have to be the exact proof listed on the label?\n\nHow do you get a final proof when using multiple barrels?\n\nHow do you clean the equipment?\n\nDoes an older still produce a different flavor?\n\nWhat are you looking for when picking rum?\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
