  "description": "Gombis’d. We’ve been Gombis’d. Today, we wit down with our good, good friend Dr. Timothy Gombis to talk through his new book, “Power in Weakness: Paul’s Transformed Vision for Ministry.” Gombis has left everything on the page with this one, looking closely at how Paul’s vision for ministry was transformed by his encounter with Jesus. Who was he before? How can we relate? Who did he become and how was his experience with Jesus manifested? How did Paul view ministry and how did he practice it? What did community look like in Paul’s churches?\n\nIt’s a great conversation with a great mind. We wrestle in real time with how to see Paul and Jesus’s vision for church and community realized, how to encourage both seasoned pastors as well as those in seminary coming up. \n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
