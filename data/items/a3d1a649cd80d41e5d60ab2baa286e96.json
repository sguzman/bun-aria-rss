  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, inflation hurts everyone; some faster and some slower. At a local diner, waitresses can't afford to fill their tanks anymore and the Diner owners can’t stock all of the goods and ingredients. Meanwhile, all President Biden does is blame Russia and manufacturers like the baby formula companies. Abbot laboratories say it will take 6-8 weeks to rebound from a recall that they claim was not linked to recent infant fatalities and sicknesses. Rep Kat Cammack has shared photos of pallets of baby formula stored for child migrants at a closed border facility. Congress is waiting two weeks to conduct a hearing which puts the lives of children in jeopardy. Then, Congressman Jim Jordan joins the show to explain how Democrats on the January 6th Select Committee have threatened to subpoena him but have failed to serve him. Jordan also discussed how a concerned mom was investigated by DHS and labeled a domestic terrorist. Later, various groups were competing for power in Russian history. Leon Trotsky was assassinated by Joseph Stalin's hitman. Marxism is an ambiguous ideology. Even Lenin was known for saying that Marx couldn't tell them how to govern. Lenin also called on Trotsky to stop Stalin. Similarly, the Democrat Party seeks a permanent counter-revolution in the United States. Therefore Democrats describe their violent war on civil society as 'mostly peaceful.'\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
