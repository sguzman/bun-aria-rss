  "description": "<p>1978-1995. USA. From 1978 through 1995, 16 bombs were either mailed or placed to terrorize the public. A government task force was formed and named UNABOM (University and Airline Bombing) after which the originally named Junkyard Bomber became known as The Unabomber. The bombs themselves were seemingly fashioned from stuff the individual had on hand. This mysterious figure behind the bombings also seemed to have a strong desire to speak to the public and in 1995 he revealed that if his essay was published that he would cease his terrorist activities. But was giving in to the demands of a terrorist the wrong course of action? Or was there good reasons to let him have his say? Join us as we discuss the case that changed not only how we operate our mail system, but also woke many people up to the fact that not all terrorists are from outside the nation.</p><p>Get more Generation Why!
