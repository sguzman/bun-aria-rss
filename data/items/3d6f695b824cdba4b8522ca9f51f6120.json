  "description": "<p>This paper aims to shed light on what becomes of discrete torsion within\nheterotic orbifolds when they are resolved to smooth geometries. Gauged Linear\nSigma Models (GLSMs) possessing (0,2) worldsheet supersymmetry are employed as\ninterpolations between them. This question is addressed for resolutions of the\nnon-compact C3/Z2xZ2 and the compact T6/Z2xZ2 orbifolds to keep track of local\nand global aspects. The GLSMs associated with the non-compact orbifold with or\nwithout torsion are to a large extent equivalent: only when expressed in the\nsame superfield basis, a field redefinition anomaly arises among them, which in\nthe orbifold limit reproduces the discrete torsion phases. Previously unknown,\nnovel resolution GLSMs for T6/Z2xZ2 are constructed. The GLSM associated with\nthe torsional compact orbifold suffers from mixed gauge anomalies, which need\nto be cancelled by appropriate logarithmic superfield dependent FI-terms on the\nworldsheet, signalling H-flux due to NS5-branes supported at the exceptional\ncycles.\n</p>",
