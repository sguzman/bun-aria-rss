Morrissey says he's happy to see the end of \"flimsy, overly engineered media brands,\" many of which were overly dependent on outside platforms to make money. Those publishers were naïve if they didn’t think Facebook would eventually put its own interests above theirs, he says, and today it would be \"crazy\" to make a new business that's similarly reliant on the social giant's algorithm.
