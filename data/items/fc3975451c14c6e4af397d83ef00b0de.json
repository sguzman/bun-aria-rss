  "title": "Arcia Tecun et al., \"Towards a Grammar of Race in Aotearoa New Zealand (Bridget Williams Books, 2022)",
  "description": "A search for new ways to talk about race in Aotearoa New Zealand brought together this powerful group of scholars, writers, and activists. For these authors, attempts to confront racism and racial violence often stall against a failure to see how power works through race, across our modern social worlds. The result is a country where racism is all too often left unnamed and unchecked, voices are erased, the colonial past ignored and silence passes for understanding.\nBy 'bringing what is unspoken into focus', Towards a Grammar of Race in Aotearoa New Zealand (Bridget Williams Books, 2022) seeks to articulate and confront ideas of race in Aotearoa New Zealand – an exploration that includes racial capitalism, colonialism, white supremacy, and anti-Blackness. A recurring theme across the book is the inescapable entanglement of local and global manifestations of race.\nEach of the contributors brings their own experiences and insights to the complexities of life in a racialised society, and together their words make an important contribution to our shared and future lives on these shores.\nContributors to this book: Pounamu Jade Aikman, Faisal Al-Asaad, Mahdis Azarmandi, Simon Barber, Garrick Cooper, Morgan Godfery, Kassie Hartendorp, Guled Mire, Tze Ming Mok, Adele Norris, Nathan Rew, Vera Seyra, Beth Teklezgi, Selome Teklezgi and Patrick Thomsen.\nArcia Tecun (a.k.a. Daniel Hernandez) is a storyteller (film maker, podcaster) and Pouako (Lecturer) at Waipapa Taumata Rau (University of Auckland) in ethnomusicology and social-cultural anthropology. His research and teaching interests include Indigeneity, race, class, gender, religion, food, and popular culture/music in Oceania and the Americas.\nLana Lopesi is an author, art critic, editor and multidisciplinary researcher based in Tāmaki Makaurau. In September, she became an Assistant Professor Pacific Islander Studies in the department of Indigenous, Race and Ethnic Studies at the University of Oregon.\nAnisha Sankar is a Chennai-born, Te Awakairangi-raised South Indian Tamil living in Pōneke. She is currently working on her PhD, which studies the contradictions of colonial capitalism.\nKey Point About the Book:\n• Arrives at a time of burgeoning questions around race, identity, and power\n• Provides readers with new ways of thinking and talking about race in Aotearoa New Zealand\n• Addresses New Zealand’s local connections to global and international discussions of race\nEd Amon has a Master of Indigenous Studies from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. He is a columnist at his local paper: Hibiscus Matters, and a Stand-up Comedian. His main interests are indigenous studies, politics, history, and cricket.
