    "media:description": "In the year 1900, David Hilbert gave a list of 23 mathematics problems for the mathematicians of the new generation.  His tenth problem proved to be an enigma for many years until Alan Turing solved it while simultaneously creating the modern computer.\n\nWatch the video to see how Alan Turing wrestled with this problem for six years and then gave his proof that computers can't do everything.\n\nSubscribe to Kinertia for more videos!\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nBorrtex-Gravity (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nImages\nVWBailey: Wikimedia Commons https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/",
