  "description": "The nameless narrator in author Claire-Louise Bennett's new novel, <em>Checkout 19</em>, absolutely loves books. Their mere presence puts her at ease. But her lifelong love of reading is, in part, because she feels let down by the people around her. Bennett told NPR's Scott Simon that loving to read is amazing, but there's a danger in always living other's  experiences before having some of your own.",
