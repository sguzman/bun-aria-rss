  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Sadly, the children in Uvalde didn’t have a chance because they had armed, trained grown men with body armor who did nothing. The Uvalde school district Police Chief is a coward. Steve McGraw, Director of the Texas Public Safety Department says this response, which was delayed by over an hour, was an abject failure. Armed officers stood by under the Chief's order while children were executed. Then, the ruling class will have you think that the Bill of Rights belongs to them, the Senate, and the House, but it doesn't, it belongs to we the people. The failure of common sense cannot be cured by legislation. Fast-tracking a gun control bill to theatrically celebrate it on a particular holiday should never be the purpose of any legislation. Later, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz joins the show to offer insight on the January 6th hearings. Dershowitz says it's indefensible and inappropriate to have such a one-sided committee alleging crimes. Dershowitz blasted the committee for falsely conflating unlawful and criminal and said that the Democrats are guilty of 'McCarthyism.'
