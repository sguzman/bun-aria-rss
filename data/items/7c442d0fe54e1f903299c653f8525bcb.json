  "description": "<p>Today's show is highlighted for two incredible interviews. First, friend of the show, ESPN college basketball analyst, former head coach, and current radio host, Dan Dakich calls into the show to break down the NCAA Tournament. They cover who some of the teams he likes going in are, why Zion Williamson is different than anyone else he's ever seen, who some of his sleeper upset picks, shares some of his favorite Bob Knight stories, and he answers questions from the around the room in another rendition of \"The Room Wants To Know.\" It's everything you need to get ready for March Madness (2:53-36:02). Later, the Blogfather, friend of the show, and one of the smartest football minds around, Mike Florio calls into the show for a new segment called, \"INTERNET BEEF,\" to discuss his recent war of words with Richard Sherman on Twitter. He breaks down why he was right in his argument with Sherman, what his logic was, and highlights a few more things around the league that carry importance and might try to steal some of the spotlight from the NCAA Tournament. They also do a little Hockey Talk, and discuss who Mike likes for March Madness (42:56-1:11:06). Pat and the guys also discuss their St. Patrick's Day together in Indianapolis and put some of the pieces back together, Pat gives a little wedding update and how he's finally convinced Sam to let Zito be involved in the wedding, the guys chat about their new Bro Bro Bro Bets podcast and what their mission is, and Digs got a new dog which leads to a discussion about Pat facing heat to add more animals to his farm, despite a written contract that says otherwise. Pat also takes to Instagram to answer questions from listeners in the first edition of new segment, \"Chat With Pat.\" Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
