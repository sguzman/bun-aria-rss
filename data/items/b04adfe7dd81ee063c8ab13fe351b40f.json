  "description": "The title of James Poyner’s book, Trump Tweets: His Social Media Phenomenon (Wilkinson Publishing, 2017), tells you everything you need to know about the world you about to enter. In temperament, and style, Trump was unlike any presidential candidate who came before him. The media and the public were enthralled with his antics. However, what stood out for many was Trumps thoroughly unique communication style. This book gives an in-depth look at how Trump used Twitter to attack, criticise, publicise and expand the reach of brand Trump.\n\nPoyner uses several key events to move the book forward and tell the story of how Trump used Twitter, from the start of his presidential campaign right up until Inauguration day. Exploring not only Trumps tweets but the publics reaction to them, Poyner is able to capture unique moments in history and examine how they impacted the race to the White House.\n\nThe term Twitter-storm was coined long before Trump threw his hat into the presidential race but no other figure, since the social media platforms inception, has been able to cause a storm quite like Trump. Poyner leads the reader down the rabbit hole and through a world of tweets, trolling, tantrums and ultimately victory.\n\nTrump Tweets is available now in Australia and will be available in the U.S. on June 1.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
