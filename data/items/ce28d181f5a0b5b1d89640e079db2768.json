  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a number of topics related to the business of sports, including a proposed boycott by NFL hall-of-famers unless the league provides them insurance and salaries. Many high-profile HOF players (Eric Dickerson, Marcus Allen, Jim Brown, for example) say they would not attend the annual induction ceremony until they receive a share of league revenue. Also discussed is University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank's testimony that the school could drop its athletic program if it has to start paying student athletes. In addition, the trio talks about a unanimous decision by Major League Lacrosse owners to increase the salary cap by 51 percent, which will lead to higher salaries.  </p><p>Host: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
