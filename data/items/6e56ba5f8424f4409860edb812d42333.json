  "description": "<p>Professor of Law at York University Heidi Matthews has been writing about \"creepiness,\" particularly as it relates to gender relations. What causes a man to be labeled a creep? What do we do about the creeps in our neighborhood? Why, with all we know about police violence, do we turn to the cops when we encounter someone we consider creepy? Are we just trying to increase marginalization on already marginalized populations, like the homeless, the mentally ill, the poor, and the neurodivergent? We discuss all this and uh also Joker.</p> <p><a href= \"http://jessacrispin.com\">http://jessacrispin.com</a></p> <p>Support this podcast: http://patreon.com/publicintellectual</p>",
