The taste undid my eyes\nAnd led me far from the gardens planted for a child\nTo wildernesses deeper than any master’s call.\n\n2\n\nNow these cool hands guide what they once caressed;\nLips forget what they have kissed.\nMy eyes now pool their light\nBetter the summit to see.\n\n3\n\nI would do it all over again:\nBe the harbor and set the sail,\nLoose the breeze and harness the gale,\nCherish the harvest of what I have been.\nBetter the summit to scale.\nBetter the summit to be.\n\nFrom Five Poems (Rainmaker Editions, 2002) by Toni Morrison with silhouettes by Kara Walker.
