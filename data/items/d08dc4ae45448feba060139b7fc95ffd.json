  "description": "In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we focus on trade relations between the EU and China.\n\nWe asked Alicia Garcia Herrero, Senior Fellow at Bruegel, where relations between China and the EU stand at the moment, and why their trade relations are so important.\n\nCurrently the US seems more interested in the Pacific than its Atlantic alliance. Does this situation leave any room for the EU and China to get closer? We asked Pascal Lamy, former General Director- of the World Trade Organisation.\n\nLawrence Lau, Professor of Economics at the University of Hong Kong, told us why he believes that both China and the EU can benefit from closer relations.\n\nWe spoke with Jianwei Xu, Visiting Scholar at Bruegel, about the effects of Brexit on the EU-China relations: what would happen if the UK strikes a free trade agreement with China before the EU does?\n\nFinally we discussed the Chinese Belt and Road initiative, which aims to reduce transportation costs between China and the EU.  We asked professor Lau what this initiative entails, and Alicia shared her opinion on potential opportunities and dangers that the initiative can bring to Europe.\n\nSPEAKERS\nAlicia Garcia Herrero, Senior Fellow, Bruegel\nPascal Lamy, former General Director, World Trade Organisation\nLawrence Lau, Professor of Economics, University of Hong Kong\nJianwei Xu, Visiting Fellow, Bruegel\n\nCREDITS\nPresented and produced by Vanessa Cotterell and Giuseppe Porcaro",
