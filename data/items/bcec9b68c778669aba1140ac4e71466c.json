He talks about why he believes the show was so successful, and of course his take on the ending. He also talks about his career, The Office, and his latest show After Life. Ricky also talks about hosting the Golden Globes and what people thought about his performance afterwards. </p><p>     Then Michael and Steve break down what could be one of the most complicated episodes of the entire series.
