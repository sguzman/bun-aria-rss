  "description": "The Broncos beat the Jets 37-28 on Thursday Night Football, so guess who we're talking about? Of course it's the losing side, as we focus Sam Darnold and Adam Gase! The Jets are embarrassing but that doesn't necessarily mean a change is coming at head coach. Could a change be coming at quarterback if they get the #1 pick though? Don't worry, Denver does get some credit. Brett Rypien had some bad moments but was serviceable in his first NFL start.
