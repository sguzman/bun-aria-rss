  "title": "Steven Dilday, “The Exegetical Labors of the Reverend Matthew Poole” (Master Poole Publishing, 2017)",
  "description": "Matthew Poole (1624-1679) was an English Nonconformist theologian educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he held the rectory of St Michael le Querne in London from 1649 to 1662. Poole is principally associated with the work Synopsis Criticorum Biblicorum (5 vols. folio), in which he summarizes the views of one hundred and fifty biblical commentators, including Jewish sources and Roman Catholic commentators–an undertaking of ten years, and a monument not only of his extensive reading, but of his great acumen and learning. He also wrote English Annotations on the Holy Bible, completing as far as Isaiah 58 before his death in 1679. Much of Poole’s valuable contribution, being written in Latin, has been out of reach for many students of the Bible, including pastors and teachers. To remedy this problem, Dr. Steven Dilday has been laboring to translate the works of Poole, publishing them in English. In today’s podcast, Steven Dilday talks about his Matthew Poole Project. He tells us about the life of Matthew Poole, and how we can obtain his recent publications of Poole’s work in English.\n\n Steven Dilday holds a BA in Religion and Philosophy from Campbell University, a Master of Arts in Religion from Westminster Theological Seminary (Philadelphia), and both a Master of Divinity and a PhD in Puritan History and Literature from Whitefield Theological Seminary. He is also the translator of De Moor’s Compendium of Christian Theology. Dilday is Assistant Professor of Religion at Southern Wesleyan University in Central, South Carolina.\n\n\n\nL. Michael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
