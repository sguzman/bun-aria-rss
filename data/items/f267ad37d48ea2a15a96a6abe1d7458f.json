On today’s episode, Rachelle and Madison talk about the rise of OnlyFans, and its importance to independent sex workers. Then they interview Slate sex columnist and OnlyFans performer Jessica Stoya about her experience on the platform over the past year, and why this sort of fight isn’t anything new for those who’ve been in the industry.\nJessica Stoya’s recent piece on OnlyFans is, “I Made Thousands on OnlyFans. I Have a Dark Suspicion About What’s Coming.” You can read more from her by checking out Slate’s How To Do It sex advice column which she writes every week with Rich Juzwiak.\nPodcast production by Daniel Schroeder and Derek John.\n﻿Support ICYMI and listen to the show with zero ads. Sign up to become a Slate Plus member for just $1 for your first month.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
