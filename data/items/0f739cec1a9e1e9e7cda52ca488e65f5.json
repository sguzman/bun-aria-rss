  "description": "<p>60,000 minutes, 1,000 hours or better put 500 Episodes. On today’s episode we tie the record for the most cigar podcast episodes with a trip down memory lane. But it get’s even better than that as there will be no Mr. Jonathan and there will be liquor involved!</p>\n<p>At the top of the first hour we welcome back someone who was there at the beginning as we discuss the early days of the show and all the ingredients that went into it. At the bottom of the hour we welcome back a true Gentleman to the show as we continue the trip down memory lane.</p>\n<p>We will do this while smoking the Perdomo Habana BBA Maduro that was included in the Care Package.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we light up a cigar that is exclusive to <a href='http://2guyscigars.com/'>2GuysCigars.com</a>. It’s a collaboration between J&J Spirits and Aganorsa Leaf. We will share with you our thoughts on the Single Cask Nation.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
