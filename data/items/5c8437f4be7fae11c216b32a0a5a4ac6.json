  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd of WJNO and WIOD fills in for Mark. The left is desperate like never before, and that’s why we see so much selective outrage from Democrats and the media to oppose President Trump at every turn. They’ve ignored Saudi Arabia being governed under Sharia Law for decades, but now suddenly care about morality because Jamal Khashoggi was murdered. The media is trying everything to make Trump say bad things about Saudi Arabia and disrupt the progress he’s making in the Middle East. The left also shows their selective outrage with the migrant caravan. DHS has identified 10% of the caravan to be known criminals, yet the left keeps insisting they’re all innocent migrants seeking asylum and need to be let in. If there were legitimate asylum seekers coming to designated ports of entry it would be a different story. Finally, the 9th Circuit court of appeals have had 86% of their rulings overturned, yet Chief Justice John Roberts showed his true political colors and defended them over President Trump. How can someone be wrong 86% of the time and still have a job?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
