  "description": "<p>The recent success of large language models for text generation poses a\nsevere threat to academic integrity, as plagiarists can generate realistic\nparaphrases indistinguishable from original work. However, the role of large\nautoregressive transformers in generating machine-paraphrased plagiarism and\ntheir detection is still developing in the literature. This work explores T5\nand GPT-3 for machine-paraphrase generation on scientific articles from arXiv,\nstudent theses, and Wikipedia. We evaluate the detection performance of six\nautomated solutions and one commercial plagiarism detection software and\nperform a human study with 105 participants regarding their detection\nperformance and the quality of generated examples. Our results suggest that\nlarge models can rewrite text humans have difficulty identifying as\nmachine-paraphrased (53% mean acc.). Human experts rate the quality of\nparaphrases generated by GPT-3 as high as original texts (clarity 4.0/5,\nfluency 4.2/5, coherence 3.8/5). The best-performing detection model (GPT-3)\nachieves a 66% F1-score in detecting paraphrases.\n</p>",
