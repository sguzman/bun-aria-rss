  "title": "Are Bilinguals Really Smarter?",
  "description": "A century ago, bilingual children were seen as disadvantaged—a kid speaking English and Spanish was liable to become confused and might not learn properly. Now? Bilinguals are seen as better than the rest of us. They get dementia later. They have bigger brains and are better at focusing on tasks. So what’s the truth? Our resident social science sleuth Maria Konnikova investigates. She’s a New Yorker contributor and author of The Confidence Game. Her new podcast is The Grift. \nIn the Spiel, the news buried this week by the firing of James Comey.   \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
