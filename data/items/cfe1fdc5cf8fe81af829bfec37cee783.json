  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden is pressuring Israel to relent in the face of 4000 rockets being fired by Hamas and proxy-funded by Iran. Consequently, Biden has been working to restore funding to Iran by restoring the JCPOA. Israel's military operation called guardian of walls is shaping up to be one of the most accurately executed in military history. Despite minimal civilian casualties, and of course, all lives should be protected, the Israeli Defense Forces have gone through every effort to protect civilian lives. The House of Representatives voted against a Resolution to condemn Hamas's terrorist attacks on Israel and every single democrat defended Hamas and voted against the Resolution, while all the Republicans voted for the measure. Later, Major Doron Spielman, spokesman for the IDF, joins the show to explain that one Hamas official had a rocket launcher hidden in his home because Hamas hides in plain sight amongst their own civilians. Spielman added that Hamas has also suffered friendly fire including their own power plant and killing their own people in Gaza. Then, Critical Race Theory didn't just happen, it's been creeping into society and now the people are accepting it. This poisonous thinking has slipped into the US military and the highest levels of law enforcement. Let alone, the damage that's been done in our college and university system and newsrooms. Afterward, the prosecutorial misconduct continues as the civil probe into former President Trump's business, the Trump Organization, has been leaked to be a criminal probe. The left and the media are creating controversy to scare innocent people into buckling and admitting to crimes they did not commit. Zero charges have been filed against Trump. This is the kind of prosecution that is seen in third-world dictatorships. Finally, Breitbart's Alex Marlow calls in to discuss his new book \"Breaking the News: exposing the Establishment Media's Hidden Deals and Secret Corruption.\" \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
