  "description": "<p><p>ROUND 1: Moving to a new duty station in the military can be a logistical nightmare, and that's especially true for THREE military families who had a trailer of all their belongings stolen on Christmas Day. ZBT listeners also shared some of their best-worst PCS tales.</p><p>ROUND 2: Military homecomings are always a sight to behold, and an Airmen who just returned home to his girlfriend and her badass BRRRRRT A-10 fighter jet jean-jacket can attest to that</p><p>ROUND 3: Overweight, unfit, or shy? The British Army doesn't give a shit. They are introducing a new platoon just for those misfits and I can't wait to tell you about it.Â </p><p>ROUND 4: Sure, we messed up a short, wacky story about missing rifles stateside, but you can count on us for the most accurate information on the latest with Iraq & Iran. We've got some updates & breakdowns for ya! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
