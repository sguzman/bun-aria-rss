One of those victims, Dallas Stoller, died in November of 2021.\nIn this special episode of the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, you’ll hear from Dallas’ sister and father, who were in the courtroom last week when Turner got a shocking sweetheart deal of just five years probation. \nHe won’t have to register as a sex offender. Solicitor David Miller of the Second Circuit Solicitor’s Office agreed to the deal. Judge Markley Dennis approved the sentence. \nLike Paul Murdaugh, Bowen Turner had the privilege of being represented by a state senator. State Senator Brad Hutto negotiated this shocking deal for his client to go free - even after he violated his bond conditions more than 60 times.\nIn this episode, you will hear from Mandy  & Liz tell you exactly what went wrong in this case and how this case exemplifies a much bigger problem in our judicial system. \n\nYou’ll also hear from survivor Chloe Bess, who was slut-shamed in court by Senator Brad Hutto after she was assaulted by Bowen Turner. \n\nHow can you help?\nRead this post: https://www.facebook.com/sarah.ford.1238/posts/pfbid0xSjEDQhS1dDX1Y1oxwZmx14eK3kwqv6bVbEU9tqABYa6YqSYVvaBSnZy2gQzPY6El\nOr this thread: https://twitter.com/MandyMatney/status/1513676053331513348\n\nCall the elected Officials Involved:\nSecond Circuit Solicitor’s Office (Ask for Deputy David Miller or his boss Bill Weeks): (803) 642-1557\nState Senator Brad Hutto: Home Phone (803) 536-1808, Business Phone (803) 534-5218, Business Phone (803) 212-6140, Email:BradHutto@scsenate.gov\nJudge Markley Dennis: (843) 719-4435, mdennisj@sccourts.org\n\nOh!
