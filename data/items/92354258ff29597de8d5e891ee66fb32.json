  "description": "With nearly 2,000 players in the NFL, being named one of the Top 100 is a pretty prestigious honor. Especially if that placement is bestowed by our own Pete Prisco. Pete got out the abacus and tossed some film on the projector to crank out his annual list, which was unveiled on Wednesday and discussed further on the podcast. Go read Pete's article so he joins us again. Last year, it was Aaron Donald at #1, but there was no stopping Patrick Mahomes this year. A shocking placement for Russell Wilson, proving old dogs can learn new tricks (Prisco not Wilson), as Russ earned his highest ever ranking from Pete. A running back at #5? Okay, the quarantine must be getting to our senior NFL writer. Does he lean on legacy too much for Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and Tom Brady? There's a set of brothers in the Top 25, but not necessarily who you'd think... Tune back in tomorrow for a deeper breakdown of the Top 100 as we hit more lingering questions that present themselves with such a dynamic list.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Bullhorn and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @PriscoCBS\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
