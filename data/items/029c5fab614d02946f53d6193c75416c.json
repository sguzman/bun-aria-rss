  "title": "Cari Lee Skogberg Eastman, “Shaping the Immigration Debate” (Lynne Rienner, 2013)",
  "description": "Cari Lee Skogberg Eastman is the author of Shaping the Immigration Debate: Contending Civil Societies on the US-Mexico Border (Lynne Rienner Publishers 2013). Eastman earned her doctoral degree at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This timely new book explores the border region of southern Arizona. Eastman provides an overview of the policy history of immigration in the US as a way to introduce the complexity of border policy and border politics. In particular, she writes about three civic organizations: Humane Borders, No More Deaths, and Minutemen Civil Defense Corps. Each has a different view of what US policy should be and they compete to attract attention to the region and address this problem. Eastman takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject that combines varied data collection and analysis. The book has a potentially wide audience, including scholars in political science, communications, and sociology, particularly those who study immigration, social movements, and policy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
