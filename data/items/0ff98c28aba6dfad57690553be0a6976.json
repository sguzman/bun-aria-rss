It was the skills, the experience and the character traits, I still had those.” [9:19]<br /><br />“There’s a misnomer around education, [...] They think that exposure to information is learning and I don’t think that’s true, or at least it hasn’t been for me.” [12:00]<br /><br />“Most people have a dramatic underestimation of how much volume it takes to be successful.” [12:53]<br /><br />“Be okay with the fact that you are going to suck and it is okay to suck, you should expect to suck, and it would be unreasonable for you to be good if you haven’t done it before, [...] are you asking the universe to be unreasonable for you by expecting to be good on your first try.”[14:02]<br /><br />“If you can wait a year, you can make a ton of money. [...] If you can wait a decade you’re going to be above the one percent, [...] do the doing without seeing the result.” [26:09]<br /><br />“Most people had a graveyard of failures before they had their actual first success.” [34:17]<br /><br />“With 20 hours of focused effort most people can be pretty decent at something, [...] but most people spend years waiting to do the first hour.” [34:26]<br /><br />“When you hear somebody speak and they really resonate with you, they give you the chills, you get excited, it’s because they’re either putting words to something that you felt but you didn’t know how to articulate and now it’s super concrete in your mind or they make you realize that you believe something that wasn’t true.” Tom Bilyeu [54:18]<br /><br />“You’ve got to optimize for the game to be fun when you’re losing.” Tom Bilyeu [1:08:39]<br /><br />“I judged myself so much on not being happy all of the time because I thought there was something wrong with the fact that I wasn’t happy that I drove myself insane not being happy rather than just being like, [...] ‘I’m just going to do the stuff and just f*ck happiness, for a minute.’”  [1:21:03]<br /><br />“The difference between rich people and poor people, successful people and not successful people is the degree to which they attribute or give power to their circumstance.” [1:33:23]<br /><br />“You may blame your circumstances but no one else will care.” [1:34:54]<br /><br />Follow Alex Hormozi:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://www.acquisition.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.acquisition.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexHormozi\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexHormozi</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hormozi/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/hormozi/</a>",
