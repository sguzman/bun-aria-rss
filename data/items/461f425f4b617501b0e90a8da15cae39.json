  "description": "<p>In this episode, I talk to Kelly Carlin about the human path to wholeness. We delve into Kelly's childhood and what it was like growing up with the influential comedian George Carlin. Recently, she started her own coaching program called Women on The Verge. With a master's degree in Jungian psychology and a coaching certification, Kelly helps women step out of their expected societal roles by empowering them to reclaim their true selves. She finds great joy in seeing others live fuller, authentic lives. We also touch on the topics of parenting, depth psychology, social justice, interconnectivity, and comedy.</p><p><strong>Bio</strong></p><p>Kelly Carlin is an actress, producer, screenwriter, podcast host, and the only daughter of the late comedian George Carlin. Her fascinations range from discovering how to live a true and deep life, to freedom of expression, to the evolution of consciousness and the American psyche. She’s a practitioner of Zen Buddhism, has a master's in Jungian psychology, and comes from a family steeped in comedy, big ideas, and warm hearts. She is also the founder of Women on The Verge, a coaching practice that encourages women to make deep, long-lasting changes within so that they can finally be valued, paid, and recognized.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://thekellycarlinsite.com/\">thekellycarlinsite.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelly_carlin\">@kelly_carlin</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>00:01:19 Kelly’s childhood and upbringing</p><p>00:10:13 The family of comedy</p><p>00:15:50 Kelly’s interest in Jungian depth psychology </p><p>00:19:05 Unlearning childhood experiences </p><p>00:22:22 Women on the Verge</p><p>00:27:01 Embodying new identities</p><p>00:31:23 Dismantling the “tyrannical shoulds”</p><p>00:35:07 Authenticity is congruence</p><p>00:38:48 Social justice and the evolution of consciousness </p><p>00:41:41 The need to matter</p><p>00:48:40 The emerging recognition of interdependence</p><p>00:52:08 Kelly’s future projects</p><p>00:58:17 What would irk George Carlin the most about current society?</p>\n",
