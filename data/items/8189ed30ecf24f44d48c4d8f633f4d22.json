  "description": "<p>The state space for solutions of the compressible Euler equations with a\ngeneral equation of state is examined. An arbitrary equation of state is\nallowed, subject only to the physical requirements of thermodynamics. An\ninvariant region of the resulting Euler system is identified and the convexity\nproperty of this region is justified by using only very minimal thermodynamical\nassumptions. Finally, we show how an invariant-region-preserving (IRP) limiter\ncan be constructed for use in high order finite-volume type schemes to solve\nthe compressible Euler equations with a general constitutive relation.\n</p>",
