  "title": "Beto O’Rourke: A Hopeful Voice",
  "description": "<p>Oprah sits down with political hopeful Beto O’Rourke, who many say has emerged as a fresh voice for Americans who feel detached, divided and disillusioned in today’s political climate. Beto, who’s known for his successful grassroots political campaigns, became one of the youngest city council members to ever serve in El Paso, Texas. In 2012, he pulled off a political upset that landed him three terms in Congress. Then, Beto created big buzz on social media, galvanizing support across the country during his 2018 bid to unseat Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Although Beto narrowly lost that race, enthusiasm for him to run for President continues to swell. Beto says he’s weighing that decision with his wife, Amy, and their three children. “If we come to that same decision about this opportunity to serve and to run, then it will be on that we do together,” he says. </p>\n",
