  "description": "<p>How long can we live? How much of aging is genetics vs. environment? What does oral hygiene have to do with brain health? What causes Alzheimer’s? How do turtles and naked mole rats live so long? Are there any proven strategies for living a longer life? What's up with whiskey and eggs? World-renowned aging expert and biogerontologist Dr. Caleb \"Tuck\" Finch takes a quick break from his prolific research at USC to answer Alie's sometimes stupid questions about everything from molecules to movies. And she only has like, 3 life-altering epiphanies during the episode.</p><p>This week's donation was made to <a href=\"http://CureALZ.org\" target=\"_blank\">CureALZ.org</a></p><p>More links at <a href=\"http://www.alieward.com/ologies/biogerontology\" target=\"_blank\">www.alieward.com/ologies/biogerontology</a></p><p>\"<a href=\"http://americanthanatologist.com/store/bullshit-pens-1-pack\" target=\"_blank\">I don't have time for bullshit</a>\" pen by Cole Imperi</p><p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a> & <a href=\"http://instagram.com/Jarrett_Sleeper\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
