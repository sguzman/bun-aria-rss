  "description": "I feel pretty confident saying that this episode is the most fun you'll have listening to a story about child murder and cannibalism. Jack of Jack and the beanstalk fame is a hero who's...not really a hero. He's a lazy teenager who's kind of stupid. It's ok, though, because he keeps running into a kind ogre who repeatedly feeds him and saves his life...and he repays her kindness by robbing her blind. The second story is that of Jack the Giant Killer, which I just recently learned is a different Jack. His story loops in with King Arthur's too, and it's just a lot of fun...if waking up in matted, greasy giant hair is your idea of fun. The creature this week is a giant pig monster from Greek mythology! Which giant pig monster? Well, that's the fun (hint: there are too many giant pig monsters in Greek mythology). -- Sponsors: Are you listening to podcasts yet on Spotify's fantastic app? No? Wait, seriously? Go do that now!
