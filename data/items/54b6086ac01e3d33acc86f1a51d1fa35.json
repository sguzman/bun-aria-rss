  "description": "In Episode #164 we hear a throwback to an earlier episode with Seb Alex on the ethics of eating animal foods.\n\nAs you know I like keep the topics of nutrition seperate from ethics. But at the same time I think it's very important we are aware of the impact that our food choices have on the world around us, including the non-human animals we share this place with.\n\nHope you enjoy the episode. Be sure to keep an eye out for Seb's new podcast launching soon.\n\nDisclaimer: This episode contains descriptive accounts of what happens to various animals that we eat.\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
