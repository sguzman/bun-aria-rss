  "description": "Steven Avery 2. Our second episode takes a look at the evidence in the case and we also explore the innocence angle. While some say he makes for the best suspect, there are many issues with the way the investigation was handled. Furthermore, the conflict of interest by Manitowoc County in this entire situation definitely has the public doubting the conviction of both Avery & Dassey. Thank you to all who provided information to us and answered our questions. This case is far from over.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
