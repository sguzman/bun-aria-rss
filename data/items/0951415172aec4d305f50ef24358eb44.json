  "description": "Oh hey everyone! Remember us? Well we're back for the first time in nearly two years to bring back your favourite three Olympic podcast hosts to chat everything about the recent announcement of the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and try and get caught up on everything else that we have missed since we last spoke! Do the boys agree with the decision to postpone the games? Do they feel our favourite Count Dracula impersonator Thomas Bach should stay as President or is his time done? Just when will the games be held? Will it be weird to potentially have a Summer and Winter Olympics within only a few months of each other like it used to be 30 years ago? Which athletes do they think this will help now that they have extra time to try and train? What will it mean for our TV viewing in a few months? And why does this mean that the Hobart 2020 Olympic Bid might all of a sudden be back on the table? There is so much to discuss and catch up on as your favourite Olympic podcast returns with a bang!",
