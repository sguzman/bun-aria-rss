  "description": "<p>FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR CLIENT. The world is full of people waiting to bring their incredible ideas to the marketplace. Many entrepreneurs first think about how great their idea is and how rich they’ll get. Before you unleash your masterpiece to the world, take a moment to think about who your product is really for. Entrepreneurs often start with marketing and building business plans. Many don’t make it as far as understanding the outcome they are trying to achieve. Start with the end. Start with the transformation and work backward. Learn to fall in love with your client, not your product. Once you know who you’re creating for and what the outcome will be, everything else will fall into place. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Darren Hardy, one of the most successful entrepreneurs I know. He shared his thoughts on the three biggest mistakes people make in sales. Darren Hardy is a successful entrepreneur, speaker, author, and publisher of Success Magazine.
