  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Part 7. Let your ‘yes’ be your ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ be your ‘no.’ Jesus is pressing forward, with a topic that we still struggle with: Using Religious Language to Manipulate Others. What does it mean to swear or to take an oath? When is that permitted? What does Jesus say about truth telling and bolstering your claims with the name of Yahweh or Heaven? What does Let your ‘yes’ be your ‘yes,’ and your ‘no’ be your ‘no’ mean? The thread from the Beatitudes, through anger, lust and divorce has brought us here. How does this version of truth telling come in line with His previous statements? How does this play into Kingdom living? We look at the verses Jesus cross references here to find the roots of this teaching and what implications it has for them, then, and us today.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
