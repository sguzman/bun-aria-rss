Inevitably, OP's son breaks up with the girl, which causes her to completely flip out and start harassing OP's son. This culminates in the girl trashing the car of OP's son. The girl's parents try to brush it off as \"kids will be kids,\" but OP wants to press charges over the literal thousands of dollars of damage done to the vehicle. Does that make OP the butthole?</p>\n<p>Get $90 off and a free gift at Sunbasket! Go to sunbasket.com/rslash - Enter the promocode \"rslash\" at checkout.</p>\n",
