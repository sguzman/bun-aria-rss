  "description": "<p>Ukraine crisis gets uglier and more dangerous. \"This is going to turn into hell,\" Buck says, and more and more of us will be seeing just how awful it will be as \"it's going to be playing on the emotions of everyone who's not in the conflict.\" How would Putin use a nuke? Clay reminds us that Russia's military doctrine allows it. C&B wisely wonder: What's the status of American missile defense? Bestselling author and former Navy Seal Jack Carr, who just co-authored a column with Buck, joins C&B on how far Putin's willing to go and how America should help Ukraine stop him. Clay and Buck play a clip from Trump impersonator Shawn Farash. Clay and Buck book recommendations. Endurance, Shackleton's ship lost in 1915, was just found. One of Buck's all-time favorite books was about the missing Endurance, and he recommends it for weekend reading.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
