  "description": "Who pays for it? It’s a question you hear all the time, especially when we’re talking about trillions of dollars in government spending.\nAnd with the U.S. government operating at a $3.1 trillion deficit in 2020, it’s an especially relevant question. But more and more, economists are beginning to wonder if it’s worth asking. Since the U.S. issues its own currency, does it need to bother thinking about who foots the bill?\nThat’s what we’re exploring today on the show with Stephanie Kelton, professor, economist, author of The Deficit Myth, and face of the modern monetary theory movement.\nYou might not agree with what Stephanie has to say...but she’ll certainly give you some food for thought. Listen now.",
