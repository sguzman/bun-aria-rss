A quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize and maintain weight loss; optimize human health; and prevent (and even reverse) lifestyle disease — both for himself and his patients (tune in to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll050\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 50</a> for our first conversation).</p><p>About 7 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient. At the time, he was suffering from&nbsp;high cholesterol, high blood pressure and a fatty liver. In other words, he was downright sick; headed towards a future plagued by obesity and chronic illness. Ironic, yes. But not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria. In fact, there was a Wendy's in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of&nbsp;double cheeseburgers — a habit he maintained for years.</p><p>Let's just say I can relate.</p><p>Current conventional wisdom in his field is that overweight patients should adopt a very low carb, low to no fruit, high protein diet — hop on board the ketosis bandwagon.
