Should we send our kids to public school, enroll them in private school, or homeschool? Is there only one right way for all Christian families? In this episode, Emily and Laura revisit the topic of school choice, encouraging moms to thoughtfully evaluate risks, be invested in their education, and outline practical steps we can take as we determine the right fit for our kids’ schooling. There are a lot of voices out there that push us one way or another, but the gospel gives us freedom to prayerfully pursue what is right for our individual children and families.</span></p> <hr /> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our generous donors.
