She talks about cooking during the pandemic, food snobbery, and the pleasures of using less popular ingredients from rhubarb to celeriac. We bond over our equally terrible knife skills and Nigella takes issue the term \"guilty pleasure.\" Team Bittman Project answers your questions from the perfect number of pizza toppings to a dad doesn't know what to feed his two vegetarian daughters. I also share my recipes for asparagus and leek soup and a simple and declines herb omelette.</p><p>Our Nigella Lawson's new book Cook, Eat, Repeat wherever books are sold, and follow her at Nigella.com or on Twitter at @Nigella_Lawson.
