  "description": "This week, we’re back on the boat to the Trojan War where Agamemnon has a problem. I mean, he always has a lot of problems, but this one involves a bunch of warriors with nothing to do but wait for the winds to pick up, and they're not going to pick up until Agamemnon does what needs to be done. The creature this week is pollo maligno, the evil chicken. He's honestly perfect for this segment. -- Sponsor: Simplisafe! Simplisafe home security is my absolute favorite.
