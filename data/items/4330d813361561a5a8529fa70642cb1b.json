  "description": "<p>Kirk comes back from July 4th and puts to bed Justin's terrible \"KMS Radio\" idea for the Youtube channel. Barstool President Dave Portnoy needs to start wearing pants that fit him. Welcome Trysta Krick and Gay Pat to Team Minihane for Season 2 of The Dozen. Jared Carrabis's co-host of Section 10, Steve Perrault, cries about the Minifans being mean to him. Hilaria Baldwin comes out as \"Culturally Fluid\" and no one is quite sure why. The show ends with Dave letting Kirk know he went to Kelly Martin to make sure a guest he booked was alright, and Kirk responds exactly as you think he would.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
