  "title": "Ukraine: The Privatization of Sanctions with Richard Edelman",
  "description": "As the war in Ukraine continues, the world is responding not just with various government sanctions on Russia, but also with a voluntary exodus of private corporations from the Russian market. To discuss these \"private sanctions\" and possible motivations behind them, we invited Richard Edelman, the CEO of one of the largest public relations firms in the world.\n\nAre firms profit-maximizing in their actions? Are they responding to political or consumer pressure? Or are they simply trying to avoid a public relations nightmare? Furthermore, do these actions constitute a precedent to be followed in future conflicts?",
