  "description": "Adam opens the show discussing a recent walk he took through his neighborhood with his dog Phil who loves to flop out on stranger's lawns only to have the homeowner come home to find this confusing situation. Adam and Drew also try to drill down on why the areas that they live in are nice, clean and friendly neighborhoods to live in. They also discuss some of their old Loveline guests who had interesting takes on medical conditions with Drew at first incorrectly remembering the name only to have a visceral reaction when Adam found the correct name. They then turn to the phones and speak to a caller looking for advice on dealing with a borderline family member. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nGetRoman.com/ADS\nLifelock.com Promo Code ADAM\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show",
