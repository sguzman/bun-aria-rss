  "description": "Not many bands can boast two drummers and an uncluttered sound, but Polica made it work at NPR Music's SXSW day party, held Thursday at The Parish in Austin, Texas. At The Parish, the band toned down the heavily manipulated vocals of Channy Leaneagh — on the new Give You the Ghost, her voice slides lithely all over the place — to reveal her as a bold, even ferocious singer in her own right. Hear the band, recorded live from Austin on March 15, 2012.",
