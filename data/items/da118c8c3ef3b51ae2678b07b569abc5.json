To others, he’s a murderer who fatally shot two game wardens after they caught him breaking Idaho trapping laws. Claude had no regard for law and order, and hated law enforcement so much he was willing to kill to avoid arrest. Claude’s early life and years of illegal trapping without being caught contributed to his feelings of invincibility, until his final arrest in 1987.</p><p>Generation Why has even more episodes.
