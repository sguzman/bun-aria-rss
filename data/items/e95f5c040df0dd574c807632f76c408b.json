  "description": "<div>Did a nightmare come true for one couple after one of them had an actual nightmare?<br>\nHere is a preview of the story.<br>\n“My husband and I walk into a hotel room. It is a typical hotel room. Two beds, a dresser with a TV, and a small table. I must pee, so I put my stuff down on a bed, and walk into the bathroom. However, I notice immediately that the bathroom is not your typical hotel bathroom. First, to the left, there is a long, ornate vanity table that looks like it is made of wood. Immediately ahead is the toilet, but to the left - the same side as the vanity - is a small set of steps that leads down to door!<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>I think this is odd, but I sit down on the toilet to take care of business. Before I have a chance to pee, I notice that the door next to me slowly swings open, just a little bit.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>I quickly get up and walk down the steps to the door. It is a very flimsy door, and I open it a little wider and find myself looking into a basement, with cement flooring and walls. There are washers and dryers. To the left, I see a man and a woman talking. They do not see me. They are talking in rapid, hushed tones, and they both look concerned.”<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>To hear more real ghost stories, become a supporter of our show and get every episode, including our weekly bonus episodes at <a href=\"http://www.ghostpodcast.com\">http://www.ghostpodcast.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories\">http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Follow Tony:<br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski\">HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski</a><br>\nTikToc: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski\">https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski\">https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski</a><br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
