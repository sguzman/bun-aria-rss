  "description": "<p>What kind of dude brings a dead raccoon into a restaurant? A cool SF dude. We have the tape to prove it. </p> <p>Plus, we heard that a fake orgasm can be detected if you really slow down the audio on it. Was Uncle Terry faking it? Here's a test. </p> <p>All time favorite derelict Yoshi is back! He talks about more medical experimenting, prostitutes and uses his astute ear to guess which porn performer is screaming into his headphones. Be sure to listen to The Last Days of August available now on audible. </p> <p>AND our original OG son, Redban stops by and we catch up on his ridiculous life. He's our big boy now and he also tells us probably the most disgusting story of all time, which is really saying something on this podcast. Also, Redban would go gay for about $500K. Not a bad deal. </p> <p> </p>\n",
