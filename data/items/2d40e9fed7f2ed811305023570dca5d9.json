In this retrospective on life and books and everything, Kevin asks Dr. Carson about his father, how he sees the state of the church, and what books he especially enjoyed (or didn’t enjoy) writing. From Bible commentaries to books on current events to a grammar on Greek accents, Kevin explores the why, what, and how of Don’s remarkable writing career.</p>\n<p><strong>Timestamps: </strong></p>\n<p>Intro and Sponsor [0:00-1:40]</p>\n<p>Guest: D.A.
