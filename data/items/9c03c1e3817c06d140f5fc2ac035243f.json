  "description": "Glenn opens the show with a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., but are we as free as we once were? The left used MLK over the summer to justify the riots, out of context, of course. Glenn tells the story of MLK’s closest friend, Bayard Rustin, and his complicated but highly impactful beliefs in the fight for civil rights, nonviolence, and LGBT rights. But would the Left still accept him? Tech expert Jeff Brown joins to discuss whether digital teleportation proves Einstein wrong, the future of 5G, and the possibility that we’ll soon have proof of UFOs.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
