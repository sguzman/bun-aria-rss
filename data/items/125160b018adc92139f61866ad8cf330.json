Today, two books that explore the different sides of generational trauma: First, Anjali Enjeti talks about <em>The Parted Earth</em>, a novel that traces the impact of India's partition across several generations and explores how understanding our families' pasts can help us understand ourselves. Then, Naheed Phiroze Patel discusses her novel <em>Mirror Made of Rain</em>, a personal, empathetic view on mothers who society has deemed 'failures.'  ",
