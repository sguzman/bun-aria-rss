  "description": "Someday we may say that we never saw it coming. After seventy-five years of peace in the Pacific, a new challenger to American power has emerged, on a scale not seen since the Soviet Union at its height. With a deep if partially contrived sense of national destiny, the Chinese Communist Party is guiding a country of 1.4 billion people towards what it calls \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\" and, with it, the end of an American-led world. The order which since 1945, has insured the greatest period of peace and prosperity in world history. Will this generation of Americans witness the final act for America as a hegemonic superpower? Can American ingenuity, confidence, and will power outcompete the long-term strategic thinking and planning of China's Communist Party? These are the challenges that will shape the next decade and more. Dr. Jonathan D. T. Ward’s China's Vision of Victory (Atlas Publishing, 2019) brings the reader to a new understanding of China's planning, strategy, and ambitions. A China specialist, with a doctorate from Oxford, where we studied with well-known China scholar, Rana Mitter, Dr. Ward’s provides what the Financial Times calls a ‘stimulating’ and “powerful” narrative which explores with unusual depth and insight the dangers to world peace of a Peoples Republic which is becoming completely unmoored to the peaceful regulation of international relations. “From seabed to space, from Africa to the Arctic, from subsurface warfare to the rise of China's global corporations\", this book will illuminate for the reader the new great game of our lifetimes, and how our adversary sees it all.\nCharles Coutinho has a doctorate in history from New York University. Where he studied with Tony Judt, Stewart Stehlin and McGeorge Bundy. His Ph. D. dissertation was on Anglo-American relations in the run-up to the Suez Crisis of 1956. His area of specialization is 19th and 20th-century European, American diplomatic and political history. He has written recently for the Journal of Intelligence History and Chatham House’s International Affairs.
