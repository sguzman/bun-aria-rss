  "description": "In this episode, I address the stunning hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday. It was a genuine disaster for the police-state Democrats. I also address a disastrous poll for the media and their collapsing reputation. Finally, I discuss this critical failure in the Biden campaign which may portend disaster for them. \n\nNews Picks:\n\nHow is Bob Mueller lieutenant Andrew Weissmann not under investigation for obstruction of justice?\n\nThe media’s reputation takes a beating in this latest survey.  \n\n\nBig developments in the Flynn case which may not bode well for the disgraced Judge Sullivan.\n\nThe FBI notes indicate that it was Joe Biden who brought up the Logan Act in reference to Mike Flynn.\n\nIncredibly, this is a repeat of the 2016 election. The Democrats still can’t find Wisconsin. \n\nYes. Biden wants to take your guns.\n\n\nThe Biden campaign isn’t knocking on doors. \n\n\nCopyright Bongino Inc All Rights Reserved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
