  "description": "<p>The name of Thousand Island dressing was inspired by an archipelago of 1,864 islands that are in both Canada and the United States. Legends surrounding the creation of the dressing are interesting, but even more intriguing are the stories of hauntings connected to the islands. These islands are dotted with villages, forts and castles making them the perfect setting for ghost stories and legends. Join us as we look at the history and hauntings of some of these locations in the 1000 Islands! The Moment in Oddity features the Black Heron's hunting trick and This Month in History features Elvis Presley's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.
