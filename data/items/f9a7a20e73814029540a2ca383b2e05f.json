  "description": "<p>https://open.spotify.com/episode/7LB9DkxkwNK2em5lphKHfo</p><p>*****</p><p>In this 115th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>This week, we talk about the two tiers of society: vaccinated and unvaccinated. Then we discuss the more hidden, and more dire, tiers being introduced first by the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, and now by Homeland Security, in its crackdown on mis-, dis-, and mal- information. We briefly discuss the war on pineapple. We celebrate, again, the Truckers for Freedom, who are standing for freedom and democracy in Ottawa, and whose compatriots are at the Coutts border crossing in Alberta, and the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor as well. We discuss the class component of these protests, and the middle-class’s often erroneous understanding of what working class people do and do not do. We discuss fact checking and rent seeking; also: Twister Sister and Beethoven.</p><p>*****</p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p>Sole: Beautiful shoes and carefully designed footbeds for healthy feet.
