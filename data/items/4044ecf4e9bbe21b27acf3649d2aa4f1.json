  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, We should step back and put events in context as we look at our culture and media. So much of Americanism as we know it is being degraded and replaced with something amorphous; it's being devoured by progressivism. Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, Samantha Bee, the Democrats and so many others are the progenitors of progressivism. Some do it knowingly, others unwittingly but all are activists for this agenda. The left would have us surrender the Constitution. They consistently blaspheme our founding as being devoid of morality and principle, therefore it must be replaced with resistance to our declaration of Independence.We are experiencing soft tyranny when we cannot say certain things on college campuses and the workplace. The left is replacing America's intellectual infrastructure with Barack Obama's ideas, Samantha Bee's ideas, Don Lemon's ideas and promote tribalism and groupthink through emotively promoting progressivism disguised as justice equality and freedom. Also, liberty means different things to different people. Some people believe you get liberty out of government - free college or free healthcare. That’s not liberty. Liberty is a personal and private matter, the freedom to move, invest or collect. Isaiah berlin put it best with positive and negative liberty. Positive liberty isn’t liberty at all – it’s what Bernie Sanders believes. Negative liberty is what we find in the Bill of rights. Finally, Michael Walsh calls in to discuss his new book, The Fiery Angel: Art, Culture, Sex, Politics, and the Struggle for the Soul of the West.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
