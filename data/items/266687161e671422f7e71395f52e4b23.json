  "description": "As the end of the 20th century approached, Radiohead took to the recording studio to capture the sound of a society that felt like it was fraying at the edges. Many people had high hopes for the new millennium, but for others a low hum of anxiety lurked just beneath the surface as the world changed rapidly and fears of a Y2K meltdown loomed.<br/><br/>Amidst all the unease, the famed British band began recording their highly anticipated follow ups to their career-changing album <em>OK Computer</em>. Those two albums, <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em>, released in 2000 and 2001, were entrancing and eerie — they documented the struggle to redefine humanity, recalibrate, and get a grip on an uncertain world. In this episode, we travel back to the turn of the millennium with Thom Yorke and Stanley Donwood and the music of <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em>.",
