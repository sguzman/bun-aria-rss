  "title": "Ep. 489 - Mayor Cheat Takes Iowa",
  "description": "Chaos ensues in the Iowa caucuses as Democrats fails to tally up the votes. Mayor Cheat Buttigieg declares himself the winner even though no official votes have come in, and he’s not polling at the top in a single state. Actually, Bernie Sanders is polling at the top—not just in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, and he’s running second in Nevada and South Carolina, where Joe Biden’s alleged “firewall” is collapsing. We will examine how an unaccomplished communist rose to the top, why party elites are trying to steal the nomination from him again, and how the Democratic Party fell apart.\n\nThen, the peerless and pioneering Rush Limbaugh announces a diagnosis of advanced stage lung cancer. We will see what the reaction to his announcement means for Rush and his enemies. Finally, a lone Democrat turns against impeachment, and rich, liberal, white women pay bigots to call them racist over dinner.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
