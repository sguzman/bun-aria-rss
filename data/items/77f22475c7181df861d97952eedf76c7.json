Mark Cole is once again joined by our special guest, Don Yaeger, who is back to share what he gleaned from his mentorship with Coach Wooden.</p> <p>For those who don’t know, Don is the author of more than 35 books, eleven of which have become New York Times Best-sellers. He has written books with NFL icons like Walter Payton, Warrick Dunn, Michael Oher, and even John Wooden himself! He is a dear friend of the Maxwell Leadership Podcast and of John Maxwell, so we are extremely happy to have Don back for our post game discussion.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the ‘Why John Wooden’s Team Won Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
