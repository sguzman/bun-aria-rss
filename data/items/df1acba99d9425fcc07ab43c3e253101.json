And on this episode, Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech get together for the first Saturday night recap of 2020! The Bills are AFC East champions for the first time since 1995 (2:20). Let that sink in... They're not just division champs, but they could have a legitimate shot to upend the Chiefs in the postseason. The guys break down Josh Allen's MVP candidacy and Buffalo's playoff seeding options. Then, they hit the Packers topping the Panthers (23:00), with a 24-16 score that didn't totally dictate Green Bay's mostly dominant effort. Aaron Rodgers made more history, but the most interesting note from this game may have come from a late Matt Rhule strategic decision. The Pick Six Superfriends analyze the analytics of that move and determine if the Packers will land the #1 seed in the NFC.
