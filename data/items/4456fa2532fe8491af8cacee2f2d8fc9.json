  "description": "The Speaker of the House and Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee have declared we are in a Constitutional Crisis. The White House has adopted a policy of \"total stonewalling\" denying any documents to any House committee to enable mandated oversight. The GOP is playing hardball knowing that whether they delay outcomes or prevent them outright they win. It's a war of attrition and if it gets them to a win in November 2020 it's a huge victory. They're enabling an imperial presidency via a political insurgency and they don't care whether the US or our system are weakened or our enemies empowered...so long as they win. So what's the Democratic Party opposition to do? We discuss with Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post and Ryan Goodman of Just Security. It's a helluva discussion. BYOB. You don't want to miss this one. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
