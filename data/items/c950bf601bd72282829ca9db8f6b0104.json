  "description": "The reason the crowds thronging the outskirts of the airport in Kabul were so large was in part due to a concerted effort--against the advice of many in his administration--by former President Trump and his aide Stephen Miller to block our Afghan allies (like allies in Iraq) from entering the United States. They shut down relevant visa programs. They created obstacle after obstacle. And they did so after being warned that such actions would put interpreters and others who assisted us at risk. That is the shocking fact revealed by former Trump official Olivia Troye in a special episode of Deep State Radio. Troye is joined in this episode by former top Obama White House official Dr. Kavita Patel and by Ryan Goodman of Just Security and NYU Law School. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
