  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Greek poet Sappho. Born in the late seventh century BC, Sappho spent much of her life on the island of Lesbos. In antiquity she was famed as one of the greatest lyric poets, but owing to a series of accidents the bulk of her work was lost to posterity. The fragments that do survive, however, give a tantalising glimpse of a unique voice of Greek literature. Her work has lived on in other languages, too, translated by such major poets as Ovid, Christina Rossetti and Baudelaire.\n\nWith\n\nEdith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at King's College, London\n\nMargaret Reynolds\nProfessor of English at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nand \n\nDirk Obbink\nProfessor of Papyrology and Greek Literature at the University of Oxford\nFellow and tutor at Christ Church, Oxford\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
