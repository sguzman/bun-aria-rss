  "description": "I’m back from the best weekend ever in Napa! Father’s Day on Instagram was a whole thing. Who will get Wendy’s purple chair? How will the new restrictions for trans-athletes affect preteens? Amber Heard pulled an Erika Jayne and is shopping at TJ Maxx. RHOBH Diane Jenkins might regret joining the show. How did Crystal lose 14 friends? Lisa is still coming for Kathy. Then Luann shares her Cabaret show and how the two casts for RHONY may look. We discuss why we think the Ultimate Girls’ Trip shows should continue and her possible spinoff. Then I cover the must-haves every girl needs in her closet with celebrity stylist Jen Principe. \n\nSubscribe on Apple Podcasts to get exclusive Extra Juicy episodes every Friday and get all episodes of Juicy Scoop, ad-free\n\nOr get access to Extra Juicy on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/juicyscoop\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
