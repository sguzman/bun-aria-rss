  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, according to the Tennessee Star, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, election records were destroyed faster than the state law requires. Multiple videos show officials flippantly getting rid of election information. This reinforces an email from Christina Iacono read by this program in November of 2020 highlighting votes that could not be counted and ballots that had chain of custody issues. These issues were ignored by the U.S Attorney of Pennsylvania and the Attorney General's Office, yet Bill Barr claimed that no such issues were raised or brought to the Department of Justice. The media is yet again exaggerating the fact that the government might shut down because Congress has failed to deliver a balanced budget as they are required to under the Constitution. Interestingly, the government is shut down every weekend and on holidays, and during actual shutdowns, only 17% of the government is down. Does the Mississippi abortion law violate the federal constitution? If it doesn't, then the Roe V. Wade decision can be weakened. Even Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has acknowledged that their basis for Roe v. wade was not rooted in the Constitution. The 14th Amendment freed the slaves and has nothing to do with abortion. It is not a right to privacy to murder a child in a woman's womb.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
