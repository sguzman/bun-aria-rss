  "description": "In Episode #223, Drew Harrisberg and I sit down to discuss how to optimise your exercise. Drew provides a detailed outline of how to develop an exercise program, working around different time constraints. We recap past episodes with Dr Richard Johnson and Professor Kieran Rooney, sharing our thoughts on these conversations. We also cover my recent Bali retreat, HIIT training and VO2 max, resistant starch and cancer, and much more.\nWith new episodes of The Proof weekly and an abundance of new studies to keep up with, taking the time to unpack these is incredibly valuable. In this content-packed episode, we recap previous episodes and apply this knowledge into actionable tips you can use to get the most out of exercise.\n\nSpecifically, this episode covers:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nTime Spent in Bali (1:47)\n\nThe Richard Johnson Episode (18:37)\n\nDiscussing Potential benefits of Dairy (30:23)\n\nExercise Optimisation (35:49)\n\nHIIT & Cardiovascular Disease (1:08:38)\n\nDeveloping an exercise program (1:13:16)\n\nResistant Starch & Cancer (1:32:34)\n\nBuilding bigger biceps (1:42:43)\n\nBear Grylls Post (1:59:32)\n\nFeeding Stray Dogs in Bali (2:08:33)\n\nGood News (2:16:24)\n\nBook/Show Recommendations (2:22:21)\n\nOutro (2:26:59)\n\n\nIt’s always great to have Drew on the show to further discuss the answers to questions we may not have covered in previous episodes.
