  "description": "<p>The 23-time Olympic champion, Michael Phelps, opened up to the Olympic Channel Podcast about his struggles with mental health. “Being able to be open, to be honest (and) being your authentic self… that’s kind of the equation for success.” Phelps was third place in what was billed as the ‘Race of the Century’. The man who beat him to second place was three-time Olympic champ Pieter van den Hoogenband. Ian Thorpe, Michael Phelps, Grant Hackett and Klete Keller were all in the race – and all have suffered from mental problems at some point. Pieter didn’t. And, once his time competitively swimming ended, he was still ok. “When your career is over, your life is not over. And you are not a medal.” Links: Legends Live On with Ian Thorpe: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/original-series/detail/legends-live-on/legends-live-on-season-season-1/episodes/australia-s-ian-thorpe-extended/ Race of the Century: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/video/detail/thorpe-wins-men-s-200m-freestyle/ Michael Phelps: Athlete Evolution: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/video/detail/athlete-evolution-michael-phelps/ </p>",
