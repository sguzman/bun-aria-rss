He fell into heavy drugs in his college years, consumed in misery and sadness, before going on his first Vipassana meditation retreat. There, he learned how to accept and embrace change in one’s self, be present in the moment and find joy in both the ups and downs of life. Now a well-known meditator, writer and public speaker, Yung Pueblo uses a plethora of social media platforms to help others on their own journeys towards a free life.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: http://yungpueblo.com/\nBook - Inward: https://www.amazon.com/Inward-Yung-Pueblo/dp/1449495753\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/yung_pueblo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/YungPueblo\nTen Percent Happier Podcast Insiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
