  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the left has eviscerated the local police under the canard of systemically racist policing and we now see the consequences of their poor choices. In Democrat-run cities they are now prisoners of their own systemic marxism. It's the Democrat Party that is systemically racist, and it has been since its inception but this isn’t reported in the news or taught in classrooms. The New York Times, and the media overall, have embraced every single Marxist movement in America, are destroying the 1st Amendment. It is the media that has given voice to mass-murderers like Stalin and Castro. Then, the abolish-ICE Democrats scored a win with a $4 billion cut to ICE's budget. This will flood communities with low-skilled labor which will only hurt the most economically vulnerable. This attack on the police and law enforcement has sparked a surge in violent crime across the country. Citizens must overwhelm the system by civilly suing ANTIFA, BLM, and even police officers suing the criminals if their agencies abdicate that responsibility. Later, the DOJ has refused to investigate the New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey nursing home scandals. Thousands of deaths will not be investigated here, but the DOJ is all hands on deck in their investigation of the January 6th riots.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
