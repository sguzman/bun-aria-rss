  "description": "<div>Hi Friends<br>\n Hope you are having a wonderful day today! This week I wanted to talk about Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris. I cannot get my mouth to say Roy properly , so I said Norris, sorry about it but, that’s the only way I could continue on. <br>\n Please be safe out there, seriously. Love and appreciate you all for the constant kind words you send my way and I hope you are able to have a great week ahead. <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nP.S.
