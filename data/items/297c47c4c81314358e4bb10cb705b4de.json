Later, we must re-open our economy and it seems the White House may be taking steps to get Americans back to work and prevent any future deficit spending or monopolistic control by the federal government over U.S capital markets. Former US Secretary of Education, Dr. Bill Bennett, calls in to discuss his Op-Ed on this very issue. Afterward, Rep.
