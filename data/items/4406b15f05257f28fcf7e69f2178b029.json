  "description": "<p>Good morning and welcome to the ride! One down, two to go. We survived the debate. Steve and the crew give their take on what took place in Cleveland. The Chief Love Officer feels bad for a man who has a faker on his plate. The first debate between 45 and Uncle Joe went down in Cleveland. There was a whole new level of petty from Donald Trump. Our resident poet has special poetry just for 45. It gets real, fast, The End. LMBAO!!! 44 gives us a message straight from The Shade Room. After last night, it should be obvious why WE need to go and vote. Today in Closing Remarks, Steve tells us that he has seen what he needs to see and makes it clear that 45 does not deserve to run this country anymore. VOTE!!!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
