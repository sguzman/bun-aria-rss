  "description": "<p>Meditation: Rest in Awake Awareness (2016-07-06) - When we allow the body to be a portal, we discover the ever-present background of awareness that includes the whole play of sensation, sound, aliveness. This meditation awakens us through a body scan, and then invites a relaxing back into the space of awareness. The guidance is to let everything be, just as it is, and become the silence that’s listening, the stillness out of which all forms arise.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"http://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p> <p> </p>",
