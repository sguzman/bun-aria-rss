  "title": "Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal",
  "description": "Host Charlie spent the last two weeks listening to every song on the Billboard Hot 100. What did he discover? That the sonic similarities of most chart-toppers sound closer than ever. Except for the #1 song in America, as of this episode's release - \"Closer\" by The Chainsmokers, ft. Halsey. This one is different than the rest...or is it? We dive into the styles of the moment to re-learn the old maxim that \"great artists steal\" - whether that artist is a 2016 DJ duo or an 18th century Classical master. \nFeaturing:\n•Tory Lanez - LUV\n•Shawn Mendes - Treat You Better\n•Frenship - Capsize\n•Maroon 5 - Don't Wanna Know\n•Cheat Codes - Sex\n•The Chainsmokers ft. Halsey - Closer\n•Charlie Puth ft. Selena Gomez - We Don't Talk Anymore\n•Jack U ft. Justin Bieber - Where Are U Now\n•Drake - Know Yourself\n•Amine - Caroline\n•MO - Final Song\n•Mike Posner - I Took a Pill in Ibiza (Seeb remix)\n•The Weeknd - I Can't Feel My Face\n•The Chainsmokers ft.
