  "description": "<p>Ukraine Beating Russia Like A Bunch Of Turkeys\n\nRound 1: ZBT Mast. A Mail carrier is accused of beating a wild turkey to death on his mail route. We’ll decide if the mail carrier needs to be court martialed or not. \n\nRound 2: ZBT Mast part 2- Florida man ticketed for going 50 in a 30… BUT, there’s some evidence on his side. He says that he just got the dodge charger, didnt know how to get it out of sports mode, AND he had just found out about Putin’s nuclear war. Pretty good excuse. \n\nRound 3: Burn pit legislation gets approval in the house but insiders arent sure if it will even see a vote in the Senate. Pretty damn typical if you ask us. \n\nRound 4: Russian pows give stirring speech. Many veterans in the western world have asked people to not share the video. We’ll give you the reasons why but also get into whether or not we agree with that stance. \n\nRound 5: Interview with Jennifer Cafarella, the Chief of Staff @TheStudyofWar & Visiting Fellow @MasonNatSec joins us to break down the Whats Next in Ukraine.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
