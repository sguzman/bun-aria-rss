  "description": "How can new faculty find success in academia and what can universities do to support them? In The Empowered Professor: Breaking the Unspoken Codes of Inequity in Academia (Teachers College Press, 2021), the author demonstrates how a coaching-focused stance toward faculty development can improve equitable conditions within the university and contribute to faculty retention and well-being. For faculty and graduate students, this book emphasizes the skills needed to be a successful academic with a focus on lifespan learning. For universities, this book articulates how institutions can implement an equity-driven plan for faculty development. In the first section, Mitra investigates the structures that can contribute to inequities, spotlighting the unspoken assumptions and lack of clarity of institutional processes. In the second section, she interweaves the building blocks needed for faculty success (agency, belonging, and competence) with the traditional academic expectations of research, teaching, and service. With engaging vignettes and extended examples of faculty experiences, The Empowered Professor centers on the space in which individuals can find success within academic settings while maintaining their integrity.\nDana Mitra is a professor of education policy studies at the Pennsylvania State University. Her books include Civic Education in the Elementary Grades: Promoting Student Engagement in an Era of Accountability.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
