We talk about many things, including working with Julian Schnabel on At Eternity’s Gate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> We learn about their working relationship, his dance with Willem Dafoe, and hiding the crew to keep them out of shot. Because Benoit does amazing things with color, we talked a lot about his approach, how he sees colors when he reads a script, and discussing color with Julian. He also tells us about shooting the film The Proposition - the difficulties of working in the Australian Outback, the difficulty of the heat, and the movies that influenced the shoot. We discuss the importance of the DP finding the first shot of the day. Benoit’s wonderful humorous outlook kept us laughing as we covered a lot of ground!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: At Eternity’s Gate, The Proposition</p>",
