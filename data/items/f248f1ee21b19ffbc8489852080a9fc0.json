  "description": "<p>This week on the podcast, we’re discussing two key clips from a recent conversation between John Maxwell, Simon Sinek, and Mark Cole. They discuss the importance of listening and empathy when it comes to leading and connecting with people––especially those unlike us.</p> <p>During the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks discuss what we can accomplish by listening to others and stepping out of our own perspective. During times of tension, we often avoid the most pertinent conversations because we find them uncomfortable. But this episode will encourage you to lean into the discomfort that growth requires of us.</p> <p>Our BONUS resources for this episode are the Leaders Listen Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching, and the live video of the entire discussion between John, Simon, and Mark. You can download the worksheet and find the video link by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/LeadersListen.</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/JohnCMaxwell/videos/vb.48357502953/2734623203439761/?type=2&theater\"> Watch the entire Facebook Live video here.</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663889/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/143-9774832-9982214?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1451663889&pd_rd_r=454811a8-14cb-4644-9b61-d24dcad52ac2&pd_rd_w=cMh05&pd_rd_wg=xXLJD&pf_rd_p=d28ef93e-22cf-4527-b60a-90c984b5663d&pf_rd_r=YZV055AX1WS7026Y8MS7&psc=1&refRID=YZV055AX1WS7026Y8MS7\"> <em>How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk</em> by Adele Faber & Elaine Mazlishprovide</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073521350X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=s0a94f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=073521350X&linkId=f15648adb4c3484dd6d479d7afecade6\"> <em>The Infinite Game</em> by Simon Sinek</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Leader-Shift--11-Essential-Changes-Every-Leader-Must-Embrace--Hardcover_p_2817.html\"> <em>Leadershift</em> by John C.
