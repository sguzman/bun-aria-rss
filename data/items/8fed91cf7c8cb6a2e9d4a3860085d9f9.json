They also discuss what all of this turmoil might mean for the future of the EU as a political institution.\n\nReferences:\n\nPolitico Europe has a great piece on how the EU fell behind on vaccines.\n\nHere’s the survey showing Europe is the most vaccine-skeptical region of the world.\n\nThe New York Times reported politics may have played a bigger role in the AstraZeneca vaccine freeze than science.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Europe may be headed into a third coronavirus wave.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
