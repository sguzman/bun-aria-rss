  "description": "Season 2 Episode 3 TOBY JONES Actor In this episode, Team Deakins sits down with the talented actor, Toby Jones (TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, INFAMOUS, THE HUNGER GAMES, ATOMIC BLONDE). We touch on a lot of subjects during the conversation including the all important relationship between an actor and a director. We talk about what an actor needs from a director and the necessity of sharing a common vision with the director. Toby also speaks about the responsibility and the freedom of playing figures from history. And we drill down to some practical points such as how to use the props without relying on them and the different processes of different actors. A very articulate look into the work of an actor that you won’t want to miss!",
