  "description": "<p>It's only hours until the 2022 Beijing Olympics and we have saved our biggest interview ahead of the games till last as we speak with the most decorated US Winter Olympian of all time and one of the greatest Short Track Speed Skaters of all time Apolo Ohno about his decorated career, his new book and everything else in between! We find out from Apolo just what brought about him writing his new book and how he hopes it will inspire people moving forward. We also learn more from his perspective of THAT race in Salt Lake City that saw Steven Bradbury famously win Australia's first ever Winter Olympic gold and what he thinks about it 20 years later. Added to this we also find out what the chances are for the US to break their 16 year drought of not winning a gold medal in short track, as well as if his blood is really that deadly if it touches the ground in Tasmania. It's an amazing interview that you simply can't miss, so get to listening and get yourself even more in the Winter Olympics zone!</p>",
