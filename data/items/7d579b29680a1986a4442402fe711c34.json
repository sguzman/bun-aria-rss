  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the momentum behind teetotalism in 19th Century Britain, when calls for moderation gave way to complete abstinence in pursuit of a better life. Although arguments for temperance had been made throughout the British Isles beforehand, the story of the organised movement in Britain is often said to have started in 1832 in Preston, when Joseph Livesey and seven others gave a pledge to abstain. The movement grew quickly, with Temperance Halls appearing as new social centres in towns in place of pubs, and political parties being drawn into taking sides either to support abstinence or impose it or reject it.  \n\nThe image above, which appeared in The Teetotal Progressionist in 1852, is an example of the way in which images contained many points of temperance teaching, and is © Copyright Livesey Collection at the University of Central Lancashire.\n \nWith\n\nAnnemarie McAllister\nSenior Research Fellow in History at the University of Central Lancashire\n\nJames Kneale\nAssociate Professor in Geography at University College London\n\nAnd\n\nDavid Beckingham\nAssociate Professor in Cultural and Historical Geography at the University of Nottingham\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
