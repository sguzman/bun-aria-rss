  "description": "<p>The analysis of a continuous measurement record $z(t)$ poses a fundamental\nchallenge in quantum measurement theory. Different approaches have been used in\nthe past as records can, e.g., exhibit predominantly Gaussian noise, telegraph\nnoise, or clicks at random times. The last case may appear as photon clicks in\nan optical spin noise measurement at very low probe laser power. Here we show\nthat such random-time quantum measurements can similarly to the first two cases\nbe analyzed in terms of higher-order temporal correlations of the detector\noutput $z(t)$ and be related to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system.\nOur analysis in terms of up to fourth-order spectra (quantum polyspectra) shows\nthat this new type of spectra reveals the same valuable information as\npreviously studied higher-order spectra in case of usual continuous quantum\nmeasurements. Surprisingly, broad-band system dynamics is revealed even for\ndeliberately low average measurement rates. Many applications are envisioned in\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, single-photon microscopy, circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum measurements in general.\n</p>",
