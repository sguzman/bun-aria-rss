  "description": "<p>In the \"Beast Mode\" world of fitness, one thing that is almost always ignored is the concept of listening to your body. When such a large majority of fitness \"professionals\" preach to \"push through the pain\" it is easy to ignore the fact that your body is talking to you and is often telling you to slow down. If you have listened to this podcast for some time you will know that Sal, Adam and Justin are advocates of the \"less is more\" philosophy. Even though they have been jokingly referred to as \"Team No Sweat,\" time and time again they have seen people improve their results in the gym by listening to their bodies and working smarter rather than harder.
