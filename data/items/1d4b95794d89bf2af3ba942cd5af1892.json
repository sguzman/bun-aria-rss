That's right, we've made it through the preseason, but before we totally turn our eyes to September, Will Brinson is joined by Tyler Sullivan to recap Week 3 of the season prior to the season. The guys discuss the 49ers plan at quarterback and experimentation with a 2-QB system featuring Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance (4:00). They also focus on how excellent Josh Allen looks and why it's wise to get some money in on his MVP odds right now (10:30). Brinson and Sully evaluate Jordan Love's performance (16:45), take notice of stellar play from Patrick Mahomes even when the games don't count (19:00) and react to the Ravens losing JK Dobbins for the year (23:00). The Bears QB situation has been a hot topic of the preseason and that debate will likely rage on into the actual regular season (29:00). Will and Tyler equally agree that Urban Meyer is mishandling things in Jacksonville when it comes to QB1 Trevor Lawrence and with the trade of backup Gardner Minshew (35:00). Finally, the guys dish out winners & losers from the weekend (47:00). \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
