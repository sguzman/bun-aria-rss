  "description": "<p>Alabama investigators are working to sort out what happened at an Alabama mall Thanksgiving night that led to 2 people wounded and a 21-year-old man dead. Police initially said an off-duty officer working as private security shot a gunman who had just shot a 12-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man. But they now acknowledge that Emantic Bradford Jr., who was shot to death by the police officer, was not the shooter. Bradford's family is now demanding to see security and body camera video. Nancy Grace talks to the Bradford's attorney Benjamin Crump. They are joined by syndicated radio host Dave Mack, forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Bober, and lawyer Ashley Willcott.</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
