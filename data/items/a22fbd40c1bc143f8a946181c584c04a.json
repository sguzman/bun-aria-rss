Presented on 09 December 2016 at the Immersive Environments Colloquium at Vanderbilt University. The high definition, closed captioned presentation details the development of two language learning games: (1) a text-based interactive fiction game; and (2) a 3D digital game-based language learning environment, and describes the lessons I learned from the design and development process. The presentation ends with a brief description of a project I am currently working on, a 3D/VR simulation of a 19th-century Louisiana sugar plantation.",
