  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the prospect of banned Golden State Warriors minority owner Mark Stevens selling his stake in the National Basketball Association franchise. Stevens, a billionaire, was barred by the NBA for a year and fined $500,000 for pushing Kyle Lowry of the Toronto Raptors. Seventy-five percent of NBA owners would have to agree in order to force Stevens to sell his stake. It is also possible that his fellow partners in the team would ask him to relinquish it. Stevens reportedly bought in at an $800 million valuation. The team, which is moving to a new arena in San Francisco next season, is now worth $3.5 billion, according to Forbes. Also discussed is the Pac-12's stake sale, which has reportedly drawn interest from several suitors, and a Twitter executive saying the company isn't interested in bidding on live sports rights.  </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
