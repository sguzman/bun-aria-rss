  "title": "Dispatches From the Border, Part 2",
  "description": "<p>After a 35-day government shutdown over a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Democrats and Republicans in Congress are negotiating over what border security actually means. We checked back in with Annie Brown from “The Daily,” who’s been driving the length of the border with the New York Times reporter Azam Ahmed. Their last dispatch focused on migrants in Mexico deciding whether to cross the border illegally. Now, we hear what can happen once they cross. Guests: Annie Brown, a producer for “The Daily,” and Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
