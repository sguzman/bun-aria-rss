  "description": "The rollout of the internet in Africa has been patchy. Some countries have used it to leapfrog others, boosting their economies. For many others, new networks and technologies have yet to bear fruit. From Sudan to Ethiopia to the DRC, the continent is marred by regular internet shutdowns, with the aim of stopping anti-government protesters from organising. And very few countries have taken steps to define the rules of digital privacy and data protection. Yet, Africa remains the fastest growing internet market in the world, with one study suggesting that by 2025 the continent will have 600 million internet users. So, who are gaining most from Africa’s improved online connectivity? Are they the foreign technology giants amassing people’s personal data, governments who can control the flow of information - or Africa's citizens who now have more choices and a voice like never before? Join Julian Marshall and guests as they discuss the winners and losers of Africa's digital transformation.\n\n(Photo: Sudanese protester Alaa Salah during a demonstration in Khartoum in April, 2019.
