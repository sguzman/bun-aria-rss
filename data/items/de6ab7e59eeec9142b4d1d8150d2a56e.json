  "description": "We've got more reaction to the Sam Darnold trade at the top of the show and then again minutes later (7:10) before we get into our two main topics. Let's start with some ADP mistakes (14:45)! Fantasy managers are drafting Cam Akers ahead of Aaron Jones and D.K. Metcalf ahead of A.J. Brown. Are those justifiable or are they mistakes?

We start with the Chargers (26:00) and the Lions (32:00) and what we can expect from RBs in the passing game. Let's hope Joe Lombardi's second stint as an offensive coordinator is better than his first ... We also cover the play calling possibilities in Jacksonville (35:40), Tennessee/Minnesota (37:40), plus Miami, Seattle, Philadelphia and finally Atlanta (49:10) ...
