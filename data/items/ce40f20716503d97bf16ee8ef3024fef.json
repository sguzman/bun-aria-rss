  "description": "<p><em><strong>Light - Part Three: Jordan Peterson, Masculinity & ‘One Another.’ </strong></em>Yowza. Today, we continue our conversation on 'evangelism.' First, Mike and Tim discuss Sean Feucht's not surprising enormous pay day from his 'let us worship' shenanigans. How do people like Sean hide in plain sight and why do some gravitate to it? Also, Mike and Tim react to a new video from Jordan Peterson on the need to save masculinity and how it's dying out. Why aren't men coming to church as much anymore? What is healthy masculinity? What is it that needs to be saved or do we need to let it die? Is evangelism imposing our understanding of righteousness on others? Or is it something else? Is it the Church's job to influence society, or is it our job to be influenced by Christ?!? Mike gives us <strong>59 (!)</strong> '<em>one another</em>' statements from the New Testament and then he and Tim discuss what those mean for us as Christians and how they speak to our place in the world.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
