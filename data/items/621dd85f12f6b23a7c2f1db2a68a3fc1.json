Looking out to 2022, while markets have priced in three rate hikes, Detrick and team believe there will only be two, with the first move not coming until the second half.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of inflation, Detrick doesn’t believe we’re in a rerun of the 1970s.

He notes that when the S&P 500 is up 20% for the year (which we’ll likely be in 2021), it’s been up the following year nine consecutive times. And in seven of those instances, the average was up double-digits. Since 1950, the average return following a 20%+ year is 11.5%.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about your ad choices.
