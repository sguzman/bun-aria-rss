We will be reviewing the documentary Discovery Bigfoot.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Steve who had a scary encounter in the Adirondacks of Northern New York. He describes being screamed up and having rocks thrown at him. I will also be speaking to Sal who is from California. Sal grew up in a concrete jungle and had to move to Oregon temporarily for work. While out for a hike in the woods Sal and his friend heard mumbling in the woods. As they came around the bend in the trail Sal saw two creatures. Sal describes seeing one of the creatures talking/mumbling to another creature. Sal said “They reminded me of hairy cavemen.”</p>",
