  "description": "Contributor(s): Lesley Hall, Melanie Williams, Mary Evans, Amy Mollett, Cheryl Brumley | Senior archivist at the Wellcome Library, Lesley Hall, talks to us about her book on the early 20th century reproductive rights campaigner Stella Browne and how her activism influences today’s feminist movements. Melanie Williams, Lecturer in Film and Television Studies at the University of East Anglia, tells us how film and gender studies make natural companions. We also hear from LSE Centennial Professor Mary Evans on the books that inspired her into social theory and gender studies and how Scandinavian crime novels make for an exciting escape from the quiet academic life. Produced by Cheryl Brumley. Music and sound came courtesy of  the following users at freesound.org: bebeto (Intro music); nemo-day-a-dalus (projector); and harri (inspiration series intro); Riceballofdoom on YouTube (Toronto Slut Walk chant); Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com for his song Hand Trolley.",
