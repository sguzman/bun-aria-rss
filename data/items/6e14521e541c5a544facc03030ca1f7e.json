  "description": "<div>In this week’s episode, Lisa, Mikey, and Jamie head to Lisa’s pantry to test out some of her staples! Finds like xanthan gum (and how to use it), a tasty new puffed snack, THE BEST licorice ever, and SO MUCH MORE! Plus, the MUST-HAVE beverage that when added to other drinks, makes them 100 times better! But wait there’s more… a vegan hot dog that is surprisingly AMAZING! So go ahead and push play now. When you’re done, head on over to our <a href=\"https://www.hungry-girl.com/pages/lisas-pantry-haul\">Foodcast</a> page for all the finds mentioned in the episode.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n",
