  "description": "<p>We consider the fundamental scheduling problem of minimizing the sum of\nweighted completion times on a single machine in the non-clairvoyant setting.\nWhile no non-preemptive algorithm is constant competitive, Motwani, Phillips,\nand Torng (SODA '93) proved that the simple preemptive round robin procedure is\n$2$-competitive and that no better competitive ratio is possible, initiating a\nlong line of research focused on preemptive algorithms for generalized variants\nof the problem. As an alternative model, Shmoys, Wein, and Williamson (FOCS\n'91) introduced kill-and-restart schedules, where running jobs may be killed\nand restarted from scratch later, and analyzed then for the makespan objective.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, this concept has never been considered\nfor the total completion time objective in the non-clairvoyant model.\n</p>\n<p>We contribute to both models: First we give for any $b &gt; 1$ a tight analysis\nfor the natural $b$-scaling kill-and-restart strategy for scheduling jobs\nwithout release dates, as well as for a randomized variant of it. This implies\na performance guarantee of $(1+3\\sqrt{3})\\approx 6.197$ for the deterministic\nalgorithm and of $\\approx 3.032$ for the randomized version. Second, we show\nthat the preemptive Weighted Shortest Elapsed Time First (WSETF) rule is\n$2$-competitive for jobs released in an online fashion over time, matching the\nlower bound by Motwani et al. Using this result as well as the competitiveness\nof round robin for multiple machines, we prove performance guarantees of\nadaptions of the $b$-scaling algorithm to online release dates and unweighted\njobs on identical parallel machines.\n</p>",
