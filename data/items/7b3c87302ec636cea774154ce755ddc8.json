  "description": "<p>A&nbsp;predominant theme of this podcast is the profound impact&nbsp;of nutrition on long-term well-being.</p><p>Less discussed is the importance of hormonal health. Most would be surprised to learn that certain maladies -- including infertility, menstrual cramps, weight gain, hair loss, breast and prostate cancer, hot flashes, and many others -- have one thing in common: they are fueled or influenced by hormones hiding in everyday foods.</p><p>The good (and surprising) news is that proper nutrition can also help restore endocrine balance, often with benefits that rival popular medications.</p><p>To provide insight on how hormones wreak havoc on the body, and how specific diet and lifestyle changes can help alleviate&nbsp;years of stress, pain and illness, I'm joined today by my friend&nbsp;<strong>Neal Barnard, MD.</strong></p><p>Making this third appearance on the podcast (check episodes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll242\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#242</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/neal-barnard-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#296</a>), Dr. Barnard is a pre-eminent authority on diet, nutrition and its impact on illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s.
