  "description": "Does publishing have a diversity problem? In Inclusive Young Adult Fiction: Authors of Colour in the United Kingdom Dr Melanie Ramdarshan Bold, an associate professor at UCL’s Centre for Publishing lays bare the crisis of underrepresentation for British authors of colour. Focusing on the high profile, but also marginalised, Young Adult Fiction genre, Inclusive Young Adult Fiction: Authors of Colour in the United Kingdom (Palgrave, 2019) explores the experiences of authors navigating the ‘diversity status quo’ of the publishing industry marked by significant inequalities. These inequalities, in turn, shape what is published and what is represented, to the exclusion of a wide range of individuals and communities. Along with companion work on children’s books, the book is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary culture.\nDave O’Brien is Chancellor’s Fellow in Cultural and Creative Industries at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
