I am here on Earth to create havoc and terror.\"--</em>letter to cops from The Son of Sam. 1977.<br>\n<br>\nIn the summer of 1977, a serial killer is targeting young couples. He stalks them late at night. He waits until they get into their car, he shoots, and then runs into the shadows. With six people dead and New York City paralyzed by fear, the cops have no leads. And then then the taunting letters to the cops and the newspapers start, \"I love to hunt. Prowling the streets looking for fair game--tasty meat. I live for the hunt.\" What would it take to catch this killer?
