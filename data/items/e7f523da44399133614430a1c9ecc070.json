  "description": "<p>Boy, am I happy to end this week.\nOver the past few days, I've struggled to write, think or care about video games. I've struggled to really do anything. Surely I'm not alone. What an awful week. What an absolutely awful week.\nAnd yet, some really amazing things have happened this week. Like this and this and this. Many people are really stepping up. So this weekend I hope you will join me in doing what we love: playing games. And I also hope you'll lend a hand. You could donate blood or money or anything.\nIt's been an awful week, but I believe we can help to make next week better.\nThat's all. This week's Besties doesn't talk about \"this week.\" We tried to focus on the good, which has been the unspoken goal of the show since its creation. I hope you enjoy it.
