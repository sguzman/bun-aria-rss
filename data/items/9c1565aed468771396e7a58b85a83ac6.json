  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, can we simultaneously love our children and betray their generation and generations unborn? If you embrace Bernie Sanders and the democrats agenda, how can you love your children yet help to create an environment that will harm them? How much do you love your children when you support a Marxist ideology of a massive expansion of government which will smother the individual? Sanders policies would create an economic wrecking ball.  Also, Sanders and the democrats go on and on about hating certain corporations, but no company or corporation has the power of a centralized government. We don’t have to fear corporations, but we do have to fear a centralized tyranny. Our founding fathers believed that liberty wasn’t enough for freedom, its companion is virtue. The Sanders and democrat ideology is virtue less, which is why they come up with schemes to take from you. Later, while President Trump and his team worked to contain the coronavirus, Democrats busied themselves with his impeachment trial, leaving little time to pass the necessary legislation. From January 16 to February 5, the Senate was paralyzed by the House Democrats, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi with this outrageous impeachment trial where the Senators had to sit on their hands and couldn't pass any business.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
