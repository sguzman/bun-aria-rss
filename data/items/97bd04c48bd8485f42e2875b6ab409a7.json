  "description": "<p>York University Professor Moshe Milevsky, today’s foremost authority on retirement finance, discusses his new book, “Longevity Insurance for a Biological Age,” which provocatively asks: “What if the number of years planet earth has circled the sun with you as a passenger is the wrong metric?” Milevsky thinks chronological age is indeed a poor metric, which distorts one’s work strategy, asset allocation and everything else that in actuality keys off one’s biological age. He says a shift to biological thinking will one day make annuities as “legitimate” as life insurance now is. He recounts his rationale for purchasing a deferred income annuity and the strong negative reaction it induced in others, and explains the difference between investment and insurance, and why both are needed.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
