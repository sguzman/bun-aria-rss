  "description": "We may be a little low on Deebo Samuel, Diontae Johnson and a few others, but we're also concerned that we could be missing the boat. Who are the players that we are worried about being wrong about? We start with Davante Adams (2:30) for Jamey and Javonte Williams (6:00) for Dan. Plus your news and notes (13:40) as we talk about the Falcons quarterback situation ... Dan doesn't want to be wrong about Travis Etienne (19:40) and Josh Jacobs (22:15). What if these guys have huge years!? Jamey isn't very high on Elijah Mitchell (25:30), but that could backfire. At quarterback, nobody wants to draft Aaron Rodgers at his cost (28:30), but of course he might just be the best QB in the NFL. And Dan isn't high on Tua Tagovailoa (32:00) but sees some potential for a big season ... Wide receivers on this list include both Dolphins WRs (37:40), Diontae Johnson (40:55) and Deebo Samuel (44:00). Also, which team has the worst offense in the NFL (48:30)? ...
