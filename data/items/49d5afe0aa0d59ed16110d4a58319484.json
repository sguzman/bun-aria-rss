Kennedy School of Government, of Harvard University.  </div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>Rodrik argues that the model of hyper globalization we have been pursuing is unsustainable and that we have an opportunity to embark on a sounder, healthier globalisation. And he outlines his views on what such a globalisation might look like.</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div>The Lecture took place during the Bruegel Annual Meetings and it was followed by a lively discussion between Dani Rodrik and André Sapir, who is a Senior Fellow at Bruegel, which we have recorded and included in this podcast. </div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n",
