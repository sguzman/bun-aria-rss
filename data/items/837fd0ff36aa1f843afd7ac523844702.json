We also learn from her the importance of mental preparation in beach volleyball, how her hugely successful partnership with her partner Taliqua Clancy came about and just why she isn't stopping at two Olympic Games and wants to compete all the way up to Brisbane in 2032! It's one fun chat that you won't want to miss!",
