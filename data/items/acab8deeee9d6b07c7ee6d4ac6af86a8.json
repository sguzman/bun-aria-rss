  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Monday Surprise! We’re so excited to share last week’s episode of 99% Invisible with Fated Mates listeners this week — Sarah’s favorite podcast did an episode about romance covers, and it was thoughtful and respectful and perfect….and not only because she was on it. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She’s so grateful to the team at 99% Invisible for having her, and we’re so grateful to them for letting us share the episode with all of you. Enjoy!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah was a guest on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-clinch/\">last week's 99% Invisible podcast called The Clinch</a>. We're huge fans of the podcast, but it's especially because their episode about locks called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/perfect-security/\">Perfect Security</a>&nbsp;was the inspiration for Felicity Faircloth in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ptqdIC\"><em>Wicked and the Wallflower</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Although we haven't talk about the cover of&nbsp;<em>Tender is the Storm</em>&nbsp;on Fated Mates, we did discuss another Johanna Lindsey fan favorite,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/7/s025-gentle-rogue\">Gentle Rogue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">One of Jen's favorite episodes of 99% Invisible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/vexillonaire/\">is about flag design,</a>&nbsp;probably because it was very complimentary to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/august-2013/chicago-city-flag/\">Chicago flag.</a>&nbsp;Sarah's is obviously Perfect Security, but she also loved&nbsp;<a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/fountain-drinks/\">this one on water fountains</a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you're looking for other great reads about romance covers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-steamy-throbbing-history-of-romance-novel-covers-1832430711\">Kelly Faircloth wrote about clinch covers for Jezebel</a>&nbsp;and it is a must read.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/making-harlequin-romance-cover/\">And Jen wrote about the art of the Harlequin romance cover for Kirkus.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This episode of 99PI was produced by Katie Mingle and inspired by her mom, Pamela Mingle, who writes historical romances. Try her debut (with that gorgeous clinch!),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3x1IL5i\"><em>A False Proposal</em></a>, or her most recent,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fX9tX8\"><em>Game of Spies</em></a>.</p>",
