  "description": "<p>In this episode, John explains why he's fine with Dan Snyder choosing <em>Washington Football Team </em>as a 2020 placeholder before choosing a permanent new nickname, and why there could be considerably less preseason buzz because of a lack of constant training camp media coverage fans love to consume.
