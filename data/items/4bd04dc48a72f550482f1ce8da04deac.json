  "description": "Harmony Bench's Perpetual Motion: Dance, Digital Cultures, and the Common (Minnesota UP, 2020) traces the changing ways dance is distributed and created on the internet from the heady early internet of the 1990s to the ubiquitous social media platforms of today. Bench discusses how flash mobs reclaimed public space in the aftermath of 9/11, how \"hyperdance\" promised that every viewer would also be a co-choreographer, and how viral dance crazes unite people across borders in ways that are potentially liberatory but also can erase the specificities of specific dance cultures. This is a book that will be of interest to dancers and dance scholars especially during a year when almost all dance was presented online, but it will also be of use to scholars and readers interested in the changing role of the internet in our daily lives.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
