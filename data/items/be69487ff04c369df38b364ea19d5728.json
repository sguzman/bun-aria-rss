  "description": "The Pick Six Superfriends are here to talk about Super Bowl storylines. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech are not in Tampa, but they are able to explore what this week typically looks like based on plenty of past trips (5:00). They also discuss the latest iteration of Media Day which has turned into virtual Zooms this year due to COVID-19 (12:30). Next, they rank stories surrounding Chiefs vs. Bucs based on their interest level. Obviously, Tom Brady vs. Patrick Mahomes is getting a majority of the focus (14:40), but how intriguing is GOAT vs. Baby GOAT? The guys continue the discussion that if Brady wins this one, it will be virtually impossible for Mahomes to catch up. Also, Kansas City establishing a budding dynasty has also been a focal point for the media. And if they win on Sunday, they'll be well on their way. But what truly defines a dynasty? Brinson, Wilson and Breech share their thoughts. More storylines include the angle of the Bucs playing at home, Travis Kelce aiming to eventually supplant Rob Gronkowski as the greatest tight end ever and Steelers outcasts Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown chasing a ring.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
