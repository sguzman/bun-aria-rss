    "media:description": "As promised, Matt is bringing you interviews from Stansberry Research's 20th annual conference for the next couple episodes. And today, he has a unique show lined up. On this episode of Making Money With Matt McCall, Matt talks with bestselling author William Cohan. His upcoming book, Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon, focuses on the journey of General Electric (GE).\n\nWe all know GE. It was once the world's most powerful and valuable company, covering technology, electronic equipment, and even finance. But it eventually collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis and never fully recovered. Typically, Matt likes to talk about market moves on the podcast. But today's show is dedicated to this corporate behemoth – and where it went wrong.\n\n00:00 William Cohan Introduction\n4:23 Jack Welch and the History of GE\n7:14 Jack's Departure and Jeff Immelt's Takeover\n13:49 Downfall and Break-up of GE\n17:29 Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon\n\n➡️  Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch \n➡️  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stansberry \n➡️  Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research\n➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research",
