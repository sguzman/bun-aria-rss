In the process, Chana talks to alumni who loved their school and never questioned why it was on the edge of a white neighborhood. To them, it was just where everyone went. But she also speaks to some who watched the school change over the years and questioned whether a local community school board was secretly plotting against 293.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/xX2quyWxQ7I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />\n",
