  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane is not the only talent in Boston whose live show tickets are selling like hotcakes. Another radio station in Boston has died (0:45:50). Speaking of poorly managed radio companies, Kirk got a look at Mike Francesa's streaming ratings (0:52:00). The Madawaska trip went well, but Kirk's got some gripes he wants addressed for next year (1:04:30). Wendy Williams bombs (1:50:30).
