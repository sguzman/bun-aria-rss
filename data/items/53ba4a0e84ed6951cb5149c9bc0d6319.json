  "description": "<p>The only wheat in existence that has never been hybridized or modified, einkorn grew thousands of years ago in the Fertile Crescent. Carla Bartolucci came across it when searching for an alternative grain for her daughter Giulia, who was diagnosed with gluten sensitivity in 2008. This week on <em>Eat Your Words,</em> host Cathy Erway gets Carla on the line to explain how Einkorn has remained unaltered for thousands of years and allows many, including Giulia—who suffered from mood swings, asthma, and digestive problems—to eat wheat without symptoms. Amazed by her daughter’s health transformation, Carla became a champion of this little-known, nutrient-packed grain. Tune in to hear how her book, “Einkorn,” shares 100 delicious recipes for working with the grain and its flour in a wide variety of flavorful dishes. “Einkorn” is sure to introduce home cooks to a delicious ancient grain that can transform the way they eat for the better by adding more nutrition and flavor to the foods they love.
