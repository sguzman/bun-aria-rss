That’s why I’m so glad to be able to sit down with an old friend today, Dr. Aviva Romm, who is my go-to doc for a better understanding fact from fiction, and where the world of medicine is headed, in no small part, through her efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Referred to as “the face of natural medicine in the 21st century” by Prevention Magazine and named one of the 100 Women to Watch in Wellness by Mind Body Green, Aviva Romm, MD has bridged the best of traditional medicine with good science for over three decades. A midwife, herbalist, and Yale-trained MD, Board Certified in Family Medicine with Obstetrics, as well as a graduate of Dr. Weil's Integrative Medicine Residency, she is an avid environmental health advocate, researching and publishing on the impact of toxins on fertility, pregnancy, women’s hormones, and chronic illness in women and children.&nbsp;</p><p>Aviva is one of the nation’s leaders in botanical medicine and is the author of seven books on natural medicine, including the textbook <em>Botanical Medicine for Women’s Health</em>, <em>The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution</em>, and her latest book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wboGt8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hormone Intelligence</em></a> (https://amzn.to/3wboGt8).
