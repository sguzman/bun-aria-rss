While leaky storage buckets get a lot of attention, database exposure is the bigger risk for most companies because each one can contain millions or even billions of sensitive records. Every CISO’s nightmare is someone getting their access keys and exfiltrating gigabytes of data in one fell swoop.\nDatabase exposures have become alarmingly common in recent years as more companies move to the cloud, and the culprit is usually a misconfiguration in the customer’s environment. In this case, customers were not at fault.\nThe research can be found here:\n\nChaosDB: How we hacked thousands of Azure customers’ databases\n\nChaosDB: How to discover your vulnerable Azure Cosmos DBs and protect them",
