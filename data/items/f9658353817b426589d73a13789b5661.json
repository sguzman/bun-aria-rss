  "description": "<p><p>Clancy, Carrabis, and Kayce made their debut on Barstool Radio SiriusXM Channel 85 and had a hell of a week. Alex Bregman saw Kayce on Twitter and decided to call into the show. Jon Taffer stopped by and did a cold read on the entire cast. Kevin introduced Kayce to Heather Brook and we reminisced about growing up. Jared Carrabis earned severalÂ cakes. Genuine congratulations to Kayce Smith for being 5 years in remission from cancer. Tune in everyday Mon-Fri at 1pm for 2 hours of Clancy & The Rockets on Barstool Radio Channel 85 on SiriusXM.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
