  "description": "<p>Healing is confronting, challenging and also the most courageous work you can do. In this episode, I send extra love for those of you deep in the healing journey (which by the way is a spiral, with layers always unfolding.) I share how an emotion gets trapped in the body and needs to be felt in its entirety in other to be released. I also offer different practices you can do to support your healing journey. Don’t let the fear of feeling keep you from healing. Just know the breakthroughs and healing you’re having now are setting you up for even higher levels of joy, ease and love than ever before.
