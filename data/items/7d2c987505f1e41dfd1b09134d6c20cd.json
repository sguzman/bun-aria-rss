  "description": "HAPPY NEW YEAR SLOOTS! \nWell honestly…New Years are a little overrated so you will NOT be getting any “New Year New Me” BS here. This week Sofia gets real about the pressure that surrounds going into a new year and how it is OKAY to not wake up on January 1st ready to change your entire life. So don’t worry, you’re not alone. There is one thing we’re doing a little different in the new year…and that is empowering all the short kings! Seriously this is NOT a joke. If Zendaya can do it, so can you! Sloots, we are leaving the no-good, bad credit having, broken down car 6’2 losers in the past, and finding someone who treats you right, EVEN IF he’s 5’9. Get over it. Finally, we have a Sloot University seminar that really brings us back to our roots: The Lost Art of Fingering. When was the last time you had a really good finger sesh? Don’t worry, we’ll wait…exactly. It’s almost as if once sex came into the picture, fingering was left in the 9th grade. It’s okay though because we are bringing it BACK. Stretch those fingers and wrists out, they’re gonna need it. \nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nEpisode promo codes:\nFitOn: Join over 10 million people getting their FitOn.
