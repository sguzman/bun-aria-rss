  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the hearing with AG Bill Barr today was like the Portland mob inside the hearing room. Not only did Democrats attack Barr, but they didn't even let him answer the questions they asked. The Democrats also seemed to support the ongoing violence occurring in several American cities. They have embraced an ideological change toward radical violence and have abandoned liberty and the American founding in favor of the para-military wing of their Party. Later, supporters of communist Cuba and Black Lives Matter have found common ground in Marxism. The purpose of Marxism is to change or overthrow the way of life and economy in a country. Some would argue that obliterating a country's standard of being is traitorous. Afterward, tech tyranny is in full swing as Facebook and Twitter censor the physicians of Americas Frontline Doctors who gathered for a Capitol Hill press conference supporting the effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine. Finally, Fox News Host Greg Gutfeld joins the show to discuss his new book, The Plus: Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
