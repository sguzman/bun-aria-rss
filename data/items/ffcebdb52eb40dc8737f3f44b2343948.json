  "description": "The Netflix series Bridgerton has hooked audiences with its bodice-ripping sex scenes, a colorblind approach period drama casting, and a soundtrack featuring recreations of modern bangers from pop stars like Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish arranged in the style of a classical string quartet. By bringing modern melodies into the proper world of Regency England, the show reminds us that classical music wasn’t always so stuffy and solemn. In its time, it trafficked in the same scandal as modern pop.\nAlongside these classical-pop mashups, Bridgerton serves up its own ravishing score from composer Kris Bowers, who joins to break down how he made the past pop.\n\nSongs Discussed:\nVitamin String Quartet - Thank U, Next, Bad Guy, In My Blood\nKris Bowers - When You Are Alone, Flawless My Dear, Strange\nMaurice Ravel - Tombeau de Couperin, Prelude\nClara Schumann - Der Mond Kommt Still Gegangen\nJohannes Brahms - Symphony No 3 in F Major Op 90, Mvt 3 (for Four Hand Piano)\n\nMore\nRead Maria Popova on the letters of Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann\nand Adrian Daub on Four Handed Monsters\nLearn more about your ad choices.
