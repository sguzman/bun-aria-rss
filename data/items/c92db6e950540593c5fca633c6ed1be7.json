According to a criminal complaint, in a social media exchange, the teens appeared to know specific details regarding Graber’s death, included how the teacher died, and the motive. Information on a specific motive has not been publicly released. Investigators obtained search warrants for both suspects’ homes and found clothing that appeared to have blood on them.
