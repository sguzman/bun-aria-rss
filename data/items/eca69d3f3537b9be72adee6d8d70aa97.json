  "description": "Our first episode is based on the motivational proverb “<em>Nana korobi, ya oki</em>” which means “Fall down seven times, stand up eight.” It means choosing to never give up hope, and to always strive for more. It means that your focus isn’t on the reality in front of you, but on a greater vision that may not be reality yet. This episode is spoken by William King Hollis (https://bit.ly/WilliamHollis) and Jim Merkel. The music is Satellite by Really Slow Motion (https://bit.ly/RSMweb).<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
