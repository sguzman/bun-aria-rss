Brett is joined by superstar actor and all round lovely dude Will Poulter, as they get down to the topics of life, death and film, all intercut with some awesome anecdotes and wisdom from Will and general good times had by all. This is basically the entire show, with a few small edits for audio (as, obviously, you can’t see the stage on this podcast - so some things wouldn’t have made a lot of sense without the visuals!), so please, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy this packed show and get to know Will Poulter even better than you did before!
