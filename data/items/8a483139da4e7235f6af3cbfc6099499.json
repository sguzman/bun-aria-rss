  "description": "The disgraced South Carolina attorney, Alex Murdaugh, was hit with 21 new felonies from the state Grand Jury. His bond hearing — which was surrounded by skeptism — was postponed and that is a very big deal.\nIn this episode, we discuss each one of the seven new indictments involving Alex’s alleged scheme and his new bond hearing which was mysteriously postponed.\nSources have told us they expect to see hundreds of charges against Alex when all is said and done. \nSome sources have told us that this case is going to be the biggest case of fraud the state — and maybe even the country — has ever seen.\n\nThe Murdaugh Murders Podcast is created by Mandy Matney and produced by Luna Shark Productions. Our Executive Editor is Liz Farrell. Advertising is curated by the talented team at AdLarge Media..\n\nFind us on social media:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MurdaughPod/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/murdaughmurderspod/ \n\nIn 2022 we plan to commission up to 5 different stories for deep-dive investigations.
