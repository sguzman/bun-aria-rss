  "description": "<p>This week, in Tellico Plains, Tennessee, when a teenage girl goes missing, the search take investigators deep into the backwoods. When she is finally found, she happens to be in the main suspect's backyard. This leads to a tip, that chills everyone to the bone... She wasn't the only one. The killer turns out to have a very distinct signature of wrapping denim around the victim's heads, and a seemingly unending hunger for teenage girls. Just when it seems settled, he escapes jail, and disappears. The last hope of finding him rests on the tv show, \"Unsolved Mysteries\". Will he be found, or stay free to kill even more.</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that things work differently in the backwoods, that 26 year old men should never go to high school keg parties, and that you should never trust teenagers to keep your murders a secret!!</p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p> </p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p> </p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on...</p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p> </p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
