  "title": "PMS 2.0 079 - Was Jeopardy James' Loss My Fault? He Tells Us",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat prepares something to honor the Greatest Generation as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of D-Day and the men that helped us continue to live in freedom in the greatest country on the planet. Pat is also starting to get the NFL itch again as the guys discuss what the chances are that Gronk is going to come out of retirement to play for the Patriots next year, discuss the possibility of the NFL going to an 18 game season, while Pat has different ideas in order to keep the players and owners both happy, and he discusses which job he would prefer: Executive Director of the NFL Players Association or Commissioner of the NFL. Later, friend of the show, arguably the most dominant player in the history of game shows, certified genius, and America's sweetheart, Jeopardy! James Holzhauer, joins the show again. He and Pat discuss whether or not being on the show last week brought upon the McAfee curse and ended his run, what's next for James and what different opportunities have come up since his Jeopardy! run ended, his overall thoughts on the whole experience, and what some of his most fond memories of his run were (35:52-55:37). The guys also discuss Aaron Rodgers being chug shamed and dive back into a conversation about the chug as a method of bringing people together, what some of their favorite buffets are, and the guys discuss the NBA Finals and try to decide if Kawhi Leonard is going to stay in Toronto or test the waters of free agency elsewhere. It's a fun one, come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>\n",
