  "description": "We are all telling ourselves a story in our heads and everything that we do will be to stay in alignment with that story. The problem with that story is that it is usually limiting us. That we are not good enough, smart enough, good looking enough, etc. Unless we identify that story and crush it, we will never change and our lives will never change. In this episode I talk about the stories we tell ourselves and how to identify what it is.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
