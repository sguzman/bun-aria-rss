  "description": "<p>The New England area is dotted with lighthouses to protect ships from the treacherous shores of the coast. Some of these lighthouses are more inland like the Ledge Lighthouse that sits in the Long Island Sound. It has a unique design that makes it appear to be a house floating out on the water, although the bright flashing light atop it is a dead give away of its true purpose. Across the water is the abandoned Lighthouse Inn that started out as a summer mansion and later served as an inn. Both of these locations are not only historic properties, but they are reputed to be haunted. Join us as we explore the histories and hauntings of the Ledge Lighthouse and the Lighthouse Inn! The Moment in Oddity features a UFO battle over Nuremburg and This Day in History features the founding of UNESCO. Our location was suggested by Brian Morse.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-164-ledge-lighthouse-and.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/11/hgb-ep-164-ledge-lighthouse-and.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump.com\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p> </p>",
