They also discuss Facebook banning \"deep fakes\" and Teen Vogue's confusion over a Facebook sponsored content article. Kara has a rant for Facebook VP, Andrew Bosworth, about his Lord of the Rings reference and op-ed. In Listener Mail we hear from an Australian asking about big tech's response to natural disasters such as the on-going fires in his country. Overall CES is a fail, but inviting Ivanka Trump to speak was next level fail. In predictions, Scott has some thoughts on the future of cyber attacks and hacks.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
