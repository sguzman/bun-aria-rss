  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the American media is corrupt. All they do is promote narratives to attack the president's response to the coronavirus as downplayed. Yet, it was President Trump that ramped up production of PPE, ventilators, deployed Naval hospital ships, passed immediate cash relief to citizens, and launched Operation Warp Speed (OWS). The OWS initiative has brought about numerous therapeutics and a possible vaccine in record time. That's not downplaying, that's taking decisive action. Then, in the three days that Trump was hospitalized, he's proved that a 74-year old man can be treated with Zinc, Vitamin D, Aspirin, and the new therapeutic drug Remdesivir on a 72-hour period and be released from the hospital. This just wasn’t' possible six months ago. So to suggest that Trump downplayed or delayed the response to this pandemic is insulting. Later, historically, experts have repudiated the concept of normalcy indicating that there is no practical way to contain the infection of a respiratory virus. A stark reminder of how the media has changed since the times of JFK and FDR where they concealed their illness and liability. Today, the media pleads that they have a right to know every detail of President Trump's medical condition. Afterward, Dan Bongino calls in to discuss new developments with this health, his upcoming book - Follow The Money, and big tech censorship. After, Facebook recently limited the distribution of the Mark Levin Show Facebook account for sharing articles that \"lack context\" in the opinion of the Facebook fact-checkers. Finally, Jeanne Ives calls in to discuss her run for Illinois 6th Congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
