  "description": "<p>Artist Walter Robinson immortalizes appetites and desires in his work, painting beer, blue jeans and burgers, magazine models and pulpy paperback romances. Known as the founding editor of Artnet magazine, where he worked from 1996 until 2012, Robinson has been a habitual chronicler of the New York art world. He first flirted with success as an artist in the 1980s, making nurse paintings before Richard Prince and spin paintings before Damien Hirst. But, then, he stopped making art. Over the past few years he has returned to painting and, today, we talk to him about his many lives.</p> <p>For a transcript of the show, click here: <a href= \"http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-20-transcript-walter-robinson/\"> http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-20-transcript-walter-robinson/</a></p> <p>\"In Other Words\" is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby's, produced by <a href= \"http://www.audiation.fm/\">Audiation.fm</a>.</p>",
