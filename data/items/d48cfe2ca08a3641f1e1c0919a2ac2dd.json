  "description": "<p>In episode 23, Christine sees her first ghost (but her second proposal). We also have a special guest…and find out Em is a reverend!<br />Em tells the story of Roland Doe/Robert Mannheim, which inspired the one and only Exorcist. It’s full of demons, priests, and blood, AKA it’s a mess and a half. On the plus side, we learn some Latin! Meanwhile, Christine tells the story of George Joseph Smith, the perpetrator of the infamous Bathtub Brides Murders. Prepare to be mesmerized by his “baby little beady creepy eyes.” And that's why we drink!</p>\n",
