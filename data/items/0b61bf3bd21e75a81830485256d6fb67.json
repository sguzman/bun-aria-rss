But, she noticed that, as good as it was, there was always this feeling of yearning, of it not being enough.</p><p>Then, a few years back, a research project she'd been working on that focused on gratitude triggered her to reexamine her life and explore nearly every facet of her existence anew.</p><p>This launched a yearlong exploration of gratitude, with a series of experiments that revealed how profound an impact simple shifts and daily practices could have on her life.
