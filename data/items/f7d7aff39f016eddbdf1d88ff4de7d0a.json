  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">It’s been over 20 years since Lee Strobel wrote his best-selling book “The Case for Christ.” He talks with Skye about the changing role of apologetics in our post-Christian culture.

Also this week: Scientists discover squirrels eavesdrop on birds. Phil and Skye debate the significance of a Missouri council member taking her oath on a Dr. Suess book. Conservative critics are accusing Democrats of being “godless,” but Pew finds a strong majority of voters in both parties say religion is important in their lives. Plus, the top 10 signs your Christianity has been “Americanized.”</p>",
