  "description": "<p><p>NFL Week 16 Fastest 2 Minutes (2:27 - 8:28). We recap every game from Saturday and Sunday (8:28 - 88:17). The Bears were in a Patrick Mahomes torture chamber on Sunday Night Football. Jameis was electric on Saturday, the Patriots put away the panic button, and the Rams season ended. The bad games were great on Sunday including the Dolphins/Bengals and Giants/Redskins. Dan Quinn is going to keep his job, maybe? The Cowboys shit the bed and the Seahawks remain an enigma. Who's back of the week to finish off the show. </p><p> Schedule for Christmas Week - Thursday Best of, regular episode Monday after Week 17 </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
