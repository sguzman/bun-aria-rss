  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Today's episode looks at the Old English sense of the word <em>wyrd</em>. Originally, it wasn’t an adjective, but a noun that’s commonly translated into Modern English as ‘fate.’ However, this oversimplified translation doesn't tell the word's full story. By comparing and contrasting etymological and cultural evidence, it’s clear that <em>wyrd</em> and \"fate\" are really not the same thing at all. </p>",
