  "description": "<div>A woman fears visiting the basement laundry room in her home because she knows something, or someone resides in the dark down there.<br>\nHere is a preview.<br>\n“So, the experience that frightens me the most is not actually a ghost, but probably demon related. But, while in my late 20s, I lived alone in a small apartment. I joke to people that I was a big X-files fan, and I always seemed to do my washes on the night of the show. The apartment complex had a laundry room behind the apartment building in the basement. It was small, so I would have to do my wash during the week to get a free washer.”<br>\n<br>\nTo hear more real ghost stories, become a supporter of our show and get every episode, including our weekly bonus episodes at <a href=\"http://www.ghostpodcast.com\">http://www.ghostpodcast.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories\">http://www.patreon.com/realghoststories</a><br>\n<br>\nWatch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/</a><br>\n<br>\nIf you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\nIf you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
