  "description": "<p>Elizabeth Lesser wants to set the record straight. The one that started all the way back with Adam and Eve. The origin story that positioned man as firstborn and favored and women as second-born and scorned. The mythology that seems to exist in nearly every faith, tradition, culture and history about the “place” of women in relationships, family, society, business, power and the world. Lesser decided it was time to do some myth-busting, some reconciliation and some reimagining about what this world, on every level, might look like if truth found its way into the narrative and power were more evenly distributed.</p><p>As the co-founder of the iconic Omega Institute, recognized internationally for its workshops and conferences in wellness, spirituality, creativity, social change and women’s leadership, Elizabeth has been gathering people from all walks of life to explore the intersection between gender, power, equity and impact for more than 40 years. She has presented at TED, was named to Oprah’s Super Soul 100, and is the author of several bestselling books, including <em>Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow,</em> and <em>Marrow: Love, Loss & What Matters Most</em>, which first brought her onto the podcast a few years back and also led to the gift of her friendship since.
