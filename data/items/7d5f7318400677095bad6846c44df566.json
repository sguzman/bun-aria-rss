  "description": "<p>Digital has transformed the way consumers approach entertainment and media consumption. The days of appointment TV, setting DVRs, and losing the remote are fading into the distance. Now consumers can stream shows when they want, where they want them. This shift has created a new marketplace for content services and is changing the way advertisers market to consumers. How can businesses capitalize on these trends?</p> <p>In this episode, Deloitte’s Kevin Westcott and Scott Lippstreu discuss how traditional television is losing ground to streaming, how binge watching impacts content distribution, what changes advertisers are taking to reach consumers, and how social media's stronghold on consumers may provide new opportunities for advertising.</p>",
