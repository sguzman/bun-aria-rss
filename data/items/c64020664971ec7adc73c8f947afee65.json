  "description": "The White House is a shambles. The president is an object of ridicule among his closest aides. The Congress is looking the other way seeming to want to rush a Supreme Court nominee into office before the President is himself hustled before a judge.  But that's not the worst of it.  Dysfunction in Washington leads to big problems worldwide.  This week, our panel including commentator and analyst Rula Jebreal, Georgetown Law School's Rosa Brooks and the Financial Times' Ed Luce consider the latest in DC and one of the places where Trump policies are making a bad situation much much worse--the Middle East.
