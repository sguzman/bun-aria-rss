  "description": "<p>The Golden Lamb Inn is the state of Ohio's oldest hotel. The hotel has been the gathering place for residents of Lebanon for over 200 years. Through the years, it has changed ownership and names and hosted a variety of presidents and famous people. But the one constant has been the symbol for which it is named: the Golden Lamb. The deep history of this inn includes a connection to war, stage coaches and much more, which has led to rumors of hauntings at the establishment. For some guests, more than just their signature's remain at the inn. Their spirits seem to have remained. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Golden Lamb Inn. The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features Ruston Triangular Lodge and This Day in History is by April Rogers-Krick and features the beheading of Anne Boylen. Our location was suggested by listener Stefanie Martin and Research Assistants were Annette Student and Sharon Spungen.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-125-golden-lamb-inn.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/05/hgb-episode-125-golden-lamb-inn.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
