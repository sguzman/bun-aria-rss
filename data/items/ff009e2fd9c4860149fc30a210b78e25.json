  "description": "<p><p>Today's 5 rounds:</p><p>1 - (5:30) A Military Plane takes a couple of low passes over Nashville and makes residents sound like they are gonna shit their pants. Should the military have to issue text alerts for training like this?</p><p>2 - (13:40) The Gubment Shutdown blues song is sweeping the nation. A Coast Guard vet's song is now being played on local radio stations and finding an audience online and through social media.</p><p>3 - (20:30) The Army released its 1300 page report on the Iraq War. Some of the take aways are the biggest “no shit statements” you could possibly imagine.</p><p>4 - (28:00) Sgt. Troney? More like PHONEY BALONEY. Last week we gave a shout out to Sgt. Trey Troney for his heroic actions at a car wreck. Hear why we're RETRACTING it this week.</p><p>5 - (40:45)  Jerry Yellin was the last fighter pilot in the skies of WWII. We take a look back at his final mission on Iwo Jima and a beautiful tributethat he gave when he went back to the volcanic sands at the age of 91!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
