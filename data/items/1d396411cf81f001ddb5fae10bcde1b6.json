People have been obsessing and hearing about dopamine and its role in human behavior for years. You may think of it as the feel-good happy hormone, or you may associate it with addiction, love, lust and sex. As our lives convert over to a totally digital experience that is with us everywhere we are in the form of a cell phone, dopamine detox has even started gaining in popularity. Dr. Andrew Huberman from the Huberman Lab is back again to unpack some of the more surprising discoveries and uses of dopamine. He cleverly relates dopamine to being a biological currency that has a role to play in human desire for more. Dopamine is the catalyst pushing humanity forward exploring things like cryptocurrency and pushing our limitations and what is possible, but is all of that for the sake of pleasure and feeling good? Dr. Huberman breaks down the eternal balance of pain and pleasure, arousal and relaxation and gives you the insight you need to start regulating your body’s dopamine release. If you thought dopamine was all about feeling good, Dr. Huberman is about to reveal why it’s more about what motivates you in the pursuit of something greater.   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction Dr. Andrew Huberman 0:56 | Dopamine the Biological Currency 6:51 | Releasing Dopamine 10:38 | Hormonal Signaling 14:34 | Can We Spike Dopamine? 21:00 | Value the Pursuit & the Dips 25:40 | Balance of Pain and Pleasure 31:23 | Self Regulation of Dopamine 38:28 | Dopamine and Time Perception 44:31 | Dopamine and Overindulging 49:05 | Action Based Denial 52:42 | Using Rules & Dopamine 58:27 | Ways to Get Motivated   QUOTES:   “When I say dopamine is the universal currency of everything, what I mean is, it's driving the motivation to develop new currencies.” [3:08]   “Celebrating the win more than the pursuit, it actually sets you up for failure in the future.” [16:00]   “If you can start to register that craving, and that friction and that desire, that almost kind of low level of agitation, sometimes high level of agitation [...] that's dopamine...” [17:54]   “Your capacity to tap into dopamine as a motivator, not just seeking dopamine rewards, that is infinite.” [19:34]   “It's the craving that makes me feel alive. So it's the state of wanting that is in and of itself, the pleasurable act.” [22:37]   “It doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin or aetherium, it doesn't matter if it's putting rockets on other planets, it doesn't matter if it's building the first automobile, it's the same currency.” [25:27]   “Dopamine itself is not the reward. It's the build up to the reward, and the reward has more of a kind of opioid bliss like property,” [29:51]   “The more pain you experience, the more dopamine you can achieve. If you get back on the avenue of pursuit.” [30:58]   “I would say addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure, and I don't like to comment too much on enlightenment, [...] but a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure, and even better is a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation and hard work. “ [32:55]   “If you think about most of the growth in life comes from these rigidly externally imposed schedules and we hate them. But they are where we learn restraint” [52:42]     Follow Andrew Huberman: Website: <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hubermanlab.com/</a> YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/andrewhubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/andrewhubermanlab</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a> Podcast: <a href=\"https://hubermanlab.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://hubermanlab.com/</a>  ",
