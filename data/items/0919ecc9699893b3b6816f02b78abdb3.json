  "description": "<p>Santorini is one of Greek wine's guiding lights. The wines from this ancient volcanic island are unlike any other – exhibiting fullness, smoky minerality, and acidity that you won’t find elsewhere. The whites of Assyrtiko are among the best Greece has to offer. The fascinating history and legacy of viticulture will transport you to this lovely Mediterranean paradise. In this show, we take you on the ultimate armchair travel destination: the island of Santorini, a Greek paradise!</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/images_1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" /></p> <p><strong>Here are the show notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Santorini is at 36.4 N latitude, in the Cyclades group of islands.  </li> <li>The region has 2200-2900 acres/900-1,200 hectares of land are under vine</li> <li>Santorini was formed by an enormous volcanic eruption around 2,600 years ago</li> <li>Wine has been made since the ancient Greek and Roman times but a Venetian crusader took over in 1336 and made the sweet wines of the Assyrtiko grape, <em>Vinsanto</em>, popular around the Mediterranean</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Santorini_Caldera_Landsat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"274\" /></p> <ul> <li>On the poor, volcanic soil on this hot windy island, the grapes are trained via an ancient pruning system, called “kouloura.\" The trunk is trained into a basket-like or wreath-like shape so the grapes hang on the of the basket, protected from wind and harsh sun</li> <li>Some of these basket trained vines may be over 400 years old; with Assyrtiko making up 70-80% of the plantings. </li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <ul> <li>In this dry, harsh climate with less than 10 inches of rain per year, grapes struggle.
