  "description": "<div>Sam's guest in this week’s books podcast is Mary Ann Sieghart, whose new book <em>The Authority Gap </em>accumulates data to show that so-called 'mansplaining' isn’t a minor irritation but the manifestation of something that goes all the way through society: women are taken less seriously than men, even by other women. She says it’s not just 'wokery' to point it out, and she makes the case for how she thinks it came to be, what we can do to change it, and why we should take the trouble.</div>\n",
