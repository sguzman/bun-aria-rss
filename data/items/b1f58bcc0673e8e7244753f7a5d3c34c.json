Welk, a household name, and host of his own show (that you probably only watched at your grandma’s house), was one of the wealthiest entertainers in the U.S before his death in the early 1990s. He came from humble beginnings, growing up on a farm in North Dakota with his German immigrant parents and several siblings. Over the course of his long musical career, Welk became the sound of an era; his “champagne music” stirring nostalgia in a generation who socialized at public dance halls and waltzed the night away.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
