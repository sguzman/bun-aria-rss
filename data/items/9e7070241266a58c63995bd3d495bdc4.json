  "description": "<p>Dr. Anthony Sweat returns (due to popular demand) and explains  why Section 29 is a favorite section regarding a broad scope of the Lord’s work and vision. Dr. Sweat also gives teachers the idea of a Scriptural and Historical Scavenger Hunt in Section 29. Not all sections are created equal and Section 29 illuminates the Premortal Existence, the Creation, the Fall, the Atonement, the Second Coming of Jesus, the Millenium, and the rationale for building Zion. Jesus intends to gather Israel and He uses Section 29  to teach His people about His elect. On God’s team, you get to choose to be a part--your choices matter and these concepts were revelatory to the Church membership.</p><p><br/></p>",
