  "description": "<p>For years, venture capital firms have been pouring money into start-ups, trying to get a piece of the next Amazon or Apple. Valuations for new tech companies soared, and many of them took to crypto to explore new forms of raising money. That included issuing tokens to venture capital funds who sometimes then flipped them to retail investors. Now, Silicon Valley seems to be crashing back down to Earth. And an industry that's all about sourcing more and more money at higher valuations, is having to contend with down rounds. Meanwhile, many of the tokens sold by start-ups have lost value during the crypto crash. On this episode we speak with long-time angel investor and co-host of the 'All-In' podcast Jason Calacanis, who was early into companies like Uber, Calm and Robinhood. He predicts that Silicon Valley is about to learn a very expensive lesson.<strong></strong></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
