On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Kenny White to break down Chiefs-Bucs from a betting perspective. First, the guys assess their conference championship picks (1:00), before evaluating the big game. Kansas City opened as 3.5-point favorites but the spread has settled in at 3 and Kenny doesn't foresee much movement coming (7:30). By now, we're all aware that Tampa will be the first team to play a Super Bowl in their own stadium, but how could that be factored into the line (9:45)? Will and Kenny give a tip for the moneyline, break down the total (16:30) and more on this early betting preview!\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
