Operas and ballet are more grand. \n\nThe other musical option is the concept album. These are records where all the songs, all  the imagery, is somehow tied togethor by some sort of unifying theme or thesis. The music, the lyrics and sometimes even the artwork come togehtor to tell a story. \n\nThese were big in the '60's and 70's but they were seen as old rock and needed to be expunged from popular culture. \n\nBut then a funny thing happened. They started to make a comeback...the stigma vanished, and they even found a place in Alt-Rock.\n\nHere...let me show you.\n\nSongs in this episode:\n\n\nGreen Day - American Idiot,\n\nDavid Bowie - Ziggy Stardust,\n\nKraftwerk - Computer Love,\n\nHusker Du - Pink Turns to Blue,\n\nNine Inch Nails - Hurt,\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Bullet With Butterfly Wings,\n\nWeezer - No Other One,\n\nTool - Stinkfist,\n\nMarilyn Manson - Beautiful People\n\n\n \n\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
