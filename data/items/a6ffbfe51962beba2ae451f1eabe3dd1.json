  "description": "There’s something a little strange about the pairing of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Certainly it’s the surprise of a pairing of seeming opposites, at least from a physical standpoint-- she the small, seductive, and somewhat frail painter whose subject matter referred to the most intimate sides of her own life; he, the large and somewhat brutish muralist whose large-scale works touched upon revolution and justice and larger issues of Mexican history. There’s almost a Beauty and the Beast quality there, and for many of us, the relationship between these two artists is just as intriguing as their creative output. And especially when it comes to Frida’s art, it’s very hard to separate their love from their artistic legacy. But how did it begin? And what is it about these two that makes them so fascinating, even 60 years later?\n//SUBSCRIBE and review us on iTunes HERE! \n And follow us on Twitter and on Instagram for more artsy goodness:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/artcuriouspod/                                                            Twitter: https://twitter.com/artcuriouspod\n\nLooking for a transcription of this episode?
