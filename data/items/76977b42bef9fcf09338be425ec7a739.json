What does she drink? What are the challenges of being a famous musician?

In his lengthy writings, he specifically called out the quality, noting:\n\n\"Some time during the Civil War it was discovered that if raw whiskey as it came from the still, unrectified and without distillation, and thus containing one-half to one-sixth of 1 percent of fusel oil, was kept in oak barrels, the inside of the staves of which were charred, the tannic acid of the charred oak which found its way from the wood into the distilled spirits would color the raw white whiskey to the conventional color of American whiskey, and after some years would eliminate altogether the raw taste and the bad odor given the liquor by the fusel oil and would leave a smooth, delicate aroma, making the whiskey exceedingly palatable without the use of any additional flavoring or coloring. The whiskey thus made by one distillation and by the aging in charred oak barrels came to be known as \"straight whiskey,\" and to those who were good judges came to be regarded as the best and purest whiskey...\"\n\nFor this decision, Taft is in the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame.\n\n \n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
