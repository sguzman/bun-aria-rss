  "description": "<p>At the height of her career, sharpshootin' Annie Oakley the talented sharpshooter was the most famous woman in America, if not the world - dazzling audiences and setting records as she fired at clay pigeons, birds, glass balls and performing a wide array of \"How in the Hell is that possible?\" trick shots. Annie's love of guns began in her childhood, when she didn’t use them to entertain, but to survive. Literally. Born Phoebe Ann Mosey, Annie picked up her father’s gun when he died, and she hunted to help feed her incredibly impoverished family. As a teen, she’d use her skills to pay off her mother’s mortgage. And it was during one of these shooting competitions where she would meet and beat her future husband, an Irish immigrant named Frank Butler. Their love story is pretty damn special and incredible. In a time when a female breadwinner was almost unheard of, Annie went on to become one of the highest paid entertainers in the world. And we Suck her life and times in today's gun-slinging, wild west, record-breaking edition, of Timesuck.</p>\n<p>In honor of Veteran’s Day,  we made a Bad Magic Productions donation of $10,000 to <a href=\"https://veteransfoodpantry.org/\"><strong>https://veteransfoodpantry.org/</strong></a>.
