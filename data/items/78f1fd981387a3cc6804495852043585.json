  "description": "Hey Trumpcast listeners, here's another show from Slate: A Word, with Jason Johnson. \n \nYou’ve heard Jason on Trumpcast several times. Now, every Friday he brings his sharp analysis to discussions with policy-makers, journalists, entertainers, and other experts about America’s challenges around race, and ideas on the way forward. If you like the episode, subscribe to A Word right here in your podcast app.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, marking her second anniversary in office, would only grant one-on-one interviews to journalists of color. Lightfoot said she was highlighting a lack of media diversity. Critics call it racist. Could this policy change the status quo, or just be a distraction? Jason Johnson is joined by Errin Haines, editor-at-large of The 19th*, a non-profit news outlet focused on women. They discuss why too many urban newsrooms remain overwhelmingly white, and whether Lightfoot’s move was a step toward equality, or a political stunt.\n\nPodcast production by Ahyiana Angel and Jasmine Ellis.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
