  "description": "<p>The Trinity is one of the most unique and startling of all Christian teachings. One of the most important things to know about the New Testament is that the Trinity— that God is one God containing three persons— is assumed everywhere, and so it’s in the background of every text.</p>\n<p>How can we talk about and think about the idea of the Trinity? This sermon will cover: 1) The difficulty of the thought of the Trinity; 2) The power of the thought; 3) The proof of the thought.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on June 12, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: Matthew 28:16-20.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
