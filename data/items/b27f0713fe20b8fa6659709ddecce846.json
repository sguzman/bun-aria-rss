  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane gives The Irishman a B- while the Mr. Rogers movie gets an A+. The crew talks about what they liked and what they hated from the much-anticipated Scorcese flick. Minihane plays mediator between Blind Mike and Steve Robinson following last Wednesday's pre-Thanksgiving clash and Mike's Friday night therapy session with the Minifans. Mama Geary makes an appearance vis-a-vis a post-family dinner interview live streamed to Periscope. A little politics talk after Joe Biden tells a bunch of kids about the hair on his legs. In the final hour, some real talk: God, Heaven, Hell -- the fundamental questions of human existence. And Steve's hemorrhoid.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
