  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Bruce Springsteen fans were appalled last month, when Ticketmaster sold some seats for his upcoming concert tour for as much as $5,000. The average price was actually around $262, according to Ticketmaster. But for a certain subset of tickets, when demand spiked, so did the prices. Ticketmaster uses &#8220;dynamic pricing algorithms,&#8221; which calculate the price of a seat based on real-time demand. Among other things, it&#8217;s an attempt to edge out ticket scalpers. There&#8217;s been backlash against this before. Ride-hailing apps like Uber use this kind of algorithm too; it&#8217;s called surge pricing. And it has kicked in during emergencies like a terrorist attack and a mass shooting — prices went through the roof as people were trying to flee. &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8217;s&#8221; Marielle Segarra spoke with Vivek Farias, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management, about the concept behind dynamic pricing and how to potentially avoid letting an algorithm create situations like this.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
