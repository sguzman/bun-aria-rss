Katharine, a self-described tomboy from the start, carried her strong-willed and independent nature with her to her acting, often imbuing her roles with&nbsp; a “vital something” that attracted audiences. But she wasn’t without her critics–those who felt she was rude and lacked the more feminine traits of a starlet. Nevertheless, Hepburn was nominated for twelve Academy Awards during her prolific cinema career and has become one of Hollywood’s most beloved leading ladies.
