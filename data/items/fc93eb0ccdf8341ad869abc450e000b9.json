  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump hasn't committed a single impeachable offense. Trump has every right to use a private envoy to employ his foreign policy and Rudy Giuliani has become a boogie man because he worked around the bureaucracy. This is legal and permissible under the powers of the president and has been done since the days of George Washington. Then, Fiona Hill was obnoxious and wrong in her testimony today. The truth is that career diplomats and bureaucrats that have served both democrat and republican presidents will all hate Trump because he is nothing like the last four U.S Presidents. The basis for this whole impeachment inquiry has been the so-called whistleblower's complaint — not the individual making the complaint known as the so-called whistleblower — but the actual complaint itself. The reason for that is that the whistleblower didn't write it, he had help from Adam Schiff and the former National Security Council staffers that now work for Schiff in the Intelligence Committee. Later, the Israeli media says Benjamin Netanyahu should resign, this program disagrees. Netanyahu shouldn’t give into this abuse of power. Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz joins the program to discuss impeachment, the soft coup against Netanyahu.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
