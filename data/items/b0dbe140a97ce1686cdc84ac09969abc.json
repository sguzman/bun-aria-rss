  "description": "This electric car revolution is finally on the horizon: many car manufacturers have promised to make only electric vehicles in the near future, in response to the climate emergency.  But the first mass-produced modern electric car, the General Motors EV1, was launched back in 1996.  Within a few short years it was scrapped: almost every vehicle was recalled and crushed, and the car of the future disappeared in history’s rear-view mirror.  Viv Jones hears the story from one of the car’s creators, research engineer Wally Rippel.\n\nPhoto: The GM EV1 (Kim Kulish/Sygma via Getty Images)",
