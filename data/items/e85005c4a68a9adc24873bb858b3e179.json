  "description": "In this episode, Sharon is joined by This American President Podcast host Richard Lim. Together they “nerd out” on facts about an under-the-radar president who was more influential than he’s often given credit for: Andrew Jackson. Listen in as they swap their favorite facts about his blasphemous parrot, Poll, his early capture as a prisoner of war, his propensity for dueling, and even how his opposition to the electoral college shaped the future of federal politics. Andrew Jackson was very instrumental in the early growth of Nashville, and the state of Tennessee. It was there that he met and married his wife, Rachel… who was already married to someone else. While in office, he also completely paid down America’s national debt by vetoing many spending bills. He was a president who reflected the people: both their great flaws and their great abilities.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
