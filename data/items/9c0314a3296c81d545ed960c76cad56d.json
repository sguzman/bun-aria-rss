  "description": "<p>Today's show features three of our favorite interviews from this week's radio show (Live on Westwood One from 10 AM - Noon EST, and live streamed on DAZN) with some incredible guests. First, Pat is joined by friend of the show, 7x Pro Bowler, 2x First Team All-Pro, former center for the New York Jets, Nick Mangold. They discuss his new venture into sports betting, the problem with all the horrendous refs in the NFL, his thoughts on the bill being passed in California to pay college athletes for the use of their image and likeness, what the difference between skinny and fat Rex Ryan is, and why he isn't in the Hall of Fame at Ohio State (2:20-23:10). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current WR for the Detroit Lions, Danny Amendola, joins for a chat with Pat. They discuss the differences between Tom Brady and some of the other quarterbacks he has played with, what he likes about the culture being built in Detroit, how all the fallout from his social media affected him, and whether or not it was fabricated, and he and Pat reminisce about a crazy night they had together in New Mexico (23:45-38:42). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 12 year NFL veteran, former QB for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers, Charlie Batch, calls into the show. He and Pat discuss what his take is on Daniel Jones starting over Eli Manning, and how he was in a similar situation when he was in Detroit, and what the best way for Daniel Jones to have success will be. He also chats about the Big Ben situation with the Steelers and whether he thinks they'll be okay, and he dishes on what it was like being teammates with Barry Sanders, and whether or not his retirement was in any way similar to Andrew Luck's (41:39-1:01:07). Today's show is a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
