  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the media doesn't follow the Democrat Party, the media leads the Democrat Party. Politico’s headline says, will the media's climate change blitz take root? That title is a confession that the media is pushing the democrat climate change ideology. Climate change is about changing the economy from our current capitalist system to a system that concentrates the power within the government. If the left can nationalize climate through the federal government, then they can take over almost everything that the climate touches. This would open the doors to nationalize almost all industries. The Green New Deal is really a 'Red' new deal that would make all citizens less free. CNN and MSNBC are preparing various propagandistic programs as the UN's Climate summit convenes to spread the 'climate change' hegemony. Then, the degrowth movement is a social movement towards Marxism and rejects the traditional economic reality of growth. Later, the New York Times is pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel, as they support the political opposition that continues to trash Prime Minister Netanyahu. Afterward, Chief Meteorologist Joe Bastardi calls in for an update on Hurricane Dorian.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
