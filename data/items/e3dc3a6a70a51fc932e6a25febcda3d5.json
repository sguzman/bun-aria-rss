  "description": "<p>Between you and Nikki, she's got hair care, broken intimacy of a good massage and Plan B top of mind. Andrew is apartment hunting and using a compass called \"Dick\". Nikki talks about her new nephew and an old bit about wanting to be a baby. They challenge each other to a breathing exercise and learn that Andrew can inhale better and Nikki exhales longer. You Heard It Here First, you don't want the Feds to see your sexts and the lengths some people go through to get an ex to view their IG stories. In Nikki's Reddit Dump they talk about Chapelle reactions, book recommendations, an ultimate roast joke and in the Final Thought, more cringe things some women do to get their ex's attention.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
