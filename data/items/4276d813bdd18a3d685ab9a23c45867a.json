  "description": "In this episode we expand the conversation on spiritual maturity by observing Walter Brueggemann's \"Spirituality of the Psalms.\"  We ask; How do we as a church celebrate so much of God's goodness when the current generation is being so disoriented by the chaos around them?  There is so much to learn from how David spoke to God.  Often, many of us would never be as honest as he was.  Especially after this week of political events, we (the Church)have so much to consider.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nResource: Spirituality of the Psalms (Facets) - Walter Brueggemann https://www.amazon.com/Spirituality-Psalms-Facets-Walter-Brueggemann/dp/0800634500\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nInvest in and support the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Twitter www.twitter.com/thevoxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nFollow Andy on Twitter www.twitter.com/Andy_lara\n\nMike Erre participates as VOX Team Leader at VOX Community, a church expression of the VOX Podcast.
