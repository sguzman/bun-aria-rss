    "media:description": "Learn about the difference between half and full duplex communication. I'll give examples of common protocols such as I2C, SPI, UART, and USB, and talk about if they're full or half duplex. Finally I demonstrate how to infer a tristate buffer in both VHDL and Verilog. I demonstrate how those are important to implement half-duplex communication\n\nPlease help me keep creating great content.
