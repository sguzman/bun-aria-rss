If so, you’ll relate to today’s podcast episode, featuring 34-year old Victoria from the UK. Victoria is a former fitness model who has overcome anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating. She knows she wasn’t truly happy in her modeling days, but she can’t help but look back on photos of her old self with envy. In their eating psychology coaching session, Marc David, founder of the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, works with Victoria on her persistent desire to lose weight and look a certain way. What unfolds is a moving conversation on the negative impact conditioning has on all of us around our appearance and weight, and how to finally move out of self-rejection and into self-acceptance. Regardless of whether you’ve personally ever struggled with an eating disorder, this episode will inspire you to think differently about your own challenges with food and body.
