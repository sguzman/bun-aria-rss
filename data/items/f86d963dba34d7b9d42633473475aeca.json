  "description": "We did it. We MADE it through 2020. It was such a tough year for so many people but we're so thankful to have had the escape of the NFL regular season to keep our spirits up. The heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler, and Gregg Rosenthal preview each game of the final weekend of the regular season starting with the Browns and Steelers (2:04). There is some bad news for the Dolphins taking on the Bills and the Rams are in tough QB situation as well (24:32). Do we have the first triple lock in ATN history (30:17)? We close the show by officially closing the 2020 book.
