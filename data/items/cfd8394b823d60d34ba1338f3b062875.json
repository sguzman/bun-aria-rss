We discuss how and why top companies like Whole Foods and McDonalds are emphasizing employee satisfaction, engagement and well-being at work. We also cover topics such as perceptions of inequality, positive effects of income transparency, ditching performance appraisals, some barriers to productivity and some of the genius tactics of big companies like Zappos (who will pay you to quit you job?!).  We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support\">https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</a></p>\n",
