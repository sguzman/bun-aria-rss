  "description": "<p>A four-year-old girl, whose paintings are compared to Kandinsky, Pollock, and even Picasso, has sold $300,000 dollars worth of paintings. Is she a genius of abstract expressionism, a tiny charlatan, or an exploited child whose parents have sold her out for the glare of the media and the lure of the almighty dollar? This one's a dozy, but hey, nobody gets murdered!</p>\n\n\n<p>Do you know someone who would love TCO? Tweet them and us (@truecrimeobsess) using  #GetObsessed and let us playfully harass them until the check us out!</p>\n\n\n<p>This week's sponsor is <a href=\"https://www.songfinch.com/\">Songfinch</a> and Patrick is OBSESSED! This week's palate cleanser is the song Patrick had Songfinch write for Daisy's 4th birthday. If you love it, tweet them (@Sonfinch) and tell them that you heard it on TCO</p>\n",
