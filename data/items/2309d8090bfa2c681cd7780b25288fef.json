  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, how about a commission to study the origin of the coronavirus? Anthony Fauci has been the leading critic of the idea that the virus was man-made and now the whole world knows that Fauci's group funded this very type of man-made virus research. Fauci has said that these viruses' must be studied because they could eventually come from nature, and so his office funded this research in China, of all places. This begs the question: what did Fauci know and when did he know it? Did Fauci purger himself in congress? Then, President Biden is now proposing the largest budget since World War II. Nearly eight trillion dollars by 2031. Democrats can't rename everything \"infrastructure\" just to get their way and spend more money. All while the indoctrination in our schools continues and Americans remain unemployed. Later, Debra Burlingame calls in to discuss why it's wrong to compare the January 6th riot to the September 11th terrorist attacks on America. Her brother was the pilot of Flight 77 and died in the Pentagon attack. She highlighted how members of Congress might have had a frightening day on Jan. 6, but on 9/11 some 200 people in the World Trade Center towers chose to jump from 80 to 100 floors above the ground rather than be consumed by fire.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
