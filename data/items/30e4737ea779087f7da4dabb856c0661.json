Watch The Full Performance: https://youtu.be/3VB24LYsE60\n\nLyrics\n\nWanderers this morning came by\nWhere did they go, graceful in the morning light?\nTo banner fair, to follow you softly\nIn the cold mountain air\n\nThrough the forest, down to your grave\nWhere the birds wait, and the tall grasses wave\nThey do not know you anymore, more, more, more\n\nDear shadow alive and well\nHow can the body die?\nYou tell me everything\nAnything true\n\nInto town one morning I went\nStaggering through premonitions of my death\nI don't see anybody that dear to me\n\nDear shadow alive and well\nHow can the body die?\nYou tell me everything\nAnything true\n\nJesse\nI don't know what I have done\nI'm turning myself to a demon\nI don't know what I have done\nI'm turning myself to a demon\n\n▶ Official Site: https://fleetfoxes.co\n▶ Facebook: https://facebook.com/FleetFoxes\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/fleetfoxes\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3IEvCpy\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3dAI4s0\n▶ Store: https://fleetfoxes.ffm.to/officialstore\n\n#fleetfoxes #averylonelysolstice #antirecords",
