  "description": "SIGNED ALBUM GIVEAWAYS!! Listen for your chance to win signed albums from Weki Meki and Yu Seung Woo (with more albums coming so so soon!). In this episode, Eric discusses Weki Meki's 'Picky Picky,' EXID's 'Me & You', and WINNER's 'AH YEAH' with some special recommendations thrown in.  We're also joined by the other alleged Nam brother. DNA tests are being run, but perhaps \"brotherly bullying\" is an acceptable measure of brotherhood? Enjoy the show!
