  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Biden administration is the most radical in American history, only we’re only 2 weeks in. President Biden has signed more executive orders than his predecessors and these actions have serious consequences on America's energy industry and industrial base. The Gallup poll has Biden's favorability plummeting beneath 50%, especially when compared to his predecessors at the same points in their respective Administrations. Also, Democrats are really good at lying and using propaganda. They intend to use footage of the siege on the US Capitol to sway public opinion away from President Trump to smear him and the upcoming impeachment trial. Then, Biden press secretary Jen Paski points to the border and family separation yet again. Ignoring the fact that children can't be housed with adults for safety concerns. Psaki also pivoted to figuring out the root causes of migration as a way to dodge questions on Biden’s latest executive order. Later, Trump's attorney Bruce Castor joins the show to explain the President's response to the unconstitutional impeachment charges. Castor indicated that the charges from the Democrats seemed to be prepared in a rushed manner and that the whole idea of trying a former president who is now a private citizen is a disgrace. Castor submits that there was no illegality otherwise Trump would have been arrested as a private citizen and he was not. Afterward, it's appalling that establishment Republicans like Karl Rove praise Liz Cheney for attacking President Trump. But it's RINO's like them and Mitch McConnell that are hurting the Party and America. Finally, Claudia Tenney calls in to discuss her NY congressional race where she is currently leading by 123 votes after one hundred days of recounts, but a judge won’t certify her win.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
