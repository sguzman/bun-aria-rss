The external expectations involuntarily placed on you amount to pressure and loss of self-identity, values and beliefs. On the other hand, the internal expectations you willingly place on yourself can put you into a state of anxiety with doubts, disappointment and indecisiveness. <br /><br />So take a step back from yourself for a moment and consider the number of decisions you passively make everyday while living a less than fulfilling life. <br /><br />If you’re not happy with where you are, how you live, what you do, the money you make (or don’t make) and the success you wish for but never have, it comes down to indecisiveness and lack of action. <br /><br />Mel Robbins is an American attorney, best selling author, motivational speaker, and straight shooter. She’s introduced two of the simplest tools anyone can use starting right now to go from autopilot to decision maker moving towards your dreams.<br /><br />“I hope you have a massive a-ha moment, but it’s not going to mean shit if you don’t take action and do something about it.” This is Mel’s wish for you today. You can trick your brain to do what’s important and beat the habit loops that keep sabotaging you everyday.<br /><br />It’s time for you to stop fighting for your excuses. Stop arguing against the dreams you want and wish for, and start making the decisions for better results day by day, hour by hour, and second, by second.

Those are decisions.” [1:33]<br /><br />“If you’re stuck that’s the problem. The problem is you’re in your head, you’re thinking. That is the universal problem, and it all starts with the knowledge of what to do and then you hesitate and you think about whether or not you feel like doing it.” [10:29]<br /><br />“You have about a five second window in which you can move from idea to action before your brain kicks into full gear and sabotages any change in behavior.” [15:07]<br /><br />“Confidence is the ability to move from thought to action because when you’re a confident person you believe enough in yourself and capabilities that you’re willing to try.” [26:08]<br />“People are making a fundamental mistake. You are withholding the very support, empowerment, and celebration that you need to change, and to do the hard work, and to face the things that you’re scared of, and that’s why you’re not changing.” [33:07]<br /><br />“The thing about jealousy is that it’s just your inspiration that’s blocked. Jealousy is sort of the insecurity that you have that blocks this inspiration.” [46:58]<br /><br />“Most folks know what they dream about and what they want, and yet they spend all of their time and energy arguing against what they want.” [1:13:58]<br /><br />Follow Mel Robbins:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://melrobbins.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://melrobbins.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melrobbins\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/melrobbins</a> <br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/melrobbins/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/melrobbins/</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/</a> <br />YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/melrobbins\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/melrobbins</a>",
