  "title": "#91 - Like Peanut Butter & Cocaine - The Hardheadedness of Michael Nunn",
  "description": "<p>This week, we are buried in a mountain of cocaine, violence, stupidity, arrogance, and just plain crazy. A tough guy turned world champion that could never quite let go of his old friends, neighborhood, and terrible habits. He fights opponents in the ring... and police, girlfriends, wives, family foes, trainers, and even elderly motorists, outside the ring. His tale is a winding road of lunacy, and bad decisions, ending in a prison sentence worthy of a murderer. Right up our alley!!Stuff a kilo down your pants, curl up inside your sister's dryer, and take part in Junior on Junior violence with Michael \"Second To\" Nunn!!Check us out, every Tuesday.
