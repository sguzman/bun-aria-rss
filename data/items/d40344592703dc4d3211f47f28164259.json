  "description": "In a step towards creating intelligent cyborg brains, Cortical Labs in Melbourne have trained lab-grown brain organoids to play a classic 1970s video game. The team explains how the brain cells live in a Matrix-like, simulated world, where all they know is Pong. And there’s more AI news, as the team digs into <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2300657-deepmind-experiment-shows-ai-must-grow-smarter-not-just-bigger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DeepMind’s invention of a ‘search engine’ style supercomputer</a>, one much smaller than its competitors.
