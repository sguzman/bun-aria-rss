  "description": "<p>This week, we’re sharing a special episode from one of Adam's favorite podcasts, Revisionist History. Revisionist History is Malcolm Gladwell’s podcast about things misunderstood and overlooked. This season, Malcolm is obsessed with experiments – natural experiments, scientific experiments, thought experiments. And in this episode, Adam Grant got to help out. Malcolm wanted to talk with a group of college seniors or recent graduates. So Adam invited him to a special seminar at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Adam’s students become guinea pigs as Malcom tries to help them identify and then discuss a very specific type of privilege, a category of privilege that’s often ignored. If you know Malcolm Gladwell, he does sometimes seem to have it out for Ivy League schools like Penn. But this episode is not what you might expect: Malcolm winds up pointing the finger of blame quite firmly in his own direction, too. <br>\n<br>\nYou can hear more from Revisionist History at <br>\n<a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/workliferevisionist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.chtbl.com/workliferevisionist</a></p>",
