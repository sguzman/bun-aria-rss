These updated samples indicate that GOLD SOUTHFIELD has resumed operations.\nThe research states \"The identification of multiple samples containing different modifications and the lack of an official new version indicate that REvil is under active development.\" Researchers identified two samples, one in October of 2021, and the other in March of 2022.
