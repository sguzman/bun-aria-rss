  "title": "111 - Demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (from Annabelle, the Conjuring, and more)",
  "description": "<p>The \"true\" horror stories of Ed and Lorraine Warren have turned into more than a billion dollars worth of scares at the box office between The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2, Annabelle, and Annabelle: Creation. Today, we take a look at the real tales behind the Hollywood creations and also dig into the lives of the \"demonologists\" who swore all of these hauntings have been all too real. Happy Halloween, Timesuckers! Hope you enjoy today's collection of haunted dolls, cemetery apparitions, demons, lost spirits, and cursed ground, today on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Steven Watson's<strong> Hurricane Michael Go Fund Me! </strong><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/69exxeo?pc_code=fb_co_postupdate_a&rcid=a707a4f2e8cb473c948a7c8b8368aed1\"><strong><em>https://www.gofundme.com/69exxeo?pc_code=fb_co_postupdate_a&rcid=a707a4f2e8cb473c948a7c8b8368aed1</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by the <strong>KINGPINS </strong>podcast on Parcast!
