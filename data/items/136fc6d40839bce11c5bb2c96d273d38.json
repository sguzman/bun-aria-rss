  "description": "This week on the podcast ET takes over the discussion and talks about living for other people. People doing things based on what they think someone else will think or how they will feel. CJ elaborates on the dangers of living with this mindset and how you can start to depend on other people to cosign for you and everything you do. They go on to talk about how this also creates a fixed mindset.
