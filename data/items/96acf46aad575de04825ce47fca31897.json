  "description": "The first episode of the Beltway Black Box series was a timely conversation on whether zero trust thinking represents a breakthrough in cyber-security, the hidden risks associated with it and how it is likely to impact companies and the government. Participating were an exceptional group of experts including: \n\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, Co-Founder of CrowdStrike and Executive Chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator; \n\nChase Cunningham, Chief Strategy Officer at Ericom Software;\n\nJuliette Kayyem, Chair of the Homeland Security and Security and Global Health Projects at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government;\n\nand David Sanger, Author of The Perfect Weapon and White House and National Security correspondent at the New York Times.\n\n\nThe conversation covers the genesis of ZTA adoption following cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure and the Biden Administration and congressional response to this change in security paradigm. The experts define ZTA in practical terms, frankly assess implementation hurdles in the private sector - including early adopter vs. laggard industries - and give actionable advice for private business and policy makers.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
