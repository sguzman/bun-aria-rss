  "description": "<p>Stress can be ruthless. It’s a silent assassin that can break down your brain, screw up your internal organs, and pack fat onto your body. But…</p> <p>That’s only one face of stress.</p> <p>Stress can also be invigorating. It’s capable of making you more physically fit, biologically stronger, and literally keep your brain decades younger.

There really isn’t anything more valuable to create a great body, build emotional fitness, and shape a great life overall, than utilizing the gift of stress.</p> <p>It may even sound like an oxymoron, “the gift of stress”, but what you learn from legendary health expert and bestselling author Ori Hofmekler today will help you understand exactly what I mean. If you’re going to live a long, fruitful life, you’ve got to make stress your ally.
