  "description": "<p>A switched quantum channel with indefinite causal order is studied for the\nfundamental metrological task of phase estimation on a qubit unitary operator\naffected by quantum thermal noise. Specific capabilities are reported in the\nswitched channel with indefinite order, not accessible with conventional\nestimation approaches with definite order. Phase estimation can be performed by\nmeasuring the control qubit alone, although it does not actively interact with\nthe unitary process -- only the probe qubit doing so. Also, phase estimation\nbecomes possible with a fully depolarized input probe or with an input probe\naligned with the rotation axis of the unitary, while this is never possible\nwith conventional approaches. The present study extends to thermal noise,\ninvestigations previously carried out with the more symmetric and isotropic\nqubit depolarizing noise, and it contributes to the timely exploration of\nproperties of quantum channels with indefinite causal order relevant to quantum\nsignal and information processing.\n</p>",
