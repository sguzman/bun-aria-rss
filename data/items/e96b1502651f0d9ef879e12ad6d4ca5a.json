Because the mantra in U.S. was that Libyans are owning this. Well Libyans weren't equipped to own this because of Qaddafi's rule. Or perhaps less regional interference you know could have forestalled a collapse,\" says Wehrey. \"But there again there's the question of U.S. power. How much authority do we have over these allies that are acting in contravention of our interests?\"\n\nFrederic Wehrey is a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He specializes in post-conflict transitions, armed groups, and identity politics, with a focus on Libya, North Africa, and the Gulf.\n\n\"The U.N. is wrestling with the question of how do you do the post conflict reconstruction when you don't have a stabilization force on the ground [in Libya]. That was a missing component that should have been part of the mix.  So it's this question where you don't want a complete Iraq type scenario- where you have this occupation and militarization and heavy handed- but then the over-learning that lesson where you've got this complete vacuum is going too far in the other direction.\"",
