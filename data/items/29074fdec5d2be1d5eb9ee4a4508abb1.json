And then he did it again at PyeongChang 2018 in below freezing conditions. From escaping avalanches in Iceland to ending up thousands of dollars in debt, the Tongan took on every problem with a smile. His sporting career started in taekwondo, then he moved to cross country skiing, and now he’s hoping to become a kayaker.
