  "description": "<p>You have a nephew who has a history of undressing, touching genitals, and dry humping smaller, weaker humans than himself. These humans either do not consent or are unable to consent. It's well known in your family that he can't be left alone with children. There have been numerous incidents with different witnesses and victims spread out over the years.</p>\n<p>Today this nephew is 20 years old and expecting a baby with his live-in girlfriend. You were horrified and began asking if this girlfriend knew about his history. No one seems to know if she's aware, but are strongly agreed that it's not any of your places to tell her.</p>\n<p>But you fear that if you don't tell her, no one will.
