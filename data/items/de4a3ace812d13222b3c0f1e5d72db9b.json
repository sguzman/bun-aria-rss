  "title": "Past Gas #144: Danica Patrick: Better Than Ricciardo?",
  "description": "Danica Patrick was one tough cookie, a spitfire, and all those other lightly patronizing names you might call a strong woman in a male-dominated sport. She’s also a self-made mogul, icon, and champion… all achieved before the age of 40. How did she get her start? How many records did she actually break? And how did she become one of the most notorious figures in racing, despite never winning a championship?\nMore about Show:\n\n\n﻿Follow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey.  \n\n\n\nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes.  \n\n\n\nFollow Joe on IG and Twitter @joegweber.\n\n\nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or using this link: http://bit.ly/PastGas.\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
