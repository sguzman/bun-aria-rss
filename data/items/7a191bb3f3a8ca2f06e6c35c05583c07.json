  "description": "Last year, venture capital investment in China surpassed North American totals for the first time in history, bringing Chinese business models to a stage and scale that \"the entire world needs to pay attention to\" in the eyes of Goldman Sachs Research's Piyush Mubayi. Corporate venture capital plays a major role: the country's big tech companies are active investors domestically, and now they're also setting sights on new markets. In this episode, Mubayi joins Jake Siewert to discuss developments in China's corporate venture capital space, as well as trends he's seeing in the broader tech sector. \n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on October 24, 2018.\n\n\nThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
