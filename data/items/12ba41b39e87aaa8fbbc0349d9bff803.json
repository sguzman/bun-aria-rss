  "description": "<p>Iconic artist, designer, and <em>New York Magazine</em> cofounder, <a href=\"http://www.miltonglaser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Glaser's</a> (http://www.miltonglaser.com/) work has been seen everywhere from the halls of global industry to, social movements to local pubs, the Museum of Modern Art and the Georges Pompidou Center. He was the visionary behind the legendary I ♥ NY logo, designed and given for free as an offering to the city he loved when it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in the 70s. The generation-defining, rainbow-haired Bob Dylan poster? Glaser, too. And, thousands of other works that have moved millions of people and defined moments, industries, and generations. Over our 8-year history, Glaser has become the single most-referenced and, arguably, most revered guest. His work changed us, and so did our time with him.</p><p>Milton Glaser passed away on Friday, June 26th at the age of 91. On his birthday. So, we wanted to share this “Best Of” conversation from our 2013 archives in honor of his life and impact, and as a powerful prompt to nurture the creative impulse that exists in all of us. To make meaning. To play. To live with purpose and joy.</p><p>You can find Milton Glaser at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.miltonglaser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.miltonglaser.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miltonglaserinc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/miltonglaserinc/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/geneenrothttps://www.facebook.com/MiltonGlaserInc/h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> : https://www.facebook.com/geneenrothttps://www.facebook.com/MiltonGlaserInc/h</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
