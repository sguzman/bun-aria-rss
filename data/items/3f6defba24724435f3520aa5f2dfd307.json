  "description": "James Bond is an iconic character because of his charm, spy skills, style and… his cars. Bond has driven his share of Subarus and Toyotas. But the ultimate Bond car, the go-to for any British spy worth his salt is the Aston Martin. What started this partnership? How did the Bond franchise affect the business dealings of Aston Martin? And how did Aston Martin affect the Bond Franchise? And why was Roger Moore the only Bond to never drive an Aston Martin?
