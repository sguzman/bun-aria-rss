  "description": "First published in 1992 before the creation of the euro, Paul De Grauwe’s Economics of Monetary Union (Oxford University Press, 2020) has become a standard text for undergraduates seeking to understand this remarkable but “fragile” project.\nUpdated every two years and now in its 13th edition, the book can hardly keep up with economic and policy developments in the 19-nation Euro Area.\nBut De Grauwe, who is still teaching at the London School of Economics after retiring from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, can always be relied upon to plug the gaps with policy ideas. In the latest of these, he made the case for the European Central Bank to monetize governments’ pandemic-related deficits.\nPaul De Grauwe is the John Paulson Chair in European Political Economy at the LSE’s European Institute.\nTim G. Jones is an economic and political-risk analyst at Medley Global Advisors.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
