  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, The history of the 14th Amendment isn’t in dispute – it was created to protect freed slaves, not illegal immigrants. Birthright citizenship didn’t start until the 1960s under the New Deal bureaucracy, so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute to change it? The left changes the constitution all the time by hook or crook, but now tell us we need an amendment to end something that’s not even in the Constitution. Also, Democrats have nominated anti-American candidates pushing socialism and unconstitutional progressive policies. We are truly battling a bleak force that does not share our values. The left doesn’t want a united nation; they want centralized power while the race-baiting media divides us and keep us from having civil debates. Later, Mark speaks with Patrick Morrisey, Attorney General of West Virginia, about his run for Senate against Joe Manchin. Finally, Mark talks to Representative Lee Zeldin about his re-election campaign for New York’s 1st district.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
