These medications frequently come with unintended side effects, however. The good news is the right foods and nutrients can dramatically lower blood pressure without the high costs and side effects of medications.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In today’s episode of my series I’m calling <em>Health Bites</em>, I discuss the driving forces of hypertension and the Functional Medicine approach to treating it.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by ButcherBox and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>ButcherBox makes it easy to get humanely raised meat and wild-caught, sustainable seafood by delivering it right to your doorstep.
