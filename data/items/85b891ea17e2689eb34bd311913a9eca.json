While we once thought that declining brain function was a given as you get older, we now know that our brains have the ability to change structure and function all throughout our lives. Our diets and quality of sleep are crucial for a well-functioning brain but so is our ability to harness focus and attention.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode Dr. Hyman speaks to Dr. Andrew Huberman about enhancing neuroplasticity to support learning, memory, alertness, and attention. He also speaks with Jim Kwik about the science of learning how to learn.</p><br><p>Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and tenured Professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He has made numerous important contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function, and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills, and cognitive functioning. Dr. Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, which is given to the scientist making the largest discoveries in the study of vision. His lab’s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine has been published in top journals including <em>Nature, Science</em>, and <em>Cell</em> and has been featured in <em>TIME</em>, BBC,<em> Scientific American, Discover</em>, and other top media outlets.</p><br><p>Jim Kwik is the founder of Kwik Learning and a widely recognized world expert in speed-reading, memory improvement, brain performance, and accelerated learning. For over two decades he has served as the brain coach to many of the world’s leading C-suite executives and celebrities. After a childhood brain injury left him learning-challenged, Jim created strategies to dramatically enhance his mental performance. He has since dedicated his life to helping others unleash their true brainpower to learn faster and perform smarter. His recent book, <em>Limitless</em>, provides the keys to accelerated learning and endless potential.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
