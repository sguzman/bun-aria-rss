  "title": "How Millennial & Gen Z Christians Can Live the Way We're Called To | Sadie Rob Huff & David Platt",
  "description": "Pastor and author David Platt joins Sadie to show us how we can be the light of the world during a dark time. They discuss the best conversation you could ever possibly have, how to live for eternity when everyone is so focused on the here and now, and how to make sure we're not living a self-centered Christianity. David also shares the frightening experience of being successful in the American church when he wasn't truly walking with God. We will always find ourselves stagnating until we commit to serve the world and share, show, and teach the Word. Be the light to someone this week, friends!
