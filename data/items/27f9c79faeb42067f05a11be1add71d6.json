Anthony thinks having a dog is harder than children, because children don't want to kill each other on the street. Erica reads a fan email in her corner and the guys reflect on Lady Gaga's dog walker being shot, a young girl being killed during an exorcism, and a killer rooster. We have a new favorite spanish rapper, everybody.&nbsp;</p>",
