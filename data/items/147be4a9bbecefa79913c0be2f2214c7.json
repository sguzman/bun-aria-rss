  "description": "<p>This week Mandii and Weezy are joined by Ayesha Faines, founder of Women Love Power, member of The Grapevine panel and host of Inside the Pink Podcast. The working title of this episode was READ ME as we all felt triggered to tell our actual feelings about casual sex, online dating and the hook up culture as we see it today. Being women who preach sexual liberation, are we truly in control of the emotionless sex we are having? Is casual sex benefiting women at all? How? All three women discuss how the hook up culture came about and what we may need to do to take back our sexual pussy power!
