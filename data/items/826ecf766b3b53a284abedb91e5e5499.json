After an entire year without uttering a single word, he ended it on Australian national television <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgR_zz8Kmbs\" target=\"_blank\">with an interview</a> that inspired millions to make more conscious and compassionate lifestyle choices and cemented him as a charismatic new force in the fight for the ethical treatment of animals.</p><p>Ranked #3 among the “Top 25 Most Influential Vegans” by Plant Based News, James has gone on to cycle&nbsp;5000kms across Australia to prove that vegans&nbsp;can be fit & healthy. He got tattooed for 25 hours&nbsp;straight&nbsp;to raise $20,000 for charity.&nbsp;He's been featured&nbsp;in&nbsp;a multitude of prominent mainstream media outlets; given&nbsp;free speeches at countless schools, universities, and&nbsp;conferences; and attended local activism events, slaughterhouse vigils, and&nbsp;street outreach events all across the world. He transparently shares his life&nbsp;and campaigns online&nbsp;to a&nbsp;massive tribe of global&nbsp;followers. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcKFPLxaWvKMwbjd5GjhzKg\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube,</a> his speeches have reached tens of millions&nbsp;of people. And his most popular speech has been viewed over 12 million views.</p><p>Enthusiastic, accessible and highly skilled behind a podium, James&nbsp;is inspiring a new generation to change how we eat and live in communion with the animals that share this home we call Earth.</p><br><p>But there's so much more to this young man's life than meets the eye. At 17, James was diagnosed with leukemia and told he only had 6 weeks to live. He beat the cancer only to slide into a life of drugs and alcohol punctuated by a profound eating disorder. Then a chance encounter with an Indian man would forever change the trajectory of James' life.</p><p>Today I'm proud to help this passionate defender of the voiceless share his powerful story.</p><p>But first, a caveat. I'm not unaware that a contingent of you shut down when the subject turns to animal welfare. I know, because I used to be that person. I didn’t start out inherently compassionate about these issues. My shift to a plant-based lifestyle was initially motivated purely for personal health reasons. In fact it was years before I became sensitive to the horrific and inexcusable manner in which we treat our animal friends. But it's an issue I now care deeply about. And it's an issue we simply can no longer ignore or tolerate.</p><p>Ghandi once famously said, “The&nbsp;greatness of a nation can be judged by&nbsp;the&nbsp;way&nbsp;its animals&nbsp;are&nbsp;treated.”</p><p>History will not look fondly upon our track record. And I, for one, want to be on the right side of history.</p><p>So for those who think this episode just isn't for you, I urge you to set aside any judgment, projection or pre-conceived ideas you may have about James or this subject matter. Trust me. And open your heart. Because to move forward, we&nbsp;cannot continue to turn a blind eye.</p><p>I really dig this conversation. I hope you do too. More importantly, I hope it inspires you to take positive action for change — both personal and global.</p><p>To view our conversation on YouTube, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/jamesaspey423\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/jamesaspey423</a>.
