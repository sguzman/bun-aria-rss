  "description": "<div>In this episode of the Sound of Economics, Paola Subacchi, Professor of international economics and chair of the advisory board of the Global Policy Institute at Queen Mary University of London, and Bruegel senior scholars Alicia García-Herrero and Michael Leigh join Giuseppe Porcaro for an age old discussion but with a twist. <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>They try to understand the geopolitical role of money, in other words, currencies and capital flows.
