    "media:description": "More humiliating fraudulent creationists! This is getting fun, no? On the chopping block today is Günter Bechly. I hadn't heard of this guy until he foolishly decided to run his mouth about me in three separate damage control pieces for creationist propaganda website \"Evolution News\". Those of you who know me well are aware that I don't take kindly to people lying about me on the internet, so I figured I should respond and humiliate this clown. Let's go through some background information on Bechly, his false identity and what it represents for the DI, and then tear through his pathetic hit pieces so that they blow up in his face, shall we?\n\nExposing Casey Luskin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRxq1Vrf_Js\nExposing Stephen Meyer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akv0TZI985U\nExposing Michael Behe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVQGQz-0Xeo\n\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveDebunk\n\nEMAIL► ProfessorDaveExplains@gmail.com\nPATREON► http://patreon.com/ProfessorDaveExplains\n\nCheck out \"Is This Wi-Fi Organic?\", my book on disarming pseudoscience!\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2HtNpVH\nBookshop: https://bit.ly/39cKADM\nBarnes and Noble: https://bit.ly/3pUjmrn\nBook Depository: http://bit.ly/3aOVDlT",
