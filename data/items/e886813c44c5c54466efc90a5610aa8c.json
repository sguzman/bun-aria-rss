  "description": "This was my globalFEST surprise. Imagine a New Orleans street band playing Indian Bollywood tunes with a go-go beat — you can't? Then just listen, because your day is about to get better. Red Baraat is the only bhangra brass band in North America. Hailing from New York City and formed in 2008, the group uses their improvisational sound to blend the dhol, a double-sided, barrel-shaped North Indian drum, with brass funk. It's a crazy blast of fun.",
