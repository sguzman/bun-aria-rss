Both had been stabbed several times and Nicole's throat had been cut so severally that she was nearly decapitated.

What has remained a mystery is the actions and movements of persons in the last few hours of June 12. Today we revisit this crime to go over the timeline of that day's events and present the evidence that sometimes is lost in the muck of drama and glamour. Did the famous football star kill his former wife and young Ron Goldman, we all know he was acquitted. We will discuss the evidence that points towards OJ's guilt and explore a few other suspects that you may not have heard of. </p>\n<p>Beer of the week - Pliny the Elder by Russian River Brewing Company \nGarage Grade - 4 of 5 bottle caps </p>\n<p>Cheers, \nNic & The Captain</p><p><a href=\"https://truecrimegarage.com/home\">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>\n",
