  "title": "274 - The Burden of Purity Culture - with Bridget Eileen Rivera & Tyler Chernesky",
  "description": "Today we sit down (virtually, from all over the country) with old friend of the Pod Tyler Chernesky and new friend Bridget Eileen Rivera, for a conversation on Purity Culture, the Church and being a Gay Christian. Tyler is a pastor of City Church OTR in downtown Cincinnati, a church that strives to be a safe place to be honest and feel supported. Bridget Eileen is an author, speaker and advocate, who speaks and writes on issues of faith, sexuality, and justice. Bridget and Tyler both share their stories of growing up in purity culture. What is a folk devil and what role does it play in society? How has Bridget’s study of criminology linked to her experience in Purity Culture? How has the conversation on sexuality consumed and pushed aside other topics in the church? This was a brilliant and heartfelt conversation.\n\nBridget Eileen Rivera can be found at: https://bridgeteileenrivera.com/ and on Twitter @TravelingNun\n\nTyler Chernesky can be found at: https://www.tylerchernesky.com/ and on Twitter @tylerchernesky\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
