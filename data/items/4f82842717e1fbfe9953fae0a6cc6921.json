  "description": "<p>     It all begins with a big THANK YOU to all our fans for voting Talking Sopranos the best podcast in Television and Film at the Webbys!</p><p>     Then Michael and Steve take on one of the best episodes of the entire Sopranos series. They also welcome guests Leslie Rae Bega (Valentina La Paz) and Joe Lisi (Dick Barone). Leslie is a fascinating woman who not only is an incredible actress, but an extremely successful real estate agent and accomplished chef. She tells us the story of her life, her career and how she ended up on the Sopranos. She also talks about how she got the role of Valentina, and what it took for her to give that character real personality. When Leslie was hired she knew there would be some nudity involved but things did get a bit more graphic then she expected. Over all it was an amazing experience and she has many fantastic stories to tell. </p><p>     After that Michael and Steve welcome Joe Lisi to the podcast. Joe tells us how he went from real NYPD captain to TV and film actor. He said he made more money in one day playing a police captain on TV than he did in a whole week as a real captain. He also tells us the real story of a celeb who went to buy coke, signed autographs for the undercover cops and ended up in cuffs. Joe is the real deal.  </p><p>     Finally Michael and Steve break down S5 – Ep8 “Marco Polo”. This is one that Michael wrote so he has lots of really interesting inside info. He tells great stories about the script, the production and what went on behind the scenes. It’s another fantastic episode of Talking Sopranos!
