    "media:description": "John Keely was the founder of the Keely Motor Company. He announced that he had discovered a new physical force, one that, if harnessed, would produce unheard-of power. He claimed to be able to produce from a quart of water enough fuel to move a 30-car train from Philadelphia to New York City.\n\nScientists and engineers scoffed at his unverified claims. After his death, an investigation was carried out, and examination of his apparatus - a supposed perpetual motion machine - showed that, rather than a new force, tubes of compressed air or a form of hydraulic power activated the machinery.\n\nIn today's video we see if there are any lessons investors can learn from the story of John Ernst Worrell Keely.\n\nBook Link: Voodoo Science by Robert Park: https://amzn.to/3BrKTsc\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nPatreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\n\nVisit our website: www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join",
