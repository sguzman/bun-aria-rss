  "description": "<p>This is the first episode of our Getting Unstuck Series. This episode, featuring social worker and NYT bestselling author Nedra Tawwab has some incredibly practical advice for various forms of stuckness, and it basically comes down to one word: boundaries. Nedra is a social worker and the New York Times bestselling author of <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/647316/set-boundaries-find-peace-by-nedra-glover-tawwab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Set Boundaries, Find Peace</em></a>, which became so popular this past year that she has now followed up with an accompanying <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-set-boundaries-workbook-practical-exercises-for-understanding-your-needs-and-setting-healthy-limits/9780593421482\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">workbook</a>. In the book, Nedra lays out a whole taxonomy of boundaries: their levels, their types, and their internal and external manifestations. In this episode, she explains it all, as well as how to summon the bravery to set and maintain boundaries even when it’s difficult and how to respect other people’s boundaries. Over the course of the conversation, she makes the convincing argument that if we can learn to see our world through the lens of boundaries, we can find some of the peace that may be eluding us. In other words, we can get unstuck.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Content Warning: This episode includes brief references to sensitive topics such as sexuality, abuse, and neglect, all in the service of exploring the myriad ways in which learning to set boundaries can help us find peace and get unstuck.</em></p><p><br></p><p>This episode is the first in the Getting Unstuck Series on the podcast.
