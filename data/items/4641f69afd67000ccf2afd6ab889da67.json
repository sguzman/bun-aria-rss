  "title": "Ep. 433 - Billionaires And Millionaires Gather For A Debate",
  "description": "Another embarrassing Democratic debate last night. We'll discuss the lowlights. Also, isn't it interesting that the party of progress and inclusion put on a debate featuring two billionaires, three millionaires, three people over 70, only one person under 50, and no minorities? And, speaking of embarrassing, the Democrats blocked a bill yesterday that would have required abortion clinics to provide basic medical care to infants born alive after abortion.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
