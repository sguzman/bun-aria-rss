  "description": "Here are two things I believe. First, the way we treat the animals we kill for food is shameful. Second, only a tiny percentage of the population will go vegetarian or vegan and stay that way, at least until lab-grown meat gets a lot better.\n\nThe middle ground is treating the animals we kill for food more humanely. Take fish. In the United States, most of the fish we eat die by slowly suffocating to death on the deck of a boat, struggling for air. That’s horrendously cruel — and it makes for acidic, rubbery, smelly food.\n\nThere’s a better way. And in this episode of Dylan Matthews’s Future Perfect, he explores it. This podcast is also a powerful example of living your deepest values. Dylan is a vegetarian because he cares about animal suffering, but because reducing suffering is what he cares about most, he’s willing to go to a place vegetarianism alone could never have taken him. I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Future Perfect:\n\nApple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\n\n\n\nNotes from our sponsors:LEGO: In today's show you heard advertising content from The LEGO Store.
