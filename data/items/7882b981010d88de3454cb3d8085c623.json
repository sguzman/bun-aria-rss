  "description": "<p>We construct an existentially undecidable complete discretely valued field of\nmixed characteristic with existentially decidable residue field and decidable\nalgebraic part, answering a question by Anscombe-Fehm in a strong way. Along\nthe way, we construct an existentially decidable field of positive\ncharacteristic with an existentially undecidable finite extension, modifying a\nconstruction due to Kesavan Thanagopal.\n</p>",
