  "description": "<p>When we need to make some serious changes to our personal finances, the small tweaks and changes aren’t going to cut it. Instead, we need to take a look at some of the bigger money moves that will allow us to drastically save and invest more of our money. And often, this isn’t an instinctual response. For many reasons we tend to immediately focus on and get bogged down with the little stuff- it’s the small money moves that often get much of the attention. For example how often do we hear about cutting out a latte or the proverbial avocado toast. But while it is certainly easier to forego a to-go coffee than to look at the bigger money levers in our life, those changes are also going to have a far smaller impact. It’s time to focus on the big stuff!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Holmberg Bound by Four Peaks Brewing- thanks to Jacob for donating these beers to the show!
