  "title": "Under Scrutiny:  America’s Somali Community",
  "description": "The state of Minnesota is home to America’s largest Somali community.  This week, Owen Bennett Jones and the Newshour Extra team are there for a special edition of the programme.  In front of a live audience, Owen and his guests will examine the impact of President Trump’s executive order to exclude immigrants from majority-muslim countries including Somalia.  Mr Trump argues that current immigration laws leave America vulnerable to domestic terror attacks by nationals from those ‘high risk’ countries.  So what does this mean for the more than 150,000 Somalis who now live in the United States, many of whom are refugees from conflict in their home country?  And what does the future hold for a migrant community President Trump has called a ‘disaster’ for Minnesota.\n\nPhoto: Members of the Somali community campaigning in Minnesota State elections, Nov 2016.
