  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, one person from one Congressional district, in one state, who’s never stood in any nation-wide election has taken complete iron-fisted control of the House, through a small majority and is bringing the United States Senate to its knees through blackmail. Nancy Pelosi is tyrannical and fascistic and it's troubling that our Senate's leadership isn't taking swifter action to uphold their oath to defend our Constitution. Pelosi, who is the closest thing to a dictator we have in America, continues to obstruct the Senate by delaying the President's Senate trial. There is literally nothing in our Constitution or our history that supports such a delay by the House or the Speaker. Our framers would never have granted illimitable power to any role in our Constitutional system. The Senate must check the rogue House of Representatives before dangerous precedents are set. Then, upon reflection of Raoul Berger's published scholarship on impeachment, it's clear that impeachment is the remedy for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors and these terms were hotly debated at the Constitutional Convention. Pelosi is a tyrant of the kind the founders sought to protect us from. Also, Christianity Today magazine is under fire for buckling to the cowardly left and calling for President Trump's impeachment. Later, Bernie Sanders called Prime Minister Netanyahu a racist. Despite claiming to proudly be Jewish but has only defended the religion-rejecting Marxist ideology throughout his career. Bernie Sanders ignores what Tyrants like Putin, Xi, Castro, Maduro or any other racists, he never mentions it. Finally, Oliver North calls in to discuss his new book, The Rifleman.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Rifleman-Oliver-North/dp/1642933147/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0/135-3001852-3711711?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1642933147&pd_rd_r=1884d61a-5fce-4a46-aa36-7e5007d9dc70&pd_rd_w=jptQz&pd_rd_wg=fRQuP&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=47ZS0VKEBKH51X4Y6P2H&psc=1&refRID=47ZS0VKEBKH51X4Y6P2H\nLearn more about your ad choices.
