  "description": "A decade has passed since the Arab Spring of 2011, during which an uprising in Egypt ended three decades of rule by Hosni Mubarak without realizing a new political order free from the dictates of the country’s military. In a new book, Bread and Freedom: Egypt’s Revolutionary Situation (Stanford University Press, 2021) Mona El Ghobashy treats the uprising as a political and social phenomenon deserving of inquiry regardless of whether it succeeded in achieving its goals or not. She joins this episode of New Books in Interpretive Political and Social Science to discuss why she resurrected the concept of a “revolutionary situation” and how it helped her to explicate what happens when state authority is severely assaulted and damaged, but does not collapse, as in Egypt.\nBread and Freedom is with Anastasia Shesterinina’s (Mobilizing in Uncertainty: Collective Identities and War in Abkhazia, Cornell UP, 2021) joint winner of the 2022 Charles Taylor Book Award, awarded annually by the Interpretive Methodologies and Methods group of the American Political Science Association for the best book in political science that employs or develops interpretive methodologies and methods; and, APSA’s Middle East and North Africa Politics Section’s Best Book Award for 2022.\nNick Cheesman is associate professor in the Department of Political and Social Change, Australian National University and in Fall 2022 a fellow at the Baldy Center for Law and Social Policy, University at Buffalo. He is a committee member of the Interpretive Methodologies and Methods group of the American Political Science Association and co-convenes the Interpretation, Method, Critique network at the ANU.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
