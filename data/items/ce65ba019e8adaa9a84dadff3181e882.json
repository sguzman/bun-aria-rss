  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss The Cars with Kevin Madden.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Kevin Madden. Kevin is the executive vice president of Arnold Ventures. He’s a Republican strategist and former advisor to President George W. Bush, Governor Mitt Romney, and Republican House leaders John Boehner and Tom DeLay. Kevin is on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kevinmaddendc\">@KevinMaddenDC</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Kevin’s Music Pick</span>: The Cars</strong></p>\n<p>The team at Political Beats mourns the death of Ric Ocasek by doing what we do best: obsessively listening to and breaking down his career in The Cars. This is a nice, tight compact show, like the best of their hits. In fact, we dove so deep into their discography that you might think we’re foolish. All three of us are really big fans of the debut album and Ben Orr’s vocals. And all of us choose a different second-favorite album alongside the consensus number one, THE CARS, one of the best debut albums of all time. Why don’t we know Ric’s real age? Why did “You Might Think” win the first MTV Video Music Award, beating out “Thriller”? How did Elliot Easton score a solo album deal in the 1980s? Answers to those questions and much more on this week’s tribute to Ric Ocasek and The Cars.<strong> </strong></p>\n",
