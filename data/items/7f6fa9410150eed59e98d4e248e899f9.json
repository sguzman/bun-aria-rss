  "description": "I just got back from the Metaverse Expo 2022 in Las Vegas and it was an amazing conference. I start today’s episode with a recap of the experience… and why the metaverse may be the largest trend on the planet. I highlight the trillions of dollars flowing into the space… why the “permissionless” worlds will be the winners of this trend… and why the metaverse will go mainstream within six months. I also explain why NFTs (an important component of the metaverse) will be the next trillion-dollar trend. By the way, stay tuned… I’ll be releasing some exclusive content from the Metaverse Expo very soon.
