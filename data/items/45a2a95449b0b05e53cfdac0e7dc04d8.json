  "description": "<p>I've told a lot of you guys that when my best friend and I started our business, we were so broke we had to live in the back of our store and sleep on an old mattress from Goodwill. In this episode, I go into detail about actually sleeping on that mattress, how embarrassing it was, but what it taught me: Successful people know when they shouldn't take themselves too seriously. If you learn to laugh at yourself, you'll laugh all the way to the bank.</p>",
