  "description": "In Episode 51 I had the absolute privilege of sitting down with European Pop sensation Ben Cristovao or \"Benny Cristo\" as he goes by.\n\nOn surface level Ben is a man with an extreme amount of raw talent and a strong work ethic and steel like determination that allows him to fulfil his potential. But despite his impressive resume of achievements, what left a lasting impression on me from this conversation, is Ben's thought processes and overall state of consciousness. He has an incredible story and where many would be sidetracked by the notoriety of the pop music industry, Ben is using his influence to leave a positive mark on the world.\n\nIN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:\n\nWhere Ben grew up in Europe and his blood lines\n\nWhat his diet was like as a kid\n\nHow he got into singing\n\nHis achievements as a music artist and athlete\n\nThe moment he decided to change what was on his plate\n\nTypical foods he eats\n\nSocial media and how he uses it to spark conversations and promote positive change amongst his community\n\nand much much more\n\n\nREVIEW/SHARE:\nIf you enjoyed the episode and have a spare 1-2 minutes please leave a review on iTunes so the Plant Proof podcast ranks higher and becomes more discoverable for other listeners.
