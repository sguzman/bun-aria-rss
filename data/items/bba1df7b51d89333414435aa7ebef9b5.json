  "title": "#352: Elon Wilson & Banaz Mahmod | \"Black and Missing\" - Part 4",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, we discuss a different kind of “missing person”, those who are missing from the lives of their families due to police misconduct, and wrongful arrests. Such was the case for Elon Wilson, Natalie’s son, a former D.C. firefighter who spent almost two years in prison after a “pretextual” traffic stop, by then Officer Jonathan A. Freitag. Elon was released after it was discovered that Freitag lied about what happened and had a history of racially motivated stops.&nbsp;Laura also talks about a case that came across her desk where law enforcement had many intervention opportunities. Banaz Mahmod, a 20-year-old woman in South London went to police several times.</p><p>Banaz asked the police for help. She told them she was&nbsp;</p><p>‘going to be the victim of an “honor killing”. She even gave them the names of the men who would kill her - orchestrated by her own father and uncle. When Banaz went missing there were already so many red flags that police should have realized the danger she was in. You won’t believe the end of this story.&nbsp;</p><p>#dontcallithonorkilling</p><p>#hernamewasBanazMahmod</p><p>#hisnameisElonWilson</p><p>#blackandmissing</p><p>#neverstopsearching</p><p>#soledado'brien</p><p>#derricawilson</p><p>#nathaliewilson</p><p>#hbodocumentaries</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><p>BOLL & BRANCH SHEETS&nbsp;-</p><p>The Signature Hemmed Sheets from Boll & Branch are a best-seller for a reason.
