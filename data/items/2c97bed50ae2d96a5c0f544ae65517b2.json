  "description": "<p>Estimation of the number of signals in the presence of noise is an important\nproblem in several areas of statistical signal processing. There are a number\nof modern works on the design of an optimal solution to this problem in terms\nof some criteria. Each criterion generates a model order selection (MOS)\nalgorithm. However, the minimum error probability criterion has not received\nsignificant attention, although errors in the estimation of the number of\nsignals might directly affect the performance of the signal processing system\nas a whole. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the design of MOS\nalgorithms partially based on the minimum error probability criterion. Also, we\npay a lot of attention to the performance and consistency analysis of the MOS\nalgorithms. In this study, an abridged error probability is used as a universal\nperformance measure of the MOS algorithms. We propose a theoretical framework\nthat makes it possible to provide a parametric consistency analysis and to\nobtain closed-form expressions for the abridged error probabilities of a wide\nrange of MOS algorithms. As an example, we applied this framework to the\nconsistency and performance analysis of several MOS algorithms. Using the\nobtained results, we provide a parametric optimization of the presented MOS\nalgorithms. Finally, we examinate a quasilikelihood (QL) approach to the design\nand analysis of the MOS algorithms. The proposed theoretical framework is used\nto obtain the abridged error probabilities as functions of the unknown signal\nparameter. These functions, in turn, allow us to find the scope of the QL\napproach.\n</p>",
