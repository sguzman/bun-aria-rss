  "description": "<p>The 85 South Show bossed up and took the show to Los Angeles to record an all-new comedy special from The Hollywood Palladium but first, Karlous Miller D.C. Young Fly and Chico Bean had to connect with the OG Nick Cannon on his new morning show to get things piped up. Nick got into how the show got started and then inquires about the relationship status of the fellas. From there, the squad made it's way to 92.3 with J Cruz and his hilarious radio show and finally the crew circled the bases one more time to get inside of Steve Harvey's Studio and chop it up with the Nephew Tommy and nem - plus Karlous speaks on The Black Men Don't Cheat hit song and how he influenced it. See how the coldest podcast moves on the west coast.
