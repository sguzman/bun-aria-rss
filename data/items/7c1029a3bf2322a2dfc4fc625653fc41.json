In fact, for the 2D case, that also means that you are guaranteed to go to ALL places in the world (the only constraint is, of course, time). [Think about why.]\n\nMarkov chains are also an important tool in modelling the real world, and so I feel like this is a good excuse for bringing it up.\n\nAt the end, I also compare this phenomenon to Stein's paradox - in both cases, there is a cutoff between 2 and 3 dimensions, and they have similar intuitive explanation - is that a coincidence?\n\nVideo chapters:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:59 Chapter 1: Markov chains\n03:20 Chapter 2: Recurrence and transience\n10:08 Chapter 3: Back to random walks\n\nFurther reading:\nLarry Brownâ€™s paper: http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~lbrown/Papers/1971b%20Admissible%20estimators,%20recurrent%20diffusions,%20and%20insoluble%20boundary%20value%20problems.pdf\nUsing electric circuits to prove recurrence / trasience: https://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/math100w13/mare.pdf\nMore complicated, but more general proof: https://sites.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_19/papers19/Legrand.pdf\nActual probability for 3D random walk to come back: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolyasRandomWalkConstants.html\n\nOther than commenting on the video, you are very welcome to fill in a Google form linked below, which helps me make better videos by catering for your math levels:\nhttps://forms.gle/QJ29hocF9uQAyZyH6\n\nIf you want to know more interesting Mathematics, stay tuned for the next video!\n\nSUBSCRIBE and see you in the next video!\n\nIf you are wondering how I made all these videos, even though it is stylistically similar to 3Blue1Brown, I don't use his animation engine Manim, but I will probably reveal how I did it in a potential subscriber milestone, so do subscribe!\n\nSocial media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mathemaniacyt\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_mathemaniac_/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mathemaniacyt\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathemaniac (support if you want to and can afford to!)\nMerch: https://mathemaniac.myspreadshop.co.uk\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/mathemaniac [for one-time support]\n\nFor my contact email, check my About page on a PC.\n\nSee you next time!",
