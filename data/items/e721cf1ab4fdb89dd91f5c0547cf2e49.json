  "description": "Not only is Sam Lipsyte one of the funniest modern fiction authors, he’s also one of Marc’s best friends, a kindred spirit with whom Marc shares a deep mutual respect and understanding. Whenever Marc is in New York City, he and Sam sit around and talk, going over the pressing questions and answers about the way things are. This is the first time they recorded it for an extended period of time. They get into Sam’s early years with the art-punk band Dungbeetle, how he creates his stories in a manner he calls “moving sideways,” how his life has been enriched by teaching, and why it took him a while to write <a href=\"http://harkthebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his latest novel Hark</a>. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://cc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comedy Central</a>, <a href=\"http://squarespace.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squarespace</a>, <a href=\"http://stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stamps.com</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/deadlyclass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deadly Class on SYFY</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
