On today’s episode of A Word, Jason Johnson is joined by UCLA Law Professor LaToya Baldwin Clark, a leader of CRT Forward. That’s a project that tracks attacks on CRT, and works to reframe the public policy discussion around it. She and her colleagues say CRT could play a vital role in preparing American students to live cooperatively in our increasingly diverse nation.\nGuest: UCLA Law Professor LaToya Baldwin Clark\nPodcast production by Yanii Evans\nYou can skip all the ads in A Word by joining Slate Plus.
