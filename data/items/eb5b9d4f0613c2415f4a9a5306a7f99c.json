  "description": "<p>Tiffany Cab&aacute;n captured national headlines when she came within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of winning the primary for district attorney in her hometown of Queens, New York, in 2019. It was an audacious move: a young, out-of-nowhere candidate running in her home borough against the establishment on a platform calling for major changes to the system. Snatching a moral victory from the jaws of electoral defeat, Tiffany kept speaking out. Two years later, she&rsquo;s just won a seat on the New York City Council, where she will have a voice in the debate about what kind of hometown New York wants to be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this interview, host Kevin Burke talks with Tiffany about her coming-of-age story and what she experienced back there that made her someone who gets up and chooses to march on the front lines, has the skills to organize &ndash; and then has the fire in her soul to throw her whole being into fighting for what she believes in. This is a show about diving down to the first act in the life of a person &ndash; in this case, a person who sees something and is moved to do something about it. It&rsquo;s a search for the people in her life who saw her and did something, and how she learned to stand up for herself and for others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a larger sense, it&rsquo;s also about grace&mdash;the kind of mercy and compassionate understanding we find ourselves asking for and being asked to give in our lives&mdash;and whether that kind of grace, born of experience, can become the foundation for how we relate to each other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your Hometown is a show where the local is the epic.
