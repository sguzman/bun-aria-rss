  "description": "Trump's Europe trip was a rare multi-tiered fiasco, a kind of mille feuille of fiascos, at which the disasters operated on many levels--his alienation of our allies, his insults to our troops, his vanity, his cozying up to villains, his fear of getting wet, his complete lack of understanding of how the world works.  In fact, it may be the worst overseas trip by any president ever...since Trump's Helsinki Summit.  Meanwhile, North Korea seems to be building more missile bases and everything else on the planet is worse off than it was two years ago.  So...that's bad.  David Sanger, Rosa Brooks, and Evelyn Farkas discuss and, to the extent possible, make sense of it all.
