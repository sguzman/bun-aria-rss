  "description": "<p>For decades we were taught there was no stopping or reversing cognitive decline, now we know this simply is not true. The brain responds to all the same insults as the rest of the body — stress, poor diet, toxins, lack of exercise or sleep, nutritional deficiencies, high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and more. The term dementia is just a label or diagnosis we associate with a collection of symptoms, it doesn't get to why a person has those symptoms.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman is joined by Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to treating cognitive health and to review patient cases in which they treated individuals with dementia, memory loss, and cognitive decline.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices functional medicine at <a href=\"https://ultrawellnesscenter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The UltraWellness Center</a> in Lenox, MA.&nbsp;Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.&nbsp;Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life.&nbsp;Her DVD Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer explores the functional medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by AirDoctor.
