  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley,\n\nMy man is so handsome sexy very smart and loved by everyone. He is so patient with me and he spoils me rotten. I love this man and I want to be more affectionate with him but I can't because it's darn breath stinks. We have been off and on for two years and his breath is a part of the reason the sex is great but I have to keep my head on the pillow because of his breath. He kisses and leaves a smell on my neck. He won't go get his teeth checked even though he's got good insurance. I mean the odor is bad and it hits you hard especially in the morning. Oh boy. My 3 year old daughter has even asked him to brush his teeth. Now don't get me wrong I have brought this up numerous times and I'm about to make him a dental appointment. I'm about to let it all out and say baby your breath is terrible and you know it. \n\nPlease help. I love this man, but this odor is tearing our relationship apart.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
