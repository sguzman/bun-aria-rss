  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys break down the big news that the Big Ten is officially back and in doing so bring in the General of the Big Ten Army, former Ohio State All-American, 2006 1st round draft pick of the Dallas Cowboys, and friend of the program, General Bob Carpenter. Pat and Bob chat about the Big Ten coming back from the dead, whether players who declared for the draft will be able to come back to school and play, why he doesn't want any of the credit, and what he's going to do as a victory lap (6:01-19:49). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 12 year NFL veteran, one of the most electric human beings on the planet and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. Pat and Ike chat about his thoughts on the Steelers after their Monday night victory over the Giants, his thoughts on the defense, Big Ben's play, how defenses today are going to stop the Chiefs, and much more (19:52-35:40). Last is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where AJ and Pat discuss their weirdest pregame eating rituals, what it takes to become an NFL Player of the Week, Vic Fangio walking back his statement about his timeout usage on Monday night, they take some listener calls, chat about Floyd Mayweather and Logan Paul potentially boxing each other, and everything else going on around the NFL (35:42-1:21:09).
