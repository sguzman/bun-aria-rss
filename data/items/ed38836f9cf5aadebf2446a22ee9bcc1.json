  "title": "257 - The Dexter Killer Mark Twitchell",
  "description": "<p>Mark Twitchell really wanted to become a serial killer. In 2008, after discovering the Showtime series, Dexter, it had become his latest obsession. The aspiring filmmaker felt like he related to Dexter Morgan, the methodical serial killer so good at continually covering his tracks. Mark thought he was just as clever as Dexter, and would be able to get away with murder just as easily. Boy was he wrong. Mark constantly overrated his abilities. As a filmmaker, as a businessman, as a lover, and as a killer, this compulsive liar would leave a ridiculous amount of evidence behind after his first murder that made it incredibly easy for detectives to catch him. He actually wrote down all the details of his murder in a document on his laptop called SK confessions. As in, \"serial killer\" confessions. The entertaining tale of probably the dumbest killer we've covered so far, today, on Timesuck. <br /><br />If you know anything regarding the disappearance of five year-old, Fruitland, Idaho boy Michael Joseph Vaughan, please click this link!: <a href=\"https://www.fruitland.org/index.asp?SEC=10B2C17A-DB5A-4256-8B6D-F589F7133F2D\">https://www.fruitland.org/index.asp?SEC=10B2C17A-DB5A-4256-8B6D-F589F7133F2D</a><br /><br />If you know anything about missing Oklahoma native Christian Alexander Stoppel, please call 405 231-2121.<br /><br />We're donating $15,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation.
