  "description": "<p>We’re starting a new series this week on Leading Through Change! It’s easy to lead when everything is consistent and your job is to simply maintain. But John Maxwell says maintaining is not leading; it’s managing. Great leaders are faced with change every day, and they lead through it with clarity and confidence.</p> <p>In part one of Leading Through Change, John talks about the first three of five points that we’ll cover throughout the series. He reminds us that different people respond to change differently, and he lays out the killers of change so we can identify and avoid them.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Jason Brooks follow up this lesson with a discussion on how the differences in peoples’ responses to change can help you lead better, while emphasizing the importance of listening to your people to know how to lead them individually.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Leading Through Change Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Change and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://johnmaxwell.com/greatestreturn\"><em>The Leader’s Greatest Return</em> by John C.
