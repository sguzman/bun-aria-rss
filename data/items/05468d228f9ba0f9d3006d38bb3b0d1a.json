It’s been nearly seven years since that first inspiration when the goal was to build a community that could learn and grow from one another’s experiences. This new format is all about that connection. In this episode, Anna and Finn share their thoughts, stories and unqualified advice with a listener whose partner’s desire to watch porn makes her feel insecure and another listener whose new partner becomes a different person when he gets high. Stay tuned for monthly special episodes where April Beyer and Anna talk with listeners in need of more qualified advice.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.runningpress.com/titles/anna-faris/dealbreakers/9780762472932/\" target=\"_blank\">Order Dealbreakers now</a>.
