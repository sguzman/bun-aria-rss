  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the media are a depressing element in our society. Even when there is positive news on the GDP or unemployment, they attack. Is the purpose of a free press to be like Don Lemon and Brian Stelter of CNN? Of course not. It’s to strengthen the American society because the government is the opinion of the people. What's happening now is an era of unenlightenment. When we look at what passes as news today, we see pornstars, failed authors, and Michael Cohen. Freedom of the press was not intended for egomaniacs to promote a particular ideology. Newspapers and pamphleteers during the Revolution strengthened America, but that's not what they do today, because Statist progressives reject the enlightenment. Later, Rep Jim Jordan calls in to announce his run for Speaker of the House. We need new leadership because the current leadership doesn’t make the case for conservatism.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
