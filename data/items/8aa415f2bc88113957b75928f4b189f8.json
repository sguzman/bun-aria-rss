  "description": "A Pennsylvania mother allegedly used her 8-year-old daughter’s breath to bypass the breathalyzer device installed to prevent her from driving while drunk, but she was busted after crashing her car, according to police. Judges allow many convicted drunk drivers to stay behind the wheel as long as they only drive cars with ignition interlock devices, which tests a driver’s breath before cranking. The woman now faces charges of corrupting her child, along with a new DUI offense. Nancy Grace and Alan Duke discuss this case and the conviction of another woman who put her drugged 5-year-old into a burning car in this episode.\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
