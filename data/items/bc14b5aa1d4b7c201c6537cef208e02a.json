    "media:description": "Winner of MrBeast \"People With Amazing Talent\" competition!\n\nArchery precision trick shooting, never done before.\nI am trying to break the limit of what is possible in archery, this is the first video, with a new collection of some of the new things I have learned since I last made videos.\n\nSome shots were hard to execute, some only required a single shot.\nRemember I have spent crazy many many hours for many years of archery and then impossible things become possible.\n\nWhy do trick archery ??\nTrick archery was once a natural part of many historical archery traditions, because war archers trained various variations, as one does with all other weapons.\n\nThere really are many different options in archery, and no \"real\" archery\nI think:\nIf you choose, just one type of archery,\nthen you miss out a lot of fun !!\n\nSincerely\nLars Andersen",
