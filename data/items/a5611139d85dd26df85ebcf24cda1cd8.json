It should rather liberate the mind. Because the mind has to be liberated in order to perceive the world, to see society, to understand what its advantages are, what its disadvantages are.” \nIn that same speech Angela Davis drew persuasive links between the suppression of academic freedom, academic and social institutional racism, and the rise of totalitarianism in German during the 1930s. \nLater that month Angela Davis was reinstated by a California Superior Court judge and completed teaching the 1969-70 academic year. \nWith that - let’s listen to Angela Davis talk about academic freedom, institutional racism and the dangers of totalitarianism.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
