  "description": "In this episode, Annette Lawlor of Lion People Global shares her story of getting jobs from the age of 13 when she lied about her age, through multiple sales jobs, selling advertising, tampon vending machines, technology solutions, and recruitment services on both sides of the Atlantic, before setting up jewellery shops and Aerobics classes. She explains her preference for flat organisations, a results oriented work culture, decentralisation, based on trust, and empowering her staff. She tells us how important it is to take action, and be ready to take risks, and is not afraid to share about how little she knew about the localisation industry when she took the plunge to form what has become one of the leading specialist recruitment companies in the industry. We hear an industry event being described as “Linkedin on Legs”, how important forming real relationships has been in her business success, and the basic secret of how to make good openings when phoning up people she wants to do business with. Her final call to action for those who want an entrepreneurial life is one that every driven person will identify with.\n\nThe NBN Entrepreneurship and Leadership podcast aims to educate and entertain, sharing insights based on the personal story of our carefully selected guests aiming for the atmosphere of an informal conversation in a bar or over a cup of coffee.\nAbout Kimon Fountoukidis Twitter Linkedin\nKimon is the founder of both Argos Multilingual and PMR.
