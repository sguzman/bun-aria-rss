  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is triumphant following his wildly successful prayer vigil in Sherborn, MA, but he's not resting on his laurels. Minihane's got another live event and Bob Murchison is invited to attend. Some might say he'd be the star. In today's show, the crew recaps the weekend, you hear the special 1-hour show recorded at Jack's Abbey after the vigil, Steve Robinson isn't too hot on Linda Marks, and John Feitelberg joins for an epic fight about cancel culture with our own Blind Mike.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
