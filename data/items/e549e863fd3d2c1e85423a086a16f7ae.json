  "description": "<p>Callum Preston was spray painting a mural in an alley in Melbourne, Australia when I asked him if he'd be on my podcast. Callum is part of the Everfresh Crew and his mural was awesome. He met me in a park the next day and we talked about the street art scene in Melbourne, how he got started with spray painting graffiti. And then we talked about Australia in general for a while. It was a beautiful day in a beautiful park and I'm really glad I actually went up to a stranger to talk to him. He's a cool guy. </p>",
