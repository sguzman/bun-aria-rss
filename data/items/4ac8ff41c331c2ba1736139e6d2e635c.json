  "description": "Head ninja. Top strategist. Main innovation engine. Chief optimist.\nSören Stamer wears a lot of hats, and it’s one of the main reasons he wears the CEO hat at CoreMedia so successfully.\nCoreMedia markets an open, best-of-breed, API-driven solution that combines a headless content repository with an advanced web-based UI. It allows editors to access content from any source and preview front-end customer experience in real-time.\nFrom the very beginning, Sören has played multiple roles in the company’s growth. As one of CoreMedia’s co-founders, he did everything it took to build the company’s CMS from a great idea into what has become a multimillion Euro business today.\nHis entrepreneurial journey, however, didn’t start in the technology sector. It began on his family’s farm. Growing up on a farm exposed Sören to entrepreneurship ever since he can remember—the good side and the challenges—in addition to the hard and dedicated work it takes to succeed.\nSören’s story is a fascinating lesson for anyone who not only wants to become an entrepreneur, but also wants to live a full and satisfying life.\nAs he says, “I never regret things I did.
