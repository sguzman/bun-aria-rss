  "description": "<p>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl said that \"between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response.\" Frankl was talking about our ability to choose our mental responses to what we encounter in life. What if we could also choose how our physiology responds to our environment so that we can perform and thrive on a higher level? My guest today explores that question in his latest book. His name is <a href=\"http://scottcarney.com/\">Scott Carney</a> and he's the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1734194308/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1734194308&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Wedge: Evolution, Consciousness, Stress, and the Key to Human Resilience</em></a>. <br /><br />We begin our conversation discussing how Scott's investigation into the breathing methods of Wim Hof, an extreme athlete, turned him from a skeptic into an intrigued believer who wanted to learn more about our ability to exercise control over our physiology. Scott then explains his idea of \"the Wedge\" as the ability to consciously put a gap between an external stimulus and the otherwise automatic physiological responses it elicits. Scott and I then discuss his trip around the world to talk to people who have found ways to create wedges in their lives in order to elevate their physical and mental states. We discuss how throwing kettlebells around can be used to overcome fear and experience flow, how lying in a float tank may recalibrate PTSD, how building up tolerance to CO2 can increase your physical performance, how saunas can boost resilience, and why the power of the placebo effect is greatly underrated. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/wedge\">aom.is/wedge</a>.</p>\n",
