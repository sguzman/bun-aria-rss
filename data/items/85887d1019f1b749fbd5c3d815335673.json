  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats seek to destroy the core principles and liberty of America. Nothing in the Constitution supports anything that the democrats are demanding. Nothing. Nominating a Supreme Court Justice in an election year has occurred on 29 other occasions and the sitting president filled the vacancy. That's 23 of 45 presidents who have obeyed the duty to comply with the constitution. Yet the Democrats insist that President Trump break this historical tradition for their partisan political benefit, or risk more riots. Then, Marxism and adherents of communist philosophy like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Chuck Schumer seek to eliminate opposition so that their party can pursue absolute power. They are making a move on our system of government, by eliminating the filibuster, eliminating the electoral college, and taking over the Supreme Court. Later, leftwing radicals continue attacking the history of America by pushing the 1619 project and packing the Supreme Court with leftwing activists posing as judges. Democrats complain of systemic racism but our education system has systematically become filled with Marxist hate and propaganda for the sake of indoctrination. Afterward, Joe Biden distorts the truth when he says that Trump only called on him to release his list of SCOTUS nominees after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Trump campaign had requested it nine days before her passing. Biden is afraid to release his list because the radical names on it will appall the American people. Biden also continues spreading his big lie that Trump didn't react fast enough to the coronavirus and the media doesn't even call him on it. Finally, Congressman Lee Zeldin calls in with an update on his campaign for the House of Representatives.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
