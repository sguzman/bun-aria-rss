  "description": "Hello, this is Eric LeMay, a host on the New Books Network. Today I interview Martín Prechtel, who's written a book about horses called The Mare and the Mouse (North Start Press of Saint Cloud, 2021). Actually, he's written three books about horses. The subtitle of this one is called Stories of My Horses, Volume 1, and there are two more volumes to come. Now, you may be thinking to yourself, \"I'm not a horse person.\" Well, I'm not a horse person either. And if you aren't, it doesn't matter. You'll love hearing what Martin has to say. He's an amazing storyteller and a profound teacher. And if you are a horse person, I suspect you'll find Martín's vision of horses moving, rambunctious, insightful, deeply learned, and richly experienced. He may even change the way you understand your horse and, as importantly, he may also give your horse a better chance to understand you. Here's my conversation with the extraordinary and invaluable Martín Prechtel.\n Eric LeMay is on the creative writing faculty at Ohio University. He is the author of five books, most recently Remember Me. He can be reached at eric@ericlemay.org.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
