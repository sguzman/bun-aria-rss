  "description": "In Episode #203, I welcome Drew Harrisberg back to the show for another episode to discuss a variety of topics, from the Hadza tribe and their diet to the importance of movement throughout the day.\n\nThere’s a lot to learn in Episode #203. We discuss red meat consumption and associated health outcomes, sleep and insulin resistance, and the dietary pattern of the Hadza tribe. We also cover the importance of maintaining activity levels throughout the day and tips to incorporate movement in environments where it’s difficult to do so. For any chocolate lovers listening, we dive into a recent study on cocoa flavanols, and note how much chocolate you can eat for maximum benefit and minimum negative health outcomes.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nEye Health (2:35)\n\nThe Hazda Diet (8:28)\n\nCarnivore Craze (28:03)\n\nRevisiting CGMs (50:49)\n\nTips for Regulating Glucose (1:04:00)\n\nBenefits of Chocolate (1:19:58)\n\nDaily Steps (1:37:49)\n\nResistance Training (1:55:12)\n\nBook/ Show Recommendations (2:24:34)\n\nOutro (2:33:18)\n\n\nTo connect with Drew, you can reach him via his Instagram or website, Drew’s Daily Dose. You can also listen to his previous appearances on the show on your favourite podcast app.\n\nThank you to The Proof partner Eimele Essential 8 for sponsoring this episode. This is a supplement I helped formulate, designed for plant-predominant eaters who may typically fall short on some key nutrients. I personally take Eimele Essential 8 every day with breakfast.
