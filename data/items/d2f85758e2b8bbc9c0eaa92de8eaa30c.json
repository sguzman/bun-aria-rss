  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">We’re starting the new year with a look back. John Fea, history professor from Messiah College, author of “Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump,” and the official historian of the Holy Post podcast, says 2020 was a year that “unveiled” the truth about American evangelicalism. He also explores how different court evangelicals have responded to Trump’s loss, and what may happen next. Fea also looks at Phil’s recent video about the history of evangelicalism, and how the Second Great Awakening shaped so much of what we’re seeing today. Also this week—Skye goes skiing and Phil replaces Plinky Pete.</p>",
