  "description": "<p>ALMOST ALL OF YOUR SUFFERING COMES FROM YOUR THOUGHTS. We all get stuck in the past. We worry about the future. We’re full of anxiety. It can consume us. And makes us ungrateful for what is happening now. In fact, you could say that the root of all our unhappiness is our thoughts. So how can we get more present? It’s not something that happens automatically. You have to practice every day. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I dive deep into the idea of eliminating suffering with an expert in meditation: Sam Harris. Sam Harris is a New York Times best-selling author, podcast host, and creator of the Waking Up Course. His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live. Sam explains how experiencing unconditional love got him interested in meditation and how he reframes the “bad things” that happen to him in life. So get ready to learn all about consciousness on Episode 823.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhen did you get into meditation? (6:00)<br />\nHad you ever felt unconditional love before taking MDMA? (10:30)<br />\nWhen did you start to focus on the desire to be happy? (15:50)<br />\nWhy do so many people believe so firmly in religion? (19:30)<br />\nHow do we unlock our consciousness? (32:40)<br />\nIf you could control your thoughts, what would you want to think? (41:00)<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nThe goal of meditation (14:00)<br />\nThe main tool we have is human conversation (18:00)<br />\nThe only important thing in the universe (30:00)<br />\nHow to reframe anxiety (35:00)<br />\nWhy worry is pointless (45:30)<br />\nIf you liked this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/823 and follow at instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
