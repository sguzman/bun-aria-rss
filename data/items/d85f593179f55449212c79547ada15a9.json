Right before Jeremy was born in December of 1992, Bonnie completed a GED course.  A few months later, she took a job as a live-in nanny with a local family, which allowed her to care for Jeremy while working.  From the outside, things appeared to be going well for Bonnie.  On the evening of April 28, 1993, Bonnie left home with Jeremy to meet someone at a local grocery store in Brandon, Florida.  They never returned home, and Bonnie's minivan was later found abandoned in the grocery store's parking lot.  It has been a long 27 years since Bonnie and Jeremy were seen alive, but their family is hoping that someone out there has a clue that may help solve this case. </p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Bonnie and Jeremy Dages, please contact the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office at 813-247-8200.</p><p>You can follow Bonnie and Jeremy's case on Facebook at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BonnieLeeDages/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In Memory of Bonnie Lee Dages</a>.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
