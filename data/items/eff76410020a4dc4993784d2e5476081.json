Then, Jason La Canfora joins Will (27:00) to sort through Sunday's storylines including what the Jags do now at QB without Nick Foles (28:30), if the Browns should be panicking (34:00), the latest on AB (42:00), plus a shoutout to all the Lamar Jackson haters (50:00). \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
