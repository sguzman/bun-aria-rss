  "title": "#59: 2020 Jumped the Shark But Will We Stick the Landing? (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 59th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we discuss the CDC recommendations to engage in race-based vaccine distribution, the New England Journal of Medicine jumping the shark on sex and birth certificates, and the role of markets in journalism. We also pay attention to this moment in time: Chanukah, Christmas and the solstice, plus a reading from Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. We begin the episode by making a few corrections from episode 58, on the subjects of ligands and adaptive immunity. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
