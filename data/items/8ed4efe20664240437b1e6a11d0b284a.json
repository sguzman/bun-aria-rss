  "description": "Quant analyst Plan B, creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, which correctly predicted the 14X rise in BTC price, from $4,000 to $55,000 shares good Bitcoin news on crypto twitter, that the S2F model still points to $500K per coin after the 2024 halving.\n\n\"Even if the original $55K model was right and the later $100K update wrong, the difference is \"only\" 2X. Remember that S2F model was created in March 2019, when bitcoin was below $4K. IMO the correctly predicted 14X rise (55/4) is worth more than the 2X prediction error (100/55).\"\n\nOriginal 2019 $55K S2F model seems to fit better than later $100K update. Interestingly a refit based on 18m average S2F ratio and 3 yrs new data confirms the original model. The bad news: $100K was probably too high. The good news: model still points to $500K after 2024 halving.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
