It was hosted by OVHcloud, a cloud provider based in Paris.  Not only was the setting amazing (window ringed conference room with a thunderstorm outside with lightning bolts shooting behind Mitzi), they passed out the best swag ever.  Check it out:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"779\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-48121\" srcset=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-225x300.jpg 225w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OVHcloud-swag-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a></p>\n<p>At first I thought the thing in the lower left was one of those old school erasers.  But then I realized it was a combination beer key and pizza cutter.  How cool is that for a meetup?  And naturally, this meetup had both beer in bottles and pizza.  But no chance to try it out, as the staff supplied beer keys and had cut all the pizza.</p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a pair of socks on top.  I remember having lunch at a conference with <a href=\"http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/\">Stu Shieber</a> years ago, when I had plenty of swag from the startup I was at (SpeechWorks).  Stu said we should pass out branded sweatpants, because everyone passed out t-shirts and he had to buy his own sweatpants.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the quintessential French writing device&#8212;the Bic 4-color pen.  Bic&#8217;s a French company, so you see these everywhere.  They were exotic in the states when I was a kid and I used to get one for Xmas every year. There&#8217;s also a pack of biodegradable playing cards, a tote bag, and a really nice notebook.</p>\n<p>Thanks, OVHcloud, both for hosting and the super-cool swag.</p>\n",
