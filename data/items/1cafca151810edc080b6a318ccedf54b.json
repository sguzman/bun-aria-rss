  "description": "<p>Today we begin our coverage of a horrific offender whom we are loathe to name, and a Netflix documentary series about his heinous crimes — who’s title we hate to repeat. Most people know his name but don’t know the victims. We will refer to him as RR throughout our series, We take apart the framework of the docuseries, which is from the POV of Detectives Frank Salerno and Gill Carrillo who led the task force to find this killer. Right off the bat, Laura and Jim have some differing and controversial opinions on the docuseries, the men charged with leading the investigation and the investigation itself.
