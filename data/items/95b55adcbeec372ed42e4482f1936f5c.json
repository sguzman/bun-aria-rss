Cuddle Party facilitator & emotional fermentation starter Scoby has been situationally monogamous for most of COVID, and now she’s ready to get back out there. But at her first sex-positive retreat, but she’s feeling a lot of shame about her lack of arousal - until a meditative cockstroking workshop in the rain changes everything. And this week, come meet Dixie in person this Friday October 14th at Doghouse Leathers (715 E Pike Street, Seattle WA).
