  "description": "<p>As we reach the halfway point of Tokyo 2020 it's time to come back and chat about another golden day for Australia and another silver day for Canada with plenty to discuss as always! We celebrate the new equal record holder of medals won by an Australian Emma McKeon and talk up how tomorrow could be a big day for both Australia and Canada at the Olympics. We also learn about more backstroke gold for our girl Kaylee, work out if Kylie winning another silver is another good thing for our show or another aspect of the curse, and also talk up some great running performances by Australia and Canada too. Added to that we bring back some commentary with our final taste of swimming, work out if getting 'given' a medal in the tennis still counts and find out what sport we watched that we are really in love with that has surprised us. Get to listening and get entertained! We guarantee it!</p>",
