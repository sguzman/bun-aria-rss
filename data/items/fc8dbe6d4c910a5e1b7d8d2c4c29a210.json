  "description": "Did you have yesterday off from work? If you didn’t, we’re sorry. But even if you did, chances are you still answered a few emails, checked a few Slacks, and furrowed your brow thinking about all the things you’ve got to catch up on this morning. \nBut what if work...didn’t have to be like that? \nThis week on Morning Brew’s Business Casual podcast, we tear apart how work came to rule our lives—and what some in the business world are doing to fix it. Basecamp CEO, remote work enthusiast, and Bezos-approved founder Jason Fried explains why today’s idea of a work/life balance isn’t doing us any favors. Plus…\n\nHow Silicon Valley’s ideas of “move fast and break things” broke the wrong things\n\nHow venture capital puts companies in “pressure cookers”\n\nAnd how tech could change the notion of 9–5\n\nListen and let us know what you think.",
