  "description": "The prospect rankings continue as Chris Trapasso joins Will Brinson to break down his top offensive line and defensive line players in the 2021 NFL Draft. We start with the side that has much more enticing prospects and that's the OL (4:30). Alijah Vera-Tucker is a promising player out of USC climbing up draft boards, but Trapasso has him lower than most because he thinks he projects on the interior at the next level. Rashawn Slater could be considered the consensus #2 tackle prospect, but Chris has him lower. There's no hesitation in labeling Penei Sewell the best of the bunch, but that doesn't mean there is value on him to be the first OL selected. Christian Darrisaw might be worth thinking about as a value play though. Next, the guys switch sides and hit on the top DTs in this class (24:45). Expect only 1-2 to be chosen in the 1st round. \nCheck out Trapasso's Big Board here: https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/nfl-draft-2021-big-board-top-200-notre-dames-jeremiah-owusu-koramoah-in-top-10-wideouts-and-corners-galore/\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
