  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Colts and Ravens, Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews having an unbelievable night, and where the Colts go from here. They also cover the news coming out of Las Vegas as Jon Gruden has officially resigned as Head Coach of the Las Vegas Raiders following emails that were leaked between him and former President/GM of the Washington Football Team, Bruce Allen. Joining the program for his weekly installment of Aaron Rodgers Tuesday fresh off a thrilling win in Cincinnati against the Bengals is the Quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about this weekend's game, what he told Joe Burrow after the game, what he thinks about the whole Jon Gruden situation, if he talked to Mason Crosby during the game at all, what Packers/Bears week means, and much more (23:06-1:06:44). Next, GM of the LA Chargers, Tom Telesco joins the show to chat about the Chargers incredible start, how much of a difference maker Brandon Staley has been, Justin Herbert continuing to get better and better, what his duties as a GM are like during the season, and where he thinks the NFL needs to go from here in response to the Jon Gruden situation (1:06:48-1:19:19). Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, former record holder of the longest FG in NFL, and K for the Arizona Cardinals, Matt Prater, joins the program. Pat, Matt, and AJ chat about how things are in Arizona, when he knew that locker room was special, if the longest field goal will be able to be much further than 66 yards, what he would tell young kicker's trying to get out of a rut, and much more (1:19:21-1:33:50). To close out the show, Pat and AJ dive deeper into last night's Monday Night Football game and Lamar Jackson's brilliance, the Colts looking much better than they have, and Pat having to donate a whole bunch of crab cakes after losing a bet to Jimmy's Seafood in Baltimore (1:35:53-1:51:17).
