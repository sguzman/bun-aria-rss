He believes Digs is starting to act like a Don around the office, Digs has &nbsp;a different message. The guys also debut a new segment dealing with notes from El Chapo's trial, but get some hazy and confusing information. They also play \"Dead or Alive,\" with Gorman and a little fact or fiction. Todd wants to know how many guys in the office it would take to take out Brock Lesnar is a UFC-type sanctioned match, if it's even possible. They also answer some listener questions, including what the worst job to be hungover for is, and what job they would assign to everyone as a punishment for a full 40 hour work week.
