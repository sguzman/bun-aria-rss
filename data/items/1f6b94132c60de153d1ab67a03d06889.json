  "description": "Today's episode is absolutely loaded. First, budding 49ers superstar, arguably the best TE in the NFL right now and friend of the show, George Kittle, calls in hot off his 210 yard performance on Sunday. They chat about the game and why he didn't eclipse the record after his monster first half, he breaks down a live game of PIG being played between the 9ers Specialists and Joe Staley, he takes issue with something Pat Angerer said, and they discuss wrestling some more as George presents a West Virginia vs. Iowa wrestling match. (1:32-11:47). Next, one of Pat's former teammates and one of the most athletic lineman in the NFL, offensive tackle for the Chicago Bears, Bradley Sowell, calls in coming off scoring the only touchdown in Sunday night's tilt against the Rams. They discuss how his career has been going up to this point, how hard he had to beg to be on the receiving end of that touchdown Sunday, his golf game and whether he'd ever consider turning pro, and the atmosphere in the Bears' locker room right now (17:20-28:47). Later, Pro introduces a new segment titled, \"A reading from the book of..\" where he highlights one of the guys' blogs from this past week. They also discuss Digs' recent Steelers rant and dive into an incredible NFL conversation including a lock from Gorman for all the brobrobro's. Also included is Pat's interview with Mike Florio on Pro Football Talk discussing some things going on in the NFL (1:05:16-1:17:45), and Pat runs through some of the songs compiled from his year end Spotify playlist. Closing out the show is an interview with Purdue legend and national inspiration, Tyler Trent, to help start your weekend with some positivity(1:39:09-1:59:00). It's a great one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
