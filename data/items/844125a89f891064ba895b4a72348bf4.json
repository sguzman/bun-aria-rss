  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Sha'Carri Richardson is a tremendous asset to the US Olympic Team and was charged with using marijuana, which is legal in many parts, and it's not even a performance-enhancing drug. She was honest and forthcoming yet she won’t be representing America in the Olympics. She was definitely poised to secure a gold medal, perhaps two. Richardson never turned her back on her country, unlike so many others. Yet our politicians will allow the borders to remain open and organizations like Black Lives Matter to destroy with impunity. Then, Donald Trump announced a federal class-action lawsuit against several tech giants to order an immediate halt to tech companies' shameful censorship of the American people. Trump's America First Policy Institute is seeking injunctive relief to restore free speech online. Later, the Democrat Party has become a largely Marxist operation using public education to promote racist propaganda. The NEA and the AFT teacher unions compete over members but they are one and the same - neither wants their members to compete on merit. Our children's education is jeopardized and it's entirely funded by the taxpayers through confiscatory taxes. Afterward, Jesse Watters calls in to discuss his new book, How I Saved The World.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
