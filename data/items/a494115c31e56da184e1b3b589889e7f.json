In this podcast, Vitaliy walks you through how he sees the market today, and how IMA is building an All-Terrain portfolio to weather whatever the market might throw at it.</p> <p>You can read this article online at: <a href= \"https://contrarianedge.com/2020-party-like-its-1999/\">https://contrarianedge.com/2020-party-like-its-1999/</a></p> <p><em>Disclosure:</em> <em><a href= \"https://contrarianedge.com/read-buy-next-stock-awesome-research/\">Read this before you buy your next stock</a></em></p> <div> </div>",
