  "description": "Guys!!! It's episode two hundred… and ONE! We’ve gathered you here today so we could grace your presence with one of the most lovely humans we’ve ever encountered: Ghost Honey aka Tyler Gaca. Tyler joins us today to talk about something we vowed to never attempt an episode on: Black Eyed Children. The first time we tried to do this episode some weird shit went down and it just straight up wouldn’t record. Luckily, we got our shit together and think the united force of the three of us kept the spooky unexplainable. Alaina takes us into the origin story, and Ash tells some spooky stories you can find on Thought Catalog. Hold onto your butts… and your noses i guess. It’s about to get real weird up in here. \n<br>\n\n<a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/christine-stockton/2013/11/16-peoples-terrifying-encounters-with-the-black-eyed-kids/\" target=\"_blank\">https://thoughtcatalog.com/christine-stockton/2013/11/16-peoples-terrifying-encounters-with-the-black-eyed-kids/</a>\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\nHelloFresh: Go to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/10morbid\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/10morbid</a> and use code 10morbid for 10 free meals, including free shipping!\n<br>\n\nSimplisafe: Right now, our listeners get a FREE home security camera, when you purchase a SimpliSafe system at <a href=\"http://SIMPLISAFE.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">SIMPLISAFE.com/MORBID</a>.\n<br>\n\nCare/of: For 50% off your first Care/of order, go to <a href=\"http://TakeCareOf.com/morbid50\" target=\"_blank\">TakeCareOf.com/morbid50</a> and enter code morbid50.\n<br>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://Stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a>: With promo code, MORBID, you get a special offer that includes a 4-week\ntrial PLUS free postage and a digital scale.
