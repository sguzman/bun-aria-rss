    "media:description": "You might’ve heard that there is currently a pilot shortage, but you’ll never believe how much pilots are actually making. The median salary for an airline pilot itself is $202,000. Meanwhile, the highest-level captains at the legacy carriers are able to make much more thanks to high-paying overtime opportunities. The top captains at Delta are making $526,000 per year. The top captains at Southwest are making $549,000 per year. And the top captains at American Airlines are making over $700,000 per year. On top of this, airlines have some of the most generous 401K plans in the world given that many of them contribute 16% worth of your paycheck to a retirement fund without you even contributing. But, despite these insane perks, the pilot shortage is only getting worse, and it’s expected that the pilot shortage will grow multiple folds within the next decade. This means that pilot salaries will only go up even more and the top pilots will probably be making 7 figures in the imminent future. This video explains why pilots are paid so much and the future of the aviation industry. \n\nDiscord Community: \nhttps://discord.gg/SJUNWNt\n\nTimestamps: \n0:00 - Pilot Salaries\n2:58 - Barrier To Entry\n5:50 - Paying Your Dues\n9:02 - Pilot Shortage\n11:18 - 7 Figure Incomes \n\nResources: \nhttps://pastebin.com/rJCwSWjZ",
