I'm a reverse engineer, through and through. Heck, I don't know anything about 99% of the businesses out there, but I believe that it would take me only about 6 months to absorb the information - the data, the numbers, the culture, etc. - and reverse engineer the business to get it to a point where I can run with it. I'd take a look at the marketplace, understand the consumer that the business is selling to, whether B2B or B2C, and start making my chess moves. Frankly, as an operator, there is no business out there that I'd ever be intimidated by. That's just who I am. Fearless.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Look, this comes down to people and process. You need to have the chops to build teams around you while having the strategy and tact to sell the product at hand. I'm certainly not the only one, but it's few and far in between that you have natural born operators that can take a look at things, assess the situation, and really operate the business without ever having any real experience in that field. </span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">As I alluded to earlier, this all boils down to sales and HR. People and process. That's why I think I've been so successful. My salesmanship and ability to build strong infrastructures with the people around me is why I have won. Period.
