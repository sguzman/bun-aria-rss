  "description": "<p>Today we welcome Dan Tomasulo who is a counseling psychologist, professor, and the Academic Director at the Spirituality Mind Body Institute (SMBI), Teachers College, Columbia University. He holds a Ph.D. in psychology, an MFA in writing, and a Masters of Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. Dan is also the author of several books, including <i>American Snake Pit</i> and <i>Confessions of a Former Child: A Therapist's Memoir</i>. His latest book is called <i>Learned Hopefulness</i>.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Dan Tomasulo about psychodrama and learned hopefulness. Interventions have always focused on helping people recover from trauma but Dan believes we can do more than that through psychodrama. When we re-enact difficult experiences, we can process and integrate trauma in a way that facilitates growth. It also teaches us to perceive obstacles differently, which is integral to learning hopefulness. </p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.dantomasulo.com/\">www.dantomasulo.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drdantomasulo\">@drdantomasulo</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:27 Dan as a stand-up comedian</p><p>04:58 Meeting Andy Kaufman</p><p>08:33 Dan’s interest in psychology</p><p>14:36 American Snake Pit </p><p>21:35 Interactive Behavioral Therapy (IBT)</p><p>27:10 What is psychodrama?</p><p>34:15 Learned Hopefulness</p><p>41:00 Hope activating exercises</p><p>45:49 Spiritual psychology</p><p>51:55 Hope, optimism, faith</p>\n",
