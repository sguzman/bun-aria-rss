  "description": "We've got you covered on Super Bowl storylines and we also have you covered with Xs and Os for Chiefs vs. Bucs. And there's no better guest to break down the matchup than Brady Quinn! Will Brinson and Brady start the podcast with their normal off-topic antics, but then get into the keys to Sunday. We didn't anticipate the weather to be a factor, but watch out, because it could come into play with a forecast for possible rain on gameday (7:00). The guys also extensively break down the matchups when Kansas City has the ball (18:20) and when Tampa Bay has the ball (32:30), with a few props sprinkled in at the end (49:00).\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
