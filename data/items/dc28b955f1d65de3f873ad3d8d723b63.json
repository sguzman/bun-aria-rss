First, Pete walks us through how he “charmed” his way through his English degree in college and the gang talks about the nuances of liberal arts education. Then, Pete touches on how he discovered the path to comedy by becoming a provocateur at his boring Christian college. Afterward, Pete compares show business to Lord of the Rings, commiserates with Anna over the perils of dating a performer, and the importance of living a balanced life. Then, the gang plays a round of “Just answer” and “How would you proceed?” Then, they talk to Tony who’s having problems with his new wife’s ex-husband and Casey who can’t stand her boyfriend’s high school friends.
