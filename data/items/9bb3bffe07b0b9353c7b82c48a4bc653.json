  "description": "When our kids show us a new drawing, score their first soccer goal, or ace a test, we want to celebrate their wins. And when our kids are struggling, our first instinct is to build them back up. But here's the tricky thing about showering kids with praise in high or low moments: It wires them to look to others for validation, instead of learning to feel at home with themselves. In this episode, Dr. Becky talks to three parents about rethinking praise. She offers strategies for how to build stable, long-lasting confidence that your child will be able to access no matter what comes their way in life. \n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
