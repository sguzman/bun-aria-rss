  "description": "Hey HB's! This week we read After We Fall by Melanie Harlow. It's a contemporary novel with a soul-searching, rich girl heroine and an emotionally isolated widower who's still navigating symptoms of PTSD. There's a farm. There are attempts at chores. There are accidental meetings. There are dubious decisions outdoors. There's some peeping. There's some excellent dirty talk. And TREE SEX. Oh yes. \n Bonus Content: Erin is SO SICK! Rooster's probable Telegram Company. The Alaskan State Fair. Our thoughts on dudes with pastel whale shorts, boat shoes, and a disgusting sense of entitlement. A discussion of how to be a friend. What are eggs? IS THAT A GOAT? Totally hypothetical advice about sex against a tree. And how Melody might employ gymnastics to coat your car in all sorts of nonsense if you don't offer her the bathroom after sex. \n Self-Love Recommendations: \n Erin: Consider taking the leash off. Erin was too scared to let Rooster off the leash for years and this weekend she proved herself to be an ecstatic off-road adventure dog! Your loved ones could surprise you.\n Melody: Make sure you're registered to vote! We've got some important upcoming elections whether local, state, and national elections.
