  "description": "<p>Football is back, sort of. We liked week 1 of the XFL and some of the funky new rules (2:14 - 13:17). PFT had to put Rovell in line and Duke/UNC was an instant classic (13:17 - 18:29). Who's back of the week including Oscars and Bobby Knight returns to Indiana (18:29 - 28:56). Super Bowl Champ Chris Jones joins the show to talk about Super Bowl 54, the post party, the time his dick flopped out of his underwear at the combine and more (28:56 - 51:45). Our friend Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen joins the show to talk about his second season in Buffalo, the famous playoff game lateral and more (51:45 - 70:16). Segments include way to stay relevant baseball, Russ Wilson photoshoot roast with a tangent on NYC wildlife, and ass eating season with Phil Fulmer and we say nice things about Tennessee.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
