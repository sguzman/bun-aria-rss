  "description": "We welcome our very first guest, author and sex educator Emily Nagoski, who talks with us about how to finally build true, joyful, confident sex lives:\n\n1. How our sex issues are totally normal—we’re all worrying about the same things. \n2. Why more than 75% of women do not orgasm from penetration alone—and why Glennon thinks the world doesn’t want us to know that.\n3. The single factor that is most predictive of strong sustained sexual connection over time. \n4. How Abby’s still healing after a lifetime in locker rooms spent comparing her body to other women’s bodies.\n\nCW: We reference sexual trauma, including what to say when someone discloses sexual trauma to you. \n\nAbout Emily: EMILY NAGOSKI is the award-winning author of the New York Times bestselling COME AS YOU ARE and THE COME AS YOU ARE WORKBOOK, and coauthor, with her sister, Amelia, of New York Times bestseller BURNOUT: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle. She earned an M.S. in counseling and a Ph.D. in health behavior, both from Indiana University, with clinical and research training at the Kinsey Institute. Now she combines sex education and stress education to teach women to live with confidence and joy inside their bodies. She lives in Massachusetts with two dogs, a cat, and a cartoonist.\n\nPodcast: https://www.feministsurvivalproject.com\nInstagram: @enagoski\nTwitter: @emilynagoski\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
