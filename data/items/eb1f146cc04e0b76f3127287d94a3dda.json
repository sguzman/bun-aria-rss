  "description": "<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life Podcast! This week, our hosts are covering chapters 16-21 of C. S. Lewis’ masterpiece <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FDBwf3\">Til We Have Faces</a></em>.

To enter to win a copy, post about the book release with hashtag #hallelujahadvent.</p> <p>They begin the conversation about <em>Til We Have Faces</em> with an examination of Lewis’ personal journey and its similarity to Orual’s own in this story. This opens up a discussion of education, Lewis’s schooling, and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. Angelina then goes on to talk about the three types of veils worn by Orual, and Cindy and Thomas explore the idea of veils and their role in relationship and power. Orual’s friendships with Bardia and the Fox further highlight her continued blindness to her own disordered affections.</p> <p>Join us next week for the last installment in our series on <em>Til We Have Faces</em>. The following episode will be a special interview with Wendi Capehart on her literary life!</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophesy, and religion. All is one.</p> <cite>John Ruskin</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Since then I have always been addicted to something or other, usually something there’s no support group for. Semicolons, for instance, I can never give up for more than two hundred words at a time.</p> <cite>Hilary Mantel</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The two hemispheres of my mind were in the sharpest contrast. On the one side, a many-islanded sea of poetry and myth; on the other, a glib and shallow “rationalism.” Nearly all that I loved, I believed to be imaginary. Nearly all that I believed to be real, I thought grim and meaningless.</p> <cite>C. S. Lewis</cite></blockquote> <h3>Moonlight</h3> <p><em>by Walter de la Mare</em></p> <p>The far moon maketh lovers wise<br /> In her pale beauty trembling down,<br /> Lending curved cheeks, dark lips, dark eyes,<br /> A strangeness not their own.<br /> And, though they shut their lids to kiss,<br /> In starless darkness peace to win,<br /> Even on that secret world from this<br /> Her twilight enters in.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>(Amazon affiliate links are used in this content.)</em></span></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jtwxfv\">Hallelujah</a></em> by Cindy Rollins</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3it2mUv\">Sesame and Lilies</a></em> by John Ruskin</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Hu9VgE\">Giving Up the Ghost: A Memoire</a></em> by Hilary Mantel</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jxKsBa\">The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C.
