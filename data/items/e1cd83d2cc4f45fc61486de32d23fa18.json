  "description": "My father died when I was 15, after years of being an alcoholic.  I don't have a memory of my father sober. Mike Abramowitz of G.R.A.B. Tomorrow asked if he could interview me for his upcoming book and we decided this would also be a good episode to publish. Although this is a longer than our typical episode, we speak about how no matter what happens in your life you have two choices - either you see yourself as a victim or you find a silver lining and learn from every negative. We hope this episode can help people who have been through similar circumstances in their lives.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
