  "description": "We’re joined by Ted, Christian, and Blake to talk about the family history on the farm that led them to have DSP-IN-31, which is a super super low number when it comes to a distilled spirits producer. We take a few twists, but there is one thing we came away with and that’s how this family never settles with a single recipe, single barrel entry proof, single cooperage, or even a single distiller. These three take turns at the helm steering their bourbon in a new direction. After recording, we went to the warehouse and tasted 12 or 15 different barrels and not one of the two was alike. Make sure you try a single barrel selection from Starlight Distillery and you will know what I’m talking about.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about media packages.\n\nWould you rather be an astronaut or an olympic gold medalist?\n\nTalk about the history of the farm and distillery.\n\nWhat law allowed MGP to operate as a distillery?\n\nTalk about your brandy.\n\nWhat were the learning curves when transitioning from brandy to whiskey?\n\nTell us about the bourbon.\n\nWhat's the difference between a brandy still and a whiskey still?\n\nWhy do you use so many different cooperages?\n\nIs there a better time of year to pull barrels?\n\nTell us about your corn varieties.\n\nTalk about your latest releases.\n\nWhat is Carl T.?\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
