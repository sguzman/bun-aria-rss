  "description": "<p>For many of us accustomed to the standard American way of food preservation, fermentation can be a strange topic to broach. Although it's a subject I've discussed before on this podcast, given the focus of this season I thought it'd be great to bring in a true expert. Today we're joined by my good friend, author and fermentation guru Wardee Harmon. In this episode we cover why fermentation is best for preserving nutrients, the benefits of probiotics, what to use for starter cultures, how to prevent cross-contamination, how to differentiate foam from mold, and much, much more. Wardee literally wrote the book on fermenting so you'll want to bring a pen and notebook to today's podcast. Be sure to listen to this episode all the way through as Wardee offers some incredible resources at the end.</p><p>Ready to dive deeper into the world of fermentation?  Be sure to check out all of the links below that Wardee mentioned on the podcast!<br/><br/>-  <a href='https://traditionalcookingschool.com/'>https://traditionalcookingschool.com/</a><br/>-  Bible-Based Cooking Program: <a href='https://traditionalcookingschool.com/7rv0'>https://traditionalcookingschool.com/7rv0</a><br/>-  New book \"Fermenting\" (releases Aug 3)<br/><a href='https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Fermenting/Wardeh-Harmon/9781615649907?id=8262634534879https://traditionalcookingschool.com/q-a/how-to-prevent-mold-during-fermentation-aw074/'>https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Fermenting/Wardeh-Harmon/9781615649907?id=8262634534879https://traditionalcookingschool.com/q-a/how-to-prevent-mold-during-fermentation-aw074/</a><br/>-  Apple Chutney Recipe:   <a href='https://traditionalcookingschool.com/celebrations/5-spice-apple-chutney/'>https://traditionalcookingschool.com/celebrations/5-spice-apple-chutney/</a></p><p>This episode is brought to you by Redmond’s Real Salt, which is the #1 salt I use in all my homesteading cooking, canning, and fermentation.

Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too.
