  "description": "<p>“I didn't want that more traditional kind of arc of childhood to a certain stance of wisdom or resignation or triumph. I wanted—partly because I felt with <em>Negroland</em>, and very much with this book—that ability to change persona, change my position, to acknowledge that one was performing at times, and that one played many, many roles … I wanted to be able to take in all of that, and a traditional memoir structure wasn't going to allow it.” Margo Jefferson is one of our most astute and elegant cultural critics, full stop. Winner of a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, she’s also the acclaimed author of several books, including her latest, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/constructing-a-nervous-system-margo-jefferson/1139543999?ean=9781524748173\"><em>Constructing a Nervous System</em></a>. Margo joins us on the show to talk about finding a new language for criticism, engaging with art on her own terms, Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald, investigating herself as a critic and a teacher, and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.
