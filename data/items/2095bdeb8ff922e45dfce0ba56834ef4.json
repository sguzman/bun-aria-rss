  "description": "Can humans and sea creatures communicate? In Shelby Van Pelt's first novel, <em>Remarkably Bright Creatures</em>, they sure can –and they do. The story centers around an octopus in captivity and his relationship to Tova, a grieving 70-year-old woman who cleans the aquarium at night. In an interview with All Things Considered, Van Pelt told Adrian Florido that the idea came to her while thinking about the frustration animals must feel in captivity and the thoughts that might be running through their heads. But it's not only a story about freedom (or lack thereof), it's also a story about heartache, loss, and unexpected friendship. ",
