  "description": "<p><p>Barstool Sports Editor-in-Chief Kmarko calls Kirk Minihane \"two-faced\" and Steve Robinson \"a dick\" during an on-air exchange about a censored blog post. While Kmarko stopped shortly of offering up a richly deserved apology, he did at least admit he was wrong and that he treated Robinson like a dick. Also on today's show: Robinson gets pranked hook-line-and-sinker by DEC posing as Drunk John Dennis, Kelleher v. Cullinane fall out, and the Boston Globe continues to run cover for the baseball arm of the John Henry Conglomerate.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
