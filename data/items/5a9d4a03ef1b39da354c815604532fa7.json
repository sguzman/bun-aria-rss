  "description": "Jean Smart (the living legend and multiple Emmy winner) plays Deborah Vance, a famous comedian whose glory days are behind her. Deborah’s agent has a suggestion for her: Hire a younger comedy writer named Ava (Hannah Einbinder) to help spice up her material. \n\nSmart and Einbinder’s chemistry and performances take “Hacks” from a showbiz comedy to something with broader appeal. It’s a show that’s interested in the ways women in male-dominated industries are constantly one mistake away from having their careers seriously undermined, the ways that women across different generations view the world differently, and the ways those different points of view can make for varied types of comedy.\n\n“Hacks” will release two new episodes on HBO Max every Thursday until June 10. The first four are streaming now.\n\nRead Emily’s review of Hacks here.\n\nLooking for a new show or movie? Let us help! No request is too vague or too specific.
