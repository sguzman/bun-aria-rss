  "description": "<div>Lise Lotte-Lublin didn’t recall being sexually assaulted until 20 years after the fact while watching an interview with a famous model whose story seemed familiar. When she went to authorities only to learn nothing could be done, she decided to take the law into her own hands. She went on to change three sex crimes laws in her home state of Nevada, including the statute of limitations. She helped fellow survivors in other states do the same. And then, she testified before the man that she says attacked her all those years ago: Bill Cosby. </div>\n<div>\n<br>\nThis episode is part of a ten-part series called<em> Let The Women Do The Work</em>.
