  "description": "<p>As much as we may desire to live with eternal purpose and become more like Christ, some days we’re doing well just to keep the diapers changed—much less figure out how we can change. In this episode, Emily and Laura get practical about how we change into the image of Christ. Drawing from David Powlison’s book, <em>How Does Sanctification Work?</em>, they unpack five things that contribute to our growth in godliness. God is changing us and using our lives for something that matters as we live faithfully from one moment (or diaper change) to the next.</p> <p><em>We’re grateful to Christian Standard Bible, a Bible translation for everyone, for making this week’s show possible.
