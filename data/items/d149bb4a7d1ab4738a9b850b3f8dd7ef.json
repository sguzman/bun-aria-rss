  "description": "<p>We present a novel method in this work to address the problem of\nmulti-vehicle conflict resolution in highly constrained spaces. A high-fidelity\noptimal control problem is formulated to incorporate nonlinear, non-holonomic\nvehicle dynamics and exact collision avoidance constraints. Despite being\nhigh-dimensional and non-convex, we can obtain an optimal solution by learning\nconfiguration strategies with reinforcement learning (RL) in a simplified\ndiscrete environment and approaching high-quality initial guesses\nprogressively. The simulation results show that our method can explore\nefficient actions to resolve conflicts in confined space and generate dexterous\nmaneuvers that are both collision-free and kinematically feasible.\n</p>",
