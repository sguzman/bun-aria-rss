  "description": "As reports have come in of Russia escalating its attacks on American democracy, our President has hopped into action escalating his war against the people who are protecting us from the Russians.  Trump has begun a campaign of stripping security clearances from America's most experience national security officials in an effort to punish them for disloyalty.  Our experts, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Ed Luce of the Financial Times, discuss which of the effects of this misguided policy will be worse--chilling free expression, alienating the security community, reducing the expertise available to the government or just ushering in more authoritarianism.  But don't worry.  You don't have to choose.  All will be bad.  Also: we discuss the president's lawyers and why they may mean he needs more lawyers.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
