  "description": "<p>First, we derive expression of the Chern sectional curvature of a Hermitian\nmanifold in local complex coordinates. As an application, we find that a\nHermitian metric is K\\\"ahler if the Riemann sectional curvature and the Chern\nsectional curvature coincide. Second, we prove that the sectional curvature\nrestricted to orthogonal 2-planes of a G-K\\\"ahler-like manifold with\nnon-negative (resp. non-positive) sectional curvature can take its maximum\n(resp. minimum) at a holomorphic plane section. And we also prove that the\nholomorphic bisectional curvature of a K\\\"ahler-like manifold with non-negative\n(resp. non-positive) Chern sectional curvature can take its maximum (resp.\nminimum) at the holomorphic sectional curvature.\n</p>",
