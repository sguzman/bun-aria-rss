  "title": "103 - The Public Suicide of Budd Dwyer and the Tragic Events That Led Up To It",
  "description": "<p>On January 22nd, 1987, forty-seven year-old R. Budd Dwyer, Republican State Treasurer of Pennsylvania, held a press conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to address his recent conviction on eleven counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in the aid of racketeering. The married father of two faced up to fifty-five years in prison and a $300,000 fine. He was scheduled to be sentenced the very next day, January 23rd, by a judge who he knew intended to make an example of him to deter other politicians from taking bribes in the future. The journalists gathered expected Budd to resign from his office. Instead, he took out a .357 magnum, put the gun in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and resigned from life.
