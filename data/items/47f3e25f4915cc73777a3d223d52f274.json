  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages? Across two nights, Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week present a program of electronic music genealogies, featuring artists whose works span the 1970s to today and represent multiple generations of Melbourne’s experimental scene.\n\nTodd Anderson-Kunert is an artist working with sound to explore themes of psychological and emotional human existence. His work attempts to communicate emotions, experiences, and situations that words can often fail to describe. Ahead of his performance for Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week Todd discusses the freedom and creative limitations that mono-synthesis allows, the possibilities for spatial and temporal emotional responses through live performance, and his documentary, A Conversational Exploration of Sonic Practice, that reveals the immense learning that emerges from community conversations. \n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/liquid-architecture-x-melbourne-music-week\n\nRitual Community Music \n10 - 11 December 2021\nMiscellania, Melbourne\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and Melbourne Music Week\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
