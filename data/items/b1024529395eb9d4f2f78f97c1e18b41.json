  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Timehop has released more information as its breach investigation proceeds. The case will be interesting as an indicator of what GDPR enforcement will look like. Two speculative execution side-channel attacks are described (in the lab, but not yet, it's believed, in the wild). The US Senate's flesh creeps over bug disclosure practices. Someone uses a Netgear exploit to get some US technical manuals. Twitter goes to work against bogus accounts. Mike Benjamin from CenturyLink on cryptojacking. Guest is Yaniv Avidan from MinerEye on cloud GDPR compliance.",
