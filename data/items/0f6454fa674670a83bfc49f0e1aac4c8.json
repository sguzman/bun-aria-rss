  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Anthony Road Wine Company</a> is a legend in the Finger Lakes Region of<br /> New York. It’s one of the pioneering wineries of the area, and it makes wines that reflect the soils and climate of the Finger Lakes. Their wines are made from grapes grown in vineyards owned or managed by the Martini Family and carefully selected by Peter Becraft, the head winemaker. <a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthony Road</a> is a family run, family owned, and family operated winery that makes outstanding Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, blends, and a variety of reds and rose, as well as some skin contact wines.</p> <p> <br />   </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">This week I speak with Peter Becraft, a man of many talents. He <a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/PeterBecraft.jpg\" alt= \"\" width=\"217\" height=\"217\" /></a>started out his career as a Fine Arts Masters student, working as a casting director for a famed fashion photographer in Manhattan. As with many of our generation, Peter found himself at a crossroad after September 11, 2001. He realized he needed to do something more fulfilling with his life. Previously finding more common ground and excitement in the folks his pastry chef wife Cary hung out with, he pursued a wine shop job in lower Manhattan and immersed himself in the world of wine. Today, he is the head winemaker at the iconic <a href= \"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Anthony Road Wine Company</a> in the Finger Lakes on Seneca Lake.</p> <p> </p> <p> Here are the show notes: </p> <ul> <li>Peter tells us how <a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John and Ann Martini</a> moved from Baltimore in<a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/JohnAndAnnMartini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"149\" height=\"149\" /></a> 1973 and set up their farm. He gives us a great lesson on the history of Finger Lakes – what it was like when the Martinis came, and how things have evolved over the last 45 years.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We learn about the role of hybrid grapes and why they are different from and similar to the grapes we know and love (vitis vinifera)</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Peter tells us about the climate and the differences between the Martini Family Vineyard and the Nutt Road Vineyard and why microclimate is so essential to winemaking In the Finger Lakes. Peter gets into really nerdy detail, including glacial movement, silt-loam soils, and how the depth and width of Seneca Lake influences the vineyards</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Peter then shares his incredible journey from sculptor to<a href=\"https://anthonyroadwine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/P1011667-500x333-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\" /></a> winemaker.
