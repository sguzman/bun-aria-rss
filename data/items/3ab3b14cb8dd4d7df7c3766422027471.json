  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, radio host Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. While hair salons have been closed in San Francisco, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been caught going to a shut-down hair salon without a mask covering her mouth or nose. In fact, Pelosi's assistant may have booked the private appointment in the shuttered salon despite salon's not being allowed to open for any indoor services. The owner of the salon was offended that Pelosi and her independent stylist would take advantage of the salon during the pandemic. Then, CNN is reporting that people who consume conservative media, including conservative talk radio, are less likely to wear masks and portray such viewers as a danger to society. Later, in a poor attempt at satire, a Starbucks employee made a viral video of how to make a Blue Lives Matter drink which included bleach, the \"blood\" of innocent Black men. Afterward, football players are idolizing an alleged rapist with stickers of Jacob Blake's name on their helmets.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
