  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part Seven: Gotta Have Faith, Faith, Faith. </strong></em>Today, Mike and a very sick Tim continue the conversation on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: \"For it is by <strong>grace</strong> you have been <strong>saved</strong>, through <strong>faith</strong>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by <strong>works</strong>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” Previously, they established salvation as 'an embodied participation in the new heavens and new earth.' Today, the focus is on <strong>faith</strong>. How does it differ, scripturally, from the understanding most of us grew up with?</p>\n<p><strong>What Faith is not:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Not the opposite of evidence assessment</li>\n <li>Not a leap in the dark</li>\n  <li>Not the opposite of works</li>\n  <li>Not optimism or a positive mindset that makes us passive</li>\n  <li>Not a profession of Faith</li>\n  <li>Not good theology</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is faith? Faith has these three elements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Mental affirmation/intellectual agreement: certain enough to yield</li>\n  <li>Professed fealty to Jesus as Lord</li>\n  <li>Enacted loyalty to the king, as in the obedience of faith</li>\n  <li>Faith as Allegiance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
