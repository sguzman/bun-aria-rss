  "description": "As a prominent author, TV host and all-round science guy. Neil De Tyson in this book explores the inner workings of our universe from tricky topics such as dark matter to delving deeper into Einstein’s theories of relativity and how his work continues to shape modern science. As a fan of Tyson’s work, I believe this is the perfect book for those who want to know a little more about how our universe came into existence from a physics perspective. The book has a perfect mix between introducing new concepts whilst also expanding on generally known concepts such as Newton’s law. As the reader, you are able appreciate how  Tyson explains a complex topic in such a vivid way. This is a book for everyone who is interested about our universe whether you’re a beginner or an expert this book has something for you. A highly recommended 5 stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
