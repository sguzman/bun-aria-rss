  "description": "<p>When you watch kids create something, it's like watching an artist who is given complete permission to explore, experiment, and express.&nbsp;There's no sense of censorship or fear of judgment...at least not until we're a bit older.</p><br><p>Working with your hands just plain does something to you. It drops you into a place of pure creativity and consciousness. You become the process, you get lost in it. And that sensation is pure bliss.</p><p>But, as we get older, we tend to go to that place less and less. We leave our artist maker side behind. And, in doing so, leave a part of us behind as well.</p><br><p>This week's Good Life Project Riff shares a story and an invitation. To reconnect with your soul through your hands.&nbsp;Jonathan offers up a near-tactile story about how, with no workshop and a modest NYC apartment, he started building tables as a way to not only express his jones to \"make,\" but also reconnect with that primal experience of pure creative consciousness.</p><br><p>And, in case you're interested, here is one of the finished products, a little 150-pound table known as the Concrete Behemoth.
