  "description": "The first interview today, <em>Build Your House Around My Body</em>, is by debut novelist Violet Kupersmith and it's about a young Vietnamese woman who disappears; ghosts are involved. She told NPR's Ari Shapiro that she was \"attracted to the ghost as a way of getting revenge.\" The second novel is also about a young woman's disappearance, this time in Haiti. Award winning author Edwidge Danticat's <em>Claire of The Sea Light</em> involves the sea instead of ghosts, though. Danticat told NPR's Rachel Martin that the sea is very important in Haitian Creole.",
