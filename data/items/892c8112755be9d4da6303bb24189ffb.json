  "description": "<p>Football is back and so is Mark Davis who dominated wings in everyone's face in Canton (00:00:49-00:04:44). We have a fake technical issue and then talk Vin Scully and Billy got dunked on playing pickup basketball (00:04:44-00:25:18). Comedian Stavros Halkias joins the show to break down the 2022 NFL Season based purely on how well the quarterbacks and coaches of each team fuck (00:25:18-01:21:27), we then do Mt Rushmore of breakups (01:21:27-01:45:46). We finish with Fyre Fest of the week (01:45:46-02:04:34:04).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
