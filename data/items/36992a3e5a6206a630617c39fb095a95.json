  "description": "Tom Bilyeu and Cindy (@essenceofcin) answer questions from the Impact Theory community. A few questions that get answered are:  Who is the one mentor you would spend a day with to grow yourself? As a creative, how do you turn off your brain at night and go to sleep? Why are we always talking about \"Phase 1 - Build a community\"? What's phase 2? Where are we headed? How do leaders in the philanthropic space push through all the current noise in media today...how do these leaders get their story out there? Currently Mel Robbins' episode is already around 300,000+ views (5x) the amount of next highest. What do you think has attributed to the results of that episode in particular? Do those same learnings guide how you choose to structure future episodes? How did you create your morning routine? Did you slowly implicate working out then meditation and eventually setting goals (not that certain order), or did you jump with both feet and just make it happen? And more...  Tom Bilyeu is the co-founder of 2014 Inc. 500 company Quest Nutrition — a unicorn startup valued at over $1 billion — and the co-founder and host of Impact Theory. Impact Theory is a first-of-its-kind company designed to facilitate global change through the incubation of mission-based businesses and the cultivation of empowering content. Every piece of content Impact Theory creates is meant to underscore the company mission to free people from The Matrix and help them unlock their true potential. Impact Theory exists to inspire the next generation of game-changing companies and creators that will make a true and lasting impact on the world.
