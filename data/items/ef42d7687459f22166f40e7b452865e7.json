  "description": "<p>We’ve all heard about the minimalist lifestyle- maybe you’re picturing a bearded hipster drinking coffee in his perfectly white dining room or an Instagram worthy, perfectly styled modern kitchen. It turns out that’s <em>not</em> what minimalism is all about- it’s about priorities. Also, we’ve all been spending more time in our homes than we’d probably like to be, and all that clutter might be getting to you. Here to talk with us today about minimalist living is Joshua Becker. While beginning the process of removing possessions from his life, Joshua started the site Becoming Minimalist and has written several fantastic books over the years including The More of Less and The Minimalist Home. Not only can a minimalist approach to life allow us to spend less & save/invest more, but it can have a positive impact in lots of areas of our life.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an I Feel It All by Monday Night Brewing!
