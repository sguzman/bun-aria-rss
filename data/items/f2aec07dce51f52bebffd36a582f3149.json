By 2003, she had to start using a wheelchair because of the progression of this disease. Conventional medical treatments were failing her, and she feared that she would be bedridden for the rest of her life.</p><br><p>Dr. Wahls began studying the latest research on autoimmune disease and brain biology and decided to get her vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids from the food she ate rather than pills and supplements. To do this, she adopted the nutrient-rich Paleo diet, gradually refining and integrating it into a regimen of neuromuscular stimulation. She went from almost being bedridden to completing an 18-mile bicycle tour.</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman sat down with Dr. Wahls to discuss the types of plant foods, proteins, and fats that Dr. Wahls incorporates into her daily diet as well as the supplements she recommends. They also explore the lifestyle changes that she made including meditation, stress reduction, movement, and much more.</p><br><p>Dr. Terry Wahls is a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Iowa. She is the author of <em>The Wahls Protocol: How I Beat Progressive MS Using Paleo Principles and Functional Medicine</em> and the cookbook <em>The Wahls Protocol Cooking for Life: The Revolutionary Modern Paleo Plan to Treat All Chronic Autoimmune Conditions</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
