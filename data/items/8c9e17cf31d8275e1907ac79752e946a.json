And these factors tend to lend themselves to tales of hauntings. There are a couple of fairly well-known \"urban legends\" concerning Grand Rapids and its haunted history. The first comes from the St. Cecilia Music Center and the second is known as the legend of the\"Ada Witch.\" Come with us as we explore the history and hauntings of these. Moment in Oddity features a court declaring a house haunted and This Day in History features the beginning of Prohibition.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-98-st-cecilia-music.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-98-st-cecilia-music.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
