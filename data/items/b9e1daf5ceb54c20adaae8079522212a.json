  "description": "It all started with 27 bees dive-bombing Si Robertson's backside, but that's not his only buzzworthy tale. Godwin is back with a Christmas tree-eating contest, reindeer games, his best bull-riding story, and what happened when he didn't buy his wife a Christmas gift. Martin remembers his first Christmas with the Robertsons. John-David gives Si his very first Christmas Tree Cake. Si has a theory that Kiss isn't really a rock band and offers a brutally honest review of \"Ted.\" The boys get into favorite Christmas songs and movies, gag gifts, a present as soft as mashed potatoes, and what you never knew about Godwin. And it's time to settle the two great Christmas debates of our time: Real trees or fake? And colored lights or white?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
