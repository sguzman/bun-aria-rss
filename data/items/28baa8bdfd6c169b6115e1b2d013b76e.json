  "description": "When Thandie Newton took the part of Maeve on Westworld, she had no idea the character would wind up being a perfect metaphor for her life. As Thandie tells Marc, she didn’t really understand her outsider status as a mixed-race young person in England until much later in life. That confusion created an identity issue where she spent many years without knowing who she really was. Thandie talks about how she turned that corner, how her friendship with Eve Ensler changed her life, and how speaking out about sexual abuse in Hollywood damaged her career before there was widespread awareness about the need for change. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://stitcherpremium.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher Premium</a>, The Climb from Sony Pictures Classics, and <a href=\"http://capterra.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capterra</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
