  "description": "This week’s show is a little different. For one thing, it’s just me today. And for another, I introduce a new format coming to Wall Street Unplugged. Today, I give you a glimpse into the future of the show... And stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks. [INTRO] You can get a great read on the economy by paying attention to your surroundings. I kick things off by sharing a lot of new ideas sparked by my boots-on-the-ground research. [3:00] I also explain why some companies are losing customers due to COVID restrictions. [29:30] Finally, I share whether I’m still bullish on gold after the recent selloff… and how to handle a massive winner in your portfolio.
