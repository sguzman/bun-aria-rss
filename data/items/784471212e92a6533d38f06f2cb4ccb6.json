  "description": "<p>The last two years have been a rollercoaster for <strong>Alex Shuford</strong>. His company—Rock House Farm, a group of furniture brands ranging from Century to Highland House to Hickory Chair—went from losing eighty percent of its business at the outbreak of COVID to a boom that has seen it struggle to keep up with demand. At the moment, catching up with his own backorders is the biggest thing on Shuford’s plate, but he also has his finger on the pulse of the broader furniture industry too. In this episode of the podcast, Shuford chats with host Dennis Scully about when we can expect the lead time crisis to finally calm down, whether the pandemic will cure the industry’s addiction to new product, and why interior designers will determine who wins the war for the future of furniture. </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"www.thebrunoeffect.com\">The Bruno Effect</a> and <a href=\"https://www.worldcoppersmith.com/\">Coppersmith</a>. </p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"http://www.rockhousefarm.com/\"><strong>Rock House Farm </strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.dennisscully.com\">Dennis Scully</a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\">Business of Home</a></p>\n",
