  "description": "Well, Week 7 of Thursday Night Football could feature a future division winner. So we have that going for us. But Giants-Eagles also offers a prime opportunity to make some money. Will Brinson is joined by R.J. White to break down this NFC East matchup from a gambling perspective. Carson Wentz has struggled overall against the spread, but he can't lose on TNF. His head coach Doug Pederson has a pretty good track record on Thursdays as well. Will that hold tonight? The Eagles are banged up but there might be some value in player props. For the Giants, R.J. is expecting a good performance from Evan Engram.
