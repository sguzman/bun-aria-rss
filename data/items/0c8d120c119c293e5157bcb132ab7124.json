After recovering from the only known case of COVID hemorrhoids, she is fresh out of acute posterior rehab and ready to talk about Katya's placenta, her tragic deli-based skull injuries as an infant, and the actual legal name she was given at birth. This episode is touching. It's confusing. It's kinda gross. In other words, it's a microcosm of genuine motherly love.\n\nFollow Trixie: @TrixieMattel\nFollow Katya: @Katya_Zamo\n\n\nTo listen to our podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/TBATBYT \n\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or by using this link: http://bit.ly/baldandthebeautifulpodcast\n\n\nIf you want to support the show, and get all the episodes ad-free go to https://thebaldandthebeautiful.supercast.com/\n\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
