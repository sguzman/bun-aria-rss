    "media:description": "I get it. Everyone wants to talk about EUV. It's the sexiest lithography around with all the mirrors and the purple UV light. \n\nBut I think we shouldn't discount 193 nanometer immersion lithography. Coming about in the early 2000s, it has taken the industry further than anyone could have ever expected. \n\n193i as it is sometimes called is still a workhorse and at the core of many leading edge process nodes. For this video, I want to look at how it works and the challenges overcome in developing it. \n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
