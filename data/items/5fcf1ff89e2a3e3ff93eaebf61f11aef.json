  "title": "Expectations and the Neutrality of Interest Rates",
  "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.johnhcochrane.com/research-all/inflation-neutrality\" target=\"_blank\">Expectations and the Neutrality of Interest Rates</a>&nbsp;is a new paper. It's an essay, really, expanding on a lunch talk I was privileged to give at the Minneapolis Fed <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/~/media/assets/events/economic-research-conferences/foundations-of-monetary-policy-agenda.pdf?la=en\" target=\"_blank\">\"Foundations of Monetary Policy\" conference</a>&nbsp;in honor of the 50th anniversary of Bob Lucas' 1972 \"Expectations and the Neutrality of Money.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Abstract:&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Lucas (1972) is the pathbreaking analysis of the neutrality and temporary non-neutrality of money. But our central banks set interest rate targets, and do not even pretend to control money supplies. How is inflation determined under an interest rate target?&nbsp;</p><p>We finally have a complete theory of inflation under interest rate targets, that mirrors the long-run neutrality and frictionless limit of monetary theory: Inflation can be stable and determinate under interest rate targets, including a k percent rule, i. e. a peg. The zero bound era is confirmatory evidence. Uncomfortably, long-run neutrality means that higher interest rates eventually produce higher inflation, other things (and fiscal policy in particular) constant.&nbsp;</p><p>With a Phillips curve, we have some non-neutrality as well: Higher nominal interest rates raise real rates and lower output. A good model in which higher interest rates temporarily lower inflation is a harder task. I exhibit one such model. It has the Lucas property that only unexpected interest rate rises can lower inflation. A better model, and empirical understanding, is as crucial to today's agenda as Lucas (1972) was in its day.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of this is contentious. The issues are crucial for policy: Can the Fed contain inflation without dramatically raising interest rates? Given the state of knowledge, a bit of humility is in order.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;The link also has slides, if you like those. In one slide, I managed to put together the 54 year project to (finally) produce a full theory of inflation under interest rate targets:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIWgofTBEpMcNgyEKNQ-CKNSUXTaLxkuTjx2hudGL58NC_ks-nel34jmGcMvV_6QN_1UWIh_otB20lr9TxvVryRxo5JVBK0O_e8KZ3Abrx3HtTDLOhdl7RDJT-A4Bkk_3loP33_tD0Wr0dflSHcMLS9nAEJqUBFtirwXZRigVCbgKkyifgeHv6KGg/s792/MN_slides.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"612\" data-original-width=\"792\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIWgofTBEpMcNgyEKNQ-CKNSUXTaLxkuTjx2hudGL58NC_ks-nel34jmGcMvV_6QN_1UWIh_otB20lr9TxvVryRxo5JVBK0O_e8KZ3Abrx3HtTDLOhdl7RDJT-A4Bkk_3loP33_tD0Wr0dflSHcMLS9nAEJqUBFtirwXZRigVCbgKkyifgeHv6KGg/w640-h494/MN_slides.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><p><br /></p><p></p>",
