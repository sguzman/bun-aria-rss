  "description": "Some inarguable facts: 1) summer is the hot season; 2) you need to drink more water; and 3) Lee Pace is symmetrically blessed. On this week's episode, we go deep on that last one! What is it about Lee we love so much? Is it his broad, broad shoulders, or his pleasing height? His deep, chest-warming voice? Or maybe it's his changeable face, which can transmit total menace or perfect sweetness, depending on the script? We talk about his varied career too— Wonderfalls, The Fall, Pushing Daisies, Halt and Catch Fire etc — all in an effort to pin down the source of his appeal. Plus: Fanfic Wars is a real scorching treat this week, so grab a fan along with your headphones and GET INTO IT.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
