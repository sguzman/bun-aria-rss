  "title": "PMS 2.0 240 - NXT, Ryan Clark, Field Yates, & Legend, AJ Hawk... HELL OF A SHOW ON A TUESDAY. Let's Gooo",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat recaps his incredible match from Saturday night with Adam Cole at NXT Takeover: XXX and all the memorable moments, how it's been something he's thought about for the last twenty years or so, and how sore his body is after the match. Joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, 12 Year NFL veteran and current ESPN NFL Analyst, Ryan Clark. Pat and Ryan chat about everything going on with the Earl Thomas situation in Baltimore, why something doesn't seem right about it, how Ryan thinks Earl has been playing in a scheme that doesn't favor him in Baltimore, whether or not Ryan thinks Earl has lost a step, and he gives some interesting anecdotes about Ben Roethlisberger and why he isn't portrayed as elite in the eyes of the media (9:53-32:29). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk as Pat and AJ rehash Saturday night and have great of an experience it was for both of them, they chat more about the Earl Thomas situation, training camp fights and how common they are, Aaron Rodgers absolutely torching the defense at Packers camp, and AJ miserably attempts to dumb down and explain how to identify what the strong side is in certain defenses (34:11-1:15:48). Later, ESPN NFL Analyst Field Yates joins the program to cover everything going on in NFL training camp. Pat and Field chat about the financial ramifications of Earl Thomas getting released, where Field thinks he may wind up, whether or not Lamar Jackson's groin injury is cause for concern, and the issues with the 77 false positive tests coming from the lab in New Jersey, and how the NFL is preparing to remedy that situation (1:15:50-1:35:22). Pat and the boys also take some time to shine a light on the NBA bubble and give props to breakout and rising star, Luka Doncic, after his absolutely insane OT game winner coming on top of a 40+ point triple double.
