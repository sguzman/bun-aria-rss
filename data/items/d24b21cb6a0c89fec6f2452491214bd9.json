  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the FBI has raided Mar-a-Lago the home of former President Donald J. Trump. It's unclear what the FBI is searching for and has never occurred before in US History. With the midterm elections 90 days away, the timing of this search warrant into Trump's vault stinks like a political vendetta from the Russia Hoax to impeaching him when he was already out of the office, to the illegal unprecedented January 6th committee, to this raid. Later, Washington Democrats voted 51-50, with Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote to push America into a depression approving an $800 spending bill falsely named the \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" All whilst nation faces the highest inflation in 40 years. The left within the media are trying to position $4.00/gallon gas prices and Red states voting on state abortion laws as a win for Biden. Then, Democrats have introduced a new 15% tax on corporations which will cause companies to cut jobs to pay the higher tax. What America needs is to slash taxes and control government spending not increase deficit spending. Afterward, US Sen. Tim Scott joins the show to discuss his new book \"America, a Redemption Story: Choosing Hope, Creating Unity.\" Scott shared how shocked he was that the FBI raided the home of a former President over presidential records pertaining to the Federal Records Act. Scott added that FBI Director Wray's answers to recent questions by the Senate Judiciary Committee was dumbfounding. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
