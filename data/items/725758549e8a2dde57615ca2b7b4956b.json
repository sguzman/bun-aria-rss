  "description": "On each episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, we know that Maia digs into different history facts that happened on that specific day. But for today’s episode, let's just say that we are literally digging in. Back in 2010, 33 men experienced something like we are experiencing now: isolation. However, their isolation looked a little different than ours. Where we are stuck in our homes, these 33 men were stuck in a cave 2,300 feet underground with no way to communicate with the outside world. Yikes! You will not want to miss this episode of finding out what happened to these men and also hearing from our special guest Sizzy Rocket! Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
