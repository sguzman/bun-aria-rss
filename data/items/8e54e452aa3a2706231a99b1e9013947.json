  "description": "<p><span data-offset-key=\"7974j-0-0\">The House of the Seven Gables is a gothic novel written by Nathaniel Hawthorne featuring a real home in Salem, Massachusetts that he knew well. The story has ghosts as some of the characters and that seems true to life as well since there are many people who claim that the home is haunted. Join me as we explore the beliefs of Nathaniel Hawthorne and the history and hauntings of The House of the Seven Gables! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Kim Gasiorowski and features three cages on St. Lamberti Church spire and This Month in History features Unabomber killing first victim. Our location was suggested by Nicole Cardarelli.</span></p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/12/ep-287-house-of-seven-gables.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/12/ep-287-house-of-seven-gables.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Eulogies by Mort music is Long Time Gone by 5 Alarm Music on Drones & Beyond album.</p> <p>Lost in the Witch's Woods by Valeriy Antonyuk on the Comic Cavalcade album.</p>",
