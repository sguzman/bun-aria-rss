  "description": "Taste is one of our most subjective of the five senses. A flavor that elicits delight in one individual may evoke strong disgust in another. And while we all have a basic understanding of flavor, we rarely think about the other sonic factors that may be affecting how we interpret different tastes. In this episode, we consider the relationship between sound and taste, and the power certain sounds can have over our taste buds. Featuring Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University. \nTwenty Thousand Hertz is hosted by Dallas Taylor and produced out of the studios of Defacto Sound. \nConsider supporting the show at donate.20k.org \nEpisode transcript, music, and credits can be found here: https://www.20k.org/episodes/sonicseasoning\nLearn more about your ad choices.
