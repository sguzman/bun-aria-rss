  "description": "Hour 1Pat and Stu wonder if they’ll be able to trust the GOP and President Trump not to back down on “red flag laws.\" The Democrats haven’t learned a single thing over the past two years, and it could well cost them the 2020 election. The president said he would rather take firearms first and go through due process second, but he’ll probably change his stance shortly. Only a small number of people with a diagnosed mental illness are more likely to commit acts of violence. MSNBC and CNN are even more unhinged than usual, from an outlandish claim about today’s date and neo-Nazis to baiting the NRA into attending a pro-gun control spectacle. It's super easy for an organization to take credit for a boycott taking a host off the air (even if they're merely on vacation).Hour 2The convention of Democratic Socialists wasn’t cringeworthy for the socialism as much as for the over-sensitivity of those in attendance. Some Millennials make great employees, but some leave something significant to be desired. Pat and Stu have a good laugh (and maybe a cry) over a twenty-something employee who was incredibly offended by being told that there is no \"p\" in “hamster.” Even Democrats are urging the president not to support “red flag laws,\" though for nefarious reasons. A Harvard professor takes on Sen. Ted Cruz over tech giants manipulating voters during the 2016 campaign.Hour 3Why have the Democrats completely abandoned the (very electable) pro-life and pro-gun rights positions? Simple anti-gun measures like universal background checks poll well, and you don’t need to fight hard for them. Chris Cuomo’s CNN rant continued with him simply saying that it was dumb not to adopt his stance on gun control. The Democrats are running an entire campaign on a lot of the things that were included in the suspected El Paso killer’s manifesto. Some Republicans are going so far as to support a ban on “military-style weapons.” Jeff Fisher joins the program to chew the fat. Here’s your reminder that Colin Kaepernick is not out of the NFL because of his political stance; he’s unemployed because he’s a lousy quarterback. Artificial diamonds? Great. Artificial burgers? Almost great. Stu provides the latest update on the Democratic field.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
