  "description": "<p>I mentioned this guest in <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep411-river-monster-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EP:411 River Monster Investigation</a>. I first heard bits and pieces of this encounter from the Cryptid Brothers Investigation. I think Lance and the guys do a great job.</p> <p>Two cousins who were fishing when the creature started throwing rocks. The witnesses thought it was a person throwing rocks until they ran into the creature. The Bigfoot attack them. This encounter has many bizarre twists and turns during the attack, but even more, the massive military and Federal Cover-up that followed, and that is still going-on.</p> <p>Tonight I bring one of the witnesses of that encounter onto the show. I was surprised by how many details the witnesses could recount. We will walk through the encounter - including the attack, what happened with law enforcement, and hospital records that seem to vanish into thin air...</p>",
