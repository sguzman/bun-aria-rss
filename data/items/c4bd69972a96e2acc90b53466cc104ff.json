  "description": "<p>The mask debate has become highly politicized and fueled by emotion. But instead, what if we approached life with logic, science, and reason? On this episode of the Model Health Show, my mission is to provide you with the tools you need to evaluate scientific studies and prepare yourself to shut down the cognitive biases that we all hold.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>We’re digging into the studies on mask efficacy, preventing infection, and health outcomes in the US. You’ll learn about different types of masks and how they perform in scientific studies, plus how to actually understand the results of the data. This episode also contains real ways you can protect your family and your community during a public health crisis.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>I hope this information inspires you to always approach life with a sense of curiosity and to stand up for logic and rationality.
