  "description": "Author Bernardine Evaristo wrote the Booker prize winning novel <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em>. But before she did, like way before, she was incredibly unsure of herself or how she - as someone with a Black father and white mother - fit into her mostly white town. Even still, Evaristo always knew she had something important to say. She lays out those early struggles and how she overcame them in her new memoir, <em>Manifesto: On Never Giving Up</em>. Evaristo told NPR's Michel Martin that she has always been a private person but sharing so many of her secrets for the reader was very liberating.",
