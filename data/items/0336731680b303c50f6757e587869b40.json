  "title": "Ep. 90 - We Need To Reclaim Sexual Morality",
  "description": "Our culture did away with the concept of sexual morality and now we have no way of dealing with, or even describing, all of the sexually immoral behavior we see around us. We lump it all together under the umbrella of 'rape' and 'abuse' because consent is the one remaining moral rule governing our sex lives. We say that sex is only immoral if it lacks consent, but this is false and confusing. A properly ordered sex life requires a lot more than just consent.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
