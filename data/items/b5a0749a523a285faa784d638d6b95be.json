  "description": "For us at BA, we're all working from home for the foreseeable future, due the current COVID-19 situation. So this week, Adam and Carla check in with each other remotely and chat about how they're stocking their kitchens and what they're cooking. (We'll be doing this with a different editor each week as the news evolves.) After that, Carla is in the studio for a segment we recorded a few weeks back with Pamela Adlon, the creator, director, and star of \"Better Things.\" Now would be a very good time to watch her TV show.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
