  "description": "For the past two weeks, our series on summer music festivals has uncovered the interplay of festival fashion and music and examined festival subcultures. But we've so far overlooked an essential reason that people attend music festivals: to experience transformational joy.\n\nAt the start of summer 2021 it seemed like the pandemic was waning and that live music was coming back. But now, heading into the fall with the Delta variant, the fate of live music is once again in question. Caught in this limbo, we thought it might be a good time to get nostalgic and reflect on joyous music festival moments as we hope for more live music in the future. \n\nThis week's episode features seven stories from listeners about their most surprising and wonderful moments at festivals past. The first story comes from musician and producer Dave Harrington of the band Darkside, who was once helped out of a musical rut by a Phish festival set\n\nSongs\nPhish (live Aug 4, 2017) - Everything In Its Right Place, Axis Bold As Love, Prince Caspian\nDarkside - Only Young\nMusic scored by Zach Tenorio of Arc Iris\nLearn more about your ad choices.
