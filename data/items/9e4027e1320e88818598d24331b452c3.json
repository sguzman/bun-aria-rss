  "description": "Christian Minimalism: Simple Steps for Abundant Living (Morehouse, 2021), written by Becca Ehrlich was published in 2021 by Morehouse Publishing Inc. In this practical and scripturally based book, Ehrlich not only gives practical ways to simplify, but she leads her readers through the Bible to show us how Christianity calls us to minimalism.\nFocus on what matters most—and intentionally remove the rest.\nLogically, we all know our purpose in life is not wrapped up in accumulating possessions, wealth, power, and prestige—Jesus is very clear about that—but society tells us otherwise. Christian Minimalism attempts to cut through our assumptions and society’s lies about what life should look like and invites readers into a life that Jesus calls us to live: one lived intentionally, free of physical, spiritual, and emotional clutter.\n\nWritten by a woman who simplified her own life and practices these principles daily, this book gives readers a fresh perspective on how to live out God’s grace for us in new and exciting ways and live out our faith in a way that is deeply satisfying.\nMeg Gambino is an artist and activist currently working as the Director of Outreach for an addiction recovery center. Her life mission is to creatively empower others by modeling reconciliation between communities of people and people on the margins.
