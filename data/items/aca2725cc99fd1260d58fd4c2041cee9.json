  "description": "<p>Dewers! My #HoneyDew this week is Jeremiah Watkins! I’ve know Jeremiah for a while and I had no idea he was a skin cancer survivor, mostly because he kept it quiet. Jeremiah opens up about that scary situation and a lot more! He was a late bloomer to the self-love game and tells us all about his delayed discovery and shares some cringy audition stories. But when they put him on the B Squad basketball team in middle school, he showed them what was up and let them hear about every day! Don’t forget to subscribe, download & review! And get those moles checked!<br /> <a href=\"theHoneyDewpodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">theHoneyDewpodcast.com</a></p>",
