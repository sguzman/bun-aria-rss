  "description": "<p>For any new homesteader, the mountain of tasks and to-do's can seem overwhelming.  Even a more experienced homesteader such as myself tend to have several projects in motion at once and about a hundred others waiting to be started.  While it'd be great to snap our fingers and have everything done at once, that's simply not realistic.  On today's episode, I'm joined by my sister Jenna as she continues to build her homestead.  We break down her goals, talk through short term and long term plans, and discuss how to chunk down goals into actionable steps.  If you've ever found yourself stuck and not accomplishing those lofty goals you set for your homestead, this episode is the perfect guide to jumpstart your productivity.</p><p>I am so thrilled to have Mason Jars Marketplace as our July sponsor! I have been using their ReCap lids & mason jar accessories non-stop this year as I work on beefing up our pantry.  These lids come in a variety of styles-- flip top, pour spout, shaker inserts, and even sprayers and soap pumps. They’re the perfect way to reduce plastic waste and make your pantry more functional, all at the same time. Grab a 5-Piece Starter Set from Mason Jars Marketplace while they're at an introductory price-- and, bonus, you won't even pay shipping!
