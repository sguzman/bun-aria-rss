  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.mattbors.com/\">Matt Bors</a> is an independent political cartoonist. He's never had a staff job, and he's never drawn a banker holding bags of money where the banker is labeled \"BANKER\" and the bags of money have giant dollar signs on them. You've certainly seen Matt's work before, but you may not have known that he created it. You'll recognize his style when you visit his site. Matt joins me from Portland, Oregon, to talk about his whole career, with a special focus on the last year and a half.</p>\n<p>Find him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattbors\">@mattbors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://the-magazine.org/\">The Magazine</a>: a subscriber-supported electronic periodical for curious people with a technical bent.
