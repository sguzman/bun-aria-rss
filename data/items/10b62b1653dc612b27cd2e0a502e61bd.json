  "description": "Over the last two decades, the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) movement has transformed medical science, pushing doctors to rely less on intuition or \"common wisdom\" in choosing treatments, and more on evidence from studies. Sounds great -- but has EBM become a victim of its own success? This episode features John Ioannidis, Stanford professor of medicine, health and policy, and statistics, and author of the famous paper, \"Why Most Published Research Findings are False.\" John and Julia discuss how EBM has been \"hijacked,\" by whom, and what do do about it.",
