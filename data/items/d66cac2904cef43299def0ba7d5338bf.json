  "description": "How do race, ethnicity and appearance work on Latin America? Edward Telles‘ and the Project on Ethnicity and Race in Latin America‘s (PERLA) new book Pigmentocracies: Ethnicity, Race and Color in Latin America (UNC Press, 2014) shatters the idea that there is a single answer to that question, and proceeds instead with probing studies of four different countries: Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. A team of researchers working in each country conducted extensive surveys and interviews with hundreds of participants. The results are surprising in many ways and indicate dynamic changes in ideas about and performances of race as well as ongoing patterns of inequality and exclusion.How and why those occur in each place has to do with a complex combinations of legal regimes, socioeconomic measures, discursive histories, and the history of emancipatory movements. As the product of a research collective, this book will open new paths of inquiry in the midst of what seems to be a turn towards multiculturalism in many parts of Latin America.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
