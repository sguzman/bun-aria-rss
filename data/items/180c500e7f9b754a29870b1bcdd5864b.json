  "description": "<p>This week, we navigate a dark path of deception, thievery, drugs, and just plain vile murder. A man that ran from his problems, his whole life, including joining another country's military to outrun authorities, and creditors. And it only got worse from there, culminating in a horrific scene, in a Thai hotel room, followed by a manhunt, and an attempt at the death penalty. This story is so crazy that it has to span over 3 continents!!Grow up in a town that Ikea named furniture after, steal anything that isn't tied down, and try to survive a Thai prison with Kenneth Eriksson!!Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie WhismanDonate at...patreon.com/crimeinsportsCheck out or site: truecrimecomedyteam.comAll web support by Web and Writer webandwriter.com or Facebook.com/webandwriterContact us on...twitter.com/crimeinsportscrimeinsports@gmail.comfacebook.com/Crimeinsportsinstagram.com/crimeinsports</p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
