  "description": "We’re joined this week by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman of the wildly popular podcast Call Your Girlfriend. We giggle over Tunde Adebimpe, Peter Dinklage, and Stanley Tucci before we discuss Big Friendship: How We Keep Each Other Close, the book that looks at Ann and Aminatou’s friendship. This episode will make you laugh and think and hopefully, reach out to your friends for no reason at all. \nIn our Thirst Aid Kit Plus segment this week, we put the microscope to Nichole’s drabbles to find out why she keeps men on their knees so much! \nAs usual, you can follow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Our music is by Tanya Morgan. You can find show notes, and more on our Tumblr at thirstaidkitpodcast.tumblr.com. Don’t forget to send us your drabbles by emailing thirstaidkit@slate.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
