  "description": "<p>\"I REALIZED THE PATHWAY I WAS GOING THROUGH WAS SILENCING ME.<br />\nI've learned that greatness can come from anywhere, everywhere, or anyone. It all starts with a dream, a vision. Of course one of the secrets is never giving up, but the biggest one is that it needs to be yours.<br />\nYou need to know that your goals are your goals, not something pushed on you by someone else.<br />\nNo matter where you are in your life, or what obstacles appear in your way, you can achieve it. I believe this now more than ever after sitting down with our most recent guest, Tererai Trent.<br />\nTererai was born in Zimbabwe, was forced into marriage as a child, and even gave birth to 4 children by the time she was 18. She came from a place where education wasn't an opportunity given to women.<br />\nTererai ended up pushing through so many obstacles and now had a PhD - and that's just the beginning of her incredible accomplishments.<br />\nTererai was named by Oprah as her All-Time Favorite Guest and received a $1.5 million donation to rebuild her childhood elementary school in recognition of her tenacity and never-give-up attitude. With the firm belief that education is the pathway out of poverty and a desire to give back to her community, she founded Tererai Trent International.<br />\nEleven schools are being built in Zimbabwe and education has been improved for over 5,000 children so far. And this is only the beginning.<br />\nToday, Dr. Trent is invited to speak all over the world, to share her remarkable story and the valuable lessons she has learned along the way. She just came out with a new book all about empowering women to awaken to their full potential (she is the poster child of this). Her favorite motto is Tinogona, meaning, It is achievable!<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 596.<br />\nSome Questions I ask:<br />\nWhat interested you in agriculture?
