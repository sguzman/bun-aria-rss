  "description": "Our audiobook this week is FATED by Stephanie Rose! \n\nNarrated by Curt Bonnem and Kit Swann\n\nTime has passed, but the longing hasn’t. \n\nPatrick Miller cut off the only girl he’d ever loved, believing he had no other choice. More than a decade later, he’s never forgotten her. Now, he’s got a whole new life—but no room for love.\n\nArianna Cole loves her job and the children in the day care center she owns, but that’s the only love she’ll allow into her life—that she can allow.\n\nBut then the boy who was once her everything walks through the doors of her center.\n\nWith his son.\n\nPatrick broke her heart right after she’d handed it to him, and she can’t go back. Her yearning for him still smolders, but it’s trapped behind twelve years of hurt.\n\nAre Patrick and Arianna still in the wrong place at the wrong time, or are they fated?\n\n \n\nNO VACANCY by Stephanie Rose: https://amzn.to/38baXa4\n\nFINDING ME by Stephanie Rose: https://amzn.to/2UtCzmE\n\nGROWLING FOR MY MATE by Shaw Hart: https://amzn.to/39eiXqJ\n\nPreorder REBORN YESTERDAY by Tessa Bailey: https://amzn.to/2OwrKfV\n\nStephanie Rose GIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com\n\nALEXA RILEY BACKLIST BOOKS\n\nAR Website: https://bit.ly/38uN0dN\n\nEden Books: https://bit.ly/31YNaYA\n\niBooks: https://apple.co/2P75vxt\n\nKobo: https://bit.ly/39DacqB\nNook: https://bit.ly/38AP7wV\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
