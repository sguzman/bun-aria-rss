  "title": "Ten Lessons Learned from Building (real-life impactful) Machine Learning Systems",
  "content": "(This is a blogpost version of a talk I gave at <a href=\"http://mlconf.com/mlconf-sf/\">MLConf SF</a> 11/14/2014. See below for original video and slides)<br /><br />There are many good textbooks and courses where you can be introduced to  machine learning and maybe even learn some of the most intricate  details about a particular approach or algorithm (See <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-talks-lectures-related-to-big-data-algorithms-machine-learning/answer/Xavier-Amatriain\">my answer on Quora </a>on what are good resources for this). While understanding  that theory is a very important base and starting point, there are many  other practical issues related to building real-life ML systems that you  don’t usually hear about. In this post I will share some of the most  important lessons learned in years of building large-scale ML  solutions that power products such as Netflix and scale to millions of users  across many countries.<br /><br />And just in case it doesn't come across clearly enough, let me insist on this once again: it does pay off to be knowledgeable and have deep understanding of the techniques and theory behind classic and modern machine learning approaches. Understanding how Logistic Regression works or the difference between Factorization Machines and Tensor Factorization, for example, is a necessary starting point. However, this in itself might not be enough unless you couple it with the real-life experience of how these models interact with systems, data, and users in order to obtain a really valuable impact. The next ten lessons are my attempt at trying to capture some of that practical knowledge.<br /><br /><h2>1. More Data <strike>vs.</strike> and Better Models&nbsp;</h2>￼A lot has been written about whether the key to better results lays in improving your algorithms or simply on throwing more data at your problem (see <a href=\"http://technocalifornia.blogspot.com/2012/07/more-data-or-better-models.html\">my post</a> from 2012 discussing this same topic, for example).<br /><br />In the context of the <a href=\"http://www.netflixprize.com/\">Netflix Prize</a>, <a href=\"http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/anand-rajaraman.html\">Anand Rajaraman</a> took an early stand on the issue by claiming that \"more data usually beats better algorithms\". In <a href=\"http://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/2008/03/more-data-usual.html\">his post</a> he explained how some of his students had improved some of the existing results on the Netflix ratings dataset by adding metadata from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB</a>.<br /><br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"260\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-a151bd0c-0d4f-1450-e347-fce69844d204\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cLDPJ8z2wGz_cvgtbJBACyNh4T-f77_yh_Y82RWHdvQJqNKiSKzx3qxgkBIFsPYGtH7TA5pqdq8KKkY8qU36TvkzdUWZNTWHWKs70g98hrj_dhwqlsrwcxIfzTEX8iz1A34E\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"400\" /></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 1.</b> More data usually beats better algorithms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Although many teams in the competition tried to follow that lead and add extra features to improve results, there was little progress in that direction. As a matter of fact, just a year later some of the leaders of what would become the runner up team published <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1639731\">a paper</a> in which they showed that adding metadata had very little impact in improving the prediction accuracy of a well-tuned algorithm. Take this as a first example of why adding more data is not always the solution.<br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"258\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-a151bd2c-0d4f-7605-22fb-f3c291a9cf2c\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UdGUvRU2Hmux2zAiOzkmI9h4ZyXz4r5XW0A4_uthtk6XgcNpXttV6XVZGzcIqnXQqUIytY9BraFQqhL-px8aVpjT6HlihJVxaI2RWcJHoUhUSd7EBWw_ZE_ueCn6ojdKPDkb\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"400\" /></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 2.</b> Even a Few Ratings Are More Valuable than Metadata</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Of course, there are different ways to \"add more data\". In the example above we were adding data by increasing the number and types of features, therefore increasing the dimensionality of our problem space. We can think about adding data in a completely different way by fixing the space dimensionality and simply throwing more training examples at it. Banko and Brill <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1073017\">showed </a>in 2001 that in some cases very different algorithms responded equally well by improving to more training data (see figure below)<br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"315px;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-a151bd33-0d4f-d7b1-f28a-c49ef172952d\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OfMe_wqQCONpoNbBrOzJNARrhj5TDF5cqWNMy5w65O6Nb5SKodAcP3DdIGtAH_CqoBnTn023laHgQ6VZmWpak5bPvmzczef06vJ4HWPBMWZ1eAw-APLrJFqLP-2YK3D5DEjN\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"289px;\" /></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 3.</b> Banko and Brill's \"famous\" model performance curves&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Google's Research Director and renowned AI figure Peter Norvig is quoted as saying that \"Google does not have better algorithms, just more data\". In fact, Norvig is one of the co-authors of \"<a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/35179.pdf\">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data</a>\" where in a similar problem to the one in Banko and Brill (language understanding) they also show how important it is to have \"more data\".</div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"148px;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-a151bd33-0d4f-ff37-acb4-193a48b711f1\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3K9GF2qX97K0hAeu61Es0O3j6t-oTZgvfeMEQUu94g3UQUTQXH3Ed_SS_oqMHTkGH-Z0vLW8RfFboB9gYDGEm2ghjecI4qm_r-pXLVfOw7-pNP8s8K-gP84Jc6bwfWWZgD_l\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"371px;\" /></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 4.</b> The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div>So, is it true that more data in the form of more training examples will always help? Well, not really. The problems above are complex models with a huge number of features which lead to situations of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff\">high variance</a>\". But, in many other cases this might not be true. See below for example a real-case scenario of an algorithm in production at Netflix. In this case, adding more than 2 million training examples has very little to no effect.</div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"202\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-a151bd6a-0d50-23e0-fede-27877995569a\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iIRqH3yADGbKXS94ZIoy7P_ArXjc6BldQb3uFsfBGPxx84O4t9KYTl_6QGlfwJnyurSbCEn_E2J1ozDmJfggDOfmr-CroI_i_xF9TnSS1AZVFT1Nw74tt6n8ImCvBdYpQIKh\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"400\" /></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 5.</b> Testing Accuracy of a real-life production model</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"> </h2><div>So, this leads to our first lesson learned, which in fact will expand over several of the following ones: it is not about more data versus better algorithms. That is a false dichotomy. Sometimes you need more data, and sometimes you don't. Sometimes you might need to improve your algorithm and in others it will make no difference. Focusing exclusively on one or the other will lead to far from optimal results.</div><h2>2. You might not need all your \"Big Data\"</h2><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This second lesson is in fact a corollary of the previous one, but I feel it is worth to mention explicitly on its own. It seems like nowadays everyone needs to make use of all their \"Big Data\". Big Data is so hyped that it seems like if you are not using huge quantities of data you must be doing something wrong. The </span></span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">truth</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> though, as discussed in lesson 1, is that there are many problems for which you might be able to get similar results by using much less data than the one you have available.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Think for example of the Netflix Prize where you had 0.5 Million users in the dataset. In the most favored approach, the data was used to compute a Matrix of 50 factors. Would the result change much if instead of the 0.5 M users you used, say 50 Million? Probably not.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A related, and important, question is how do you determine what subset of your data to use. A good initial approach would be to random sample your original data to obtain as many samples you need for your model training. That might not be good enough though. Staying with the Netflix Prize example, users might be very different and not homogeneously distributed in our original population. New users, for example, will have much fewer ratings and increase sparsity in the dataset. On the other hand, they might have a different behavior from more tenured users and we might want to make our model capture it. The solution is to use some form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling\">stratified sampling</a>. Setting up a good stratified sampling scheme is not easy since it requires us to define the different strata, and decide what is the right combination of samples for the model to learn. However, as surprising as it might sound, a well-defined stratified sampled subset might accomplish even better results than the original complete dataset.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Just to be clear, I am not saying that having lots of data is a bad thing, of course it is not. The more data you have, the more choices you will be able to make on how to use it. All I am saying is that focusing on the \"size\" of your data versus the quality of the information in the data is a mistake. Garner the ability to use as much data as you can in your systems and then use only as much as you need to solve your problems.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><br /><h2>3. The fact that a more complex Model does not improve things does not mean you don't need one</h2><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Imagine the following scenario: </span><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">You have a linear model and for some time you have been selecting and optimizing features for that model. One day you decide to </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">try a </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">more complex</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> (e.g. non-linear) </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">model</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> with the same features you have been engineering. Most likely, you will </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">not</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> see any </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">improvement.</span><br /><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After that failure, you change your strategy and try to do the opposite: You keep the old model, but </span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">add </span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">more</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> expressive </span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">features that try to capture more complex interactions. Most likely the result will be the same and you will again see little to no improvements.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So, what is going on? The issue here is that simply put more complex features require a more complex model, and vice versa, a more complex model may require more complex features before showing any significant improvement.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span>So, the lesson learned is that you must improve both your model and your feature set in parallel. Doing only one of them at a time might lead to wrong conclusions.<br /><br /></div><h2>4. Be thoughtful about how you define your training/testing data sets</h2><div><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you are training a simple binary classifier, one of the first tasks to do is to define your positive and negative examples. Defining positive and negative labels for samples though may not be such a trivial task. Think about a use case where you need to define a classifier to distinguish between shows that users watch (positives) and do not watch (negatives). In that context, would the following be positives or negatives?</span><br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">User watches a movie to completion and rates it 1 star</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">User watches the same movie again (maybe because she can’t find anything else)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">User abandons movie after 5 minutes, or 15 minutes… or 1 hour</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">User abandons TV show after 2 episodes, or 10 episode… or 1 season</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;\">User adds something to her list but never watches it</span></li></ul><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As you can see, determining whether a given example is a positive or a negative is not so easy.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Besides paying attention to your positive and negative definition, there are many other things you need to make sure to get right when defining your training and testing datasets. One such issue is what we call <i>Time Travelling</i>. </span></span>Time traveling is defined as usage of features that originated after the event you are trying to predict. <span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">E.g. </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Your rating a movie is a pretty good prediction of you watching that movie, especially because most ratings happen AFTER you watch the movie.</span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></span>In simple cases as the example above this effect might seem obvious. However, things can get very tricky when you have many features that come from different sources and pipelines and relate to each other in non-obvious ways. </span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><i>Time traveling</i> has the effect of increasing model performance beyond what would seem reasonable. That is why whenever you see an offline experiment with huge wins, the first question you might want to ask yourself is: “Am I time traveling?”.</span></span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b10ab187-3d2a-e838-b4e4-bffc8cd4eb91\"></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And, remember, Time Traveling and positive/negative selection are just two examples of issues you might encounter when defining your training and testing datasets. Just make sure you are thoughtful about how you define all the details of your datasets.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><br /><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b10ab187-3d2a-e838-b4e4-bffc8cd4eb91\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b10ab18c-3d2b-58de-0f93-9fb017560787\"></span></span></div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b10ab187-3d2a-e838-b4e4-bffc8cd4eb91\"></span></div><h2>5.

Of course, what your algorithm decided to show is what it predicted was good for the user.&nbsp;Let's suppose that a new user comes in and we decide to show the user only popular items. The fact that a week later the user has only consumed popular items does not mean that's what the user like. That's the *only* thing she had a chance to consume!</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As many (<a href=\"http://technocalifornia.blogspot.com/2011/09/recommender-problem-presentation.html\">including myself</a>) have mentioned in the past, is important to take that into account in your algorithms and try to somehow break this \"Curse of the Presentation Bias\". Most approaches to addressing this issue are based on the idea that you should \"punish\" items that were showed to the user but not \"clicked on\".&nbsp;One way to do so is by implementing some presentation discounting mechanism (see <a href=\"http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~peil/papers/kdd2014.pdf\">this KDD 2014 paper</a> by the LinkedIn folks).&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Another way to address the issue is to use viewed but not clicked items as negatives in your training process. This, in principle, makes sense: if a user searched for a query and ended up clicking in result number three it means the first two results were bad and should be treated as negatives... or not? The problem with this is that although the first two items were likely worse than the third one (at least in that particular context), this does not mean they were any worse than item in position 4, let alone item in position 5000, which your original model decided was no good at all. Yes, you want to remove the presentation bias, but not all of it since it responds to some hopefully well-informed decisions your model took in the first place.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So, what can we do? First thing that comes to mind is to introduce some sort of randomization in the original results. This randomization should allow to collect unbiased user feedback so as to whether those items are good or not (see some of the early publications by Thorsten Joachims such as <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/publications/radlinski_joachims_06a.pdf\">this one</a> or take a look at the idea of <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/tdunning/which-algorithms-really-matter\">result dithering</a> proposed by Ted Dunning).</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Another better approach is to develop some sort of \"attention model\" of the user. In this case both clicked and non-clicked items will be weighted by the probability that the user noticed them in the first place depending on their location on the page (see <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=95PaR-QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">some of the recent work by Dmitry Lagun</a> for interesting ideas on this area.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finally, yet another and well established way to address presentation bias is by using some sort of explore/exploit approach, in particular multi-armed bandits. By using a method such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling\">Thompson Sampling</a>, you can introduce some form of \"randomization\" on the items that you are still not sure about, while still exploiting as much as you can from what you already know for sure (see Deepak Argawal's <a href=\"http://www.ueo-workshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/UEO-Deepak.pdf\">Explore/Exploit approach to recommendations</a>  or one of the many publications by <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/\">Thorsten Joashims</a> for more details on this).</span></span><br /><br /><h2>6.

On the one hand, the UI generates all the user feedback that we will use as input to our algorithms. On the other hand, the UI is the only place where our algorithms will be shown. It doesn't matter how smart our ML algorithm is. If the UI hides its results or does not give the user the ability to give some form of feedback, all our efforts on the modeling side will have been in vain.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Also, it is important to understand that a change in the user interface might require a change in the algorithms and vice versa.

Actually, as I write this I feel that it is a bit unfortunate that this lesson might seem as \"just another lesson\" hidden in position 7. This should be a good place to stress that these lessons in this post are not sorted from more to less important, they are just grouped in topics or themes.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So, yes, as important as all the other discussions about data, models, and infrastructure may be, they are all rather useless if you don't have the right evaluation approach in place. If you don't know how to measure an improvement you might be endlessly spinning your wheels without really getting anywhere. Some of the biggest gains I have seen in practice have indeed come from tuning the metrics to which models were being optimized.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Ok, then what is the \"right evaluation approach\"? Figure 8 illustrates an offline/online approach to innovation that should be a good starting point. Whatever the final goal of your machine learning algorithm is in your product you should think of driving your innovation in two distinct ways: offline and online.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTRWeZePLPE/VIqMIiZ60dI/AAAAAAAAA6k/UrX3q2EJhVA/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A32%3A32.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTRWeZePLPE/VIqMIiZ60dI/AAAAAAAAA6k/UrX3q2EJhVA/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A32%3A32.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 9.</b> Offline Evaluation</td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">First, you should generate datasets that allow to try different models and features in an offline fashion by following a traditional ML experimentation approach (see Figure 9): You train your model to a training seat, you probably optimize some (hyper)parameters to a validation set, and finally measure some evaluation metrics on a test set. The evaluation metrics in our context are likely to be IR metrics such as precision and recall, ROC curves, or ranking metrics such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain\">NDCG</a>, MRR, or FPC (Fraction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_pair\">Concordant Pairs</a>). Note though that the selection of the metric itself has its consequences. Take a look at Figure 10 for an example of how the different ranking metrics weight different ranks being evaluated. In that sense, metrics such as  MRR or (especially) NDCG will give much more importance to the head of the ranking, while FPC will be weighting more on the middle of the ranks. The key here is that depending on your application you should choose the right metric.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4XpWGVRI50M/VIqMNJty8TI/AAAAAAAAA6s/aaTzCltjMNY/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A32%3A48.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4XpWGVRI50M/VIqMNJty8TI/AAAAAAAAA6s/aaTzCltjMNY/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A32%3A48.png\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig. 10. </b>Importance given to different ranks by typical ranking metrics</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Offline experimentation is great because once you have the right data and the right metric it is fairly cheap to run many experiments with very few resources. Unfortunately, a successful offline experiment can only be generally used as an indication of a promising approach worth testing online. While most companies are investing in finding better correlation between offline and online results, this is still, generally speaking, an unsolved issue that deserves more research (see <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488215\">this KDD 2013 paper</a>, for example).  </span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">In online experimentation the most usual approach is to do A/B testing (other approaches such as <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en\">Multiarmed Bandit Testing</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/chapelle_etal_12a.pdf\">Interleaved Testing</a> are becoming more popular recently but are beyond the scope of this post). The goal of an A/B test is to measure difference in metrics across statistically identical populations that each experience a different algorithm. As with the offline evaluation process, and perhaps even more here, it is very important to choose the appropriate evaluation metric to make sure that most if not all decisions on the product are data driven.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Most people will have a number of different metrics they are tracking in any AB test, but it is important to clearly identify the so-called Overall Evaluation Criteria (OEC). This should be the ultimate metric used for product decisions. In order to avoid noise and make sure the OEC maps well to business success it is better to use a long-term metric (e.g. customer retention). Of course, the issue with that is that you need time, and therefore resources, to evaluate a long-term metric. That is why it is very useful to have short-term metrics that can be used as initial early reads on the tests in order to narrow down worthwhile hypothesis that need to wait until the OEC read is complete.</span><br /><br />If you want more details on the online experimentation piece there are many good reads, starting with the many good articles by Bing's Ronny Kohavi (see <a href=\"http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/2013%20controlledExperimentsAtScale.pdf\">this</a>, for example).</div><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-91e5a539-3d32-4035-9513-f42bed9adb25\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span></span></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><h2>8. Distributing algorithms? Yes, but at what level?</h2><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There always comes a time in the life of a Machine Learning practitioner when you feel the need to distribute your algorithm. Distributing algorithms that require of many resources is a natural thing to do. The issue to consider is at what *level* does it make sense to distribute.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">We distinguish three levels of distribution:</span></span><br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Level 1. For each independent subset of the overall data </span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Level 2. For every combination of the hyperparameters</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: inherit; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Level 3. For all partitions in each training dataset</span></li></ul><br />In the first level we may have subsets of the overall data for which we need to (or simply can) train an independently optimized model. A typical example of this situation is when we opt for training completely independent ML models for different regions in the world, different kinds of users, or different languages. In this case, all we need to do is to define completely independent training datasets. Training can then be fully distributed requiring no coordination or data communication.<br /><br />In the second level, we address the issue of how to train several models with different hyperparameter values in order to find the optimal model. Although there are smarter ways to do it, let's for now think of the worst-case grid search scenario. We can definitely train models with different values of the hyperparameters in a completely distributed fashion, but the process does require coordination. Some central location needs to gather results and decide on the next \"step\" to take. Level 2 requires data distribution, but not sharing since each node will use a complete replica of the original dataset and the communication will happen at the level of the parameters.<br /><br />Finally, in level 3 we address the issue of how to distribute or parallelize model training for a single combination of the hyperparameters. This is a hard problem, but there has been a lot of research put into it. There are different solutions with different pros and cons. You can distribute computation over different machines splitting examples or parameter using, for example, <a href=\"http://stanford.edu/~boyd/admm.html\">ADMM</a>. Recent solutions such as the <a href=\"http://parameterserver.org/\">Parameter Sever</a>&nbsp;promise to offer a generic solution to this problem. Another option is to parallelize on a single multicore machine using algorithms such as <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/hogwildTR.pdf\">Hogwild</a>. Or, you can use the massive array of cores available in GPU cards.<br /><br />As an example of the different approaches you can take to distribute each of the levels, take a look at <a href=\"http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/distributed-neural-networks-with-gpus.html\">what we did</a> in our distribution of Artificial Neural Networks over the AWS cloud (see Figure 11 below for an illustration). For Level 1 distribution, we simply used different machine instances over different AWS regions. For Level 2 we used different machine in the same region and a central node for coordination. We used Condor for cluster coordination (although other options such as StarCluster, Mesos, or even Spark) are possible. Finally, for level 3 optimization, we used highly optimized CUDA code on GPUs.<br /><div><span style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span></div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2e000fb4-3d33-e866-ae0f-47dcdd6ee409\"></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bV484RKiTAc/VIqMnegzc5I/AAAAAAAAA60/jYLfDo-GCro/s1600/DistributedANN-Final.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"267\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bV484RKiTAc/VIqMnegzc5I/AAAAAAAAA60/jYLfDo-GCro/s1600/DistributedANN-Final.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 11. </b>Distributing ANN over the AWS cloud</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2e000fb4-3d33-e866-ae0f-47dcdd6ee409\"></span></div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2e000fb4-3d33-e866-ae0f-47dcdd6ee409\"></span><br /><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2e000fb4-3d33-e866-ae0f-47dcdd6ee409\"><span style=\"color: #666666; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 32px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span></div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2e000fb4-3d33-e866-ae0f-47dcdd6ee409\"></span></div><h2>9. It pays off to be smart about your Hyperparameters</h2><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b7ec9469-3d35-8cb0-546e-5738b3abc26a\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As already mentioned in the previous lesson, one of the  important things you have to do when building your ML system is to tune your hyperparameters. Most, if not all, algorithms will have some hyperparameters that need to be tuned: learning rate in matrix factorization, regularization lambda in logistic regression, number of hidden layers in a neural network, shrinkage in gradient boosted decision trees... These are all parameters that need to be tuned to the validation data.</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Many times you will face situations in which models need to be periodically retrained and therefore hyperparameters need to be at least fine-tuned. This is a clear situation where you need to figure out a way to automatically select the best hyperparameters without requiring a manual check. As a matter of fact, having an automatic hyperparameter selection approach is worthwhile even if all you are doing is the initial experimentation. A fair approach is to try all possible combinations of hyperparameters and pick the one that maximizes a given accuracy metric on the validation set. While this is, generally speaking, a good idea, it might be problematic if implemented directly. The issue is that blindly taking the point that optimizes whatever metric does not take into account the possible noisiness in the process and the metric. In other words, we can't be sure that if point A has an accuracy that is only 1% better than point B, point A is a better operating point than B.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Take a look at Figure 12 below, which illustrates this issue by showing (made up) accuracy results for a model given different values of the regularization parameter. In this particular example the highest accuracy is for no regularization, plus there is a relatively flat plateau region for values of lambda between 0.1 and 100. Blindly taking a value of lambda of zero is generally a bad idea since it points to overfitting (yes, this could be checked by using the test dataset). But, beyond that, going to the \"flat region\", is it better to stick with the 0.1 value? By looking at the plot I would be inclined to take 100 as the operating point. This point is (a) non-zero, and (b) noise-level different in terms of accuracy from the other non-zero values. So, one possible rule of thumb to use is to keep the highest non-zero value that is noise level different in terms of the optimizing metric from the optimal point.</span><br /><br /></div><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span></div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MlCCRurPOMY/VIqM-_W_GNI/AAAAAAAAA68/Yba5QlkSNvM/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A36%3A34.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"401\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MlCCRurPOMY/VIqM-_W_GNI/AAAAAAAAA68/Yba5QlkSNvM/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2014-12-11%2B22%3A36%3A34.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 12. </b>Example of model accuracy vs. regularization lambda</td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I should also add that even though in this lesson I have dsf about using a brute-force grid search approach to hyperparameter optimization, there are much better things you can do which are again beyond the scope of this post.

In this last lesson I thought it was worth to focus on systems and architecture. When the final goal of your ML model is to have impact on a product, you are necessarily going to have to think about the right system architecture. </span><br /><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Figure 13 depicts a three level architecture that can be used as a </span><span style=\"line-height: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">blueprint for any machine learning system that is designed to have a customer impact. The basic idea is that it is important to have different layers in which to trade off latency vs. complexity. Some computations need to be as real-time as possible to quickly respond to user feedback and context. Those are better off in an online setting. On the other extreme, complex ML models that require large amounts of data and lengthy computations are better done in an offline fashion. Finally, there is a Nearline world where operations  are not guaranteed to happen in real-time but a best effort is performed to do them as \"soon as possible\".</span><br /><br /></div><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #666666; line-height: 1; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span></span></div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ab7QnWsT-GY/VIqNala6WgI/AAAAAAAAA7E/hragQzAHvLI/s1600/MachineLearningArchitecture-v3.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ab7QnWsT-GY/VIqNala6WgI/AAAAAAAAA7E/hragQzAHvLI/s1600/MachineLearningArchitecture-v3.jpg\" width=\"579\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Fig 13.</b> This three level architecture can be used as a blueprint for machine learning systems that drive customer impact.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">Interestingly, thinking about these three \"<a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/3-shades-of-latency-how-netflix-built-a-data-architecture-around-timeliness/\">shades of latency</a>\" also helps breaking down traditional machine learning algorithms into different components that can be executed in different layers. Take matrix factorization as an example. As illustrated in Figure 14, you can decide to do the more time-consuming item factor computation in an offline fashion.
