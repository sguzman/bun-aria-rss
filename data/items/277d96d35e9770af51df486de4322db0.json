  "description": "<p><strong>You invited a friend to rent one of your rooms for a year. Only five months in, she's having delusional psychotic breaks in which she claims to be God, purports to read minds, and accuses your fiance and numerous others of raping her.</strong> Under the circumstances, your family doesn't feel safe having her in your home anymore, and you've let her know she's not welcome back. Now she's calling you incessantly and making you feel guilty for not supporting her as a \"friend.\" Do you have a responsibility to help her, or -- for the sake of your family's safety -- are you right for cutting her off?
