  "description": "Mud and dirt have often been treated as waste products from excavation or dredging sites. But these days, coastal communities need massive amounts of mud and dirt to protect their shorelines from rising seas. This is leading to a dirt shortage, where the demand for it is higher than supply. NPR climate correspondent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer\">Lauren Sommer</a> gives us the scoop — including why one federal agency that has dirt often disposes of it instead of reusing it for these projects.",
