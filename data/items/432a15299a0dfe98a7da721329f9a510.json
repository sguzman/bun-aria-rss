How Carson received sign-off from his Mormon Bishop for his first queer date.  \n4. The accident that left Carson paralyzed from the chest down at 23.\n5. How ableism hurts us all.  \n\nAbout Carson: \nCarson Tueller is a coach, speaker and activist whose work provides people with the tools they need to live authentic, fulfilling, and powerful lives. He identifies as queer and disabled.  Carson grew up as a Mormon in a military family moving around a lot before settling in Utah.  His own journey into powerful living began in 2013 when, in the same year, he came out, and was then injured in an accident that paralyzed him from the chest down. Since then, Carson has brought his work to international nonprofits and presidential campaigns – and when he isn’t coaching or speaking, Carson can be found at the gym, reading non-fiction, or playing Pokemon with his niece and nephews.\n\nTW: @carson_tueller\nIG: @carson_tueller\n\n#disabilitypride #disabilitypridemonth\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
