When it comes to toxins one plus one does not equal two. There is a compounded effect. Chronic toxicity can wreak havoc on our health and result in symptoms ranging from fatigue to sleep and skin issues. It can also be related to autoimmune issues, diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, autism, and many other conditions. Unfortunately, conventional medicine rarely examines the role of toxic load when it comes to treating these conditions.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to assessing a patient's toxic load and supporting the body to detoxify and reduce high levels of heavy metals.

Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life.
