  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, The widespread public demonstrations by high school students display a much deeper issue with American public education, mainly that it has become in many ways a vehicle to indoctrinate our schoolchildren with leftist ideas. These efforts in these schools are never to advance liberty, constitutionalism or capitalism generally. It’s always to advance the Left’s agenda. These schools have become propaganda mills. How did we get here? There’s been an effort underway for 100 years by the Left to turn education into the advancement of the progressive ideology and they have succeeded with the help of John Dewey. Also, we’ve been hearing that the Pennsylvania election is a a bellweather race for President Trump. All during the Barack Obama years, Democrats lost 1000 legislative seats, lost the house in 2010, lost the senate in 2014 and numerous governerships. Do you remember the media reporting that Obama is responsible for all those loses? No, yet every race in the country is a referendum on Trump. Later, Sen Rand Paul’s attack on Gina Haspel was shameful; he accused her of enjoying waterboarding terrorists. After 9/11 Haspel was in a position and did things in order to help protect our country. Paul did nothing and has no idea how war works.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
