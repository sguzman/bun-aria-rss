  "description": "<p>Amanda Knox is back in the news, as a film \"inspired by\" the story of her being accused of murder is in the theaters. Knox has compared telling stories of other people's lives to \"cultural appropriation,\" and Cameron and Jessa try to untangle that particular mess. Who gets to tell a story? What is the divide between the private and the public self?
