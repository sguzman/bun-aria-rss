  "description": "<p>On July 11, 1969, 15-year-old Cynthia Constantine took her dog for a walk as she did every afternoon in the family’s hometown of Oakdale, New York. Cynthia loved walking along the railroad tracks alongside a busy highway and often explored the area with her brother. On this day, Cynthia walked with her dog alone, picking up cattails along the way. Cynthia had planned to go check out a muskrat burrow she spotted earlier in the day while with her brother. But Cynthia never returned home, and when the family dog came home without her, the family immediately knew something was wrong. Backtracking her steps, Cynthia’s mother and brother found a pile of cattails that Cynthia had likely collected and dropped. This is the spot where Cynthia is believed to have vanished from more than 53 years ago and has never been seen or heard from again.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Cynthia Constantine, please call the Suffolk County Police Department at 631-852-6110</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p>Doordash- Get 50% off your first order up to a $15 value.
