  "description": "It's night two at the Blue Room Comedy Club in Springfield, Missouri! Adam recalls going to flavor town at Guy Fieri’s restaurant before ranting about how coffee shops are the new video stores and why ‘Candy’ would be a much better name for Kevin Bacon’s daughter. He welcomes comedian Kyle Dunnigan as Gina and Bryan join in for a round of 'Blah Blah Blog' featuring guest contestants such as: 'Trans Trump’, Pete Davidson, and Sylvester Stallone (all of which are Kyle impressions). Gina Grad reports the news of today including: Errol Musk having a second kid with his stepdaughter, a new study about recommended alcoholic consumption, and a real life 'Weekend at Bernie's' situation that happened in Ireland. \n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nGeico.com\n\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show\n\nCon-Cret.com/PODCAST\n\nTommyJohn.com/ADAM",
