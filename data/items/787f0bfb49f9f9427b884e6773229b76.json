  "description": "<p>One way to improve the estimation of time varying channels is to incorporate\nknowledge of previous observations. In this context, Dynamical VAEs (DVAEs)\nbuild a promising deep learning (DL) framework which is well suited to learn\nthe distribution of time series data. We introduce a new DVAE architecture,\ncalled k-MemoryMarkovVAE (k-MMVAE), whose sparsity can be controlled by an\nadditional memory parameter. Following the approach in [1] we derive a k-MMVAE\naided channel estimator which takes temporal correlations of successive\nobservations into account. The results are evaluated on simulated channels by\nQuaDRiGa and show that the k-MMVAE aided channel estimator clearly outperforms\nother machine learning (ML) aided estimators which are either memoryless or\nnaively extended to time varying channels without major adaptions.\n</p>",
