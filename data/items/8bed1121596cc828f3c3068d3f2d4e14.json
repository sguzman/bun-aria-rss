  "title": "Ep 99 | Tulsi Gabbard Confronts Dangerous Smears of Our Military & Conservatives | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "It’s hard to put a label on former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate, Tulsi Gabbard. She has worked with Bernie Sanders but has also felt the fires of the Left and mainstream media for simply putting her love for this country above partisan politics. Lately, she has even sided with conservatives on issues from transgenderism to Big Tech censorship. But as much of the nation dives dangerously deep into partisan politics, Tulsi calls on Democrats to turn their talk of unity into action and joins Glenn to lead the way. Together, they ask who’s defining “extremism,” why are there still troops guarding the Capitol, and how long will we let our First Amendment be trampled on as Congress “bullies” conservative media outlets and the COVID-19 restrictions persist? And Tulsi shares her own experience in the military that shatters the far-left narrative that it’s crawling with white supremacists.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
