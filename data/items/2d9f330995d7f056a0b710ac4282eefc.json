  "description": "<p>Nick Herbert is a former Minister, and the founder of GovernUp. Last summer he launched the Commission for Smart Government, to tackle the systemic problems of government in the UK: departmental silos, a muddled centre exercising weak financial management, unaccountable agencies, inability to learn from mistakes. In this seminar he is joined by Sir Suma Chakrabarti KCB and Sophie Miremadi, two fellow Commissioners, to explain how acute fiscal pressures and technological change require government to be smarter: and they set out the Commission’s emerging ideas to make government more efficient, more capable and more accountable.</p>\n",
