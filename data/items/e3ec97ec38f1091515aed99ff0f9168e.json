  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery and Codie continue the Petersburg Campaign series with the long-awaited third installment. The guys take on the months that followed the Battle of The Crater leading all the way to the Presidential Election of 1864 in November. Actions at the Weldon Railroad, New Market Heights, and Boydton Plank Road all marked some of the final offensive actions by U.S. forces south and southwest of Petersburg, Virginia for the year before the long winter set in. Avery and Codie also discuss the importance of the 1864 election and how the armies in the field dealt with the conundrum of giving all of the troops the opportunity to exercise their right to vote. Enjoy!</p>",
