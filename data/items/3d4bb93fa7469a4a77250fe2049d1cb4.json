She is the #1 Amazon bestselling author of the books Heal From Your Narcissist Ex and I Left My Toxic Relationship – Now What? Much of her professional practice is focused on helping clients through the process of recovering from the trauma and PTSD of abusive relationships. Having survived her own experience in an abusive relationship, Heather soon came to realize that many other women (and men) find themselves in the same situation, which leaves them feeling broken, ashamed, and paralyzed by fear. Heather combines her experience from her previous teaching career with her integrative therapeutic approach to counselling. Through her virtual programs, speaking engagements, workshops, and retreats, Heather is able to serve a larger population of clients who want interactive guided support from a licensed professional, as they navigate their way through trauma recovery from an abusive relationship and begin the next phase of their lives with safety and confidence.
