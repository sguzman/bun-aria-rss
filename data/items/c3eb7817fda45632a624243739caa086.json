  "description": "<p>Mac Miller was a young rapper with a unique style of rap who took the music industry by storm.  After being featured in XXL’s “Freshman Class” list with Kendrick Lamar and Meek Mill, Mac was signed to a label, collaborated with other top musicians, and ultimately released 6 studio albums.  Sadly, Mac Miller also struggled with substance abuse issues, which ultimately led to his untimely death after he suffered a fatal overdose from taking what he thought were oxycodone pills but actually contained fentanyl. Tune in as we discuss the aftermath following Mac's death, including the lawsuits against his drug dealers.</p><p>Patreon: <a href='https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy'>https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy</a><br/>LinkTree: <a href='https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy'>https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy<br/></a>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en'>https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en</a><br/>Twitter: <a href='https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy'>https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy</a><br/><br/>Intro Song:<br/>Trick or Treat (instrumental) by RYYZN <a href='https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn'>https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat'>https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc'>https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc</a><br/><br/>Outro Song:<br/>Sundown Drive by Ghostrifter Official<br/><a href='https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official'>https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive'>https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs'>https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs</a></p>\n",
