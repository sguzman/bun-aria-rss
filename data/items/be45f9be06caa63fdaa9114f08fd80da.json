  "description": "If you have been following my Button club projects, you see in year 3 that Tammy Tutterow’s delightful alphabet pattern is one of the features! Tammy is a fantastic designer who focuses on small applique projects she calls ‘bit size’ projects. Ones that can be started and finished in a limited amount of time. She give us an insight into her work and a few tips too!\n------\nTo say I’m a HUGE fan girl of Amanda Niederhauser’s quilts is an understatement, I might be the life long fan club president at this point. She is not just create with her quilting, but with her writing, her photos and her collaboration work. Amanda is a mom of both people and cats, so for those of you who are cat moms’ you need to follow her Instagram to see all the gorgeous kitty assistant photos. It’s been awhile since I checked in with Amanda so I’m thrilled to catch up and hear about her newest projects!\n-------\nRussell Conte of Sewp box is leading a fully creative life. I meet Russell at the Babylock Sewing Machine Ambassador event. We had a chance for a chat before our group went to the Opera and I loved getting to know him. Besides being a shop owner for 20 years, he created a massive teaching culture for the shop and now teaches full time as part of the faculty in the Fashion Department at Los Angeles Trade Technical College. Russell has a passion for teaching and we are going to talk about this and how you can teach others. He has great tips. Also I love his motto is “\"Needle, thread, machines, leather, material...and a voice from my Sewp Box for passion and creativity\". You are going to love Russell.. oh my the way.. he makes shoes too.. seriously.. leather shoes...\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
