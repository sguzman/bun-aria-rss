They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment,” Dorsey writes. “I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"V3wIAV\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter.

After getting ousted from the role in 2007, he <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/5/9457277/jack-dorsey-twitter-ceo-timeline\">returned as Twitter’s CEO in 2015</a> before ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807578/jack-dorsey-rumor-resign-twitter-ceo-square-web3\">stepping down in November of last year</a>. He tasked Twitter’s former <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement\">CTO Parag Agrawal with taking his place</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23042172/jack-dorsey-elon-musk-twitter-lbo-radiohead\">was quick to endorse Musk’s takeover</a> of the platform. </p>\n<p id=\"tdFdvl\">“Elon is the singular solution I trust,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772757340639232?s=20&amp;t=46RKR6VW5iK-Yb1hFrxinQ\">Dorsey said on Twitter</a> in April. “I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” He expressed this same sentiment in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23379435/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-buyout-texts\">private text messages that were revealed</a> as a part of Twitter’s lawsuit against Musk. In a message to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Dorsey said, “I won’t let this [the acquisition] fail and will do whatever it takes. It’s too critical to humanity.” Dorsey retained a 2.4 percent stake in Twitter when Musk assumed ownership, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312522274034/d393652dsc13d.htm\">a filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<div><aside id=\"9A3Vtx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Elon Musk tries to distract from Twitter layoffs by claiming advertisers are fleeing the platform\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23440510/elon-musk-twitter-revenue-drop-advertising-exodus\"},{\"title\":\"Why Elon Musk is so desperate for Twitter to make money\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23437120/elon-musk-twitter-product-subscription-verification-revenue-debt-finance\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"loN2bs\">Prior to laying off about 50 percent of Twitter’s staff, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23441404/twitter-trust-safety-staff-layoffs-content-moderation\">included 15 percent</a> of the team responsible for content moderation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement\">Musk also fired Agrawal</a> and a number of other executives, including chief financial officer Ned Segal and policy chief Vijaya Gadde. A group of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23440304/twitter-mass-firing-class-action-lawsuit-violation-federal-warn-act-notice\">Twitter employees has since filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the company, accusing it of not giving them enough notice of the job cuts in line with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) and California WARN Act.</p>",
