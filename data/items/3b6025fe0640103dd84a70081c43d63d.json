President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional $33 billion to help Ukraine. The call for more funds comes as reports that Russia&#8217;s revenue from energy sales has almost doubled since it launched the war on its neighbor. We&#8217;ll look at why Russia continues to benefit despite the numerous sanctions levied against it. There&#8217;s also a hard conversation about the measures climate activists have taken in hopes of speeding up our response to the global climate crisis.
