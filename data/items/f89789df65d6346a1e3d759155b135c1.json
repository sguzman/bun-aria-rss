From there, each JSON string is converted from binary or whatever formatting they come back as using the <a title=\"httr R package\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">content</code></a> function from the <a title=\"httr R package\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">httr</code></a> package. Without specifying any arguments to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">content</code> function, the function tries to guess at the proper translation method.</p>\n\n<p>The guessing is all fine and good until you don’t pass a valid JSON string!  In this case, the error message is guessing that it might be XML (the returned error is actually HTML), tries to load the XML package…then says it can’t load the XML package. A two-for-one error!</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it’s just me, but I’m finding this hilarious after a long day of programming. Maybe it’s because I’m not longer intimidated by an error like this, and as such, I’ve gotten over the steep learning curve of R.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note:  Hadley, if you read this, I’m not saying your httr package has any sort of bug or anything. Just that I found this particular error amusing.</em></p>"
