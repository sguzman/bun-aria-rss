  "description": "<p>Infinite-dimensional control systems with outputs are considered in the\nHamiltonian formulation with generalized coordinates. An explicit scheme for\nconstructing a dynamic observer for this class of systems is proposed with\narbitrary gain coefficients. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of the\nconstructed observer are obtained on the basis of the invariance principle.\nThis result is applied to a flexible beam model attached to a mass-spring\nsystem with lumped and distributed actuators. The estimation error decay is\nillustrated with numerical simulations of finite-dimensional approximations of\nthe observer dynamics.\n</p>",
