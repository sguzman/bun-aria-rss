  "description": "<p>Ron Morehead will be coming on the show to discuss his new book “The Quantum Bigfoot.” He will also be sharing some of the stranger things that happen to him while he recorded the Sierra Sounds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ronmorehead.com/product-category/bigfoot-books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out Ron's new book here.</a></p> <p>Ron Morehead is an ‘adventurist’; a positive ‘someone’ who loves life, but often lives it on the edge. As a SCUBA diver, he swam with the hammerhead sharks, has been filmed in Mexico’s Pacific Ocean riding the backs of giant manta rays, and been a safety diver for the filming of Right whales in Patagonia.</p> <p>As a private pilot, Ron has flown his own aircraft from the Alaskan bush to the Costa Rican jungle. Besides travelling to the ancient Mayan civilizations in the Yucatan, he has also flown into a remote jungle area of Chiapas (Southern Mexico) on an anonymous Mayan discovery expedition. What he saw was thought to be one of the last remaining strong-holds of the Mayan people. He has ventured into Western Nepal’s Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve to help assess the tiger population, explored the jungles of Bardiya on elephants, and been in the wilderness of Siberia looking for evidence of the Russian Yeti. He has made two trips in South America exploring the enigmatic structures and the non-human remains of the pre-Inca people.</p> <p>Over the years Ron has been interviewed by several radio programs and has been televised by the BBC and other learning channels. He was a guest speaker at the Darwin Museum in Moscow (Russia) and for years he has given presentations at symposiums and conferences about his Bigfoot/Sasquatch experiences. He has openly shared his knowledge and accounts with others. His book, “Voices in the Wilderness,” chronicles his 40 years of researching the enigma. Besides his book, he has produced two CDs with actual Bigfoot vocalizations, focusing on the interaction he and others had with these forest giants.</p> <p>As a successful businessman, and a father of four, his entrepreneurialism has afforded him the time and means to do many things. He doesn’t consider himself an active participant in a man-made religion, but is deeply spiritual. Besides being a gifted entertainer-musician, his incredible life as a speaker has taken him worldwide.</p> <p>Unlike most of our culture, Ron has learned to live with nature on its terms and not attempt to conquer it. His story about Bigfoot/Sasquatch is a chronicle that has drawn much attention over the last 40-years. It’s a true story and he says that it’s been the biggest adventure of his lifetime.</p>",
