  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life podcast, we are excited to delve into the literary life of the mysterious Mr. Banks! But before we get started, we do want to let you know that we have posted the reading schedule for January-March, and you can view it on our <a href=\"https://www.theliterary.life/upcoming-events/\">Upcoming Events</a> page. Also, <a href=\"https://blueskydaisies.net/\">Blue Sky Daisies Publishing</a> is running a fun contest for kids involving our new Commonplace Books, so you will want to head over to <a href=\"https://blueskydaisies.net/contest/\">their website</a> and check that out! Finally, be looking out for The Well Read Poem podcast coming to a podcast app near you on January 18, 2021!</p> <p>Cindy begins the interview asking Thomas about his family background and the influence of his parents on his own reading life. He shares about many of the books he loved in childhood and how that shaped his tastes in literature. He also talks about how he approached school learning as opposed to his personal reading. Angelina asks Thomas to tell about how he fell in love with poetry and how he ended up going to college even though that was not his original goal. He also shares more about his reading as an adult, as well as his habit of commonplacing quotations.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>…but I was glad to sing again too; it had been a greater loss that I realized in that particular wintering which saw the waning of my voice.
