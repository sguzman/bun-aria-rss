  "description": "Not unlike a lot of comedians, Marc's relationship with Rick Glassman started out with an apology. But that apology led to both of them liking each other more than they expected. Rick explains how a recent diagnosis has given him more self-awareness and prompted him to reassess the boundaries in his life. And Marc is able to relate to Rick's desire to start doing comedy as a way to control the laughter coming at you. They also talk about Rick's time on the show Undateable and his own podcast, Take Your Shoes Off, which is more than a name, it's a way of life. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
