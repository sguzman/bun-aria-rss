  "description": "<p>Tim Dillon is an hilarious stand-up comedian and he also loves some conspiracy theories. After desperately trying to get Joe back into conspiracy theory life he brings great energy and enthusiasm to this conversation. I highly recommend his podcast to anyone who finds his conversation with Joe funny.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
