  "description": "<p>Paige Hathaway is a small town girl, born and raised in Minnesota. Although she had grown up playing soccer and being active, she had never made her health or fitness a priority. After being approached at the gym about doing a fitness competition, she worked harder than ever, and placed 2nd at Ronnie Coleman Classic. This gained Paige a massive amount of exposure, and it was then that she decided to undertake a career in the fitness industry.</p> <p>Paige took a grassroots approach to building her career. She attended every fitness expo and passed out flyers about herself to everyone in the industry. As she was trying to build a name for herself in fitness, she realized the true power of social media, especially Instagram. In one year, she went from having a few hundred Instagram followers to over half a million. She now has over 4 million followers on Instagram, with a very high engagement percentage. She loves competing, modeling and working with companies like Shredz.</p> <p>What she has found most fulfilling is helping other people achieve their fitness goals. Paige wants to motivate others to be healthy, fit and confident. She sets an example of someone who makes her health a priority while still living a fun balanced life!</p>\n",
