  "description": "Thor’s daughter is getting married to a dwarf, and Thor is the last person to find out about it. Also he punted a dwarf onto a burning ship for fun at his brother’s funeral, so things might get awkward. The creature is the Segbin, and it’s a smelly goat that bites. Don’t worry though, it doesn’t want to eat you. It wants to kill you, but it doesn’t want to eat you.
