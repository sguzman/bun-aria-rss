  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss The Doors with Steven Levy.</p>\n<p><b>Introducing the Band:<br />\n</b>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Steven Levy. Steven is editor at large of <i>Wired</i> magazine and author of <i>Facebook: The Inside Story</i>. Follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StevenLevy\" target=\"_blank\">@StevenLevy</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Steven’s Music Pick: The Doors<br />\n</b>It’s been oft-observed that the day destroys the night while the night divides the day, but no matter how much <em>Political Beats</em> tried to run and tried to hide, we could not avoid breaking on through to the other side with our episode about The Doors. In many ways The Doors are the most controversial artist that the show has ever covered, for the simple reason that they are so polarizing: People tend to either adore them or hate them with a fiery splenetic passion. Which makes this episode one of the most fun and interesting ones we have ever done, because you get three perspectives on Jim Morrison & company: a true super-fan who was there at time (indeed in the audience at several of their concerts) in Steven, an ex-fan who doesn’t hate them but definitely has criticisms in Jeff, and then . . . well then there’s Scot. Is this The End for<em> Political Beats</em>? No, we’ll be back at it again soon enough, but now that summer’s almost gone we figured we’d send it out with a bang, and keep at it until the music’s over and we’ve turned out the lights.</p>\n",
