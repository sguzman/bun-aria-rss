  "description": "<p>Have you ever been in a place you felt you weren't supposed to be within your career or business? Or like you're not doing what you feel like you're supposed to be doing?</p> <p>I certainly have. It's easy to get caught in this, to keep doing what you're doing, ignoring that voice inside, fearing the risk.</p> <p>Yet listening to our fear keeps us small, it keeps the world from getting the gift we could be giving.</p> <p>Architect Ibrahim Greenidge came to this place in his career, where he decided he needed to make a shift.</p> <p>In today's episode, you'll discover how Greenidge started his practice and grew it to a team of five. Greenidge shares his number one challenge running an architectural practice today and the three top principles that have been his guiding stars for success.</p> <p>Greenidge is the co-founder of BOLT Architecture, a Brooklyn-based architectural practice.</p> <p>In 2017, he was appointed to serve as President of the New York Coalition of Black Architects. He won the 2015 Jumaane Stewart Recognition Award, his designs have been featured in the UN's Remembering Slavery Exhibit as well as the Center for Architecture's \"Say It Loud: Distinguished Black Designers of New York Coalition of Black Architects\". In 2017, Greenidge was acknowledged among the Top 20 Distinguished Minority Architects and Designers by Architizer.</p> <p>► Feedback?
