  "title": "Listening 2 Britney: ...Baby One More Time",
  "description": "On a crisp Autumn morning in 1998, the world was introduced to the voice of Britney Spears, and pop would never be the same. Britney’s mix of vocal fry, percussive pronunciations, and timbral play on “...Baby One More Time” hadn't been heard before. As successful as they were, these techniques were derided by critics as parts of her manufactured “baby voice.\" Listening in 2022, we can hear Britney with more clarity: as a radical new artist.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was not Britney's first turn in the spotlight. She had been cast on the Mickey Mouse Club in 1992, when she was 12 years old, executing immaculate vocals and choreography. But the voice on her first single represents a different side of the singer, and a new sound on the pop landscape. With Britney's ferocious vocals at the center, \"...Baby\" rocketed to number one and broke sales records. On her next release, \"Oops!... I Did it Again,\" Spears upped the ante. Working again with producers Max Martin and Rami Yacoub, \"...Oops\" borrowed liberally from music across the radio dial, and added a dash of 16th-century harmony into the mix.\n\nBetween her first two albums, Britney had taken hold of audiences by sheer force of personality and artistry, fought for in every syllable she sang. The stardom that followed was as unprecedented as her sound. But for someone as scrutinized as Britney has been, the artistry behind her celebrity has often been ignored. On the first episode of the four-part series Listening to Britney, we focus on Britney's voice in order to hear a pop icon with fresh ears.\n\nSongs Discussed\nBritney Spears - ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did it Again, Stronger, Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know, Email My Heart\nBackstreet Boys - Larger than Life\nJean-Baptiste Lully - Les Folies d'Espagne\nLearn more about your ad choices.
