  "title": "PMS 2.0 051 - Greatest Conversation With An NFL General Manager In History",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys sit down with Colts GM and friend of the show, Chris Ballard, for probably the best interview ever given by an NFL GM. He takes them through his draft and scouting process, and how much it changes during the week of the combine. He also discusses what some of the questions the Colts use for potential draft picks are, what he focuses on to put his team into a position to be successful, his thoughts on Frank Reich, and whether or not he’ll be making moves to bring in a guy like AB or Lev Bell in an absolutely hilarious and enlightening conversation (1:53-25:00). The guys also discuss The Pub sliding in to the number three spot in the St. Paddy’s march sale, what the combine week means, discuss old toys that probably killed a lot of kids, the allure of scuba diving which sprouts another oceans vs. space debate, wedding planning, what kind of questions Dr. Phil would ask NFL draft prospects, and what some of their favorite types of cookies are. It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.&nbsp;</p>\n",
