  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, a radical group focused on the secession of Puerto Rico, opened fire inside the US Capitol Building shooting 4 US Congressmen in 1954. The Weather Underground set off a bomb at the Capitol in 1971. In May of 1972 leftwing terrorists set off a bomb outside the State Department. Democrats, however, will not call these attacks an insurrection or the biggest threat to democracy, will they? Speaker Nancy Pelosi is concealing information regarding her culpability for the security breach at the Capitol on January 6th, 2020. Our Congress trashes the Constitutional system and seeks to change the Constitution by appointing radical judges and by legislation, instead of by proposing amendments. The January 6 Committee’s agenda is clear, it’s to prevent Donald Trump from ever serving as President again, it has nothing to do with legislative inquiry. It's the left that uses phony TV experts to repeatedly paint Trump as an evil dictator despite having any proof. It is the Democrats that celebrate the attacks on police officers while supporting lawlessness in minority neighborhoods, promote the censorship of parents in public education and advance transgender policies in public schools rather than focus on educating children academically.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
