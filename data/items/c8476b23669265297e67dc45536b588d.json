  "description": "<p>*Please be aware that this episode deals with sensitive topics, including suicide and child/adolescent mortality.*</p> <p>In the wake of the elementary school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, David French and Skye Jethani spend the whole episode debating what can be done to curb gun deaths in America. While they find some agreement around “Red Flag” laws and making gun owners liable for the misuse of their weapons, French doesn’t support an assault weapons ban or requiring training and evaluation before purchasing a gun. With guns now the leading cause of death for kids and teens in America, Skye says it’s time for Christians to explore all possible solutions, including amending the Constitution, similar to the pro-life movement’s approach to ending abortion. David French says the 2nd Amendment must be protected as a basic human right. Both agree, however, that the status quo is not acceptable.</p> <p>Holy Post episode 423: “Is America’s Gun Culture a Blessing or Curse? with David French” - <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.holypost.com/post/episode-423-is-america-s-gun-culture-a-blessing-or-curse-with-david-french\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.holypost.com/post/episode-423-is-america-s-gun-culture-a-blessing-or-curse-with-david-french\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.holypost.com/post/episode-423-is-america-s-gun-culture-a-blessing-or-curse-with-david-french</a></p> <p>“Pass and Enforce Red Flag Laws.
