  "description": "This is an episode about movies in the year 2010. Why? Well, it’s been 10 years since 2010, 10 long years in the life cycle of American movies. A lot has changed. Earlier this week, we celebrated the decade anniversary of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' with a special episode. What else happened in movies that year? How could we have a fun conversation that didn’t just rehash the release schedule? We got an idea for a kind of movie draft: six categories, six picks each, snake-style. Chris Ryan joins Sean and Amanda to determine who has the best 2010 movie roster. Listen and decide for yourselves.\n\nHosts: Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins\nGuest: Chris Ryan\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
