She's not a dude.

It’s authentic and bold. And it's as infectious as it is inclusive. She is totally unapologetic, far from sheepish, and 100% herself.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch it all go down on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8IaSgq6hV54\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>.
