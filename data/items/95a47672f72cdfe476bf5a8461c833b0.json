  "description": "<p>Bobby starts by rolling through some voicemails addressing some concerns they have from the show. We address a complaint we get about having ‘too many commercials. Bobby shares two crazy stories: a dad fends off robbers posed as trick or treaters…and a dad who killed his daughter's 19-year-old boyfriend for selling her into a sex trafficking ring. We also get into a debate about Daylight Savings time and how Facebook is getting rid of facial recognition technology. Bobby also talks about how he doesn’t think he’d push his kids to play football.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
