  "description": "<p>Bruce Feiler is the author of six consecutive<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers, including <em>Walking the Bible</em> and <em>Council of Dads</em>, the presenter of two primetime series on PBS, and the inspiration for the COUNCIL OF DADS series on NBC. He describes himself as an experiencer and explainer. Growing up in Savannah, Georgia, for as long as he can remember, he’s loved going out into the world, creating powerful experiences, then sharing what he’s discovered, first in letters home, then eventually in books, talks, and TV.&nbsp;</p><p>But his latest set of experiences were ones he neither sought out nor saw coming. Collectively, they dropped him to his knees, and nearly took his life. Still, fueled by a relentless curiosity, Bruce became fascinated with moments of profound transition, \"lifequakes\" as he calls them, where life after looks very different than life before. So he spent years traveling the country investigating this phenomenon, gathering and coding stories, and that’s led to the groundbreaking new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xk1NV6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Life is in the Transitions: Mastering Change at Any Age</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/2Xk1NV6). Bruce’s experiences and ideas really helped me reframe and better understand how to navigate the disruptions and bigger lifequakes, which for many of us, is something we’re in the middle of now.</p><br><p>You can find Bruce Feiler at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.brucefeiler.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.brucefeiler.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brucefeiler/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> : https://www.instagram.com/brucefeiler/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
