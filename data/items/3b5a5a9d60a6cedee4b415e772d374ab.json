  "description": "<p>Our guest on this episode is personal finance expert Farnoosh Torabi who has transformed what most would consider setbacks, into the very things that drive her forward. She found herself living in NYC at the age of 22 with over $30k in debt, but it was through the process of climbing out of debt that Farnoosh realized her desire to help others with their money. She has done it all, from reporting for Money Magazine, to hosting her own podcast, to writing multiple books including ‘Psych Yourself Rich’ & her latest bestseller ‘When She Makes More’. We’re excited to talk with Farnoosh about couples and all things related to money, but in particular how personal finance is so much more than just understanding the nuts and bolts.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed Petite Sour Raspberry by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends there at the brewery!
