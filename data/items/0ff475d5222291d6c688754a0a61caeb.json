  "description": "Maybe you’re like us: Year after year, we tell ourselves that THIS Thanksgiving is going to be the simple one. Then, year after year, we find ourselves back in the kitchen, feeling way too stressed out while juggling 15 recipes for sides, salads, desserts, and of course, a massive turkey that refuses to finish cooking. Why do we do this to ourselves? And is there another way? Associate food editor Kendra Vaculin thinks there is, and she’s here this week, along with test kitchen director Chris Morocco, to talk through her super-simplified menu for this year’s feast, which you can find in the November issue of the magazine. Tune in for tips on maximizing oven space and hot takes on why no one needs a roasting pan. Plus, Chris makes the case for yet another “compelling and dynamic” salad.\nStuff we talk about in this episode: \n\n\nBon Appétit’s Thanksgiving, Simplified Menu: https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/thanksgiving-dinner-simplified\n\n\nMore on Cheryl Day’s Desserts : https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cheryl-day-southern-baking\n\n\nDiana Yen’s Pumpkin-Tahini Mousse Pie recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pumpkin-tahini-mousse-pie\n\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Kale Salad With Pecan Vinaigrette recipe : https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kale-salad-with-pecan-vinaigrette\n\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Green Beans and Mushrooms With Crispy Shallots recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-beans-and-mushrooms-with-crispy-shallots\n\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Stuffing Biscuits recipe : https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/stuffing-biscuits\n\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Twice-Roasted Squash With Vanilla, Maple, and Chile recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/twice-roasted-squash-with-vanilla-maple-and-chile\n\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Sheet-Pan Turkey and Gravy recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sheet-pan-turkey-and-gravy\n\n\nNordic Ware Half Sheet Pan: https://market.bonappetit.com/products/half-sheet-1\n\n\nNordic Ware Baking and Cooling Grid : https://market.bonappetit.com/products/large-baking-cooling-grid-1\n\n\nChris Morocco’s Burnished Potato Nuggets recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/burnished-potato-nuggets\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
