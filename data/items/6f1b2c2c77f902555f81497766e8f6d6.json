The problem is that chronic stress causes inflammation and is behind many of the health conditions that affect men specifically. Stress can drive low testosterone, for instance, which is a common problem for men that drives many other health issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. George Papanicolaou, Dr. Louis Ignarro, and Jessie Inchauspé about low testosterone and its effects on men, the heart-protective molecule nitric oxide, the importance of minimizing blood sugar spikes, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is board certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital. He is also an Institute for Functional Medicine practitioner. Upon graduation from his residency he joined the Indian Health Service. He worked on the Navajo reservation for four years at the Chinle Comprehensive Medical Facility, where he served as the Outpatient Department Coordinator. In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He began training in Functional Medicine through the Institute of Functional Medicine. In 2015, he established Cornerstone Personal Health, a practice dedicated entirely to Functional Medicine. Dr. Papanicolaou joined The UltraWellness Center in 2017.</p><br><p>Dr. Louis Ignarro is a medical research scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his breakthrough discovery of how nitric oxide positively impacts health and longevity. His groundbreaking research on nitric oxide paved the way for—among other innovations—Viagra. He is an award-winning Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Molecular & Medical Pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and has his PhD in pharmacology, with over 35 years of experience teaching.</p><br><p>Jessie Inchauspé holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from King's College London and a master’s degree in biochemistry from Georgetown University. Her work at a genetic analysis start-up in Silicon Valley made her realize that, as the key to good health, food habits beat genetics. In her first book, <em>Glucose Revolution</em>, Jessie shares her startling discovery about the essential role of blood sugar in every aspect of our lives, from cravings to fertility, and the surprising hacks to optimize it while still eating the foods we love.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and Rupa Health.</p><br><p>Right now, when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/hyman</a>.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
