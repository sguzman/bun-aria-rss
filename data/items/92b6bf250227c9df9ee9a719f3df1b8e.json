  "description": "In the second week of our new series, The Paradox of Purpose we were encouraged to answer when God calls us. It is not IF God calls you, but WHEN and if you will ANSWER.

Be encouraged that you don’t have to find calling, calling will find YOU!<br /><br />Join us for service online every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST). <br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
