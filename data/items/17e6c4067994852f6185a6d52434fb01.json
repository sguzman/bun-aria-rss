  "title": "Episode 202: The Tragic Story of Cinnamon Brown",
  "description": "Cinnamon Brown was 14 years old when her own father, David Brown, convinced her to carry out the murder of her stepmother, Linda Bailey Brown. Cinnamon was fully convinced and brainwashed into thinking that she wouldn’t do jail time and instead just have to see a psychiatrist. Little did she know, she’d be taken away in cuffs and sent to a California Youth Authority facility for the next 4 years while her father and his new wife cashed in on Linda’s life insurance policy and lived the good life. Don't worry though, Cinnamon came back strong and David got what he deserved. \n<br>\n\nAs always thank you to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\nHelloFresh: Go to <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/10morbid\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/10morbid</a> and use code 10morbid for 10 free meals, including free shipping!”\n<br>\n\nSquarespace: Go to <a href=\"http://Squarespace.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace.com/MORBID</a> for a free trial and when you’re ready to launch, use the offer code MORBID to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain\n<br>\n\nCurology: Go to <a href=\"http://Curology.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">Curology.com/morbid</a> for a free 30-day trial, just pay for shipping and handling!\n<br>\n\nBetterhelp: Special offer for morbid listeners get 10% off your first month at ​<a href=\"http://betterhelp.com\" target=\"_blank\">betterhelp.com</a>/​Morbid\n<br>\n\nShudder: To try Shudder free for 30 days, go to <a href=\"http://shudder.com\" target=\"_blank\">shudder.com</a> and use promo code morbid\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
