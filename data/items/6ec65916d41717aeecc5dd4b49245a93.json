  "description": "<p>In the parable of the sower, we see that Jesus did not just come to bring forgiveness of sins, but the very kingdom of God—in other words, forgiveness of sins is just the beginning. The kingdom of God is nothing less than the power of God in heaven entering the world to heal every alienation and every brokenness.</p>\n<p>What does it mean to enter the kingdom of God? How do we come into the power of the kingdom of God? In this parable, we learn that listening well, listening deep, and listening in understanding is the primary skill of the kingdom of God.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 23, 1992. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1992). Scripture: Matthew 13:1-9; 18-23.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
