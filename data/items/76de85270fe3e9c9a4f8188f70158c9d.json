  "description": "<p>Taking revenge has been the subject of many different TV shows, and -- no surprise -- as soul food, it can be well-cooked or very bland. Both Nate and Brian started a vengeance show which is getting tons of positive reviews from conservatives: The Terminal List -- which falls flat on its face right out of the gates because there's not a single real human in the show. And of course the entire T-List doesn't even handle the theme vengeance as well as those four seconds from The Patriot....or Fantastic Mr. Fox. This leads into a discussion of what Nate claims is perhaps the best pilot in TV history: \"Lost\" episodes 1 & 2. Yes, that and the Rings of Power trailer (just kidding, we're just checking to see if anyone is still reading).</p>\n<p>#TerminalList #FantasticMrFox #ChrisPratt #PrimeVideo #TV #vengeance #television #familymovienight #SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #revenge</p>",
