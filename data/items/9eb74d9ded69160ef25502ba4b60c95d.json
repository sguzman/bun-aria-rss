He would soon be trying to figure out how to get out with his life!</p>\n\n<p>John and his co-author, William Burton McCormick have written a fictional crime thriller based on his true life experience titled, \"KGB Banker\".  We sit down with John and talk about his real story, and the new book, and find out how the two stories are similar! </p>\n\n<p>Get KGB Banker here:  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3u1jJF8\">https://amzn.to/3u1jJF8</a></p>\n",
