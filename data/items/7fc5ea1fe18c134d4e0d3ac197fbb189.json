  "description": "<p>This week the liquor store crush is reveled and it doesn't have a happy ending. The girls dive into new drugs involving amphibious creatures - and which members of the royal family have dabbled in them. Shannon talks her date out of a medical procedure and wonders if she's officially dating people too old for her. AG recounts a crisis involving her hair and the WIG BURRITO is born... and quickly killed. What happens when two girls walk into Bass Pro Shop when they absolutely don't belong there? AG gets naked that's what. You'll find out what terrible pickup lines Shannon throws to her Raya matches and how AG convinces her to be less mean to men. Why does everyone Shannon know's and loves all go to the same OBGYN and simultaneously end up on bed rest in one day? Lastly the girls discuss the horrifying act of submitting a stool sample and the poor FedEx worker who is in charge of shipping your shit. You read that correctly. Enjoy</p>",
