  "description": "We are back with another episode of @daebakshow discussing new music from CHUNGHA, (G)I-DLE, and THE ROSE. We are also giving away TWO signed albums from THE BOYZ! We also have BRIAN NAM back on the show and without the #acornofaman to defend himself, Eric and Brian take full advantage. The Nam Bros are back in Atlanta for Eddie’s engagement party, however, the word “party” stirs up sad memories of Eric not being invited to middle school birthday parties. Only on @daebakshow do we get to dig deep and weigh in on things that really matter. “Eric, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” - Kelly Clarkson There is also a lot of solid rambling in this week’s episode, so don’t miss it.
