  "description": "<p>THE GREATEST PEOPLE ARE MADE BY THE GREATEST CHALLENGES. Have you ever wondered what the truth is about why we're here and how to make sense of life? I think we all have. It's a question I often ask guests on my podcast who have a spiritual background. I'm fascinated by all the different ideas on our purpose in life and how to find it. We've had some amazing spiritual leaders on the show, from all different backgrounds, so I thought it would be cool to do a Masters mashup episode on spiritual truths. The response to these mashup episodes from the archives has been so great, I'm going to keep them coming. This one features 4 clips from some of the wisest spiritual minds I've ever met. First we hear from John Gray about how we can see our biggest mistakes and challenges being used for good in our lives. Then we hear from Marianne Williamson about the difference between pain and suffering (and that we have a choice about how to respond to them). Next there's a great nugget from Danielle LaPorte about why it's so important to be your own guru when it comes to walking your spiritual path. And lastly we end with Rob Bell talking about why he believes God has put paradox into every truth (and why that is a good thing). I loved each of these episodes, and I think you'll get as much value as I did by revisiting them in Episode 640. In this episode you will learn: The importance of seeing each other's struggles (5:42) The difference between pain and suffering (9:16) How to create space to listen to your own wisdom (12:38) Why paradox is baked into truth (19:04) Plus much more...</p>\n",
