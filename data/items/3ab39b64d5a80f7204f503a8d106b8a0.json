  "description": "<p>The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the Kitaev honeycomb magnets has\ndrawn intensive attention recently. In particular, $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been\nwidely recognized as a promising candidate for the Kitaev QSL. Although the\ncompound exhibits an antiferromagnetic order under zero field, it is believed\nto be endowed with fractionalized excitations, and can be driven to the QSL\nphase by magnetic fields. Here, based on a realistic $K$-$J$-$\\Gamma$-$\\Gamma'$\nmodel for $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ [1], we exploit the exponential tensor\nrenormalization group approach to explore the phase diagram of the compound\nunder magnetic fields. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities, including the\nspecific heat, Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, magnetic torque, and the magnetotropic\nsusceptibility, etc, under a magnetic field with a tilting angle $\\theta$ to\nthe $c^*$-axis perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. We find an extended QSL in\nthe angle-field phase diagram determined with thermodynamic responses. The\ngapless nature of such field-induced QSL is identified from the specific heat\nand entropy data computed down to very low temperatures. The present study\nprovides guidance for future high-field experiments for the QSL in\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and other candidate Kitaev magnets.\n</p>",
