I then moved to Cleveland, OH where my mother raised me as a single parent until she passed away when I was six. I was fortunate enough that her aunt and uncle took guardianship of me and have raised me as their own ever since. They provided me with all the love and support I needed to get where I am today.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I attended John Carroll University in Cleveland and majored in computer science and minored in mathematics and statistics. Outside of work, you can find me kayaking down the Colorado River, at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater, or trying out new breweries and food in Austin!&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b><br /></b></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>What’s your role at Google?</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I am currently a <a href=\"https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/cloud-technical-residency/#!?detail-content-tabby_activeEl=overview\">Cloud Technical Resident</a>, part of a rotational program aimed to provide recent graduates with technical and client facing skills. The program is 12 months long, with 3 months of training and rotations in 3 separate Google Cloud organizations.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Throughout the past year, I have been able to build crucial business and technical skills that I never would have with a typical software engineering job. Within my rotations I increased my technical knowledge of Google Cloud products as a Technical Solutions Engineer, learned what it was like to sell products to customers as a Customer Engineer, and how to manage enterprise customers as a Technical Account Manager.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">What I love most about this program is the incredible network I've been able to build. I've met so many different individuals within each rotation and within our cohort of 25 Residents as well. I didn't really know what I wanted to do after college, and being able to start a role with 24 other people in the same situation was the best way I could have started my post grad life.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><i><b>Editor's note:</b> The<a href=\"https://goo.gle/2r82Da4\"> Google Cloud Technical Residency program</a> in Austin, Texas is currently hiring!</i></span></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HKGc_m1ZgEU/XdMC_dvYGQI/AAAAAAAAAvU/dlFQ_W5t4bkGA20SvV8X5bOL8Qh8WZpEACEwYBhgL/s1600/CKP_7456.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1060\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"263\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HKGc_m1ZgEU/XdMC_dvYGQI/AAAAAAAAAvU/dlFQ_W5t4bkGA20SvV8X5bOL8Qh8WZpEACEwYBhgL/s400/CKP_7456.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Callen and fellow Residents at the Cloud Technical Residency 2018 Cohort Graduation.</td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>Complete the following: \"I [code/create/design/build] for...\"&nbsp;</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I build for a better future for others.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>What inspires you to come in every day?</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I am excited to be a part of Cloud's ever expanding and rapidly scaling business.

It blew my mind that a company could have such global impact. Billions of people use their products and the extent of their customer reach was beyond me.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I've always wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself, and Google was just that. In all honesty, I had never applied before because I didn't think I'd get the job. I didn't think I could compete with all the other talented individuals out there, which all changed senior year of college.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>How did the recruitment process go for you?</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">During the last semester of my senior year of college, I received an email one day from a Google recruiter, informing me about a new program they had just opened up. At first I thought it was spam or a cruel joke email. However, it was obviously not and I continued through the hiring process and never looked back.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">The entire process was very exciting and also nerve racking. On one hand, I couldn't believe I was talking to “Google people” and that I was getting closer and closer to landing a job at Google. On the other hand, I really really wanted the job and knew I would have been sad if I didn't get it.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I'll never forget the day I found out I got the position. I had woken up to an email from my recruiter. She said she had some good news and to call her immediately. I remember my heart beating so fast and being overcome with so much emotion. I had never felt so proud of myself and was the happiest I'd ever been. I always think back to that moment when job/life gets tough as a reminder to why I'm here.</span></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oDnGMoSOOb0/XdMC_WTc6GI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/TjEsNZ3mHqwLQ-mGeOnWO2EdJ8OyYIMWgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_20180715_210649_067.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"959\" data-original-width=\"959\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oDnGMoSOOb0/XdMC_WTc6GI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/TjEsNZ3mHqwLQ-mGeOnWO2EdJ8OyYIMWgCEwYBhgL/s400/IMG_20180715_210649_067.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Callen and other Noogers on their first day at orientation.</td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>What do you wish you’d known when you started the process?</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I wish I would have known how easy going and friendly the Google team would be throughout the process.
