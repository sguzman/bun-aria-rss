  "description": "<p><p>The Blind Mike and The Minifans crossover event with Dave Cullinane's Great Thinkers bombed last night in Woburn. Steve Robinson got a shitty over-priced haircut and now expecting to lose his tennis match against Kirk Minihane. Robert Redford and Robert DeNiro want you to know the hate Donald Trump. The Boston Globe put out a list of podcasts to enjoy this Thanksgiving, and surprise: The Kirk Minihane Show didn't make the list, but a bunch of shitty shows no one listens to did. Hunter Biden is suspected to have smoked crack in the VIP room of a strip club in DC. Minihane has a new live show idea to raise money for a charitable cause. Robinson's lunch yesterday with Minihane and his brother Adam prompts a tense and emotional discussion of Blind Mike's future.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
