  "description": "<p>Oprah sits down with Timothy Shriver, the impassioned chairman of the Special Olympics and a member of the prominent Kennedy family, to talk about some of the spiritual lessons he's learned from the athletes, how courage and grit are fundamental to success, and why vulnerability is a virtue that everyone can nourish. The son of 1972 Democratic vice presidential candidate Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics in 1968, Timothy grew up among some of the most powerful public and political figures in American history. Yet, he says, it was his Aunt Rose Marie \"Rosemary\" Kennedy, born with intellectual disabilities, who taught him that self-worth isn't defined by accomplishments. Timothy also discusses his memoir, \"Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most,\" in which he shares the story of the remarkable teachers and inspiring way of life he discovered during his search for how to make a difference in the world.</p>\n",
