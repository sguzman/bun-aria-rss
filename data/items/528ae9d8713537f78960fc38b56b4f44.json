  "description": "Hello, this is Eric LeMay, a host on the New Books Network. Today I interview Sarah Durham Wilson, whose new book Maiden to Mother: Unlocking Our Archetypal Journey into the Mature Feminine (Sounds True, 2022) is a reclamation and celebration of women, women’s power, and the possibilities for women’s lives outside of limitations imposed by our patriarchal culture. Wilson seeks to unearth a sacred, ancient, and empowering connection to the divine feminine, reviving the stories of such figures as the legendary Sumerian goddess Innana and showing what wisdom these stories hold for women who find themselves under threat by the misogynistic politics and policies currently proliferating around us. And Durham is a live wire, a generous and profound spirit who seeks to connect women with one another and with their birthright—the chance to become whole and radiant selves who can lead the world through this wounded present to a future in which each us and our planet can flourish.\n﻿Eric LeMay is on the creative writing faculty at Ohio University. He is the author of five books, most recently Remember Me. He can be reached at eric@ericlemay.org.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
