    "media:description": "Karl Franz must unite The Empire in Total War: Warhammer 3 if he's to have any hope against the darkness that encroaches in Immortal Empires. Our new Let's Play will take us to one of the oldest playable factions over the last 6 years of Total War: Warhammer games - The Empire. New gameplay mechanics from The Empire rework means we'll be tackling the Elector Counts, Machinations, and more as we expand across the Old World and more.\n\nBuy the game and its DLC here to support the channel as you buy:\nhttps://partyelite.gg/game-store\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/_PartyElite\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/c/PartyElite/join\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PartyElite\nSend me a Tip: https://streamlabs.com/partyelite\nJoin us on Discord: https://discord.gg/6Tq3ut5\n\n#ImmortalEmpires #TotalWarWarhammer3",
