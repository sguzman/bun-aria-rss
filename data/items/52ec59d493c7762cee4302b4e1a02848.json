  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eleanor Kerrigan comes over to talk about the glory days of the Comedy Store. Eleanor and Ari were employees of the Store together at the turn of the century. That sounds weird but it’s true. Are we old? Am I old? Is the only thing keeping me young a steady flow of mind-altering substances and laughs from live audiences? Or is it just the general utter lack of responsibility? My friends from high school look like you should call them sir. I look like a guy you’d find sleeping on your lawn on a weekday.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, Eleanor and Ari talk about our favorite time at the Comedy Store. Back in between when it was famous in the ’80s and when it was famous again in the 2010s. It was dark in those tweener years. Dark and vicious. That’s when I got to the Store. When nobody in LA gave a fuck about that place. Literally, agents and managers were told by their companies to not go there. Crowds were sparse. Really really sparse. Sometimes we couldn't even get enough customers to start the show. And it was a breeding ground for fun. For wild nights. For mayhem.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So come along with Ari and Eleanor. Two paid regulars who started as non-comedy employees. And listen to some amazing tales of a time and a place long gone. Back when the Store was the place that made me. When the Store had its balls.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Thanks to our sponsor!</strong> Go to 3Chi.com and use code \"Skeptic\" for 5% off your order! </span></p> <p> </p> <p>The Music</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turtles - Elenore</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tennessee Ernie Ford - 16 Tons</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carly Rae Jepson - Store</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dean Martin and Nat King Cole -Long Long Ago </span></p>",
