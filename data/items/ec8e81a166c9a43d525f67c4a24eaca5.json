  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! First and foremost… I want to thank everybody for their patience. My flagship newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory is just a few days away from launch. And today, without saying too much, I wanted to cover some last minute details. This will include some hints on what to expect, prices, my lifetime offer, and the special reports attached. And please, if you have any questions or concerns about receiving the offer… Email me directly at Frank@CurzioResearch.com. I want to make sure all of my followers have immediate access.  My next question comes from Chadwick. He brings up a mining stock located in a region I rarely cover - South Africa. As far as mining stocks go, is South Africa’s jurisdiction worth exploring? I then break down one of the most important factors to look for before any investment. This is something I check before I dive into any numbers or technicals. It's insider trading. Insider information is extremely valuable to us (individual investors). Insider trading shows insider confidence. Let's face it, the mangers and front office executive will always know something that we don't. Insider's buy for only one reason... And timing your investments with theirs can result in huge gains. Tune in to discover how to find them online. After all, it's free. Special thanks to George, Chadwick, Robert, Peter, and Brian. Keep the questions coming! Other topics talked about: The buying hated stocks methodology, and my thought process behind fertilizer/ farming investing.",
