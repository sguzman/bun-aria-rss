  "description": "<p><br></p><p>February 10, 1998. Green Bay, Wisconsin. In the early 1990s, Sandy Maloney was diagnosed with Arnold-Chiari Malformation and soon became addicted to prescription drugs. In 1997, her husband, John asked for a divorce, seeking full custody of their three sons. On the morning of the final divorce hearing, February 11, 1998, Sandy was found dead and burned on her scorched couch. At first, investigators thought the fire was an accident but soon changed their minds to arson and murder. John Maloney would later be arrested. But did he kill Sandy? He was a police officer and was taking over arson investigations for his precinct. Perhaps he knew how to use fire to cover his tracks. But others say that the evidence suggests another cause for Sandy's death...</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
