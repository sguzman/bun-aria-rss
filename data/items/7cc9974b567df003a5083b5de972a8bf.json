In this week’s two-part episode, Anna and Sim meet up with Dave in Atlanta, on location for Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2.

The gang also discusses life on the set of GOTG2, Dave’s all-time favorite workout playlist, and the wonder that is Japanese toilets. Later, they play a new WWE-inspired game, in which Dave must match famous wrestlers with their catch-phrases. <br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
