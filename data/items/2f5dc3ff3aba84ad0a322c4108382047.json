  "description": "<p>Today it’s great to have Gustav Kuhn on the show. Born in Switzerland, <span> </span>Kuhn discovered his passion for magic at the age of 13, and much of his teenage years were dedicated to the art of illusion and deception. <span> </span>At the age of 19 he moved to London to follow his dream of becoming a professional magician, but his career took a dramatic change after he discovered a keen interest for psychology. Gustav went on to study psychology at Sussex University, and towards the end of his PhD, he noticed a direct link between magic and psychology. His unique background in science and magic allowed him to build bridges between these two domains, which helped him establish a science of magic. Kuhn is now a Reader at Goldsmiths University of London, and director of the MAGIC-Lab (Mind Attention & General Illusory Cognition). <span> </span>He is one of the pioneering researchers in the Science of Magic and he is one of the founding members and president of the Science of Magic Association.
