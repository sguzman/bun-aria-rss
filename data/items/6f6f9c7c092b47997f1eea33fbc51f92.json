  "description": "<p>In the framework of a nonrelativistic potential quark model, we investigate\nthe mass spectrum of the $1S$-wave charmed-strange tetraquark states of\n$cn\\bar{s}\\bar{n}$ and $cs\\bar{n}\\bar{n}$ ($n=u$ or $d$) systems. The\ntetraquark system is solved by a correlated Gaussian method. With the same\nparameters fixed by the meson spectra, we obtained the mass spectra for the\n$1S$-wave tetraquark states. Furthermore, based on the predicted tetraquark\nspectra we estimate their rearrangement decays in a quark-exchange model. We\nfind that the resonances $X_0(2900)^0$ and $T^a_{c\\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++/0}$\nreported from LHCb may be assigned to be the lowest $1S$-wave tetraquark states\n$\\bar{T}_{cs0}^f(2818)$ and $T^{a}_{c\\bar{s}0}(2828)$ classified in the quark\nmodel, respectively. It also allows us to extract the couplings for the initial\ntetraquark states to their nearby $S$-wave interaction channels. We find that\nsome of these couplings turn out to be sizeable. For $\\bar{T}_{cs0}^f(2818)$\nand $T^{a}_{c\\bar{s}0}(2828)$ their couplings to $D^*\\bar{K}^*$ and $D^*K^*$,\nrespectively, are found to be large. Following the picture of the wavefunction\nrenormalization for the near-threshold strong $S$-wave interactions, the\nsizeable coupling strengths can be regarded as an indication of their dynamic\norigins as candidates for hadronic molecules. Furthermore, our predictions\nsuggest that signals for the $1S$-wave charmed-strange tetraquark states can\nalso be searched in the other channels, such as $D^0K^+$, $D^+K^+$,\n$D^{*+}K^-$, $D^{*+}K^+$, $D^{*0}K^+$, $D^0\\bar{K}^{*0}$, $D_s^+\\rho^0$, etc.\n</p>",
