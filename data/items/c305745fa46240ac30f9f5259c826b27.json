  "description": "<p>Thank you for 10+ years and 400 episodes. We couldn’t do it without you! A VERY special thanks to our <a href= \"http://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople\">Patrons</a> who have kept the show alive since 2018. </p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/400_Episodes_YouTube_Channel_Art.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"144\" /></p> <p>In this show we discuss 10 things we've learned over the 400 episodes we've produced over the last 10+ years. Here's a quick summary...<br /> <br /></p> <p>1. Climate change is no longer a BS term. People are taking it seriously and being more positive about what to do about it<br /> <br /></p> <p>2. Change in the New World – confidence, maturity, and even better wine<br /> <br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Change in the Old World – a more wine-lover centric attitude<br /> <br /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/WFNP_Maps_World.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"342\" height=\"226\" /></p> <p>4. Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater…wine styles have diversified, so make sure you try many examples before you say you dislike a grape or a region<br /> <br /></p> <p>5. The decline of the wine score…we still use them, but they carry a lot less weight and there are many of us who know they are highly biased and don’t give a lot of information to us<br /> <br /></p> <p>6. Balance is more important in wine than any one component<br /> <br /></p> <p>7. Consistency for WFNP (and for wine) is never going away…but changing your mind with new facts is ok!<br /> <br /></p> <p>8. Everything in wine changes, everything in wine stays the same…<br /> <br /></p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/pexels-timur-saglambilek-87224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"248\" /></p> <p>9. You can get a great bottle for $9, if you know what to look for<br /> <br /></p> <p>10. A riff on #4 – sometimes wines that are bad sippers are great with food. It’s sometimes imbalance in a sipper that makes it perfect with food (yes, it contradicts #6 but this is a special circumstance – food changes a lot of things with wine. And that’s wine…full of consistency, full of contradiction!)</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers to another 400 episodes -- we'll make them as long as you keep listening! </p> <p>__________________________</p> <p>Thanks for our sponsors this week:</p> <p><strong>Wine Access:</strong> Access to the best wines for the best prices!
