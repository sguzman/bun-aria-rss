As vaccines make their way across the country, the questions are only increasing and it can feel overwhelming to find answers from expert sources. While we don’t have all the answers, we are learning more every day. We’ve seen that for people 15 and older, COVID-19 can double our risk of dying this year. And while we know chronic disease puts us at an increased risk for severity and death, we don’t know why some perfectly healthy people still can’t fight this virus off. We’re seeing that vaccines will be a dramatic help for this virus, helping to reduce the risk of severe symptoms and death, but that they won’t stop transmission.</p><br><p>I really wanted to talk to someone in-depth about where we are with COVID-19, what we can count on with the vaccines, and what we still don’t know. I knew Dale Harrison would be the perfect scientist to help me break down this topic. Dale is a senior executive with more than 20 years of experience in the biotech industry. He has held multiple VP and C-level positions with companies in the research tools and molecular diagnostics sectors. Dale currently works as a consultant with companies that are developing new clinical diagnostic platforms, including a company developing a CRISPR-based COVID test for the OTC market, and a metagenomics-based NGS platform for infectious disease testing in the human transplant market.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Bioptimizers, Thrive Market, and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Right now you can try Bioptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough for 10% off, just go to <a href=\"http://bioptimizers.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bioptimizers.com/hyman</a> and use the code HYMAN10 at checkout.</p><br><p>Thrive is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
