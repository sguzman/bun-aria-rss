As a Vaccine Infodemiologist and science communication lead for <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">The COVID Tracking Project</a>, Jessica Malaty Rivera specializes in infectious disease epidemics and the surge of misinformation that accompanies them. The very first human trials of the COVID-19 vaccine occurred in March 2020, and Alie asks Jessica one million questions about the differences between the two available vaccines, rollout schedules, herd immunity, mRNA, vaccine hesitancy, mutated virus strains, picnics, vision boards, the post-holiday spike, how history can influence current vaccine rates, whether you should wipe down your groceries and more.
