  "description": "<p>When we look at haunted graveyards, we have many questions. Why are there ghosts or at least, unexplained things happening in cemeteries? Can we find answers in the history? In the stories? We're up to episode 14 of these haunted cemeteries and I don't know that I'm any closer to answers. One thing that is very clear though, is that cemeteries are very important! Join me as we explore Elkhart Cemetery in Illinois, Dawson Cemetery in New Mexico, Lone Fir Cemetery in Oregon, Spider Gate Cemetery in Massachusetts and Oakwood Cemetery in Texas! Moment in Oddity features the Mysterious Stone Monuments of Markawasi, Peru and This Month in History features King William II dies by accident or assassination.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/08/hgb-ep-306-haunted-cemeteries-14.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/08/hgb-ep-306-haunted-cemeteries-14.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>The following music is from <a href= \"https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:\">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</a></p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)<br /> License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Zombie Cemetery by 5Alarm Music<br /> Sad Day by 5Alarm Music</p>",
