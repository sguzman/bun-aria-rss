  "description": "<p>Atop a hill in the Filipino city of Pines sits an abandoned and dilapidated building that not only has a brutal history, it is considered the most haunted place in the Philippines. This is the Old Diplomat Hotel, which was originally a retreat for friars of the Dominican Order that later became a place of sanctuary and then eventually a place of death. But this is not the only creepy location with a haunted reputation in Baguio. The city is dotted with haunted locations like the Laperal White House. Join us as we share the history and hauntings of the Old Diplomat Hotel and haunted Baguio. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Scott Booker and features Boanthropy and This Month in History features British Airship R101 crashing.
