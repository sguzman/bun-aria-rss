  "description": "Contributor(s): Rupal Patel, Dr Jack Meaning | The book addresses ten questions that are the key to understanding economics, from ‘Why aren’t Freddos 10p anymore?’ to ‘What actually is money?’. Along the way, it offers idiosyncratic examples of economics in action: whether in the City of London, the Bank of England canteen, Springfield Power Plant or the National Lottery. The result is an authoritative and surprisingly witty guide to economics and why it matters.",
