The formal name for the transformation is \"the critical turn in education,\" which \"turned\" education from traditional models of pedagogy to \"Critical Pedagogy,\" the application and teaching of Critical Theory to and through the education system. Its purpose: to overcome what Marxists refer to as \"the problem of reproduction,\" by which stable societies reproduce themselves from one generation to the next, especially through institutions involving children like religion, family, media, and especially education.
