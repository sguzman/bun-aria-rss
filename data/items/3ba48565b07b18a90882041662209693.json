  "description": "<p>Architect <strong>Edward Durell Stone</strong> like many of his generation fell in love with Modernism. His first independent commission was a 1933 Modernist house for <strong>Richard Mandel</strong>, which led to many other prominent commissions including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington.  Stone is one of the few architects to make the cover of TIME. Business Week called Stone \"the man with a billion on the drawing board\" for the number and scale of prestigious projects in development.  About that time, however, Stone had a change of philosophy about Modernist design and moved away from what he called the “transient enthusiasms” of Modernism. Stone was not alone.  By 1970, the Modernist movement was nearly dead.  In North Carolina, Stone worked with Raleigh architects John Holloway and Ralph Reeves on two of the state’s most recognized and treasured buildings, the 1963 North Carolina Legislative Building and 20 years later, the North Carolina Museum of Art.  We talk with Stone’s son, <strong>Hicks Stone</strong>, and Reeves’ son, <strong>Bernie Reeves</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Hicks Stone</strong> is the author of Edward Durell Stone: A Son's Untold Story of a Legendary Architect.He is the principal of Stone Architecture LLC and has been featured in House & Garden, Palm Beach Cottages & Gardens, The New Yorker and This Old House.  </p> <p>North Carolina publisher and political writer <strong>Bernie Reeves</strong> created Spectator Magazine; Triangle Business Journal; Triad Business Journal; and Raleigh Metro Magazine.  He ran for Congress in 2010, writes for the National Review, and has been a good friend to NC Modernist and US Modernist since we started. </p>",
