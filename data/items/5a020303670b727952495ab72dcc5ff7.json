His podcast, and the community he’s developed around it, is built on the desire to help other driven entrepreneurs break through to the next level in life and in business.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, Zach and Irvin jam on Irvin’s entrepreneurial upbringing and the start of his own business, the pursuit of excellence even in the smallest details, and why building great connections is easily the most valuable use of your time.
