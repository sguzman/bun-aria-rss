  "description": "On today's show, Pat reacts to Patrick Mahomes' new deal which is reportedly for 10 years and up to 503 MILLION DOLLARS. Pat and the boys also cover the tentative training camp schedule and the questions raised by Phil Rivers around if a player tests positive for COVID19 during Super Bowl week, will they have to quarantine and potentially miss the game even if said player is asymptomatic. Pat also reacts to the news that BMF title holder Jorge Masvidal is stepping in to face UFC Welterweight Champion Kamaru Usman on Fight Island this Saturday, chats about Bryson Dechambeau's body transformation which has proven to be successful, Pat and the boys discuss where everyone in the office is on the AFL ladder with their respective squads, and pays his respects to the greatest eater on the planet, Joey Chestnut, after winning his 13th Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Championship. Also joining the show is former NFL defensive back and Head Coach for the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, and current head coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils, Herm Edwards. Pat and Herm chat about what it was that he missed about football after being away from the game, and what drew him back to the college level, how he's been handling coaching during the quarantine, what he thinks about this upcoming college football season, who the best player he's ever seen is, him still getting residuals off \"you play to win the game,\" and what he picked up by being away from coaching that he has taken with him while at Arizona State in an electric conversation (4:52-22:29). Later, Yahoo Sports Senior NFL writer and friend of the program, Charles Robinson joins the show. Pat and Charles discuss the potential negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA leading up to the preseason and how he thinks it's going to be a knockdown dragout, the mess in Washington DC right now with Daniel Snyder having to change the name of the team and what kind of timeline they're working with, and the latest developments in the Jadeveon Clowney situation with the Browns reportedly offering him close to $20 million for 1 year and what Charles thinks will ultimately happen with Clowney (42:59-58:09). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. Also be on the lookout for a big announcement today. We appreciate you all letting us penetrate your ears on a daily basis. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
