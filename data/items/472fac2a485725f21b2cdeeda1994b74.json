  "description": "<p>An old theorem of Ad\\'amek constructs initial algebras for sufficiently\ncocontinuous endofunctors via transfinite iteration over ordinals in classical\nset theory. We prove a new version that works in constructive logic, using\n\"inflationary\" iteration over a notion of size that abstracts from limit\nordinals just their transitive, directed and well-founded properties. Borrowing\nfrom Taylor's constructive treatment of ordinals, we show that sizes exist with\nupper bounds for any given signature of indexes. From this it follows that\nthere is a rich class of endofunctors to which the new theorem applies,\nprovided one admits a weak form of choice (WISC) due to Streicher, Moerdijk,\nvan den Berg and Palmgren, and which is known to hold in the internal\nconstructive logic of many kinds of topos.\n</p>",
