  "description": "<p>Natural gas prices remain elevated and security of supply is uncertain. In Europe, the reduced flows of natural gas coming from Russia have impacted everything from home heating to manufacturing. As we head into winter in the Northern Hemisphere, what is likely to happen in natural gas markets and what factors are important to consider when we think about implications beyond this year? In today’s episode, we hear from Stefan Ulrich and Arun Toora, who are both European gas specialists at BNEF. They address outstanding questions like whether Europe has enough gas in storage to make it through this winter and how big of a role demand destruction could play.</p>\n<p>Complimentary research from BNEF includes the ‘European Gas Winter Outlook 2022: Demand Swings Too Far?’ and ‘Global LNG Winter Outlook 2022-2023.’  These can be found at BNEF on the Bloomberg Terminal, at bnef.com and on our mobile app. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
