  "description": "<p>In this 68th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.In this episode, we begin by discussing ice storms and electrical outages, and what it suggests about differing ecologies. We review Daniel Schmactenberger’s categorization of “1st, 2nd, and 3rd person epistemics”, and discuss what they suggest about education. Meanwhile, the NYT argues for skipping the critical reasoning and going right to the answer. Modern fact-checkers are an existential threat to civilization. The NYT also thinks that ClubHouse’s “unfettered” conversations are a problem. The House Committee on Energy & Commerce is having a(nother) meeting on misinformation with big tech CEOs. Also, a group of activists got Wikipedia to take down a page on the lab leak hypothesis. Peter Embarek of the WHO commission explains why the lab leak hypothesis is unlikely (or does he?). Another new paper suggests that lab leak should be the default hypothesis. And finally: dung beetles, and what else they can offer us besides cool field projects.<br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
