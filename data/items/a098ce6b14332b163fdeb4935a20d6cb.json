She added that the fashion industry has a huge role to play, saying, “It’s up to you to reinvent what we understand by fashion… and it’s up to you to rethink, reinvent, redesign.”</p><p>That reinvention and redesigning means interrogating what wealth, well-being, and pleasure are — and untethering those ideas from physical things.
