In “The Lost Tapes Vol. 1”, the show is opened with a song by Eli Braden (Howard Stern Show), just before Anna and Sim go back in time, pre-Unqualified, to practice giving advice to a caller named “Lewis” (played by Chris Pratt) who accidentally slept with his cousin! Then, they interview Justin Long to discuss how he met Anna and to ask him some rapid-fire questions (one word: anal?). Zachary Levi takes a meeting to brainstorm his next great role with the one and only, Karen Sarducci. Are Adam Pally and Zoe Lister-Jones ready to meet Kayla? Find out what happens when Thomas Middleditch is approached by Chad, an app designer, who has an idea that's truly visionary!
