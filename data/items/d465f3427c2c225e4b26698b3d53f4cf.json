  "description": "<p>Marlo Thomas has been breaking barriers for women for more than five decades as an actress and activist. As an award-winning actress, Marlo became a household name as Ann-Marie, the lead in the television show <em>That Girl</em>, a woman who, in the late 60s, wanted a career more than a family. An outspoken feminist, Marlo then launched <em>Free to Be...You and Me</em>, which was first an album, then a book, and eventually, an Emmy and Peabody award-winning TV show for children that challenged gender norms and became a touchstone for a generation of feminists. Her best-selling books include a memoir about growing up an adored daughter of TV star Danny Thomas, and, just last year, she and her husband Phil Donahue released a book, <em>What Makes a Marriage Last: 40 Celebrated Couples Share with Us the Secrets to a Happy Life</em>, and a podcast, <em>Double Date</em>, filled with marriage advice. All in all, quite a life for That Girl. </p><p><br></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
