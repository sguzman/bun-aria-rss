Eating in sync with your circadian rhythm can have profound effects on your digestion, microbiome, mental alertness, and so much more.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Circadian nutrition might sound like a new, cutting-edge idea, but fasting in accordance with the sun is actually something humans have done since the beginning of time. Today, we have access to food around the clock, we’re prone to late night snacking, and many of us don’t consider that when we eat is just as important as what we eat.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On today’s show, we’re diving into the latest emerging science behind circadian nutrition and why it matters. You’re going to learn multiple functions and systems within the body that are impacted by the timing of your eating patterns, plus realistic ways to implement circadian fasting to optimize your health.
