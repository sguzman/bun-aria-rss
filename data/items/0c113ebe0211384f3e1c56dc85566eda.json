  "description": "<p>Comedian, television star and all around interesting person. Rosanne is a real sweetheart who has had some real challenging moments in her life. She recently sent out a controversial Tweet that led to her losing her job on TV and a lot of negative press.</p>\n <p>She came on Rogan to set the story straight and it made for a fantastic conversation.</p>\n <p>I really enjoyed reviewing it.</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
