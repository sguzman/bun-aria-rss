  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin show, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib keep getting special privileges despite their disdain for America. Their press conference today was a stunt; a stunt to advance the anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. Congressmen like Jerry Nadler actually have Jews in their districts yet they defend these two anti-Semites who sound like neo-Nazis. Unlike the U.S, Israel is surrounded by enemies and is constantly fighting for their survival. Why should Israel admit these two supporters of the BDS movement into their nation when the BDS movement seeks to destroy Israel. These two well-informed Congresswomen know that Israel had passed a law banning supporters of the BDS movement from entering Israel. Then, the Palestinian Authority operates like mobsters keeping their own people poor while they themselves become very wealthy. In 1941, Germany's promise to wipe out the Jews living in Palestine so the predecessors to the P.L.O. sided with the S.S. So much of Tlaib's commentary sounds like the Grand Mufti, a cleric whose rhetoric is comparable to supporters of the Third Reich. Later, Mr. Zuhdi Jasser, President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy calls in to offer analysis on American-Islamic relations and his experiences visiting Israel. After, The New York Times admitted to shifting its focus from reporting on alleged Trump collusion to alleged Trump racism. Using social activism as journalism to advance their new 1619 project to promote the idea that America started in 1619 and was built on slavery and racism that still abounds today.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
