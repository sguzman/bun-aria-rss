  "description": "No team wants to catch a beatdown, but wanting can only get you so far in life, as it turns out. Usually, that beatdown comes at the hands of a powerhouse, like the USWNT, or Oklahoma, or UConn Football. In every case, a beatdown is something to be beheld and regarded, like a freak accident or a zoo animal that gets stuck on the roof of a skyscraper. We will not shame those who deliver beatdowns in this home. We will seek them out and remind you that they are real, and that they can happen at any level, at any time. Especially if you're at a Rutgers game.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
