  "description": "<p>We analyze the multitime statistics associated with pure dephasing systems\nrepeatedly probed with sharp measurements, and search for measurement protocols\nwhose statistics satisfies the Kolmogorov consistency conditions possibly up to\na finite order. We find a rich phenomenology of quantum dephasing processes\nwhich can be interpreted in classical terms. In particular, if the underlying\ndephasing process is Markovian, we find sufficient conditions under which\nclassicality at every order can be found: this can be reached by choosing the\ndephasing and measurement basis to be fully compatible or fully incompatible,\nthat is, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). For non-Markovian processes,\nclassicality can only be proven in the fully compatible case, thus revealing a\nkey difference between Markovian and non-Markovian pure dephasing processes.\n</p>",
