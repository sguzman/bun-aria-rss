  "description": "<p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <a href= \"https://phit.click/freecourse\">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p> </p> <p>I'm a busy lady just like you. I can tell you one thing:I attract women who get a lot done and feel they have no time left for themselves.</p> <p>That's why I want to talk about self-care a minute.</p> <p>I decided a long time ago that self-care was not optional. But, I also don't define it like most people.</p> <p>Self-care, for me, is taking time each day to clean out my brain. I need to know what's going on in there that needs re-directing. Just because I wake up in a sour mood doesn't mean the day is shot. It means I need to ask myself to generate the feelings I want for the day.</p> <p> </p> <p>To me planning and assessing is self-care. The ultimate form of self-care is my mental health. Knowing I am prepared for my day, thought ahead, decided how I was going to show up for the world is the best gift I give myself.</p> <p>Sure I get my hair done, go out to dinner every now and then, but the real form of self-care I love is taking a few minutes to just figure out how I am CHOOSING to show up each day in thought and action. What will I eat? When will I shower? What times are my meetings? What podcasts and books will I listen to on my drive? What do I want to feel at the end of the day?</p> <p>That's self-care.</p> <p>When you start to feel bad that you are last on your list...don't. Waste of time.</p> <p>Take a look at what you might be doing now that IS for you. Game your brain. Stop telling yourself that just makes you feel terrible. Heck, I count doing dishes and getting coffee ready as self-care. One, I love me a clean dish to eat off of. Two, I really like that coffee waiting on me like a sweet friend each morning.</p> <p>I challenge you to ask one question of yourself? How can I care for me today? Get creative momma!</p> <p>Don't play victim to life. How you respond to your life is your responsibility.</p> <p>In our podcast today you will hear a lot about how we care for ourselves. I share a story about Logan and start bawling. Warning! And poor Kathy didn't know it was coming. I swear she looked at me and was like, \"Holy crap! I think I have to take over the podcast.\" LOL.</p> <p> </p>",
