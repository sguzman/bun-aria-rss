  "description": "<div>In this week's Book club podcast Sam's guest is Roland Philipps - whose new book <em>Victoire: A Wartime Story of Resistance, Collaboration and Betrayal </em>tells the morally murky and humanly fascinating story of Mathilde Carre - a vital figure of the early days of resistance in occupied France. Roland's story describes her heroic early work; and its undoing when she was captured and turned collaborator... before she saw, in the figure of an agent for the British secret services, the opportunity for a triple-cross and the hope of redemption.</div>\n",
