The only reason I'm not all in right now is because I'm too busy. Everybody has to decide their own opportunity costs. For me, I think I over-index on video. I perform better on video. I like video, I like this whole thing.<br /><br />But I want to still have a presence on their, so I'm taking the audio of this show and turning into a podcast. I think podcasting is a huge phenomenon. Obviously the smart phone has changed the dynamic; people can take it with them when they run or travel or work out. Other people are listening on their car over blue tooth. It has particularly exploded over the last twenty-four months, especially with Serial being such a big deal. It was big back in 04 and 05, and now it's having a comeback. <br /><br />I'm all about podcasting in its traditional form as an audio experience. To me, there is a huge opportunity that is being missed for a long of people. Let's not forget that audio is much more accessible to a lot of people. Making a video takes a different dimension and skill set, one that I think I own; thus, I use this form to create two pieces of content. I take the audio and turn it into a podcast. Because video comes so naturally to me, that is what I default to. But I want to be aware of the podcast world, so I do what I can to make it work.<br /><br />If I had time to do two separate shows, I would. But right now I don't see the ROI of only doing audio in a world where I have so many projects happening. <br /><br />And by the way, Podcast listeners (if you're reading this :) ), please give me your feedback.
