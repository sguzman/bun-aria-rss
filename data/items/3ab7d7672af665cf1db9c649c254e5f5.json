Each month I will tackle a specific problem, issue, and concept related to mental ill health. I will be discussing major issues in the current mental health system AND how to find healing for yourself or a loved one.\nI’m excited to announce that for the February and March Mental Health Initiative we are going to be doing another book club! Over the next eight weeks we will be going through my latest book, Think Learn Succeed!\nI decided to spread the book over two months because there is just so much to unpack and discuss. Like the January Perfect You book club, there will be weekly YouTube Live sessions that go over the assigned chapters as well as blogs and podcasts related to topics and concepts in Think Learn Succeed.\nHow you understand and use your mind is predictive of how successful you will be. Nothing will work unless you get your mind right first. Think Learn Succeed is all about helping you make that switch to a life well-lived, filled with meaningful success.\nSo how do you join the book club?\n1. Get the book!
