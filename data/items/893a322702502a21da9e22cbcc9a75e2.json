  "description": "Vulnerability is a tough subject. As we get older we learn to close ourselves off and put our armor up, and not let ourselves be vulnerable so that we can avoid getting hurt. The problem with that is that in order to have true, deep relationships we need to be vulnerable and others need to be vulnerable as well. In this episode we talk about what vulnerability is, why we hide from it, and the positives of allowing ourselves to be vulnerable.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
