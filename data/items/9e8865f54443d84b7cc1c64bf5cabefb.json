  "description": "Vox.com editor-at-large Ezra Klein talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about Vox's new Netflix series \"Explained.\" The first season of the show, which debuted May 23, will feature 20 mini-documentaries about topics such as monogamy, cryptocurrency or the racial wealth gap. Klein said these topics are too big to be tackled in a three-minute YouTube video, and that one of his team's metrics of success is whether the Netflix episodes are still useful and relevant to people a year or more from now. Klein also explains why he's skeptical about the supposedly dramatic changes in video consumers’ habits online, and how Vox.com's approach to journalism has changed since he founded the site four years ago. Plus: Why divisions over social justice, political correctness and \"identity politics\" are the new \"fundamental driver of political conflict\" in the world.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
