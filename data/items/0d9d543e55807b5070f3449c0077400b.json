  "description": "Californians told not to charge electric cars days after talk of future gas car sales ban. Not all heroes wear capes: Buck took on the challenging task of watching all of Joe Biden's latest campaign talk. Joe Biden was a pyromaniac in a field of strawmen. Buck says, \"Biden's gaslighting was thermonuclear level. I mean, the gaslighting was like the scene in Game of Thrones where they light the whole ocean on fire with the wildfire.\"  California Governor Gavin Newsom’s in-laws donated money to Ron Desantis. Biden continues to spread lies about January 6th. Liberal media carries the water for weak Democrat candidates like Fetterman. DOJ releases staged photos of Mar-a-Largo documents. More Biden lies. Clay sums it up: \"The midterms are not a referendum on Donald Trump. He hasn't been in office for two years. The midterms are a hundred percent a referendum on what Joe Biden has done as president.\"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
