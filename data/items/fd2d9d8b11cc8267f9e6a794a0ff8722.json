The board set a deadline of January 2021 for changing the rules. The announcement came about a month after California's governor signed a bill that makes it easier for athletes at schools in the state to profit from their image. Also talked about is Tiger Woods's most recent PGA tour victory -- career No. 82 -- and the host of entities that benefit when he's winning. And also discussed is the apology issued by Houston Astros owner Jim Crane to a Sports Illustrated reporter.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
