  "description": "<p><p>For our post-trade deadline episode, we brought back the boys to assess the current state of their respective teams. Frankie Borrelli laments the current state of his beloved Islanders; Chief comes to terms with the fact that his Blackhawks are now mediocre; 610 tries to find positives for Rangers fans to glom onto after the front office emailed a white flag; and Jordie lets us know how the Flyers went from losing 10 in a row to being neck-and-neck for the division lead. This is a jam-packed ep featuring Barstool's excellent hockey contributors so tune in.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
