  "description": "This week on Milk Street Radio, we talk to blogger and writer Sasha Martin, who cooks through the alphabet starting with Afghanistan. “The first day we meet, the next day we are brothers,” Sasha says. “And this idea that when we sit down to the food and we put away our silverware and we’re eating with our hands and we’re having this communal meal something changes and indeed we sat around the table for a really long time that night and it was just a wonderful experience.” Christopher Kimball discusses Milk Street’s cookbook roundup for the year with editorial director J.M. Hirsch. We also learn how to transform an affordable cut of beef into a succulent holiday roast, and wine writer Stephen Meuse discusses the best wines for the season. Finally, we take your calls with Sarah Moulton.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
