  "description": "Secularism, radical Islam, and nationalism all sound like buzzwords pulled straight from today’s headlines. But you might be surprised to know that 500 years ago they were at the epicenter of one of the greatest religious and political convulsions in western history—the Reformation. Today I talk with Prof. Bejamin Wiker, author of the new book The Reformation 500 Years Later: 12 Things You Need to Know. He brings to light the enduring relevance of one of the most significant events in history—and the surprising things about it you probably never learned in history class. We discuss...    How Luther inspired radical reformers whom he actually despised    How bad popes were even worse than you think    Why nationalism was as much a force in the Reformation as religious reform was    How the Catholic Church was in dire need of reform—and how it had benefited from continual reform over the course of its then 1,500-year history    How the invention of the printing press both helped and harmed the Reformation    Why another Reformation is inevitable—and what course it might take",
