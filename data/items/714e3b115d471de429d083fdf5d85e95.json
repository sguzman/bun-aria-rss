  "description": "<p>We believe the working title for this documentary was \"The Garbage-Human Who Pretended To Be A 9/11 Survivor.\"\n Ugh, Meet Tania Head, the woman who claimed to be a survivor of the attacks on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. An \"employee of Merrill Lynch\" with \"degrees from Harvard and Stanford\" and the \"fiancee of 'Big Dave,'\" an employee in the opposite tower, Tania was, for all intents and purposes, the face of the survivors of 9/11....Until the New York Times looked into her story. \n As the truth of her story comes to light, we meet the real survivors she conned--some who'd figured her out early on, others who held out hope that she was who she claimed to be. \n Hear our funny, insightful, and super-annoyed take. </p>\n",
