  "description": "<p>A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to autonomously learn new flexible,\ncognitive behaviors. Here we define cognitive behaviors as those that require\nworking memory, that is, behaviors where the appropriate action depends not\njust on immediate stimuli (as in simple reflexive stimulus-response\nassociations), but on memorized contextual information. Such cognitive,\nmemory-dependent behaviors are by definition meta-learning (``learning to\nlearn'') tasks. In typical meta-learning experiments, agents are trained with\nan external, human-designed algorithm to acquire one specific cognitive task.\nBy contrast, animals are able to pick up new cognitive tasks (including tasks\nnever seen during evolution) automatically, from stimuli and rewards alone,\nthrough the operation of their own evolved internal machinery. Can we harness\nthis process to generate artificial agents with such abilities? Here we evolve\nneural networks, endowed with plastic connections and neuromodulation, over a\nsizable set of simple meta-learning tasks based on a framework from\ncomputational neuroscience. The resulting evolved networks can automatically\nmodify their own connectivity to acquire a novel simple cognitive task, never\nseen during evolution, from stimuli and rewards alone, through the spontaneous\noperation of their evolved neural organization and plasticity system. We\nsuggest that attending to the multiplicity of loops involved in natural\nlearning may provide useful insight into the emergence of intelligent behavior.\n</p>",
