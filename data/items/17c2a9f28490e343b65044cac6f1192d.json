  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss Pavement with Jeff Pojanowski.</p>\n<p><strong>Introducing the Band</strong>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest Jeff Pojanowski, professor at Notre Dame Law School. Jeff is on Twitter at @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/pojanowski\">pojanowski</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff’s Music Pick: Pavement</strong></p>\n<p>Political Beats has been dressed for success for a long time, but success it never comes. Finally it arrives with their episode on Pavement, a band that Jeff (Blehar, that is) considers to be the single greatest of the entire 1990s. The discussion carries the gang from Pavement’s early lo-fi EPs and debut album (complete with a ’70s hippie burnout on drums and behind the producer’s desk) to their more assured (but never ‘straight’ or particularly commercial) mid- and late-’90s material. This is a band that, for all their practiced inscrutability and just-don’t-care posing, never set a foot wrong over their entire career (five EPs, five albums, and countless B-sides and outtakes) until the end — a record of near-perfection that makes them one of the most essential bands of the rock era. Join us as we go back to those gold soundz, and you don’t even have to keep your advent to yourself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",
