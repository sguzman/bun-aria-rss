Simple and practical financial advice sounds familiar, but is rarely ever truly given. Maybe you have access to financial advisors you trust and maybe you don’t. Understanding for yourself that money, investing and living a rich life is much simpler than you could imagine is the most important thing for you to remember. Ramit Sethi has joined me twice before to bring you sound financial advice and he delivers again. He shares investing strategies worth considering if you are looking to create wealth. Even if you’re a modest investor, you’ll want to hear how he breaks down the truth behind hidden investment fees, advice for couples to understand the root of their money problems and solutions for those never-ending disagreements around finances. This episode will give you the tools you need to reconsider your investment strategy, how you approach money and why, and the best way to move towards living the rich life, however you define it!   Check Out Ramit’s 1st Interview on Impact Theory: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mokyNBWZ8wg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/mokyNBWZ8wg</a> Check Out Ramit’s 2nd Interview on Impact Theory: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mokyNBWZ8wg\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/mokyNBWZ8wg</a>   Order Ramit Sethi’s book, I Will Teach You To Be Rich: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VmKbKk\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/2VmKbKk</a>   SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction Ramit Sethi 1:42 | Current Financial Situation 2:31 | Low Fees Exposed 5:13 | What Great Investing Is 7:28 | Investing Isn’t Quick Money 10:53 | Understand Compound Growth 14:44 | Protecting Your Wealth 16:04 | Wealth Accumulation Strategy 26:51 | Low Cost Low Fee Funds 31:22 | Gamifying Investing 33:34 | Investment Journey 35:47 | Love and Money Solutions 42:35 | Couple with Separate Accounts 44:35 | Women Having Higher Income 49:09 | Pivotal Financial Conversations 53:43 | Spender Saver Couples   QUOTES: “Investing is not about excitement.
