    "media:description": "As you wind down at the end of the day and open a go-to streaming platform, we’re all faced with the difficult task of choosing what we want to watch. Stockbuster previews feature generic genres we've all learnt to expect. Stereotypical characters we all love, “originals” and binge-worthy series we've spent all weekend watching. All produced with TV-worthy stock footage from Dissolve. \n\nWatch our other showreels: Faux Show, Summer Senses, and This Is Stock - at dissolve.com/showreels",
