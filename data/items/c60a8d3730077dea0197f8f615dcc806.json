    "media:description": "Shows a demonstration of two Nandland Go Boards communicating to each other without wires over a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface. This is a simple project that creates a \"Transparent UART\" between two devices, so that data that is received on one UART is forwarded to the remotely connected device.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/nandland/bluetooth-rn4871-demo\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/nandland\n\nGet a Go Board for yourself: https://nandland.com/goboard/introduction.html\n\nThe Digilent PMOD Board: https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-ble-bluetooth-low-energy-interface/",
