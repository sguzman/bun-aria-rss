  "description": "<p>$N$-gram language models (LM) have been largely superseded by neural LMs as\nthe latter exhibits better performance. However, we find that $n$-gram models\ncan achieve satisfactory performance on a large proportion of testing cases,\nindicating they have already captured abundant knowledge of the language with\nrelatively low computational cost. With this observation, we propose to learn a\nneural LM that fits the residual between an $n$-gram LM and the real-data\ndistribution. The combination of $n$-gram and neural LMs not only allows the\nneural part to focus on the deeper understanding of language but also provides\na flexible way to customize an LM by switching the underlying $n$-gram model\nwithout changing the neural model. Experimental results on three typical\nlanguage tasks (i.e., language modeling, machine translation, and\nsummarization) demonstrate that our approach attains additional performance\ngains over popular standalone neural models consistently. We also show that our\napproach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to a\ndomain-specific $n$-gram model, without any extra training. Our code is\nreleased at https://github.com/ghrua/NgramRes.\n</p>",
