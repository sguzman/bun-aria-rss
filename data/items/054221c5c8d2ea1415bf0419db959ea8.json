  "description": "<p>What is Unit 731? It was one of Japan's WWII era medical research centers where doctors performed horrific experiments on prisoners, gruesomely torturing and killing human lab rats in order to improve biological, gas, chemical, and other weapons. Prisoners were infected with the bubonic plague, syphilis, cholera, and other diseases. Prisoners were raped, beaten, frozen, and even trapped in pressurized chambers where they bled out from their pores. <em>“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” - </em>George Santayana <em> </em></p>\n<p>Let us never repeat what happened in Unit 731.
