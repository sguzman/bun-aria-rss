  "description": "Three stories this week from the Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen about people that are matchless. The first is the tale of the emperor and his new clothes, where an emperor who needs a new coat every hour gets an offer he can't refuse. The second is about a boy who wants to marry the daughter of a monarch and all the cool gadgets and racially insensitive cosplaying he'll do to win her hand, and the third is the story of the little match girl. That one literally has matches in it. I still do puns. The creature is the scariest couch potato in the world. If the seas have couches. I mean, they probably have lots of couches with how much trash we throw into them. Ok, I'm sad now.
