  "description": "Today's show is a great one for the holidays -- it's really focused on infusing deeper meaning into our quilts, our hobby, and our collections. We start with a conversation about the importance of quilt labels -- we discuss how to add them, what to include on the label, and some tips for writing and printing on fabric. We share heartwarming stories of quilters making a difference in their communities, including an exciting update to our One Million Pillowcase Challenge. One of our editors shares the story behind her most cherished quilt -- it's the quilt that started her on her quilting journey. We chat about the history of paper needle books and what to look for as a collector. And on Getting Sewcial, we chat with Brittany Lloyd of Lo & Behold Stitchery, who shares how her late grandmother still influences her quilts and patterns.\n\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
