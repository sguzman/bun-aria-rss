  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Mitch McConnell is pouring money into the Tennessee US Senate race, outspending conservative Dr. Manny Sethi by four-to-one. Meanwhile, Joe Biden showed his true colors saying that, apart from some exceptions, African Americans all think the same when commenting on the diversity of Latinos. Then, the media covers for Biden just like Twitter covers for ANTIFA, better yet, Twitter has become the ANTIFA of the media. In 1946, the Hutchins Commission on Freedom of the Press warned that the media risked permanent damage if they didn't focus more on the facts and less on opinion. Later, Democrat Governors across America are responsible for hurting, and in some cases, for the deaths of many citizens because of coronavirus. Along with the pandemic, there was a well-orchestrated plan to shut down the country. They dispirited the American people, ban worship, ignite hatred, and allow riots across the country while they support the abolish the police mob. Yet despite the closures of schools in every state, not a single teacher has been furloughed or laid off. Afterward, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joins the show to discuss how Democrats will continue to push chaos, such as defunding the police and destroying small businesses if they win in November.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
