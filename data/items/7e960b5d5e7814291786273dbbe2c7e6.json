  "title": "Mark Edele, \"Debates on Stalinism\" (Manchester UP, 2020)",
  "description": "Debates on Stalinism (Manchester University Press, 2020) considers some of the major debates about Stalinism during and after the Cold War. Was ‘Stalinism’ a system in its own right, or just one stage in the overall development of Soviet society? Was it an aberration from Leninism, or the logical conclusion of Marxism? Was its violence an expression of revenge of the Russian past, or the result of a revolutionary mindset? In approaching these questions, the book unpacks complex historiographical debates in which evidence, politics, personality, and biography are entangled. In doing so, Debates on Stalinism allows readers to better understand the history of history writing, and sheds light on contemporary controversies and conflicts in the successor states of the Soviet Union, and in particular Russia and Ukraine.\nMark Edele is a historian of the Soviet Union and its successor states. He is the inaugural Hansen Professor in History at the University of Melbourne, and an Australian Research Council Future Fellow (2015-2019). His recent publications include The Soviet Union: A Short History (Wiley Blackwell, 2018), Debates on Stalinism (Manchester University Press, 2020), The Politics of Veteran Benefits in the Twentieth Century: A Comparative History with Martin Crotty and Neil J. Diamant (Cornell University Press, 2020), and Stalinism at War: The Soviet Union in World War II (Bloomsbury, 2021).\nProfile page: https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/794083-mark-edele\nTwitter: @EdeleMark\nIva Glisic is a historian and art historian specialising in modern Russia and the Balkans.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
