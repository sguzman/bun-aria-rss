This simple-sounding idea has some surprising moral implications: https://80000hours.org/kurzgesagt-last-human\n\nSources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-last-human/\n\nThis video was created in partnership with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nKurzgesagt in 8 languages: https://linktr.ee/kgs_international\n\nThe future of humanity seems insecure. Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism and so many people think our end is in sight.
