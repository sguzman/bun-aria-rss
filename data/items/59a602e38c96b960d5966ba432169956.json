Mix the flour, ground almonds, salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add one egg to the butter and sugar mixture and beat in, then a third of the dry ingredients, then the second egg, and so on. Add two tablespoons of elderflower cordial and mix. Place in a greased baking tin and bake at 160 degrees Celsius (fan oven) for 20-25 minutes until just beginning to brown at the edges. Meanwhile, mix the drizzle - 100ml of elderflower cordial and the juice of the two lemons. When the cake is done, prick all over with a cake tester (or piece of spaghetti), and slowly pour on the drizzle so it soaks in and doesn’t pool. Sprinkle modestly with granulated sugar and poppy seeds. Leave to cool completely before cutting. Pairs excellently with a cup of earl grey tea or a glass of rosé wine (French, not Californian).\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 - Appetizer\n2:29 - First Course\n10:30 - Second Course\n21:55 - Side Dish: The Ballad of Kelly Slaughter\n28:45 - Third Course\n\n#Food #Cooking #Beauty",
