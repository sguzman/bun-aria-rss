  "description": "<p>There are a lot of promising results in 3D recognition, including\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, many of\nthese results rely on manually collecting densely annotated real-world 3D data,\nwhich is highly time-consuming and expensive to obtain, limiting the\nscalability of 3D recognition tasks. Thus in this paper, we study unsupervised\n3D recognition and propose a Self-supervised-Self-Labeled 3D Recognition (SL3D)\nframework. SL3D simultaneously solves two coupled objectives, i.e., clustering\nand learning feature representation to generate pseudo labeled data for\nunsupervised 3D recognition. SL3D is a generic framework and can be applied to\nsolve different 3D recognition tasks, including classification, object\ndetection, and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its\neffectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/fcendra/sl3d.\n</p>",
