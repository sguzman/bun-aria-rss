  "description": "<p>Today’s episode features a full crew to welcome you back from the weekend as the boys jump right into their weekend shenanigans. Nick and Ty got to take their ladies DAHN to the state fair and they were in for quite the treat. As the discussion of movies begins, major SPOILER ALERT (34:00.379) for the Suicide Squad sequel because Zito per usual spilled all the beans out of excitement. The boys then jump into the Pod FOD which is a folder made up of all things from the internet. Today’s FOD takes the boys through a pimp’s estate, reaction to O.J. Simpsons continue pandering, Mountain Dew getting in on the hard seltzer game, finishing off with Chet Hanx’s COVID thoughts and everything in between. Make sure to subscribe to youtube.come/thepodpmi to watch full episodes and don't forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD to @ThePodPMI on twitter and instagram. We appreciate you rocking with us and we'll see you Wednesday, Cheers.</p>\n",
