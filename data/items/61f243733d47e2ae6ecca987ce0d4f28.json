  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the lockdowns are having a catastrophic impact on the economy, mental health, and education. In one country, more people have died by suicide than by COVID. The situation across much of the rest of the world is also dire. Yet those who push the lockdowns refuse to grapple with or even acknowledge the devastating effects. Also Five Headlines, including Joe Biden’s injury and another “anonymous racist note” story that the media is reporting as fact, even though anonymous racist notes are almost always hoaxes. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’m afraid it is my duty to rain on the parade of everyone celebrating a woman’s “historic” kick during a college football game on Saturday.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
