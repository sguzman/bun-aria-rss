  "title": "Remembering Anthony Bourdain with Writer Laurie Woolever",
  "description": "Few people knew the world of Anthony Bourdain as well as writer Laurie Woolever. As his longtime assistant (or lieutenant, as he called her), Laurie was enmeshed in the details of his life and work. When the beloved chef and journalist died in 2018, Laurie lost a boss, a friend, and a trusted collaborator. As she grieved with the rest of the world, Laurie set about finishing a project she and Anthony had just barely kicked off, a book called \"World Travel\" that would share inside details on the places he had loved and visited over the years. Laurie joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about her life, \"World Travel,\" and of course, Anthony Bourdain. \n\nToday’s show is presented by Cakebread Cellars and Homemade, the podcast from the publishers of Allrecipes. \n\nRadio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Our theme song is by the band Tra La La.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter at https://cherrybombe.com/newsletter-signup. ",
