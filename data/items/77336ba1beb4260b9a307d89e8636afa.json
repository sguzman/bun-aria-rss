  "description": "<p><strong>“If I had to describe my work, I would say that it is a blend of grunge, whimsy and outsider.”</strong></p>\n<p>In our first breakout week, Louise is in discussion with artist Jacqui Fehl . Influenced by music, lyrics, feelings, stories, other artists, and the materials themselves, Jacqui’s art is as varied as her ever changing hair – sometimes light, humorous and colourful , while at other times serious with a touch of dark.</p>\n<p>In this podcast, Jacqui and Louise dive deeply into issues around the creative process, scaling up your work, your personal voice and and how we define success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Part of the conversation centred on this quote:</p>\n<p>\"It quite frequently happens that you’re just treading water for quite a long time. Nothing really dramatic seems to be happening. … And then suddenly everything seems to lock together in a different way. It’s like a crystallization point where you can’t detect any single element having changed. There’s a proverb that says that the fruit takes a long time to ripen, but it falls suddenly … And that seems to be the process.\"<br>\nBrian Eno</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>See more of Jacqui’s work at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacquifehl.com\"><u>https://www.jacquifehl.com</u></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\"><strong>Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\"><strong>bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram: </strong>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp; @louisefletcher_art &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>See fuller show notes on our websites:<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\"><strong>www.alicesheridan.com</strong></a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\"><strong>www.louisefletcherart.com</strong></a></p>\n<p><u><strong>Credits</strong></u></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br>\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em>&nbsp;</p>\n",
