  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motherhood is a gift from God. We never want to forget that. But while we’re down here in the trenches, we can’t ignore real annoyances—like who left this sock behind and why are there crumbs everywhere? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss why moms get annoyed and how the gospel shapes our responses. They even discuss some practical tips. Every mom is going to face annoying things, so we can sigh and roll our eyes or turn back in dependence to God who supplies for our every need. Christ came to save us—annoyances and all—so we could learn to love others even when we’re annoyed.</span></p> <p><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-130-gospel-hope-when-youre-annoyed-as-a-mom-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-130-gospel-hope-when-youre-annoyed-as-a-mom\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/75993/Copy_of_Regular_format.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p>",
