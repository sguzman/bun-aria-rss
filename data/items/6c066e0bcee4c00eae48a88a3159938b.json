  "description": "Every report out of the Trump White House tells the same story.  Whether it's the anonymous op-ed from a \"senior Trump Administration official\" in the New York Times or Bob Woodward's book \"Fear\" or the Omarosa book or the Wolff book or countless news reports--the president's unhinged, the people around him don't trust him, and some of them have decided to just by-pass the president and govern on their own, elections be damned.  Trump blames the Deep State.  But we know better!  On this emergency episode Rosa \"Anonymous\" Brooks, David \"Anonymous\" Sanger and Ed \"Anonymous\" Luce join us for the kind of fresh, terrifying analysis you can't get anywhere else and shouldn't try at home.
