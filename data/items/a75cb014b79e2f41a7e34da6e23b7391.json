  "description": "<p>Clay, back from freedom lover's Florida, is at the helm solo today. Biden's covid plan is 500,000 million test kits. It's a \"complete joke,\" says Clay, that this will help with covid, which might take billions of tests and everyone testing every morning when they wake up. A big win for Team Reality, New York Times editorial: Do not close schools, masking should be voluntary. Notice how when Biden took over all the media covid deaths counters miraculously disappeared? Let's all imagine what it would be like if Trump were president now. One million people left blue states and covid has made red states redder and blue states bluer over the departure of conservative voters. Fauci, who Clay says is the worst bureaucrat official in the history of our country, demands for Fox News to fire host Jesse Watters. Biden’s and Fauci’s calls for segregated Christmas undermine confidence in vaccine.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
