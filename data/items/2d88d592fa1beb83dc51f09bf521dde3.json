  "description": "<p>Solitons in nematic liquid crystals offer intriguing opportunities for\ntransport and sensing in microfluidic systems. Little is known about the\nelementary conditions that are needed to create solitons in nematic materials.\nIn this work, theory, simulations and experiments are used to study the\ngeneration and propagation of solitary waves (or \"solitons\") in nematic liquid\ncrystals upon the application of an alternating current (AC) electric field. We\nfind that these solitary waves exhibit \"butterfly\"-like or \"bullet\"-like\nstructures that travel in the direction perpendicular to the applied electric\nfield. Such structures propagate over long distances without losing their\ninitial shape. The theoretical model adopted here serves to identify some of\nthe key requirements that are needed to generate solitons in the absence of\nelectrostatic interactions. These include surface imperfections that introduce\na twist in the director, unequal elastic constants, and negative anisotropic\ndielectric permittivity. The results of simulations are shown to be in good\nagreement with our own experimental observations, serving to establish the\nvalidity of the theoretical concepts advanced in this work.\n</p>",
