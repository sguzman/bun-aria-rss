  "description": "If you're a fan of good bourbon, then you're likely a fan of good food too. Today's guest is the intersection of those two, combining a culinary background with his love for the south and, of course, bourbon. You may know Chef Newman Miller from his appearance on Top Chef season 16. He's also the Executive Chef and Owner of Star Hill Provisions at Maker's Mark and the Harrison Smith House in Bardstown. We talk about his culinary background, where he played a part in the creation of the McDonald's McGriddle and behind the scenes at Top Chef. His deep dive into bourbon was influenced by Drew Kulsveen of Willett. So if you're a wannabe chef or if you're an occasional TV dinner kind of person, this episode is going to have something for you.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about 4th of July.\n\nWhat was Padma from Top Chef like in real life?\n\nWhat was it like when you heard about being on Top Chef?\n\nWhy do you think they chose Kentucky for Top Chef?\n\nWhat did the chefs think of being in smaller towns?\n\nWas it challenging to cook for everyone?\n\nWhat's a banana croquet?\n\nHow cool was it to have the chefs create versions of your dishes?\n\nHow hard is it to judge fellow chefs?\n\n Tell us about your relationship with Rob Samuels.
