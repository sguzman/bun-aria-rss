    "media:description": "Eminem dissed his mother so bad, she sued him, and not for an insignificant amount either. Eminem's mom sued him for $10m, with the lawsuit eventually succeeding, although not for the amount that Debbie Mathers initially expected. This event had come after the time Eminem got sued by his childhood bully, marking just one of the many times Marshall Mathers got sued.\n\nThis is, The Time Eminem Got Sued By His Own Mother.\n\nThank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ‚ù§\n\nAlso, the idea for this video was inspired by both \"Trap Lore Ross\" and \"ISAIAHthePLAYAH\" who each posted a video on a similar topic in 2019 titled \"Eminem's Mom Sued Him For $10m\" and \"The Time Eminem Got Sued by his Childhood Bully\" respectively. You can watch their versions here - \n\nISAIAHthePLAYAH - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2YrtD8kchY&t=85s\nTrap Lore Ross - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTnikAsYBWk&t=891s",
