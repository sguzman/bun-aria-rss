  "description": "<div>TICK TOCK IT’S CULT O’CLOCK!</div>\n<div>What can we say, the 60s in Los Angels were ROUGH! Lots of drugs and crappy eating, not to mention the terrible music. So it just seemed fitting that when the 70s rolled around and a guy named Jim Baker opened a bunch of popular health food restaurants on the Sunset Strip that he should parlay that into a full on cult…WITH A ROCK BAND! Soon hundreds of members of “the family” are crammed into a 3 bedroom / 2 bath house and it all goes exactly how you imagine. BUCKLE UP, YOU GUYS, THIS ONE IS BANANAS. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 100 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"Don't F**K With Cats,\" \"The Menendez Murders,\" \"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more!
