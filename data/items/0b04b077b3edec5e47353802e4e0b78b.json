To overcome these challenges, more companies are turning to heterogeneous integration and the 3D stacking of ICs and specialized chiplets (implemented in different processes geometries) into 3D ICs. Chiplets are small ICs specifically designed and optimized for operation within a package in conjunction with other chiplets and full-sized ICs. In heterogeneous designs, chips and chiplets are stacked and interconnected with vertical wiring. Designers can also combine them with 3D memory stacks, such as high bandwidth memory, on a silicon interposer within the package of a device.</p> <p>Learn how to engineer a smarter future faster by downloading this ebook.</p>",
