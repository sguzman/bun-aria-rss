  "description": "As we reported in MMP this week, the Judge Hall reversed his earlier order that basically split the \"boat crash\" case in two and allowed the Murdaughs to indefinitely postpone that trial so Alex could prepare for his speedy murder trial. The Attorney General’s Office told us the murder case still hasn’t been scheduled. \nWhile we wait for those crucial announcements, Mandy Matney, Liz Farrell and Eric Bland want to share some conversations about what might be happening behind the scenes.\n\nWe all want to drink from the same Cup of Justice — and it starts with learning about our legal system.
