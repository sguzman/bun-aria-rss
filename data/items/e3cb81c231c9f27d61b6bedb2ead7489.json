Our poor metabolic health is driving our chronic disease epidemic and putting people at higher risk of experiencing severe complications from COVID-19, if they are to get the virus. The good news is that it is possible to become metabolically healthy in a matter of months, if not weeks.</p><br><p>In recent conversations with Dr. Aseem Malhotra and Chris Kresser, Dr. Hyman discusses the drivers of poor metabolic health and how, with the right support, making changes to your diet and lifestyle can rapidly optimize your health.</p><br><p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra is a founding member of Action on Sugar and was the lead campaigner highlighting the harm caused by excess sugar consumption in the United Kingdom, particularly its role in type 2 diabetes and obesity. In 2015, he coordinated the Choosing Wisely campaign by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges as lead author in a BMJ paper to highlight the risks of overuse of medical treatments. In the same year, he became the youngest member to be appointed to the board of trustees of UK health think tank, The King's Fund, that advises government on health policy. His first book, co-authored with Donal O' Neill, The Pioppi Diet, has become an international bestseller.</p><br><p>Chris Kresser M.S., L.Ac is the co-director of the California Center for Functional Medicine, founder of Kresser Institute, and the New York Times bestselling author of The Paleo Cure and Unconventional Medicine. He is one of the most respected clinicians and educators in the fields of Functional Medicine and ancestral health and has trained over 1,500 clinicians and health coaches in his unique approach. His health coaching program, called ADAPT, is the one I recommend for my staff at Cleveland Clinic and he’s the guy I trust with my own health.</p><br><p>Find Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Dr. Aseem Malhotra, “How Diet Is Driving COVID-19 Outcomes,” here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/DrAseemMalhotra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrAseemMalhotra</a></p><br><p>Find Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation with Chris Kresser, “Is Meat As Bad As We Think: Breaking Down Nutrition Myths,” here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/ChrisKresser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/ChrisKresser</a></p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
