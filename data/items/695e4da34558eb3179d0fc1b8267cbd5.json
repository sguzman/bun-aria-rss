The app’s latest update on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\">Apple App Store</a> says you have to pay for Blue to get verified on the platform “just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”</p>\n<p id=\"yAb0bT\">The new Twitter Blue subscription isn’t available just yet, though. Esther Crawford, a product manager at Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1588969361976741888?s=20&amp;t=ZukmnL9xJlhPrHqOmXT0qg\">confirmed it’s not live right now</a> but says some users “may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"SSDnsx\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Twitter shipped its new Blue subscription for verification ahead of Musk’s Monday deadline given to employees. I updated and verified accounts are now the first tab of notifications. <a href=\"https://t.co/xfTl3b3GYk\">pic.twitter.com/xfTl3b3GYk</a></p>— Alex Heath (@alexeheath) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1588956178759192576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2022</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"muw5Xk\">While the updated app initially showed a revamped notifications screen that defaulted to displaying tweets from Verified users in the first tab (helping to promote the idea that paying for the new plan is the best way to make sure people actually see your tweets), this has since disappeared. As pointed out by one of my colleagues at <em>The Verge</em> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LelloucheNico/status/1588984083220422656?s=20&amp;t=x10mQNXh3bgvXeq7WHEPnw\">reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong</a>, the new layout disappears after quitting out of the app and opening it again.</p>\n<p id=\"5ov5qU\">The app displayed a “Blue looks good on you, enjoy your verified checkmark” pop-up when users try to sign up to Blue as well, but without the actual opt-in for displaying a “verified” label on your profile. This message also disappeared from my colleague’s app after quitting and reopening Twitter, so it’s unclear whether or not all users will see this show up.</p>\n<p id=\"NYqTBr\">Whenever Twitter does decide to let users display checkmarks on their profiles, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23441028/this-might-be-all-it-takes-to-get-verified-on-twitter\">we have an idea about what that process will look like</a> thanks to Wong. App researcher Nima Owji has also given us a glimpse of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1588154661139365888\">new “official account” labels</a> Twitter could start applying to notable users, as well as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1588602918168846337\">“verified account” confirmation</a> on profiles, which indicates an account’s verified “because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KN5TYPPBEY7F-2z8S_t92OPs44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24171376/twitter_blue_subscription.png\">\n      <cite>Screenshot: The Verge</cite>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"qS83PK\">It’s still not clear when verification through Twitter Blue will go live (or when it will arrive on Android), but it seems like it’s happening soon. Musk initially gave the developers working on Blue until Monday, November 7th, to complete these changes or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23431931/twitter-paid-verification-elon-musk-blue-monthly-subscription\">else face getting fired</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"DZivAC\">It looks like verification will be the only feature available with the Twitter Blue subscription to start. Other perks, like fewer ads, the ability to post longer videos, and priority ranking to help “lower the visibility of scams, spam, and bots,” are listed as “coming soon.” Twitter Blue is only available in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK for now. Crawford says it’s “coming soon” to Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"2rFryQ\">When <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23435092/elon-musk-twitter-blue-verification-cost-ads-search\">Musk announced the new Twitter Blue subscription last week</a>, he hinted at providing access to paywalled articles, but this feature isn’t among those listed in the update. He also pulled the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23434502/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles-discontinued-feature\">ad-free article perk that came with the previous $4.99 / month</a> Twitter Blue subscription and reportedly pushed to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23437836/elon-musk-twitter-edit-feature-button-everyone-all-users-blue\">make Twitter’s “edit” button available to all users</a>, not just subscribers. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439790/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-trust-and-safety-teams-severance\">Musk laid off around half of Twitter’s employees</a> across several departments, including product trust and safety, policy, communications, tweet curation, ethical AI, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"cyy1lD\"><em><strong>Update, 3:08PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to add information from a product manager at Twitter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"hkSYzL\"><em><strong>Update, 3:25PM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated to add more information about Twitter’s upcoming “official account” labels and verified account confirmations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"jdMsVf\"><em><strong>Update, 4:34PM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated to note that the revamped notifications tab is no longer available.</em></p>\n<p id=\"4cDLI0\"><em><strong>Update, 5:15PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to note that not all users will see information about the verification process after updating.</em></p>\n<p id=\"kq0S9U\"><em><strong>Update, 5:27PM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated to note that the new Blue subscription is coming soon to Europe.</em></p>",
