  "description": "In 1988, a woman called 911 to report a strange man outside her house. After a brief moment of silence, she screamed before the phone got disconnected. Ever since the call surfaced on the internet in 2002, it’s been picked apart by internet sleuths, and has left people everywhere wondering: Is the call a hoax? Or is it a 30-year-old murder mystery waiting to be solved?
