  "description": "<p>On today’s playlist: chamber music, but not how you’re used to hearing it. The band Forro in the Dark combines the driving dance rhythms of forro from Northeastern Brazil with rock, jazz, reggae, folk and country.  Listen to selections from their latest musical adventure - \"Forro Zinho - Forro in the Dark plays Zorn\" - an exploration of the lyrical, driving melodies of John Zorn  as Brazilian-tinged dance music. Then, there's music from Eviyan, which is clarinetist/composer  Evan Ziporyn, the violinist/vocalist/composer Iva Bitova, and guitarist/composer Gyan Riley. Also, hear chamber music with a Japanese cast from Seattle-based composer and percussionist Paul Kikuchi. Plus, there's American composer Shankar Tucker’s piece \"Ae Re Chanda\" combining Indian classical music with American jazz and classical sounds. And lastly, music inspired by water by Christopher Tin. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PROGRAM # 3756, Composed Works, Unusual Settings (First aired on 7-28-2015)                                </p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>ARTIST(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>RECORDING</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CUT(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SOURCE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Shankar Tucker</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> Filament</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ae Re Chanda (Suite for the Moon) (excerpt) [:56]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://shankartucker.bandcamp.com/album/filament\">shankartucker.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Forro in the Dark</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Forro Zinho – Forro in the Dark plays Zorn</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Forro Zinho [4:59]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tzadik.com/index.php?catalog=8334\">tzadik.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Paul Kikuchi</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bat of No Bird Island</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Four Seasons of the Childhood [7:36]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://paulkikuchi.bandcamp.com/\">paulkikuchi.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Forro in the Dark</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Forro Zinho – Forro in the Dark plays Zorn</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Quiet Surf [3:04]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>See above.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Forro in the Dark</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Forro Zinho – Forro in the Dark plays Zorn</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Zabeve [4:38]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>See above.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Eviyan</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nayive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> Pygmyesque [4:43]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.airplaneears.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=66&amp;products_id=311\">airplaneears.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Eviyan</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nayive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sun Shower [5:53]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>See above.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Shankar Tucker</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Filament</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ae Re Chanda (Suite for the Moon) [9:15]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>See above.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Christopher Tin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Drop That Contained the Sea</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Deviprabaha (excerpt) [3:29]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>TW004<br><a href=\"https://christophertin.com/#store\" target=\"_blank\">christophertin.com</a> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
