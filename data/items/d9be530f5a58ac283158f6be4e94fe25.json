  "description": "Lorraine Kelly has been on our TV screens for the best part of 40 years. Born to working-class, teenage parents, she turned down a university place to join the local paper and then BBC Scotland as a researcher. By 1984, she was TV-AM’s Scotland correspondent. Today, she’s at the helm of the eponymous Lorraine show live every weekday morning.<br />In a special bonus episode, she joins me to talk about everything from the power of drag to the TV executive who told her to change her accent to how being fired on maternity leave was actually the making of her via her worries that she only had one child and her passion for penguins. Yes. Penguins. Enjoy!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Queens for the Night airs tomorrow night on ITV at 8.30pm<br /><br />--<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted and produced by Elizabeth Day.
