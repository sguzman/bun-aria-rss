  "description": "Digital creator Dylan Marron has racked up millions of views for projects like \"Every Single Word\" and \"Sitting in Bathrooms With Trans People\" -- but he's found that the flip side of success online is internet hate. Over time, he's developed an unexpected coping mechanism: calling the people who leave him insensitive comments and asking a simple question: \"Why did you write that?\" In a thoughtful talk about how we interact online, Marron explains how sometimes the most subversive thing you can do is actually speak with people you disagree with, not simply at them. Listen to his podcast, \"Conversations With People Who Hate Me,\" wherever you get your podcasts.",
