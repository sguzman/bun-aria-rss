  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd of WJNO and WIOD fills in for Mark. Robert Mueller released a new memo and Michael Cohen is facing substantial jail time, but there’s still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. All we have is confirmation that Cohen is a liar and was not a cooperating witness to Mueller. Almost $50 million has been spent on the Mueller probe and we still don’t have a shred of evidence of collusion. Also, it’s been 25 years since the Brady Law and more people are being killed by guns than ever before. The left’s narrative on guns is deliberate; if they can make guns equal violence, they can focus on the object instead of the person causing the violence. If gun control was the answer, why do we have more deaths attributed to guns at a time where we have the most gun control laws ever? Later, the media portrayal of the situation on the border with migrant caravan is completely opposite of what we actually want. The vast majority of Americans favor stronger border security and oppose letting the caravan in, but the media is trying to make it seem the other way around.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
