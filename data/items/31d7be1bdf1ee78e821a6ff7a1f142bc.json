In this episode of the podcast, James Lindsay reads through part of an academic paper from 2006 about incorporating Critical Race Theory and Whiteness Studies into literacy education in second-grade classrooms. That's seven-year-olds. The point is clear: almost all of our kids go to Paulo Freire's Marxist schools, and Critical Race Theory is definitely a part of that program in today's Race Marxist regime.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
