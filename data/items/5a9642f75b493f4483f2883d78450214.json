  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Gregg Rosenthal recap all the latest news from around the league, starting with Derwin James signing an extension in Los Angeles (10:03). We have an update on Zach Wilson's status (13:52), Drew Lock tested positive for COVID (17:07), Carl Nassib is back with the Buccaneers (20:14), Robert Nkemdiche was released by the 49ers (23:27), and the Manti Te'o documentary debuted on Netflix last night (24:29). Then, September Madness is almost here with the Week One Tournament for Our Attention (28:50). We go through every matchup on the Week 1 slate in bracket form to decide the premier game to watch. Will the chalky 1-seed come out on top? What contest can pull off an upset? The heroes complete the second round (56:22) and eventually finish out the Final Four (1:07:55). After everything, we cap the show with a discussion about which NBA player Justin Herbert best represents, because calling him the Michael Jordan of football really doesn't make a lot of sense (1:14:40).</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
