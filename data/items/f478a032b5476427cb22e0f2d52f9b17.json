  "description": "Both interviews today will transport you into the exciting world of classical music. No, really! The first is with Brendan Slocumb, whose new book, <em>The Violin Conspiracy</em>, is a mystery surrounding a musician trying to recover his stolen violin. It's also about how hard it is to be a Black classical musician, Slocumb told NPR's Asma Khalid. The second is Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman's conversation with NPR's Scott Simon. Hindman's memoir <em>Sounds Like Titanic</em> follows her experience touring with an orchestra that wasn't really performing for the audience.",
