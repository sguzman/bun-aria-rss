  "description": "<p>Justin Alexander was on episode 143, and returns now in a two-part conversation. The first part took place on Venice Beach a few weeks ago, and Part II happened here in Chiang Mai, Thailand. We talk about Justin's 18,000 miles on a motorcycle in the American west, as well as his visit to a hunter-gatherer village in the Philippines and our recent motorcycle trip to a town call Pai, in the mountains north of Chiang Mai. Always fun to chat with this guy.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
