  "description": "Si isn't exactly sure what Dogecoin is, but he predicts it's going to the moon!  Godwin is judging JD HARD for wearing socks at the beach, and Si doesn't understand why anyone would hit the beach in socks when you're supposed to be ... nude? Godwin shows off his extremely flat feet in all their shoeless glory. Martin sings the praises of gas station fried chicken and hog head cheese. Si doesn't buy what the media's telling him about the skyrocketing price of lumber. The boys deliver a crash course on marriage thanks to Bill and Melinda Gates. JD gives Si literal chill bumps with a story about a humble hero who saved a little girl's life. Si reveals the one thing he won't eat from a fast food place, Martin lays down his one rule about fast food, and the Duck Call Room weighs in on favorite fast food joints (and which ones should be kicked to the curb).\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
