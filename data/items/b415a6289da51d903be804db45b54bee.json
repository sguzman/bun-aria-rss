Even though things are starting to open in many places, we all are facing a world which is dramatically different to the one we knew before the pandemic—so many things are uncertain, which only exacerbates our collective mental distress. Thankfully, as I discuss in this week’s blog and podcast with world-renowned psychiatrist, brain specialist and best-selling author Dr. Daniel Amen, there are ways we can take our mental and brain health into our own hands! The human brain is remarkably resilient: over time we can heal our minds and find freedom, purpose and renewal in an imperfect world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Special offers from our sponsors:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Ritual (my favorite multivitamins): To get 10% off your first three months of Ritual multivitamins see: https://ritual.com/drleaf &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-BetterHelp (the best online counseling app): To get 10% off BetterHelp counseling during your first month see: https://trybetterhelp.com/drleaf &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-SEED (my favorite probiotic!): Visit https://seed.com and use code MENTALMESS for 15% off your first month of the Daily Synbiotic&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Podcast Time Stamps&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-3:06 How the Vietnam War inspire Dr. Amen’s love for medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-7:30 ADHD: a story of how one boy overcame his symptoms, and how psychiatry has changed over human history&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-17:25 Why we need to start changing the current mental health narrative&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-24:43 What to do to have a healthy brain and love your life&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-38:10 Why you need to spend time building your brain every day&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-40:11 Head trauma, brain injuries and mental health&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-46:27 The best habit for a healthy brain&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more info on Dr. Amen and to get his books visit: https://www.amenclinics.com/&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additional Resources: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Get my new brain detox app SWITCH on sale now!
