  "description": "Dr. Thomas A. Wayment, professor of Classics at Brigham Young University, has done something remarkable — he has retranslated the New Testament. This new translation from the best available Greek manuscripts, entitled, The New Testament: A Translation for Latter-day Saints(Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 2019), renders the New Testament text into modern English and is sensitive to Latter-day Saint beliefs and practices. It is also readable and accessible for a wide range of readers. The original paragraph structure of the New Testament is restored and highlights features such as quotations, hymns, and poetic passages. New and extensive notes provide alternative translations, commentary on variant manuscript traditions, and historical insights. Where applicable, the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible has been included, and the notes contain the most complete list of cross-references to New Testament passages in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants that has ever been assembled. In our discussion, Dr. Wayment gives us exciting insights into how he translated the New Testament, along with his thoughts on Jesus Christ, the Pauline epistles, the role of women in the early church, and more. It’s a fun and fascinating conversation!\nDaniel P. Stone holds a PhD in American religious history from Manchester Metropolitan University (United Kingdom) and is the author of William Bickerton: Forgotten Latter Day Prophet (Signature Books, 2018). He has taught history courses at the University of Detroit Mercy and Florida Atlantic University, and currently, he works as a research archivist for a private library/archive in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
