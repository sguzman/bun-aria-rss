  "description": "<p>In this 69th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. In this episode, we begin by discussing power, race and social media, specifically regarding the app Clubhouse. We talk about how Covid outcomes are affected by preexisting conditions, such as obesity and hypertension. We ask: should children be vaccinated, and are the reasons being proposed to do so justified? We review a truly sexist obituary of an esteemed scientist, and ask what should be done about it. And we review a new finding in octopi. <br/><br/>DarkHorse merchandise now available at: store.darkhorsepodcast.org <br/><br/>Find more from us on Bret’s website (https://bretweinstein.net) or Heather’s website (http://heatherheying.com). <br/><br/>Become a member of the DarkHorse LiveStreams, and get access to an additional Q&A livestream every month.
