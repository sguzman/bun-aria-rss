  "description": "<p>Growing up in northern California, <a href=\"https://kyleabryant.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Bryant</a> (https://kyleabryant.com/) loved being outside and being active. But, his late teens would change everything. He began experiencing a loss in balance, coordination and strength. A battery of doctors and tests eventually led to a diagnosis of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA), a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease that currently has no treatment or cure. While grappling with this diagnosis and all it meant, Kyle discovered cycling, and, along with it, a new lease on freedom. He's now completed numerous ultra-distance rides including \"The World's Toughest Bike Race\", Race Across America in 2010, as part of 4-man Team FARA which is the subject of the documentary The Ataxian. He is the co-host of the Two Disabled Dudes Podcast and the author of a moving new memoir, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31R1QaR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Shifting Into High Gear</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/31R1QaR). Bryant is also the founder and director of the bicycle ride fundraiser, rideATAXIA for the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA). rideATAXIA is currently held annually in 6 locations and has raised over $7 million for Friedreich's ataxia (FA) research since 2007.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
