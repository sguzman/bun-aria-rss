  "description": "<p>This week we are kicking off the first in our Lifelong Learners Series with Casey Rose Wilson. Casey joins Jessica to lead a discussion on the Art of Small Talk, let us tell you the masters are at work, honey! Don't worry, June is along for the ride as a lifelong learner herself. Casey and Jessica discuss how to scan the room, increase verbal skills (lie), become ‘dog creepers’, and how weather is ALWAYS a great opener. Then, June has Casey and Jessica role-play some small talk scenarios which include the big three: engaging, pivoting, and appropriately ending your small talk. And yes, Home Goods is used to set the scene. Remember Deep Divers, even if you’re not a small talker, you can still refuse to pay full price for fabulous.</p><p><br /> </p><p>Visit the Pinterest Board <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://pinterest.com/thedeepdive__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!bvoIYdIgmE7KcXmQhQQF4ldnS_6bdqPM48PQ0lJqsKcUXwR2BsNGSJxf4VSW6_-E6LQegF6RWX0vmUkybCJG3a0$\">pinterest.com/thedeepdive</a></p><p>You can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod</p><p>June Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram</p><p>Jessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram</p><p>Check out the Jane Club at <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.janeclub.com__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!bvoIYdIgmE7KcXmQhQQF4ldnS_6bdqPM48PQ0lJqsKcUXwR2BsNGSJxf4VSW6_-E6LQegF6RWX0vmUkyqLNhhAU$\">www.janeclub.com</a></p><p>Send us your The Deep Dive theme or any questions you might have to <a href=\"mailto:thedeepdive@earwolf.com\">thedeepdive@earwolf.com</a></p>\n",
