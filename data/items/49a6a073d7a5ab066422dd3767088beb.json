  "description": "<p>YOU CAN’T DISMISS PAIN. So many of us try to cover up our pain. We eat too much, buy too much, and drink too much in order to not feel anything. I used to avoid my feelings. I didn’t have the tools to process heartache and loss so I found another outlet: inflicting pain on the football field. But pain doesn’t just disappear- it will find another way of coming to the surface. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Brene Brown where she explained how hate is just a mask for pain. Dr. Brené Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston where she holds the Huffington Brené Brown Endowed Chair at The Graduate College of Social Work. She has spent the past fourteen years studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and is the author of three #1 New York Times bestsellers – The Gifts of Imperfection, Daring Greatly, and Rising Strong. If you look at the world today, people are pointing fingers looking for someone to blame so they don’t have to confront what’s inside. We are much better at causing pain than feeling pain. Learn how to tolerate discomfort in Episode 882.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nHow Brene thinks we can heal the country (2:00)<br />\nThe reason why people hate (2:30)<br />\nHow Lewis had trouble dealing with loss (03:00)<br />\nThe toxic type of leadership you need to be aware of (4:00)<br />\nIf you enjoyed this episode, check out the video, show notes and more at http://www.lewishowes.com/882 and follow at www.instagram.com/lewishowes</p>\n",
