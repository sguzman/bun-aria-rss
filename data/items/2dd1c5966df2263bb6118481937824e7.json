But according to Sadowski, planting a tree or donating a dollar is not a path to achieving meaningful change. “The focus should be on reducing emissions. That’s what the science says, that’s what the NGOs work in the science-based target initiatives [say] — we must decarbonise all sectors, at a much more ambitious pace,” says Sadowski.</p> </li> <li> <p>A brand’s messaging about sustainability is important, too. Providing accessible information on progress — and missteps — goes a long way.
