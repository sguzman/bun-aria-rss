  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming Kevin to the show who wrote, \"I had an encounter that was exactly like one of your other guests. When I heard his story I almost fell off my chair.”</p> <p>I spoke to Kevin yesterday and he said, “I had the exact same encounter as one of your previous guests, it happened in the exact same location as his in fact I played the encounter for family and friends. My family and friends have always laughed at me and when I played the encounter nobody was laughing. My encounter happened several years ago and where your guest describes being escorted out, that is exactly what happen to me. This thing paced me out knocking down everything in its way and when I would stop it would stop when I would continue it would continue. As your guest was describing the location I knew every detail in fact where he describes the creature stopping as he came out of the wood line is exactly where it stopped when it was chasing me.”</p> <p>I will be also welcoming Timothy Renner to the show. Tim writes \"I just published my second book which is called Bigfoot in Pennsylvania: A History of Wild-Men, Gorillas, and Other Hairy Monsters in the Keystone State. It is all historical accounts from the 1830s through the 1920s which I have compiled from old newspaper articles.</p> <p>In this way, it is kind of like Sasquatch Chronicles in that it's just filled with encounters. I have added some commentary at the end of each chapter - but this mostly is my reasoning as to why I think the \"wild man\" in an article is referring to a bigfoot creature (for instance if the \"wild-man\" is 8 ft tall and covered in hair). Throughout the early 1920s there was a wave of sightings in PA - many of them quite aggressive - with multiple attacks on people, livestock, and cars noted in the articles. Many behaviors are noted throughout the articles which I recognized from being an avid listener of SC.</p> <p>I know you don't often have authors on - but I figured I would at least let you know the book is 'out there' and let you decide.</p> <p>All the best\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Timothy's book <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/dp/154551397X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493934153&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a> and his website, Strange Familiars, <a href=\"https://www.strangefamiliars.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p> <p> </p>",
