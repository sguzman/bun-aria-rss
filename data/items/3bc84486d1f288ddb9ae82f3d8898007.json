  "description": "<p>Welcome back to the Art of Manliness podcast!<br />Why are men in American falling behind? What’s caused their decline in the past 50 years? Many sociologists argue that driving forces are economic and cultural in nature. But our guest today disagrees and proposes that biology (or rather humans messing with it) is the main force behind the decline of men in the West.<br />His name is Dr. Lionel Tiger and he’s the author of the book, The Decline of Males: The First Look at an Unexpected New World for Men and Women. Dr. Tiger is the Charles Darwin Professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University. He has written several articles and books on how human biology effects social interaction. Dr. Tiger is also a pioneer in a new academic discipline called male studies.</p>\n",
