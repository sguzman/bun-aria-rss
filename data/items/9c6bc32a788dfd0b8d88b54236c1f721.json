  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the massive college admissions-bribery case detailed by government investigators on Tuesday in Boston. In hundreds of pages, investigators lay out an allegedly brazen scheme for the wealthy and powerful to bribe and cheat their way into the nation's top universities. Many of the scams involved applicants posing at athletic recruits, who often don't face the same stringent admissions standards as others. Also talked about is James Dolan, who in an interview with ESPN radio talked about his banning a fan who told the Knicks' owner to sell the team. Also discussed is player movement in the NFL, where the Giants traded receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns and the Jets signed running back Le'Veon Bell, who sat out last season and forfeited his $15 million salary. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
