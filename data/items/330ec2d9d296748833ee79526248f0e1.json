  "description": "Contributor(s): Jonathan Reynolds | The COVID-19 emergency is testing the protective capacity of welfare states in the most dramatic way. In virtue of their scale and nature, only the state can respond to on-going challenges, but policy responses need to be understood in relation to the capacity of different systems to provide protection and support. Prior to the COVID crisis, recent years had seen a growing debate around different approaches to address human needs: these differed in a variety of ways – in terms of type and coverage of provision, level of generosity and conditionality arrangements – which in turn reflected different priorities and policy goals. The new issue of the LSE Public Policy Review, ‘Beveridge 2.0: The Supportive State’ discusses a range of these approaches, from Universal Basic Income and Universal Capital Grants to Universal Basic Services. It also addresses the radical changes that have affected the development of social security systems and tries to understand contemporary challenges to provide human security more broadly.\nFurther information about the event and how to attend is available via the LSE Events.\nA podcast of this event is available to download here.\n \nChair:\nProfessor Tony Travers\nAssociate DeanSchool of Public Policy, LSE\nRespondent:\nJonathan Reynolds\nShadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions\nGuests:\nProfessor Oriana Bandiera\nSir Anthony Atkinson Professor of EconomicsDepartment of Economics, LSE\nProfessor Julian LeGrand\nProfessor of Social PolicyMarshall Institute for Philanthropy and Social Entrepeneurship, LSE\nDr Abigail McKnight\nDirectorCentre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, LSE\n \nThe LSE Public Policy Review issue 'The Supportive State' is now available online here with contributions from:\n\nNidhi Parekh and Oriana Bandiera (Economics, LSE)\nDavid Piachaud (Social Policy, LSE)\nMaitreesh Ghatak and Xavier Jaravel (Economics, LSE)\nMalcolm Torry (Social Policy, LSE)\nJulian Le Grand (Marshall Institute, LSE)\nIan Gough (Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion/ Grantham Institute, LSE)\nMary Kaldor (International Development, LSE)\n\nThe Beveridge 2.0 Redifining the Social Contract is programme hosted by the School of Public Policy that aims at bringing the LSE community together with the intent of exploring important policy questions, fostering dialogue across disciplines and identifying avenues for collaborative cross-disciplinary research.",
