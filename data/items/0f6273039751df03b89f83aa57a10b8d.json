  "description": "General Mark Hertling served for 37 years in the U.S. military, rising to become Commanding General of the U.S. Army Europe.  Since his retirement, he has become well-known as a commentator on television and on social media.  He discusses what went wrong between Trump and \"his generals\", the current level of dysfunction within the U.S. national security establishment, its impact on our allies, our security and morale in the military.  He also speculates as to whether or not, it may actually be helpful for the U.S. to have a president like Donald Trump every so often--in much the same way that a heart-attack may help a smoker give up cigarettes.
