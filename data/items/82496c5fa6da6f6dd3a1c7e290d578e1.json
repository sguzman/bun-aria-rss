  "description": "<p>We start the show in a world where Big Cat doesn’t know Andy Dalton is about to be the Bears QB and PFT celebrates Ryan Fitzpatrick’s signing in Washington (4:04 - 23:33). Breaking Moos brings us the Dalton move and instant reaction (23:33 - 30:34). Hot seat/cool throne and Billy’s long awaited QB bracket (30:34 - 48:09). Mark Titus joins the show to break down the Bracket, Brad Stevens to Indiana, sleepers, how good Gonzaga is and Big Ten excuses just in case (48:09 - 105:51). We finish with FAQ’s.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
