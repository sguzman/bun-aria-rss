  "description": "<p>The unit commitment problem (UC) is crucial for the operation and market\nmechanism of power systems. With the development of modern electricity, the\nscale of power systems is expanding, and solving the UC problem is also\nbecoming more and more difficult. To this end, this paper proposes a new fast\nsolution method based on Lagrangian relaxation and dynamic program-ming.\nFirstly, the UC solution is estimated to be an initial trial UC solution by a\nfast method based on Lagrangian relaxation. This initial trial UC solution\nfully considers the system-wide con-straints. Secondly, a dynamic programming\nmodule is introduced to adjust the trial UC solution to make it satisfy the\nunit-wise constraints. Thirdly, a method for constructing a feasible UC\nsolution is proposed based on the adjusted trial UC solution. Specifically, a\nfeasibility-testing model and an updating strategy for the trial UC solution\nare established in this part. Numerical tests are implemented on IEEE 24-bus,\nIEEE 118-bus, Polish 2383-bus, and French 6468-bus systems, which verify the\neffec-tiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\n</p>",
