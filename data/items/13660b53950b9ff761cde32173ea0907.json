  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Biden-Sanders unity task force recommendations are laced with words about American inequity, massive control over neighborhoods, and how they plan to negatively impact every single job in the country. Biden has plans to financially bail out every poorly-run city, new gun confiscation programs, and expanded rights for illegal aliens. This is not a people's movement because the people have nothing to do with it! It's a top-down centralized government that Karl Marx would be proud of. Later, in future a Biden administration Hunter Biden won't have an office in the West Wing, he'll have an office in Beijing. While Biden campaign staffers claim that the Obama-Biden was scandal-free, Americans know that Obama and then-CIA Director John Brennan authorized spying on members of Congress as well as reporters. It seems that they've forgotten about Tara Reade too. Then, Steve Bannon has been arrested yet the media seems to be more interested in connecting President Trump to Bannon than with anything else. The media gave Barack Obama a pass whenever he brought the Muslim Brotherhood into the White House. Obama had a love fest with the Castro's and Abbas in Syria and the media never covered that.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
