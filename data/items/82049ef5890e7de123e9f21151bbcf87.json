  "description": "Here in the United States, bail can be an enormous deciding factor on who goes to prison and who doesn’t. And for how long they go or don’t go...regardless of guilt or not. \nBut do you know how the bail system really works? Who profits from it? Who is put at a detriment because of it? Likely not. So we’re dissecting the bail system—and getting real about its inherent, systemic issues. \nToday on Business Casual, I’m interviewing Adam Foss, a widely respected criminal justice reform advocate and an advisor to the Bail Project. He’ll explain precisely how the bail system fits into the broader private prison ecosystem in the United States. A small taste?\n\nDid you know the concept of bail dates back to feudal England? And really hasn’t been meaningfully rethought since serfs were a thing?\n\nOr that some bail funds pick and choose which incarcerated people to help, while others take an “anything goes” approach, regardless of alleged offense?\n\n\nThere’s so much more to learn.\nAnd after a summer of reading the words “donate to bail funds” over and over again, it’s high time you get an idea of what bail funds actually do...and why they want to be put out of business. \nListen now.",
