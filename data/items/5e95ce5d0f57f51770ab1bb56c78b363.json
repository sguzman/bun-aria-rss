  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything seems pressing in the early years of motherhood. The baby’s diaper, the promised game of tag, and the dirty upstairs bathroom repeatedly demand our attention. It can be easy to feel bogged down by the everyday and lose sight of the bigger picture. In this episode, Emily and Laura interview Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth about building habits of faithfulness in every season of life. Nancy has impacted millions of women worldwide through her ministries, Revive Our Hearts and the True Woman movement. She’s a prolific writer, speaker, radio host; and she’s wife to Robert. It may be hard to see past the early years of motherhood in the moment, but when we’re 40, 50, or 60 years old, we’ll see the spiritual impact of the daily choices we make right now. If we want to breathe the gospel in and out, we need a steady habit of seeking God through his word.</span></p> <p><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-132-habits-of-faithfulness-in-every-season-an-interview-with-nancy-wolgemuth-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-132-habits-of-faithfulness-in-every-season-an-interview-with-nancy-wolgemuth\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/75993/Copy_of_Regular_format-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p>",
