  "description": "In the fight to combat high inflation, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have embarked on aggressive tightening paths. But how much damage to economic growth will they ultimately have to inflict to win this fight? In the latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist and head of Goldman Sachs Research, and Olivier Blanchard, C. Fred Bergsten Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute, debate whether the Fed can rebalance an overheated labor market — a key requirement to tame inflation — without a sharp rise in unemployment. This episode is based off of Goldman Sachs’ latest Top of Mind report.",
