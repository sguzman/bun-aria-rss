  "description": "<p>Recently we (Alex &amp; Tatiana) were invited to give lectures about machine learning at\n<a href=\"http://gsfp.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/\">GradDays</a> —\nan event that is organized twice a year at the <a href=\"http://gsfp.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/\">Heidelberg University</a> \n(Germany’s oldest university).</p>\n\n<p>GradDays are giving courses that broaden the physics knowledge of students and teach specialized useful techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Program of GradDays included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Black Holes and Quantum Gravity Constraints on Field Theories</li>\n  <li>Correlated Quantum Dynamics of Ultracold Few- to Many-Body Systems</li>\n  <li>Quantum Simulation with Quantum Optical Systems</li>\n  <li>The formation of structure in cosmology</li>\n  <li>Solar System Exploration Missions and their Scientific Outcome</li>\n  <li>Quantum Field Theory in Extreme Environments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>as well as <a href=\"http://gsfp.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/graddays/index.php?m=2\">other sweet things</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, our course <strong>“Machine learning and applications in Science and Industry”</strong> was the most popular.\nFocus of the course (heavily influenced by time constraints: only 4 days) \nwas to give a <strong>wide overview</strong> of useful models in Machine Learning and their applications in very different areas, \nand even contained optional practice!</p>\n\n<p>That’s why we put inside many <em>interactive demonstrations</em> of machine learning techniques!</p>\n\n<p>Also we tried to create a nice bridge between models and their real-life applications.\nMany of the examples were from particle physics — an area that we’re working in \n(tracking, tagging, reweighting, uniform boosting, particle identification, simulation refinement, \ntuning of simulation parameters, etc.). \nHowever we also included some notable examples from other data-intensive areas: astronomy, neuroscience, medicine, climatology and biology.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, many other interesting things done with machine learning were discussed: \nspam detection, search engines, visual recognition, kinect and AlphaGo, recommender systems and news clustering.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/360y3XpmIhKlJN\" width=\"700\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;
