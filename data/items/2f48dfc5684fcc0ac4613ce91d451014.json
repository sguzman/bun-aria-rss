But none of their creations are quite as iconic as the DeathAdder.\n\nFor years, the DeathAdder has been one of the most popular head clickers in esports. From League of Legends to Valorant, pros have made history with this mouse in their hands.\n\nRazer has released several new and upgraded DeathAdders over the years - and it all culminated in this: The DeathAdder V3 Pro.
