Dan, who's just written a book about his experience called \"Money Men,\" explains how he first spotted problems at what was once described as \"Europe's greatest fintech,\" and how hard it was to convince others of the truth. Rather than going after Wirecard itself, German authorities went after the journalists and short-sellers who were warning of the scheme.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
