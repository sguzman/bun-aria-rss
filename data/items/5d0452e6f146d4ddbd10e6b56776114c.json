  "title": "Author Tessa Hadley writes a juicy tale of the bourgeois in 'Free Love'",
  "description": "Author Tess Hadley's new novel opens with an affair, but that's not really what the book is about. <em>Free Love</em> is set in the 1960s just outside of London and it starts with a wealthy woman in her 40s, Phyllis, sharing a secret kiss with a much younger man who is not her husband (gasp). The kiss has unintended consequences and Phyllis has to figure out what she really wants out of life. Hadley told NPR's Elissa Nadworny that being part of the bourgeois is not something she's familiar with, but she loves to write about it because she doesn't think that world exists anymore.",
