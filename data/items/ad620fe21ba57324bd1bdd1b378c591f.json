  "description": "<p>We don’t want you to cancel the holidays- we want you to cancel the overconsumption and debt that typically accompanies the holiday season. Americans racked up an average of $1,325 last year- how much more of a problem will it be this year as so many folks are still reeling from the impact of covid?! For many of us, our default way of thinking is that in order to have a “successful and fun” holiday season, we need to spend a ton of money. Even for frugal folks like us, it can be easy to get caught up in all the spending even if we are able to avoid the debt. So during this episode we talk about ways to resist overconsumption and how to enjoy the holidays without going overboard.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed an Owl Theory by Fieldwork Brewing Company- a big thanks to Tim for donating this one to the show!
