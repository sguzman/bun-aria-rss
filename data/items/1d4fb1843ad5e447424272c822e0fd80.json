  "title": "#90 - Rich Kid Gone Rogue - The Dishonestness of Byron McLaughlin",
  "description": "<p>This week, we dive deep into the story of a man who a mediocre talent, but had a penchant for lying, and scamming that knew no bounds. He started life with everything, and went to school with movie stars, but that didn't stop him from ending up in some of the lowest situations a person could find themselves. He was both a common drug dealer, and an international counterfeiter. Born with a silver spoon, he went from playing catch on the beach with Sandy Koufax, to being a gun toting guy, with an attitude problem that got him pushed out of major league baseball, then wanted by federal, state, and international authorities. A real peach of a fella.Sell a mountain of cocaine to a police officer, be the most hated man in the world of sneakers, and bribe your way out of a North African prison with Byron McLaughlin!!Check us out, every Tuesday.
