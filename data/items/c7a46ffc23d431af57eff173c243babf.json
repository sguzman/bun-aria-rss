  "description": "2011-09-21 - Part 2 - Do You Make Regular Visits to Yourself?  - These two classes cover the basic instructions for Buddhist mindfulness (vipassana or insight) meditation.  The first class explores the attitude we bring to meditation that makes it rewarding, and the training that helps us in \"coming back\" from thoughts. The second class guides us in \"being here,\" in cultivating a mindful awareness that recognizes and accepts what is happening in the present moment. Both classes include guided meditations and valuable reminders that can support you in developing a rich meditation practice.
