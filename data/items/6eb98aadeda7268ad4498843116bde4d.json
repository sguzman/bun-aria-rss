  "description": "In today's Daily Podcast we follow up on the Panama Papers' investigation, and, like everyone else, wait for the expected shoes to drop. BAE warns that Qbot has become more aware, more evasive, and harder to block. Cisco's Talos predicts the disturbing rise of \"crytpoworms.\" The US Federal CIO warns of the risks inherent in legacy systems. Guy Guzner from FireGlass helps us sort out the Panama Papers speculation, and Markus Rauschecker wonders if the FBI will have better luck convincing Apple to unlock another iPhone. And we take a trip down memory lane with the unlamented legacy code represented by Clippy.",
