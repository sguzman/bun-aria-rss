  "title": "89 - Joan of Arc",
  "description": "<p>Joan of Arc was BURNED ALIVE on May 30th, 1431 CE, something no one ever aspires to have written on their obituary. She fought to end the Hundred Years' War between England and France on behalf of Charles VII, the King of France she would help crown. How did a rural farmer's daughter with no military training end up in charge of thousands of French soldiers? Why did Charles even allow a seventeen year old girl into the army in an age when women didn't go to war? Prophecies fulfilled, battles fought and won, a heroine captured and then burned alive, and so much more on this Game of Thrones-esque 15th century Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Today's Timesuck is brought to you by AmeriGas!
