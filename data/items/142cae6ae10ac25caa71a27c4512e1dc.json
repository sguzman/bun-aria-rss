  "description": "<p>This week I talk to Jake Bilbro, award-winning winemaker and winegrower of Limerick Lane Cellars in the Russian River of Sonoma. We discuss his family's history in Sonoma, how he came to own Limerick Lane, and his winemaking philosophies. A fascinating look at a young, famed small producer who represents the heart and soul of Sonoma. </p> <p>Some show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Limerick Lane is a 30-acre estate in the northeast part of the Russian River valley in Sonoma County, California</li> <li>The vineyards were originally planted in 1910. Much of it is old vine Zinfandel and field blends of varietals interspersed with Zin, Syrah, Grenache and other grapes. </li> <li>Jake is a 4th generation winemaker and winegrower -- his passion and positivity is contagious! </li> <li>He makes outstanding rosé, Zinfandel, Syrah, and Rhône blends. </li> </ul> <p>He's also participating in the <a href= \"http://www.undergroundwineevents.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sonoma Underground event</a> of small producers that I've co-founded! </p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em> *Note -- the podcast was recorded in the tasting room of Limerick Lane, so there is ambient noise.
