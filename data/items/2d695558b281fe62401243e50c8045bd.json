  "description": "<p>Happy October 39th, where Christine doesn’t know exponents and Em doesn’t know calendars. Em tells the story of Anneliese Michel, the inspiration for the Exorcism of Emily Rose and one of the truest proofs of demonic possession in recorded history. Meanwhile, Christine talks about the Axeman of New Orleans, who chisels some panels and taps some faces. (It’s like the Purge, but with jazz music.)<br />If there’s one thing you take away from this episode, we hope it’s the fact that we’re modern-day jesters, and Gio is the Venn diagram of our love. I promise that makes more sense in context. I think.<br />Don’t forget to check out our incredible sponsors, Mack Weldon (promo code “Drink”) and Hello Fresh (promo code “Drink30”). You won’t regret it.</p>\n",
