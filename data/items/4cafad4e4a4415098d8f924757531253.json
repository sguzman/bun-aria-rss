  "description": "<p>The health of our digestive system greatly impacts the health of our whole body.<strong> </strong>This is because our gut is designed to help us digest food, absorb nutrients, keep invaders out, and even produce helpful compounds like the neurotransmitter serotonin, among so many other powerful functions. This is why the whole body will suffer when the gut is out of balance.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Stanley Hazen about how the microbiome can influence disease risk and why this is an essential piece to the future of medicine. He also talks to Dr. David Perlmutter about how what we eat influences everything from our mood to our tiniest gut friends—microbes—and how well they function and fight off invaders.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Stanley Hazen is both the chair of the Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine at the Lerner Research Institute and section head of Preventive Cardiology & Rehabilitation at the Heart and Vascular Institute of the Cleveland Clinic.
