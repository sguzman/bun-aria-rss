  "description": "<p>Charlie is LIVE from the University of Texas Austin as part of Turning Point USA's Live Free tour. Charlie reflects on his tabling event on UT Austin's campus that happened prior to this speech, and he reflects on the recurring theme that came up over and over again with the students he interacted with: Who is Charlie to determine what is right and wrong? Who is any man or woman? Charlie breaks down how the Founders dealt with that very question, and where they garnered their moral authority to determine, shape, and architect a moral framework based on eternal truths. What are the ramifications of their decisions and what would happen if we abandoned them now? Do different cultures have different truths? Complete with a LIVE Q+A with UTA students, this is a must listen episode of The Charlie Kirk Show. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
