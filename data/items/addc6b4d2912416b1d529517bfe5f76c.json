  "description": "David Sanger of the New York Times discusses how the Trump Administration's decision to pull out of the INF Treaty because of Russian non-compliance may be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the unwinding of the foundational nuclear agreements of the past several decades.  He describes why the INF was widely regarded as a successful agreement and why the rise of new powers may make it hard to put back together again.  And then he discusses how its undoing might also lead to the end of the key ICBM-related treaty our countries have.  And for good measure we chat about the latest in Trump-Russia and the oddity of a president who can't seem to get anyone to accept what is often considered the second most powerful job in Washington.
