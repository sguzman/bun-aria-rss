  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, The issue isn’t why John Brennan had his security clearance revoked, the issue is why he ever had a security clearance in the first place. How did he even become a CIA director when he voted for Gus Hall, the leader of the communist party USA, for President. Also, what did the Obama administration staff do with their security clearance when they were in government? They did nothing effective with it to stop the Russians from interfering in our election and didn’t stop China from stealing our technology. Of course, the media comes to his defense which may mean he may have been a source feeding them information through leaks. Security clearance is a privilege, not a right of retirement. The Democrats are free to say what they want but do not have a right to have classified information when they leave. It’s the President's prerogative to issue or revoke such access to classified information. We still haven't gotten to the bottom of the unmasking issue. We don't know who did what. Then, NY Governor Andrew Cuomo says that America was never great. The political left doesn't feel like they can gain power, expand power, or propagate their message unless they preach hatred for America. The Cuomo's have benefited greatly from America yet trash her just the same. Finally, John Heubusch calls in to discuss his new book, The Second Coming (A Thriller).\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
