  "description": "Vasco Pedro talks about growing up in Portugal, the lessons learned in military boarding school from the age of 10, his love of coding and building things, and how he was always pushing himself to do better and why team surfing trips, and mock battles are part of the Unbabel culture. We hear him being open about his mistakes and his view of Steve Jobs’ concept of “reality distortion”. He talks about the ups and downs of being a YC company. We also get an insider’s view of how the translation industry is being disrupted by the combination of tremendous cost reductions and speed enhancements that their AI technology brings to the market.\nThe NBN Entrepreneurship and Leadership podcast aims to educate and entertain, sharing insights based on the personal story of our carefully selected guests aiming for the atmosphere of an informal conversation in a bar or over a cup of coffee.\nAbout our guest\nVasco is the CEO of Unbabel, we are eliminating language barriers by combining machine translation and human post editing.
