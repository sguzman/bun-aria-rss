  "description": "<div>On this week's podcast:<br>\n<br>\nFor the cover of the magazine Kate Andrews assesses the politics of panic, and the fallout of last week's so-called fiscal event. She is joined by Robert Colvile, director of the Centre for Policy Studies think tank to discuss where the Conservatives go from here (00:57).<br>\n<br>\nAlso this week:<br>\n<br>\nDoes the future belong to Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland?<br>\n<br>\nThis is the claim that Jenny McCartney makes in this week's <em>Spectator. </em>We speak with journalist<em> </em>Melanie McDonagh and politician Mairia Cahill about what this could mean for Irish reunification (15:58).<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally:<br>\n<br>\nAre red kites magnificent or a menace?<br>\n<br>\nPaul Sargeanton says in his article for <em>The Spectator </em>that red kites should have never been reintroduced back into the UK. His claim is contested by naturalist and author of <em>The Red Kites Year,</em> Ian Carter (28:19).<br>\n<br>\nHosted by Lara Prendergast and William Moore.Â <br>\n<br>\nProduced by Oscar Edmondson.</div>\n",
