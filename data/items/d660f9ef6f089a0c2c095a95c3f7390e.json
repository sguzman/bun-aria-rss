You can also take a look at his (still growing) list of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Cohen%2C+M+B\" class=\"liinternal\">publications on arxiv</a>. In fact I know of an upcoming major paper so stay tuned (the premises are in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9-DkECZCE\" class=\"liinternal\">Yin Tat&#8217;s talk</a> at the symposium).</p>\n<p>As always when remembering this tragic loss my thoughts go to Michael&#8217;s family.</p>\n",
