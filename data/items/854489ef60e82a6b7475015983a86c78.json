  "description": "<p>Today's show is highlighted by three incredible interviews. First, The Problem Child, Jake Paul joins Pat and AJ to chat about his upcoming fight with Tyron Woodley, his boxing career as a whole, when he decided he wanted to take boxing seriously, how much involvement he has in the presentation of his fight cards, his beef with Pete Davidson, and much more (27:31-48:43). Next, NCAA National Champion and new Gold Medal Winner, Gable Dan Steveson joins the show to chat about his incredible Olympic Gold medal match in wrestling, whether he's been contacted by the WWE or UFC after his meteoric rise, how things were in Tokyo, what's next for him, and what he ultimately wants to do with his career (48:45-1:09:23). Later, 2x Olympic Gold Medal winner, the most prolific scorer in US women's soccer history, Carli Lloyd, joins the show to chat about her career, how things have changed in women's soccer from the time she stepped on to the scene to now, if the weight of being the greatest women's soccer team in the world was ever too much to handle, what she plans on doing once she hangs the soccer boots up, and much more (1:10:56-1:28:42).
