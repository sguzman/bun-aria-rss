  "description": "<p><p>The people at Giants games are not great looking. Highlights are too long. John experiments with telling the truth. No one is good at human interaction. ESPN overpays people. Stephen A is inspiring the youth. Magicians, hypnotists, and mentalists. Voicemails include: Dating During the Playoffs, get out of jail free card, music before or after you were born.</p><p>Nikki Glaser stops by to chat about her new special \"Bangin\" and the roast scene. Why she isn't into orgasms anymore, how guys should eat more pussy, the dating app Raya, and roasting Caitlin Jenner.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
