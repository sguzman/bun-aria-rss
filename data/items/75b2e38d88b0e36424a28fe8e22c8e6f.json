  "description": "<p>Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) aims to generate a correct\nsentence from an erroneous sequence, where different kinds of errors are mixed.\nThis paper divides the CGEC task into two steps, namely spelling error\ncorrection and grammatical error correction. Specifically, we propose a novel\nzero-shot approach for spelling error correction, which is simple but\neffective, obtaining a high precision to avoid error accumulation of the\npipeline structure. To handle grammatical error correction, we design\npart-of-speech (POS) features and semantic class features to enhance the neural\nnetwork model, and propose an auxiliary task to predict the POS sequence of the\ntarget sentence. Our proposed framework achieves a 42.11 F0.5 score on CGEC\ndataset without using any synthetic data or data augmentation methods, which\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a wide margin of 1.30 points.\nMoreover, our model produces meaningful POS representations that capture\ndifferent POS words and convey reasonable POS transition rules.\n</p>",
