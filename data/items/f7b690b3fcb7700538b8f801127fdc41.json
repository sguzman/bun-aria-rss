    "media:description": "#chinainsights \nThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, has attracted global attention. On the first day of its opening, the Consul General of the Chinese Consulate in Manchester, England, personally came out to a protest scene and beat up a Hong Kong protestor who was protesting peacefully, causing shockwaves in Britain. \nThe term war-wolf diplomacy surfaced around 2019 when Zhao Lijian used Twitter to slam foreign voices critical of China. Since then, other Chinese diplomats have joined the bandwagon, taking an aggressive posture abroad. It is fair to say that until 2019, little attention was paid to Zhao, but his tough and belligerent rhetorical style, both officially and online, quickly and radically changed the way China communicates with its allies and adversaries, spreading to the entire Chinese diplomatic circle. It replaced a decades-long tedious blend of roundabout diplomatic rhetoric and convoluted communist clichés that had characterized China's public statements before. \n\nHave questions?
