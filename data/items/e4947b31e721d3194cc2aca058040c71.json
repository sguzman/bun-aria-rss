  "description": "Our audiobook this week is STUCK WITH A DATE by Georgia Coffman\n\nIt’s all fun and games… until my ex-girlfriend wins a date with me.\n\nI only agreed to do the bachelor auction because it’s for a good cause. But I never signed up to go out with the woman who up and ran out on me, taking our dog—and my heart—with her.\n\nAt first, I refuse. I don’t trust her, or myself.\n\nBecause the moment I lay eyes on Micah again, I’m too easily reminded of how good we were together.\n\nOur chemistry is still undeniable.\n\nAnd Micah has a few surprises up the sleeve of her fitted shirt.\n\nShe’s persistent. Gorgeous and confident too. Which is all a dangerous combination.\n\nAfter all, I’m only human, and the temptation is too much to ignore as we share unexpected laughs over drinks and a show.\n\nIf I’m not careful, I might end up with more than just a fun night out with an entertaining woman.\n\nI may even give her my heart… again.\n\nebook of STUCK WITH A DATE: https://amzn.to/3KXTAMO\nSTUCK WITH THE BILLIONAIRE: https://amzn.to/3irqUzs\nSTUCK WITH THE MOVIE STAR: https://amzn.to/352EK8k\n\nMore Georgia Coffman eBooks: https://amzn.to/36EBHn8\nGiveaway (signed paperback): https://bit.ly/3L1iHhy\n\nIf you&#039;re looking for those chapters from the Lady Listener with the hot husband & wedding cake we got you! Click Me! MaryCarsonBooks.com/ReadMeRomance\n\nDocumentary - The Queen of Versailles\nNext Week - Jaycee Wolfe https://bit.ly/3N9DrFU\n\nOTHER BOOKS MENTIONED\n\nMel \n\nHER PRISON PEN PAL by Dani Wyatt\nHARD CANDY by Jisa Dean\nENDLESS OBSESSION by Alex Grayson\nTEACH ME SOMETHING DIRTY by Alex Grayson\n\nLea\nUNDER ONE ROOF by Ali Hazelwood\nFROM LUKOV WITH LOVE Ali Hazelwood\n\nADS PLAYED BEFORE PODCAST\n\nDEATH WISH by K Webster\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3Jrv32y\nAmazon INTL: https://getbook.at/9g5OLb\niBooks: https://apple.co/3qsjIHX\nNook: https://bit.ly/2WQpFlS\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3HiCwza\nGPlay: https://bit.ly/3AFoXI8\n\nALPHA&#039;S FIRE by Renee Rose & Lee Savino\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/36lCfia\nAmazon INTL: https://geni.us/tcfQyx7\niBooks: https://apple.co/36erlLb\nNook: https://bit.ly/3iq1LW1\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3JzHAAO\nGPlay: https://bit.ly/37MwjPv\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
