  "description": "Joe Biden appears on Jimmy Kimmel and mumbles and makes no sense, even with Kimmel propping him up. Biden then stumbles on the stairs up to Air Force One. An assassination attempt on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh shows the latest instance of violence stirred up by the unaccountable Left. Joy Behar is so wrong on so many levels when she says that gun laws will change once black people own guns. And we debate if the new \"Top Gun\" is better than the 1986 classic. \nSponsor: Birch Gold - Inflation is already running hot…right at the highs of the last couple decades. And now the Dems are pushing through ANOTHER MASSIVE SPENDING PLAN! 3.5 trillion dollars!
