  "description": "Happy Memorial Day Weekend! Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. Today I’m packing my bags and heading to middle state, Nevada. A brand-new mining company is coming together… coming from a management team Wall Street Unplugged listeners are all too familiar with. There’s no IPO yet… Not even a symbol… And fortunately, before word spreads any further, I’ve been invited to check out this developing project. This weekend. Firsthand. It’s an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. And from the looks of it right now, this could potentially be one of the best mining companies I’ll ever recommend. Moving on, I then cover a company that is now on the street’s center stage - Best Buy (BBY). Last week, the electronic retailer posted better-than-expected earnings results from top to bottom.  This includes a reported 60 cents Earnings Per Share versus last year’s 44 cents per share. Digital sales grew more than 22%... And more important, comparable same-store sales rose 1.6% overall versus an expected decline. The stock jumped nearly 20% this week from the news… and is seemingly beginning to show signs of having the right formula to go up against Amazon. Who’s saying big box retailers are dead? Tune in to hear out my entry point strategy. Special Thanks to Micha, Ron, and Don for all the questions. Keep em’ coming at Frank@CurzioResearch.com  Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
