  "description": "<p>When it comes to fitness, people tend to either focus on endurance or strength; they're runners or powerlifters. But wouldn't it be pretty cool to be able to deadlift 500 pounds and run a marathon? My guest says that combining real strength with true endurance to become a \"hybrid athlete\" isn't only possible, it also makes for a wonderfully adventurous and fulfilling path to pursue.</p><p>His name is Fergus Crawley and he's the co-founder of Omnia Performance, which offers coaching to hybrid athletes. Today on the show, Fergus shares how he found his way into hybrid training, what a struggle with depression had to do with that journey, and why he decided to take on some incredible challenges that combine strength and endurance, including deadlifting 500 lbs, running a sub-5-minute mile and doing a marathon in a single day, and powerlifting 1200 kilos and doing a sub-12-hour Ironman Triathlon in a single day. We then turn to the technical side of programming hybrid training, and how you incorporate both endurance and strength workouts in a single week. We end our conversation with Fergus' case for the benefits of hybrid training to body, mind, and spirit, which made me want to go out for a run — something I don't say every day.</p><h2>Resources Related to the Podcast</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.movember.com/\">Movember</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/leashing-the-black-dog-my-struggle-with-depression/\">AoM series on male depression</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/podcast-741-the-exercise-prescription-for-depression-and-anxiety/\">AoM Podcast #741: The Exercise Prescription for Depression and Anxiety</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cxtri/\">Celtman Extreme Scottish Triathlon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/the-case-for-not-listening-to-music-when-you-work-out/\">AoM Article: The Case for Not Listening to Music When You Work Out</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.howardluksmd.com/zone-2-hr-training-live-longer-less-injury/\">Zone 2 Training</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Connect With Fergus Crawley</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ferguscrawley/?hl=en\">Fergus on Instagram</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUspFbF3GdQiP_b3e58AP5A\">Fergus on YouTube</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.omnia-performance.com/\">Omnia Performance</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/02/LastShareCollage-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n",
