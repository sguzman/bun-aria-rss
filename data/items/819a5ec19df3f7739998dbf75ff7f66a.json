  "title": "When we eat matters - how time restricted feeding helps nurture our circadian rhythms with Emily Manoogian, PhD",
  "description": "In Episode 114 I sit down with Emily Manoogian, PhD from the Panda lab at Salk Institute to learn about how we can improve our health by nurturing our our circadian rhythms. Emily and her team are considered world leaders in the field of science known as 'chronobiology' and have published several studies (and many others currently under way) investigating how the timing of our meals effects our health.\n\nIn this episode we specifically cover:\n\n\nWhat circadian rhythms are\n\nWhy we need circadian rhythms\n\nWhat circadian disruption is\n\nWhat social jet-lag is\n\nLearning from shift workers\n\nHow external cues such as light exposure and meal timing affect our circadian rhythms\n\nTime restricted feeding (TRF) and what Emily's research has identified so far\n\nThe difference between TRF and fasting\n\nWhy Emily recommends having more calories in the first half of your day\n\nWhat to do if you are someone who routinely has dinner very late (e.g many Europeans)\n\nLots of practical information that you can put into play\n\nFuture research Emily would like to conduct\n\nand much more\n\n\nAs I note at the beginning of this episode in the introduction. While the time restricted eating that we talk about is far from an extreme protocol, if you suffer from an eating disorder and find the subject of meal timing in any way to be triggering then this may not be the best episode for you, which is totally fine! You can just pick the show back up next episode, and come back to this episode in the future if you feel the timing is more appropriate for you.\n\nNOTE: Unfortunately the audio quality of this episode is not as high as I would ordinarily like.
