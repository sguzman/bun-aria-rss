    "media:description": "It's time we talked about the TeamSeas partnership with the Ocean Cleanup and its interceptors. While on the surface they appear to be a fine idea, dig a little deeper and you find a story of scientific illiteracy, and a huge missed opportunity.\n\nMy previous video about #TeamSeas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSG8BtZn9-8\n\nYou can support the channel and help me make more videos like this one by becoming a patron at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys\n\nHuge thanks to Drs van Emmerik and Schutte for their help with this project, check out their research here:\n- Dr Tim van Emmerik: https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Tim-dr.ir.-THM-Tim-van-Emmerik.htm\n- Dr Virginia Schutte: https://www.virginiaschutte.com/\n\nReferences in this video:\n(1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSG8BtZn9-8\n(2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDx6DjNLDU\n(3) https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352\n(4) https://www.virginiaschutte.com/\n(5) https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/\n(6) https://twitter.com/melaniebergma18/status/1493494193666285569\n(7) https://www.southernfriedscience.com/i-asked-15-ocean-plastic-pollution-experts-about-the-ocean-cleanup-project-and-they-have-concerns/\n(8) https://sci-hubtw.hkvisa.net/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141115\n(9) https://discardstudies.com/2015/06/05/how-the-ocean-clean-up-array-fundamentally-misunderstands-marine-plastics-and-causes-harm/\n(10) https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2021/06/04/coca-cola-funds-endless-cleanups-but-doesnt-prevent-more-plastic-bottles-ending-up-in-our-oceans/\n(11) https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/07/23/breaking-the-plastic-wave-top-findings\n(12) https://hakaimagazine.com/features/scooping-plastic-out-of-the-ocean-is-a-losing-game/\n(12 2 - oops) https://www.river-cleanup.org/en\n(13) https://waterwitch.com/\n\nCheck out my website! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/\n\n---------- II ----------\n\nMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphys\nMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimon\nMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphys\n\n---------- II ----------\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com\nSome stock footage courtesy of Getty\n\nThis video essay offers some criticisms of the TeamSeas project and it's association with the Ocean Cleanup. Is TeamSeas going to make any difference? Is TeamSeas bad? What are the TeamSeas interceptors? Will the TeamSeas interceptorts work? The interceptors run by the Ocean Cleanup use new technology to stop plastic reaching the ocean, except they're not new technology and won't stop plastic reaching the ocean. They are a technologically and ecologically inappropriate solution to the problem of plastic waste and the TeamSeas campaign is a colossal missed opportunity to do some good.\n\nHuge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Conor Safbom, William Pettersson, Paul H and Linda L, InDefenseOfToucans, Savannah, Jimmy Lee, Simon Stelling, Gabriele Siino, Bjorn Bakker, Ieuan Williams, Candace H, Tom Malcolm, Marcus Bosshard, Shab Kumar, Brady Johnston, Liat Khitman, Jesper Norsted, Kent & Krista Halloran, Rapssack, Kevin O'Connor, Timo Kerremans, Ashley Wilkins, Michael Parmenter, Samuel Baumgartner, Dan Sherman, ST0RMW1NG 1, Adrian Sand, Morten Engsvang, Farsight101, K.L, poundedjam, fourthdwarf, Daan Sneep, Felix Freiberger, Chris Field, Robert Connell, ChemMentat, Kolbrandr, , Sebastain Graf, Dan Nelson, Shane O'Brien, Alex, Fujia Li, Will Tolley, Cody VanZandt, Jesper Koed, Jonathan Craske, Albrecht Striffler, Igor Francetic, Jack Troup, SexyCaveman , Sean Richards, Kedar , Omar Miranda, Alastair Fortune, bitreign33 , Mat Allen, Anne Smith, Rafaela Corrêa Pereira, Colin J.
