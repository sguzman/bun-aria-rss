  "description": "What are the limitations of relying on logic as an upfront filter in pursuing ideas? Find out as I talk to Rory Sutherland about his new books Alchemy: the Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life (William Morrow, 2019)\nSutherland is Vice Chairman of Ogilvy, a legendary advertising agency. He’s also a columnist for The Spectator and a past president of the London-based Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA). His TED Talks have been viewed over 6.5 million times.\nTopics covered in this episode include:\n\nWhat’s to be gained from realizing that evolution likes fitness, not accuracy.\n\nWhy biology is different from physics, thereby meaning that there will likely never be a Newton of biology, of marketing, or other fields, where universal laws don’t apply. Instead, the focus is on noting the exceptions and finding patterns.\n\nRealizing how much people are context-dependent in realizing solutions to problems. Many forms of measurement create more problems than successful outcomes.\n\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of eight books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc.
