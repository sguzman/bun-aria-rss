  "itunes:summary": "In this episode, Tom talks with us about the poem that has been a friend to him – 'Aubade' by Philip Larkin.\n\nTom visited The Poetry Exchange in February 2020 for what turned out to be our last live event of the year before lockdown. He joined us at beautiful Manchester Central Library and is in conversation with Poetry Exchange team members, Fiona Bennett and Al Snell.\n\nAl reads the gift reading of 'Aubade'.\n\n*****\n\nI work all day, and get half-drunk at night.   \nWaking at four to soundless dark, I stare.   \nIn time the curtain-edges will grow light.   \nTill then I see what’s really always there:   \nUnresting death, a whole day nearer now,   \nMaking all thought impossible but how   \nAnd where and when I shall myself die.   \nArid interrogation: yet the dread\nOf dying, and being dead,\nFlashes afresh to hold and horrify.\n\nThe mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse   \n—The good not done, the love not given, time   \nTorn off unused—nor wretchedly because   \nAn only life can take so long to climb\nClear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;   \nBut at the total emptiness for ever,\nThe sure extinction that we travel to\nAnd shall be lost in always. Not to be here,   \nNot to be anywhere,\nAnd soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.\n\nThis is a special way of being afraid\nNo trick dispels. Religion used to try,\nThat vast moth-eaten musical brocade\nCreated to pretend we never die,\nAnd specious stuff that says No rational being \nCan fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing\nThat this is what we fear—no sight, no sound,   \nNo touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,   \nNothing to love or link with,\nThe anaesthetic from which none come round.\n\nAnd so it stays just on the edge of vision,   \nA small unfocused blur, a standing chill   \nThat slows each impulse down to indecision.   \nMost things may never happen: this one will,   \nAnd realisation of it rages out\nIn furnace-fear when we are caught without   \nPeople or drink. Courage is no good:\nIt means not scaring others. Being brave   \nLets no one off the grave.\nDeath is no different whined at than withstood.\n\nSlowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.   \nIt stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,   \nHave always known, know that we can’t escape,   \nYet can’t accept. One side will have to go.\nMeanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring   \nIn locked-up offices, and all the uncaring\nIntricate rented world begins to rouse.\nThe sky is white as clay, with no sun.\nWork has to be done.\nPostmen like doctors go from house to house.\n\n\nPhilip Larkin, \"Aubade\" from Collected Poems.
