  "description": "The UFO field has produced thousands of dedicated researchers over the years, and reams of literature; but to what end? What can we claim to know conclusively today about the underlying nature of UFO phenomena that we didnt know in the late-1940s? UFO study has always suffered from major organizational and methodological problems. It has also become dangerously self-referential.<br>\nIf ever we are to further our understanding of the UFO enigma, we must fundamentally reframe our debate. We must wipe the board clean and fill it with new ideas, new theories, even new language. We must be willing to start from scratch when the field stagnates. We must be critical, sober, and free of dogmaready to rinse away the residue of our own beliefs.<br>\nDave discusses the current issues and problems with the study of UFOlogy and asks what is next with his guests Robbie Graham & Susan Demeter-St. Clair.<br>\n<br>\nRobbie's website: <a href=\"http://www.robbiegraham.uk\">www.robbiegraham.uk</a><br>\nSusan's website: <a href=\"http://www.susanstclair.com\">www.susanstclair.com</a>",
