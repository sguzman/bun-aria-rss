  "title": "From Boutique Menswear to Boutique Retail Technology: A Conversation with Bryan Amaral",
  "description": "Bryan Amaral began his career as an entrepreneur going door-to-door, selling custom-made suits. He learned how to work closely with clients as a therapist might work with their patients. By his mid-20s he was able to establish a brick-and-mortar location and create a showroom. He moved away from simply selling suits to building entire wardrobes for his clients.\nSoon after, in the early 90s, Bryan began designing customer relations software to expand his business and sell to other companies. His company was acquired by Symbol Technologies, which Bryan describes as akin to being adopted by a dysfunctional family. After an accounting fraud scandal at Symbol in the early 2000s, Bryan purchased his company back and created Retaligent Solutions, Inc. \nSoon after reacquiring his company, the 2008 financial crisis hit. Bryan was able to weather the storm by \"doing more with less,\" recapitalizing and partnering with Microsoft. Just three years later, his partners sold the company to another Microsoft partner.\nAt this point, having had over 20 years of experience in retail technology and strategy, Bryan founded a consulting company, Clientricity. Clientricity helps retailers develop and grow, much in the way that Bryan first grew his menswear company nearly 30 years ago.\nBryan also discusses the soft skills he learned along the way. He emphasizes the importance of company culture, finding the right people, and investing in the education of his employees to advance and succeed in different roles. As Bryan states, \"I loved using the organization as a vehicle for people to live out their potential.\" Bryan's podcast is here. Bryan on Twitter here.
