We're sharing creative ways to use scraps in smaller projects, home decor, and even some holiday gift ideas. Then we chat with Carla Hall, who you know from The Chew, Good Morning America, and The Food Network. She also serves as a board member for 4-H and recently expanded her love of crafting into the quilting world.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-521-repurpose-scraps-as-decor\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
