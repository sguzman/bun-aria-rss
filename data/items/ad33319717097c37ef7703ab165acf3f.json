They also speak to callers including one who wants Drew to inspire doctors to revolt against the Covid misinformation plaguing our media. Adam also revisits a clip of Gavin Newsom on The Adam Carolla Show discussing homelessness. As the show wraps up they speak with a caller who is questioning the ongoing use of emergency use authorizations still in use for the Covid vaccine. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors: \noffers.americanhartfordgold.com/adam/\nBlindsGalore.com let them know we sent you",
