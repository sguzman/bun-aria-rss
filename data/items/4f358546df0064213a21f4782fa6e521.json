  "description": "Three, two, one, lift off! In this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the tale of how NASA became the United States’ official space exploration organization. Now, this was a major event in U.S. history and did not come without its challenges. Rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States led to one of the most famous competitions in history: the space race. All of this was in an effort to show off who was leading in technology and science, which ultimately led to launching the first man into space. Speaking of launching a person into space… Maia shares a fun music fact about a different kind of Rocket Man, who on this day was honored in the Madison Square Garden Hall of Fame.
