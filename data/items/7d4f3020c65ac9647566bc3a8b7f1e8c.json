WikiLeaks offers to share Vault 7 vulnerabilities with vendors, but it wants something in return. A look at the Atlantic Council's recently concluded Cyber 9/12 competition. Does cabin fever increase the risk of being hacked? Enigma Software saw things during last week's unseasonable US weather that suggests it might. We welcome David Dufour from Webroot to the show as our newest industry partner. And Kirk ransomware is ready to beam into your enterprise.",
