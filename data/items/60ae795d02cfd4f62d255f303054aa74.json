  "description": "<p>In this week's impersonation-heavy ep, the Bayers are thrilled to welcome their friend, the hilarious Jay Pharoah!! Jay and Vanessa reminisce about SNL impressions they did based on their childhoods and some celebrity impressions they did later on (speaking of- who does a better Denzel Washington- you'll have to listen to find out!) The Bayers and Jay also talk about a fave show from growing up, Nickelodeon's \"Doug\" and Jay and Vanessa are so proud to learn what their tv son is up to today: winning a Daytime Emmy! (\"tv son\" is kind of nuanced in this instance but again, ya gotta listen to find out how!) Plus, in an exciting game of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" they all debate new moves being made by The History Channel, how transparent restaurant commercials need to be, and whether texting your parents is a sufficient way to communicate. You're gonna love this ep so much you'll be saying \"Alright, Okay!\" for the rest of the week (AGAIN, this might not make sense now, but that's why you have to listen!\"</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
