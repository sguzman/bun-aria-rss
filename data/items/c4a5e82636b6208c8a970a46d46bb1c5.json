The truck was announced in 2017, to be produced in 2019. Well, it's 2022, and the truck still isn't on the highway. But according to Tesla & Pepsi, that changes this year, with deliveries set to happen in December 2022. This brings up the question, does the Tesla Semi make any sense?\n\nWe'll look at six major questions:\n1. What is the battery capacity and weight?\n2. How much range will it actually have?\n3. How much does the Semi weigh, and how much power does it make?\n4. What's the charging rate?\n5. How much will the Tesla Semi cost to opperate?\n6. Will the Tesla Semi have better emissions than a diesel?\n\nReferences:\nRolling Resistance - https://www.lrrb.org/pdf/201539.pdf\nDiesel Prices - https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMD_EPD2D_PTE_SCA_DPG&f=M\nClass 8 MPG - https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10310\nClass 8 Dimensions - https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/publications/size_regs_final_rpt/\nCAA 2019 - https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/pol_plng_finance/policy/fastact/tswprovisions2019/index.htm\nClass 8 Truck Weight - https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-620-april-26-2010-class-8-truck-tractor-weight-component\n2021 Tesla Impact - https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2021-tesla-impact-report.pdf\nNat Gas Weight Penalty - https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/812194_commercialmdhdtruckfuelefficiency.pdf\nSemi Aero Drag - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705813004621\nCO2 Emissions - https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=Every%20gallon%20of%20gasoline%20burned%20creates%20about%208%2C887%20grams%20of%20CO2.\nW2W Emissions Cummins - https://www.cummins.com/news/2022/10/03/comparing-emission-reductions-across-alternative-fuels\nCO2 Coefficients - https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php\nW2W Diesel Emissions - https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/16004_life-cycle_ghg_oil_use_cars.pdf\nElectricity Prices - https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a\nFuel Prices - https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/prices.php\nEnergy Calculations - https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenergylett.7b00432\nUSA Power Emissions - https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20total%20U.S.%20electricity,of%20CO2%20emissions%20per%20kWh\nBattery Production Emissions - https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",
