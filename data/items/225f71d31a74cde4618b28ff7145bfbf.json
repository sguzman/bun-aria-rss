  "title": "Update: Just Romeo's High School Teacher Asked Him To Do The Scariest Thing Ever!",
  "description": "His drama teacher called asking him if he could do a small 5-minute speech for Hispanic heritage month in September!\nHe thinks it’s almost weird that he enjoys the nervousness he gets from things like this. First his college last year, Moe for his comedy show, and now this! Well, we guess it’s his way of being an adrenaline junkie!\nWhen Just Romeo was in high school the ratio was 50% Latinos, 40% Blacks, and 10% others. A lot of the students then and now are either undocumented or recipients of the Dream Act scholarship just like Romeo.\n“.. they want me to come in and pretty much motivate these kids who don’t want to go to college and they’re looking at these kids right now and they think that high school is it. They don’t see the motivation in these students to want to pursue higher education.”\nSo, of course, with so much pressure on Just Romeo to rise to the occasion of motivating the students, Bert gives him some sound advice that has help him when he has to public speak.\n“Sometimes I have to do this also, man, some of this a fight with ego. This isn’t about you, man. It’s not about how well you're gonna do. It’s not if you’re gonna, like, present something. Maybe you’ll stumble over a word. You are going to be touching a whole bunch of kids that normally wouldn’t have this kind of perspective. It’s about them, so keep your focus there.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
