  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are you doing to charge your batteries? Maybe you’re sleeping enough, or trying to eat healthy. What Tim wants you to do is start getting some damn sprouts in your diet, and he’s here to tell you why.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tim James grew up in Oregon so he knows a thing or two about farming and outdoorsmanship. He spent some decades playing professional baseball, and these days he’s giving his own kids the childhood that he enjoyed. His passion in life is bringing nature back into our bodies, through means that most people have never heard of.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of Underdog Empowerment, Tim recounts the path that took him to wellness. His life quality wasn’t always as great as it is now; his health faced a slow decline over a few years, finally coming to a head on a vacation in South America. Because of that, and a holistic treatment center he attended with a friend, he’s now dedicated his life to helping others by educating them about the options that exist for getting healthy. If you haven’t heard of the benefits from magnesium soaks, infrared saunas, or sunflower sprouts, then tune in today to jump-start your journey and learn health secrets that most of the public doesn’t know.</span></p> <div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Show Notes:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" title= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/tim-james\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/tim-james\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-target-href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/anthony-morrison\">https://underdogempowerment.com/tim-james</a></span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Get More Involved: </span></div> <ol class=\"listtype-number listindent1 list-number1\" start=\"1\"> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Leave A Review & Subscribe On iTunes:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Free A-to-Z roadmap on launching a top-shelf podcast:</span> <span class= \"attrlink url author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"attrlink\" href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\" data-target-href=\"https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap\">https://underdogempowerment.com/roadmap</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Access Our Top Resource Recommendations:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/resources/</a></span></li> <li><span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z\"> Subscribe On YouTube:</span> <span class= \"author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovw8z68zs51dz83z2z70zz79z1z75zz75zhmjo1z78zz75z05qz82z5z122zz81z9z77zz80z url\"> <a class=\"dynamiclink\" href= \"https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https://underdogempowerment.com/youtube</a></span></li> </ol> <p> </p>",
