  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, CNN lost half of its viewers in one year in its struggle to maintain cable television viewership in key demographic areas. Why would anyone watch a political operation like CNN or MSNBC? Then, former President Donald Trump joined Governor Greg Abbott at the Texas-Mexico Border, the same border that Kamala Harris wouldn't even get close to. Afterward, Kamala Harris never praises America but attacks it relentlessly as if it were an abstraction instead of our nation. Biden pushes an ideological agenda that destroys education, residential zoning, public safety, and how one identifies based on their biological genitalia. From the attack on capitalism to the redefinition of race radical Democrats are \"re-imagining\" everything they can get their hands on. Later, New York City's Democratic primary election has been corrupted and the results were removed by the board of elections due to a discrepancy of 135,000 duplicate rank choice votes.
