  "itunes:summary": "For many, it&#8217;s more anger than sadness to learn that President Trump has contracted Covid-19, given his long campaign of mocking and belittling those who wear masks and underplaying the severity of the virus.Â  Also distressing is the fact that the White House has not exactly been transparent in disclosing the timeline and severity of Trump&#8217;s illness &#8230; following a long tradition of shading the truth when it comes to a president&#8217;s health.<br />\nAnd then, with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris set to square off on Wednesday, we go through some of the greatest hits of VP debates in history.<br />\nAn earlier version of this post had an invalid audio file &#8211; this has been corrected.<br />",
