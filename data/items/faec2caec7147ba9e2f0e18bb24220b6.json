I can read a room and I know in real-time how to navigate the conversation and find my way to the top and win that discussion. Others? They just can't.

I care SO MUCH about my clients that I'll do whatever it takes to make them realize how worthwhile it is to work with me (VaynerMedia) as opposed to anybody else. It just is what it is. Other people just need to apply different routes and tactics. But quite honestly, any other route besides the one that I roll with, is sh*t. Period.
