  "title": "Jumping with default: wrong-way risk modelling for CVA",
  "description": "Fabio Mercurio and Minqiang Li investigate credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) in the presence of wrong-way risk by introducing jumps at default to model the correlation between counterparty default and relevant risk factors. Efficient approximations based on CVA formulas with the independence assumption are presented, and numerical examples for a cross-currency swap and a vanilla interest rate swap are showcased",
