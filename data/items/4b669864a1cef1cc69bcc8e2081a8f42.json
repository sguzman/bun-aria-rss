  "description": "<p>This fall marks the 30th anniversary of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the testimony of Anita Hill. It was an historic moment and one that brought sexual harassment into the public consciousness and conversation. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie revisits that moment 30 years ago and what it was like to cover it as the newly minted co-anchor of the Today Show. She also sits down with Anita Hill to talk about her new book, “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671557/believing-by-anita-hill/\">Believing: Our Thirty-Year Journey to End Gender Violence</a>,” and how far we have — and haven’t — come since Anita shared her story with the world and changed her life — and ours.
