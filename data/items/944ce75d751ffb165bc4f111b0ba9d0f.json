  "description": "<p>This week, we find ourselves in an avalanche of craziness. The story has so many twists, and turns that it's sometimes difficult to figure out where to direct our scorn. An NHL player's murder for hire plot gone wrong, amongst a backdrop of mental illness, abuse, and a relationship between a hockey player, and his coach/agent that falls somewhere between life partners, and cult leader/follower. It's a wild story, chock full of terrible people. We couldn't be more thrilled. Grab your stick, hit the ice, and ask a girl named Katie to find you a hit man with Mike Danton!!
