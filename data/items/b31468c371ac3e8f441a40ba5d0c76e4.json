  "title": "Making sense of nutrition | Dr Gil Carvalho",
  "description": "In Episode #207, Dr Gil Carvalho explains how to approach nutrition information from an evidence-based viewpoint, breaking down the details of data analysis.\n\nIn recent years, we’ve seen a huge influx of information being presented as fact without any real scientific foundations. Being able to assess the validity of these claims is critical, and Dr Carvalho offers useful insight into how a layperson can approach them.\n\nIn today’s episode, we shift the focus away from what to think about the science of nutrition onto how to think about it. You’ll learn how to assess scientific claims with Dr Carvalho’s “Three P’s” framework. We apply this framework to a few examples, exploring cooking oils, red meat, eggs, and cholesterol. We also discuss the nuance of evidence hierarchies, and much more.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nGil’s Story (4:50)\n\nHow we Think About Nutrition (10:30)\n\nWhat is Proof (14:50)\n\nObservational & Randomized Control Trials (28:40)\n\nEvaluating the Impact of Oil (44:07)\n\nRed Meat (1:22:14)\n\nOutro (1:54:33)\n\n\nYou can learn more about Dr Gil Carvalho here, and connect with him on Twitter and Facebook.

You can also access his research publications for more.\n\nThank you to The Proof friend, Eimele Essential 8, for sponsoring today’s episode.
