  "description": "IT’S OUR BIRTHDAY! That’s right, Thirst Buckets! We are a whole year old. Whew! From the dirty auntie laughs to the profane gasps of delight, we’ve enjoyed every minute of breaking down pop culture and thirst with you. From southern men to British baes, newbies to Zaddies, french fries to hearty snacks, we tried to show love to all the baes we’ve loved before and we’re thrilled you’ve been along for the ride. In this episode, we reveal some of those [REDACTED] intros, share our favorite moments, and we even have special messages from some listeners and former guests. We have more episodes to  go so this isn’t the end, but we had to show ourselves a little anniversary love.
