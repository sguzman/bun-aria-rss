Not everyone in the family knows this, and now that family member will be present at future holidays and gatherings. <strong>If your spouse doesn't want to speak up, what can </strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong> do?</strong></li>\n<li>Getting from the beginning to the end of a personal anecdote can be a struggle when you don't feel like you've mastered the art of storytelling. <strong>How do you get better at honing your storytelling chops?</strong></li>\n<li>You know it's a bad idea to pursue a romance or relationship with someone at the office (especially when you're the boss), but you can't deny there's an attraction between you and someone there.
