  "description": "Today we’re talking about styling your kitchen.  The place to start, the island.  We will tell you a few tricks to wrangling the little things that tend to occupy large kitchen surfaces and some styling tips to keep things fresh and seasonal.   We address the stove and give recommendations for what to put on the wall behind your stove and ways to incorporate a painting or a cutting board. If you have open shelves or a deep window sill we like to use these to display dishes and keep them accessible.  Be sure you are displaying pretty cookbooks to add to the culinary aesthetic.  Your sink styling should have pretty bottles paired with your favorite scents.
