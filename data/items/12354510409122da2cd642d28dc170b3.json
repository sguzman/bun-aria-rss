  "description": "<p>Oprah says, “I’ll never forget the first time Maya Angelou shared with me what would become a much beloved refrain: <em>People may not remember what you did or said, but they always remember how you made them feel. </em>What her words so brilliantly remind us, is that every single moment is an opportunity to be of service to another human being. That is what I hope will be your takeaway from this podcast. I’m not referring just to volunteering or contributing to a cause, though those are wonderful, worthwhile activities that strengthen us. What I am talking about is committing, decision by decision to a sustained compassionate approach to life.” In this podcast, Oprah sits down with: Mark Nepo, Bryan Stevenson, Gloria Steinem, Thich Nhat Hanh, U.S. Representative John Lewis, Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Charles Eisenstein, Lynne Twist, President Jimmy Carter, Mindy Kaling, Gary Zukav, Wayne Dyer. They all share their incredible experiences using their unique talents and abilities in service of others. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from her Emmy Award-winning show Super Soul Sunday. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Path Made Clear.</em></p>\n",
