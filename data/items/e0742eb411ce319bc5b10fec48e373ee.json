  "title": "Sarah Imhoff, “Masculinity and the Making of American Judaism” (Indiana UP, 2017)",
  "description": "In her new book, Masculinity and the Making of American Judaism (Indiana University Press, 2017), Professor Sarah Imhoff explores the relationship between American identity and American Jewish depictions and definitions of masculinity. Professor Imhoff examines Jewish communal efforts to consciously create an American Jewish masculinity — one that is tied to the land, modeled on Protestant delimitations of masculine virtues — and she analyzes popular conceptions about and ambivalence toward the American Jewish male. Professor Imhoff explores the ways in which conscious efforts to forge a connection between the Jewish male body and the American land collide with anti-Semitic stereotypes, and with an emerging range of Jewish masculinities, in this multifaceted work.\n\nSarah Imhoff is Assistant Professor of Jewish Studies and Religious Studies, and Director of Graduate Studies in the Robert A. and Sandra S. Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana University.\n\n\n\nDavid Gottlieb is a PhD Candidate in the History of Judaism at the University of Chicago Divinity School. His research focuses on interpretations of the Binding of Isaac and the formation of Jewish cultural memory. He can be reached at davidg1@uchicago.edu.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
