    "media:description": "The new beach animal Animaris Ader is named after the 19th century aviation pioneer Clement Ader (1841-1926). In order not to be buried in a sandstorm, it can hover a little above the ground. Beach animals are normally sand magnets. They attract sand when the wind blows. So floating could be a new survival strategy. To be able to do this, they must be able to anchor themselves. In the past, this often happened with a pin that was hammered into the ground. Now I am thinking more of a screw pin that screws itself into the ground. This is done with compressed air, generated by the wavy wing on top of the Ader, which pumps air into PET bottles.",
