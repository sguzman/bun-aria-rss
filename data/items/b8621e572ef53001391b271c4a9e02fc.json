I hired a personal trainer a year ago and have increased my weights consistently. I am also following MAPS Anabolic. I am not sure if it’s my age, but I’m just not seeing results. I tend to over train, work a high stress 60 hour a week desk job and wonder if stress is playing into it? I watch my sleep and get consistent 7 hours per night. Any suggestions?
