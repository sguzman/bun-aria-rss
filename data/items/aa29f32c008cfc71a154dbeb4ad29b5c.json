I enjoyed speaking with Hadley (whom I'd never met before in person) about these problems as we've come up with nice solutions to many of them independently, and in different languages (R and Python, respectively). A lot of folks assume that parts of pandas are inspired by his <a href=\"http://plyr.had.co.nz/\" title=\"plyr\" target=\"_blank\">plyr</a> and <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html\" title=\"reshape2\" target=\"_blank\">reshape2</a> packages, but I've only started playing around with them recently. I think we all have a lot we can learn from each other on the road toward building even better high performance, easy-to-use, and expressive data manipulation tools.</p>\n<iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/7jsVCGeW8VWpHY\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/wesm/structured-data-challenges-in-finance-and-statistics\" title=\"Structured Data Challenges in Finance and Statistics\" target=\"_blank\">Structured Data Challenges in Finance and Statistics</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/wesm\" target=\"_blank\">Wes McKinney</a></strong> </div>"
