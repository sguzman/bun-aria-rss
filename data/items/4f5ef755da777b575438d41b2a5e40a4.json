  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin. The American Marxist elements in America, backed by the media and embraced by the Democrat party, have brought us the crime wave we are seeing across the country. The George Floyd riots in 2020 were seen as an opportunity for a war on cops, capitalism, and society. The Democrat party has the help from George Soros to destroy America from within. Until Soros and the Democrat Party are held to account this crime will continue. We have a lack of leaders who will stand up to these radicals. Also, Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist playing both sides of the fence, is causing a stir over an interview he’s done with former President Trump wherein he claims that former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was amongst the first to congratulate President-Elect Joe Biden in November of 2020 when he was one of the last western leaders to do so. Then, inflation is not a way to print more money to achieve abstractions like Marxism. The laws of economics must be followed lest you create a false economic world. Thanks to Biden the U.S is now at the highest rate of inflation in 40 years. All Biden can do is blame you, the private sector, and the American people. Later, Rep Liz Cheney suggests that then-President Trump committed a federal crime on January 6th, 2021. Of course, Congress has no authority to prosecute any crime, and acting in this manner violates one’s Fifth Amendment rights. in doing so, Liz Cheney has demonstrated that many in Trump’s inner circle urged him via texts to Mark Meadows to speak out against the violence at the Capitol. Incidentally, Trump had offered 10,000 National Guard troops, but Speaker Pelosi rejected the President’s offer. This Pelosi-appointed committee is covering up for her. The real question is: what did Pelosi know and when did she know it?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
