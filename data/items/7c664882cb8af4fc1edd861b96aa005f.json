  "description": "<p>A poet considers his father, and, particularly, his father’s boots. These boots could be a hammer, a prop, a weapon. But Esteban Rodríguez also remembers how his father — a sleepwalker — would walk outside at night in his underwear, wielding his boots, slapping them against each other in a kind of protective ritual. What spirits was his father protecting them from? What was he asserting about land and place, by standing guard, even in his dreams?</p><p><strong>Esteban Rodríguez</strong> is the author of five poetry collections, most recently, <i>The Valley</i>. His debut essay collection <a href=\"https://www.splitlippress.com/before-the-earth-devours-us\"><i>Before the Earth Devours Us</i></a> will be published by Split/Lip Press in late 2021.
