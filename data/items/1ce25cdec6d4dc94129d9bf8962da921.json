It has been a smash hit in the UK, selling almost 100,000 copies in just 7 months, and has just been published in the United States. Professor BJ Fogg, the world’s leading expert in human behavior, calls this book, one of the best habit change programs he has seen—deceptively simple but remarkably effective.” Dr. Chatterjee regularly appears on BBC News and Television and has been featured in numerous international publications including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>Vogue</em>, and his TED talk, <em>How To Make Disease Disappear</em>, has been viewed almost 3 million times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of us have made short-term changes before, but how do you get them to last? Dr. Chatterjee shares his plan, <em>Feel Better in 5</em>, which is based on three easy practices, which he calls, “health snacks.” Each one takes no more than 5 minutes to complete—short enough to be able to fit into your busy day, yet long enough to ensure you gain real benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market and Joovv.</p><br><p>Right now, Thrive is offering all Doctor's Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
