  "description": "<p>Plotly dashboards give you the glitz &amp; glamour of D3 charts without having to write a line of code. They can match your brand perfectly and are shareable with simple web links. We wanted an alternative to the usual dashboard platforms that feel heavy, kludgy, expensive, and clunky. Plotly dashboards aren&rsquo;t your dad&rsquo;s dashboards: They&rsquo;re built for today&rsquo;s web and make you look like the smartest person in the room.\n<br/><br/></p><center>\n<a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboards/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RBlX7TW.gif\" alt=\"Dashboard\"/></a>\n</center>\n<br/><br/>\nWe present to you 3 Plotly dashboards on clean energy, with inspiration from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEconomist\" target=\"_blank\">The Economist</a>.\n<br/><br/><center>________________</center>\n<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html#.WDViW9zgCq8\" target=\"_blank\">The United States is 2nd</a>.\n<br/><br/>\n2nd usually implies something good; for instance 2nd place in a race, runner-up in a basketball tournament, or the silver medalist in an Olympic event. However, in the case of total carbon dioxide emissions, 2nd is not the place you want to be in.\n<br/><br/>\nThe United States, in 2011, was responsible for 17% of the world&rsquo;s carbon dioxide emissions. There is no question that population plays a role in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; however, the U.S. placed 3rd in the per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions category. \n<br/><br/> \nPresident Obama has unleashed a variety of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/13/building-a-new-foundation-energy-and-environment\" target=\"_blank\">aggressive tactics to reduce carbon emissions</a>, such as the creation of new &ldquo;clean energy&rdquo; jobs and technologies and the initiative to make America more energy independent. In 2015, he announced new, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/03/fact-sheet-president-obama-announce-historic-carbon-pollution-standards\" target=\"_blank\">historic carbon emission standards</a> for power plants.\n<br/><br/>\nDespite his unprecedented steps to attempt to combat climate change, efforts &ndash;both domestically and internationally&ndash; may sadly be too little, too late. \n<br/><br/>\nIt goes without saying that Mother Nature is pulling off some unprecented stuff of her own this year:\n<br/><br/><center>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is not normal.

And for good reason: The country is responsible for 15% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Nevertheless, it is a leader in non-hydropower renewable energy [see next dashboard]. \n<br/><br/>\nThe graph in the bottom left shows some promise. Note how CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have decreased in recent years, mostly coinciding with Obama&rsquo;s presidency and his largely unprecedented climate initiatives. \n<br/><br/>\nThe graph in the bottom right indicates that coal is behind about 20% of American CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center>\n<a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8381/view\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wMlLrq9.gif\" alt=\"Emissions\"/></a>\n</center>\n</div>\n\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>2. <a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8377/view\" target=\"_blank\">Renewable Energy</a></h2>\n<br/>\nThe use of coal [dashboard above] has tailed off very slightly in recent years. As such, production from renewables has slowly picked up. Electricity generation by way of wind in 2014 was 400% greater than it was in 2000. \n<br/><br/>\nBrazil is the global leader in renewable energy, generating nearly 80% of its energy in that fashion &ndash; led by hydropower. \n<br/><br/>\nBrazil, Canada, and Germany are the only countries that generate more than 20% of energy through renewables (as of 2013).\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center>\n<a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8377/view\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RcP6CXY.gif\" alt=\"Renewable Energy\"/></a>\n</center>\n</div>\n\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>3. <a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8376/view\" target=\"_blank\">A Bright Future?</a></h2>\n<br/>\nThe Economist reported that global investment in renewable energy rose by a sixth in 2014, to $270 billion. Most impressive was the rise shown by developing countries &ndash; the year-over-year change was about (+) $25 billion. \n<br/><br/>\nNew investment in renewable energy has increased by about 400% since the year 2004 (!)\n<br/><br/>\nThe graph on the right indicates that the cost of the generation of energy through the use of solar power has actually fallen below that of oil. Of course, the prevalence of solar energy instruments is still low &ndash;and minuscule compared to oil&ndash; but continued growth is anticipated. \n<br/><br/><div>\n<center>\n<a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8376/view\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/A98cyWk.gif\" alt=\"Outlook\"/></a>\n</center>\n</div>\n<br/><br/><br/>  \nIf you liked this post, please consider sharing.
