  "description": "<p>Out of 743 riders on the World Tour, the highest tier of&nbsp;professional road cycling, only 5 are black. Today’s guest is&nbsp;devoted to changing that. I wouldn’t bet against him.</p><p>Dubbed ‘the most important bike racer you don’t know’,&nbsp;<strong>Justin Williams</strong>&nbsp;is an 11-time U.S. National&nbsp;Champion and 14-time California State Road and Track Champion. A rare sprinting talent from the get go, Justin was already crushing criteriums across the&nbsp;state as a teen en route to becoming the Jr. Track National Champ and a member of the U.S. National&nbsp;Team. In 2009 he joined the coveted Trek Livestrong U23 Dev Team. A launchpad to the majors,&nbsp;Justin’s dream of competing on the World Tour was becoming real.</p><p>However, despite Justin’s skyward trajectory and unbound potential, he quickly became disillusioned&nbsp;with the elitist aspect of the sport. Then he did the unthinkable:&nbsp;he quit.Departing Europe for home, he&nbsp;enrolled in college. Lived a civilian life. And let his bike collect cobwebs. For Justin, it seemed,&nbsp;cycling was over.</p><p>However, Justin’s younger brother Cory — then making his own cycling waves&nbsp;— had other plans,&nbsp;enticing Justin’s return to the sport through fixie racing culture. Revitalized by this dynamic&nbsp;community, Justin would soon discover renewed purpose on the bike. As an athlete who still had races&nbsp;to win. And ultimately as an advocate on a mission to redefine the sport he loves.</p><p>Thus was born&nbsp;Legion of Los Angeles:&nbsp;an independent elite cycling team dedicated to increasing&nbsp;diversity & encouraging inclusion in the industry. Translation: a launchpad for badass racers of&nbsp;varying ethnicities and backgrounds who don’t necessarily fit the status quo of the current&nbsp;whitewashed cycling program.</p><p>Today we explore&nbsp;Justin’s extraordinary story — from his experience growing up in Los Angeles to immigrant parents&nbsp;through his blossoming love affair with the bike.</p><p>We dissect the sport of cycling and the industry that supports it. What’s great about it. What must&nbsp;change. And how Legion is leading the way by smashing paradigms and setting a new standard when&nbsp;it comes to supporting athletes and promoting inclusivity.</p><p>Wise beyond his years, Justin is passion in motion. A cycling hero. The embodiment of persistence.&nbsp;And a powerful reminder that what is most important about sport has nothing to do with podiums.&nbsp;Instead, it’s about the journey towards self-actualization. It’s about sharing experience. And above all,&nbsp;the impact you leave on others.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch our exchange on<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FQmUyMW7CMY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;YouTube.</a>&nbsp;And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>Equal parts important and entertaining, it was an honor to host this enlightening exchange with an athlete so devoted to positive change.
