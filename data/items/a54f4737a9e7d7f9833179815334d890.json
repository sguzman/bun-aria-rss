  "description": "Click here to join the member exclusive portion of my show: https://utm.io/ueSEm \n\nToday on the Matt Walsh Show we talk about lies, damned lies, and studies.

Also, some students in Virginia walk out in protest against policies that make them safer and protect their privacy. Don Lemon embarrassed himself gloriously on camera yet again. People seem to be very concerned about a sex scandal involving something called The Try Guys. And in our Daily Cancellation, Gen Z has found a new way to rebrand laziness. \n\n- - - \n\nDailyWire+:\n\nJoin the Jeremy’s Razors Contest For The Car at https://www.jeremysrazors.com/play.
