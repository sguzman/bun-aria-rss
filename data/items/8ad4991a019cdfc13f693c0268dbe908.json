  "description": "<p>Please take a moment and just think of all the different diets that you’ve heard of- South Beach, Paleo, Whole 30, juice cleanses, Keto and intermittent fasting. There’s always a new fad just around the corner in the dieting space. And while we’re not experts in the realm of nutrition, we do know that a healthy balanced diet is what you should be striving after. And while there are some helpful elements with these different diets, if you take any one of them to the extreme it’s going to harm your body. And the same is definitely true of your finances- especially when it comes to investing. We’ve seen a rise of alternative investments over the past decade and the last few years have seen a flurry of new platforms giving you new and exciting places to invest your money. But are they a good way for you to invest your money or are they another fad that will lead you astray? During this episode we talk through the pros, the cons, some of the more popular platforms out there, and then how you can incorporate alternative investments into your portfolio.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Imaginary Grace by Monday Night Brewing- a big thanks to Brian and our friends there at MNB for donating this one to the podcast!
