The Platinum threat actor continues to prospect Southeast Asian targets with stealthy malware, and a new backdoor. Buran tries to take black market share in the ransomware-as-a-service souk. Paycard standard compliance is down. And is that a spy ship we see, or are you just looking at the seabed, all for science?
