At first, it was a hobby, but the two of them quickly rose to prominence with a signature look and a bold, buzzy marketing campaign. In addition to running a thriving brand, Eric is also a former president of the Decorative Furnishings Association, where he had a front-row seat to the challenges and opportunities of an industry in transition. In this episode of the podcast, he speaks with host Dennis Scully about why Hellman-Chang moved from Brooklyn to Georgia, the surprising reason why he loves RH, and why a lack of transparency has stunted the industry’s growth—and what we can do about it.</p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"www.thebrunoeffect.com\">The Bruno Effect</a> and <a href=\"https://www.worldcoppersmith.com/\">Coppersmith</a>. </p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/designer_gent/\"><strong>Eric Chang</strong></a><br /><a href=\"https://hellman-chang.com/\"><strong>Hellman-Chang</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\"><strong>Dennis Scully </strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a><br /> </p>\n",
