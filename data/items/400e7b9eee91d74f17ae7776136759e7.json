  "description": "<div>June 22, 1990. 2:00 am. The phone rings at Gayle and Kay Baker's house in the San Fernando Valley. \"We have your son. Unless you give us $100,000 by 5pm, he will die.\" At first they thought it was a joke. But when the man called back in the morning with the same demand, they knew 21-year-old son was in trouble. Later that day, the police would call the Bakers to tell them their son had been found. Dead. Murdered in the infamous \"Manson Tunnel\" outside of LA. But who could have done this?
