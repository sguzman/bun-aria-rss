  "description": "Michael Myers sits down to tell us his story of starting Distillery 291. He had a booming photography career, but while living in NY during the events of 9/11, it made him want something else. He found out early on that he liked whiskey, so like most of us who start off with something new, he researched and used his skills from a past farm life to make it a reality. Michael actually built his very first still on a tight budget and ended up using some of his photography equipment to create the still. From these humble beginnings, his whiskey has gone off to win many different awards and they are now expanding even further, creating a whiskey that is Aspen stave finished and authentic to Colorado.\nShow Notes:\n\nMaker's Mark Solar Panels:  https://www.wlky.com/article/makers-mark-now-powering-rickhouses-with-help-of-500-solar-panels/31017612\n\n\nBeverage Daily Article:  https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/02/17/Alcohol-s-three-tier-system-slows-ecommerce-and-dates-the-industry\n\n\nWhy Does Whiskey Taste Like Whiskey:  https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-does-whiskey-taste-like-whiskey-an-excerpt-from-lew-brysons-new-book-whiskey-master-class\n\n\nRate Our Podcast: https://ratethispodcast.com/bourbon\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about blended whiskey.\n\nWhen were you first introduced to bourbon?\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nHow long where you in Savannah?\n\nLet's talk about your background in photography.\n\nWhich more enjoyable, photography or whiskey making?\n\nTell us about your experience with 9/11.\n\nHow were your first attempts at making whiskey?\n\nDid you lean on any outside consultants?\n\nTell us about building and designing your still.\n\nHow much did it cost to build your still?\n\nWhat was your end goal when you first started?\n\nTell us about your barrels.\n\nWhat was going through your mind when you first started?\n\nDid your photography career fund the whiskey business?\n\nTell us about your awards.\n\nWhat is the operation like today?\n\nWas it daunting coming to Kentucky with your bourbon?\n\nDid you experience growing pains?\n\nWhat do you want our listeners to leave with about 291?",
