  "description": "This week, Ben Wittes of Brookings and Lawfare and David Sanger of the New York Times chat with David Rothkopf about the global consequences of domestic scandals. The President continues to argue that Russia didn’t interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections -- how does this affect his relationship with the intelligence community, constituencies, and the world? At what point does Trump become a direct line of communication between Putin and the American people? We also discuss the policy process of the National Security Council and the President’s approach to nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, with analysis from observations at the Aspen Ideas Festival.
