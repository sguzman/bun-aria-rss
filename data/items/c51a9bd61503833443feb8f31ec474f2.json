  "description": "<p>Many of us have been stuck at home with extra time on our hands due to the quarantine. Even if your state or local government hasn’t made it an official order, it’s likely you’ve found yourself trying to figure out what to do with these free nights and weekends! And while we wouldn’t suggest that you must use all that additional time to work on your personal finances, it would helpful to use at least some of it to work on some money matters that typically get swept under the rug. So in this episode we’re talking about the chorelike, everyday money disciplines that are often skipped over. These are the kinds of money moves you may not be paying attention to, but they still have a big impact on your personal finances.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Adambier by Crooked Stave- thanks to our friends at the brewery for donating this one to the show!
