  "description": "Both interviews today are with author Douglas Stuart. The first about his Booker prize-winning <em>Shuggie Bain</em>; a story based on his own life growing up a queer son of a single mother struggling with addiction. He told NPR's Scott Simon that he hoped people could find comfort in this story. Next, Stuart spoke to NPR's Ari Shapiro about his new book, <em>Young Mungo</em>. It's a story about two boys separated by faith who end up falling in love with each other. Stuart told Shapiro that when he \"write[s] about heartbreak or sadness, I'm really only doing that to make the tenderness and the love shine more.\"",
