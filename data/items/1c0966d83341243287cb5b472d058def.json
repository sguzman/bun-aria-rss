  "description": "<p>20-year-old Keith Mann was last seen in Wichita Falls, Texas on Saturday, May 10th, 1997.&nbsp;Keith had worked that day and later went out with a couple friends. While they were hanging out, Keith mentioned that he was meeting someone at 12:15am.&nbsp;His friends said they dropped him off at his apartment around 11:45 PM. They told his family that they watched him walk up the stairs toward his apartment. That is the last time anyone claims to have seen Keith.&nbsp;The following day, the car that Keith was driving was spotted in a church parking lot just a few miles away. Keith’s disappearance is a baffling mystery with no obvious suspects to point to.&nbsp;Keith had no known enemies and nothing to be running from.
