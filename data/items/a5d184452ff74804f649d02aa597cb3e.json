  "description": "<p>God has given so much responsibility to Dads to lead and invest in their family's faith. As a wife and a mom, we can and should come alongside them in this task, offering our gifts, talents, skills, intelligence and creativity to help them thrive in this calling. But how does that look practically? In today's episode, Emily and Laura talk about how a wife can help and equip her husband to lead the family spiritually. Not through manipulation, nagging, eye-rolling, or shaming; but by believing the best in him and being his biggest supporter.</p> <p>Like what you hear?

You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind.
