  "description": "Contributor(s): Dr Maria Christina Chatziioannou, Dr Andreas Kakridis, Professor Stathis N Kalyvas | How far may the economic problems of the modern Greek state be attributed to the nature of its origins? It’s small, albeit enlarging, size; the lack of popular trust in public institutions and authority; the recourse to patrons and to ‘rent-seeking’; and, its own vulnerability to external powers: are these path-dependent features that overwhelm the scope for change?\nThis panel will discuss the inheritance of 1821 for the course of development taken by modern Greece and how it has structured options and choices. When, and how, has or might such historical determinism be overcome?\nMeet our speakers and chair\nMaria Christina Chatziioannou is the Director of the Institute for Historical Research at the National Hellenic Research Foundation. She is Editor of the Historical Library for 1821 supported by the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation as part of the \"Bicentennial Initiative 1821-2021\".
