  "description": "<p>In line with our recent focus on stablecoins, today we're going to explore the OG onchain stablecoin: MakerDAO. We will dive deeper into the economics of Maker, and understand how the $DAI ecosystem works.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO is a novel and innovative protocol that allows for on-chain collateralised borrowing, while also creating a reasonably effective stablecoin. This gives the crypto community an alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins like $USDT. Furthermore, $MKR holders continue to make continual improvements to the protocol, that make MakerDAO better.</p>\n<p>MakerDAO is an alternative source of leverage. Because it is an alternative way to gain access to leverage for those who do not wish to custody assets with a centralised exchange. Borrowing from Maker could also be cheaper when stability fees are low.</p>\n<p>Any losses incurred by $DAI holders are backstopped implicitly by $MKR holders, who will be diluted in case the system as a whole becomes under-collateralised. This is a major advantage that Maker has versus other lending platforms on the market, where any losses are borne by the lender.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>0:00 – Intro & Contents</p>\n<p>0:34 – Analysing Maker</p>\n<p>2:01 – Maker's Dual-Token Mechanism</p>\n<p>3:42 – Maker's Reserve Mechanism</p>\n<p>4:35 – Creating $DAI: How it works</p>\n<p>6:47 – Maintaining Stability</p>\n<p>11:40 – How Maker deals with market crashes</p>\n<p>13:07 – Opinion: Maker vs Lending/Borrowing</p>\n<p>14:38 – Opinion: Transparency</p>\n<p>15:45 – Opinion: Multi-collateral & Past performance</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Want more in-depth content?</p>\n<p>1) Support us on our Patreon: www.patreon.com/economicsdesign</p>\n<p>2) (Textbook) The Economics and Math of Token Engineering and DeFi https://book.economicsdesign.com/</p>\n<p>3) Academy: https://academy.economicsdesign.com/</p>\n<p>4) Newsletter: https://economicsdesign.substack.com</p>\n<p>Connect with us and the ED community:</p>\n<p>Discord – https://discord.gg/ZqgpzdbZP2</p>\n<p>Twitter – https://twitter.com/econsdesign</p>\n<p>Reddit – https://reddit.com/u/economicsdesign</p>\n",
