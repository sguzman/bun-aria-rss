Today on the podcast, Amanda is joined by contributor Amiel Stanek, senior staff writer Alex Beggs, and senior food editor Christina Chaey to talk all about martinis: Why we love them, what makes them perfect vs. “perfect,” and how to order them properly (or make them at home). Along the way, Andrea Hernández aka the Snack Oracle comes by to try to explain why the espresso martini is making a comeback—and whether it’s here to stay.
