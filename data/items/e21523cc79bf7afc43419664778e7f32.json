  "description": "Last week the guys took a moment to watch the first installment of \"The Last Dance,\" A documentary focusing on not just the final season but the length and breadth of Michael Jordan's professional basketball career. The guys agreed that although Jordan made it all look so easy and effortless,  the levels of adversity, personal trauma, and pain he endured WHILE killing the game was unbelievable. Life happens, and if you didn't know it before COVID-19 straight stopped the entire world in its tracks, you certainly know it now.  As the podcast continues, they transition from discussing MJ to discussing the importance of having and maintaining provisions. For those who don't know, provisions are things we stock up on in preparation for times like these, namely, canned goods and other non-perishable items. Essentially, provisions are things that will keep you alive. Like all of you, each of the guys has had a crisis period where they relied on their emotional, spiritual and physical \"provisions\" to get through the doubt, the pain, and REAL life-altering adversity each one faced. The provisions they stocked up on allowed them to emerge on the other side, better than when they went in. They'll share these stories and more on today's Secret to Success Podcast.
