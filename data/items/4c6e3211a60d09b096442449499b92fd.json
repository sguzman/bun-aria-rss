  "description": "<p>KMS is looking for a new studio. After roaches in the hallways, no heat in the winter and with the air conditioning currently broken in studio, enough is enough. John Stewart is in the second chair and came prepared with plenty of sound and notes to direct the show with. The Wilbur will not be the venue for the next KMS live show as they are booked through March 25 of 2023. Justin saves the Pizza Picture Party, Trump wishes Biden the best with Covid, Bruce Springsteen gouges his fans and more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
