  "description": "Today's roundtable tackles a new topic that took most of us by surprise. About 3 weeks ago, when I was doing a label approval for our Four Roses barrels, I was given an additional contract to sign that was called a non-mutilation agreement. Basically stating that we agree to not add any stickers, wax, or anything that alters the package. Will other distilleries follow suit? What happens if someone breaks the contract? We give our opinions on that plus, if we think blends are going to become the new single barrels.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick (@fredminnick) talks about what smooth means.\n\nFour Roses bans stickers for private barrels. Is this good or bad?\n\nDo you think other distilleries will start banning stickers?\n\nHow do you enforce the ban?\n\nDoes the ban violate freedom of speech?\n\nHow can you set your pick apart from other picks?\n\nAre blends the new single barrels?\n\nThanks to @bourbonr, @breakingbourbon, and @sippn_corn for joining.\n\nSupport this Podcast on Patreon",
