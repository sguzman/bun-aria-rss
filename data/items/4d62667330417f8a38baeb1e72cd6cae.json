  "description": "Does meritocracy create a better world for everyone, or does it create massive inequality? There's been a lot of debate in the last few years about meritocracy, and it's become even more pressing in light of the pandemic. If essential workers are \"essential\", are they really less meritorious than a banker or accountant? So, we decided to discuss both sides of this debate in our next two episodes. \n\nOn this episode, we'll be joined by Adrian Wooldridge, political editor at The Economist and author of the new book \"The Aristocracy of Talent: How Meritocracy Made the Modern World\". He'll be making the nuanced case in favor of meritocracy, and we'll hear the other side on our next episode.",
