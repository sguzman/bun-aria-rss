  "description": "Tish Mills is known for creating peaceful yet livable spaces that reflect the homeowners personality. She joins us this week to talk about her love of construction, how a great design team makes the whole thing seem effortless, and ways we can create peace and harmony in our busy homes and lives. We also reminisce about the showroom we worked on together in 2014, and draw from that how to take pieces and customize them in a beautiful way that is meaningful to you.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs on good neighbor relations when it comes to painting, a fun pastel door color, the wrong sized curtains (take two), and a few of the best options for good ergonomics when working from home until who knows when.\n\nThe difference between console and desks in terms of height and surface working area.\n\nWhy Tish used the word “peaceful” when it comes to her design, and examples of projects that fit this description perfectly, including a home with fluted kitchen cabinets.\n\nHow a great team in design can make a project seem effortless.\n\nMore about Tish’s love of construction, and how it’s like a mix to go through labor and to therapy when doing a major remodel.\n\nTish’s dad was one of the four major developers of Hilton Head, so construction is in her blood.\n\nWhy planning ahead and knowing our traffic patterns can help make the best decisions in every aspect of design, as early as we can.\n\nHow Tish works with her clients to use pieces that are personal and meaningful that they collect over time, rather than feeling like they need to furnish and decorate in a hurry.\n\nHow we can use earth tones correctly.\n\nMore about the Not Your Average Downsize project which boasted a 30,000 square foot incredible home.\n\nUsing metals as the base for your interiors, and options that you may not have otherwise thought about.\n\nMore about the showhouse we did together in 2014 at the Atlanta Symphony Showhouse, and what we can learn about taking objects and customizing them to make them feel like your own.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n@tishmills \nTish Mills \nCarin Console \nRachel Cannon - Ep #44 Forward Thinking with Ballard Designs\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nWe love this question, and love that you are up for a change. Tish agrees 100% that the bed facing the fireplace is too expected, and doesn’t feel that you need to move the chandelier. Do some floor to ceiling panels, and weight the treatments slightly more to equalize the windows. Do complimentary tables on the side, and they do not have to match. The part of the door to the right of the fireplace that you don’t use, the mirror feels a little out of place, so you could find another place for it. You can also put a nice comfy chair there and create a seating area or cozy reading nook. Art is important in this space, and Tish would float a piece of art over the headboard. There are also some “lazy” options that we suggest, and we won’t tell anyone if you decide to go for them!\nFind all of the Show Notes at Ballarddesigns.com/podcast",
