  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, few in the media are condemning the looting, arson, and riots in Brooklyn Center, MN. When facts don't matter people will believe whatever they want to believe when they reject the facts. Despite the facts, BLM, Benjamin Crump, and the Mayor are adding fuel to the fire irrespective of the facts that are evident on the police body cam. The City manager has been fired for asking for due process, the Police Chief and the Officer involved in the shooting have both resigned. Interestingly, 81% of Black Americans do not want the police defunded and want more police according to a June Gallup Poll. However, some feel that the media enflames these situations by misrepresenting them and egging them on. Then, Democrats don't believe in infrastructure, they believe in empowering the Democrat Party and increasing the size of government. Also, former House Speaker John Boehner defends his sell-out tactics in Washington by taking shots at Mark Levin and Sean Hannity saying that their styles weren't conducive to his governing. Later, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas has caught CNN on hidden camera admitting to creating \"propaganda\" just to stop President Trump from being re-elected. CNN staff say that the directive comes from the top to \"paint Biden\" as healthy by showing clips of him jogging with his aviator glasses on during the campaign. The undercover video also reveals that activists have taken jobs at CNN just to get Trump out of office. O'Keefe suggests that CNN be honest and admit that they are the media arm of the Democrat Party. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
