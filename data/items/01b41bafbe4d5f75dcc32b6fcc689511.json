  "description": "<p>On this week’s episode of Let’s Eat In, Cathy Erway is joined in the studio by Daniel Delaney of VendrTV and the new barbecue workshop, Brisketlab. Back in Austin, Daniel bought an eighteen foot barbecue smoker, and he’s brought it to New York City to make some succulent barbecue brisket. Tune in to hear why Daniel decided to stop talking about food and start making it! Learn more about brisket, and what about the meat makes it a difficult cut to barbecue. Learn more about the goals of Brisketlab, and how the project grew so rapidly that it has become difficult to get a taste of Brisketlab’s barbecue. Fire up your smoker, grab a little salt and pepper, and tune into this episode of Let’s Eat In!
