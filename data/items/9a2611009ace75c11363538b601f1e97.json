  "title": "How to test your stress levels using your urine pH + how to heal hormonal imbalances that may be making you moody and anxious (with Dr. Anna Cabeca OB-GYN and hormone expert)",
  "description": "We all know that our hormones are important, but did you know that they can impact our mood and mental health as well? In this podcast, I spoke to Dr. Anna Cabeca, an OB-GYN, bestselling author and hormone expert, about the neuroendocrine system, how our hormones affect our mood and mental wellbeing, how the keto diet boosts brain energy and can help us lose weight and what our urine says about our stress levels. \n \nDr. Anna’s desire to help others was inspired by her own life story. After the traumatic death of her young son, Anna’s health started declining as she went through PTSD-induced early menopause. Even though she was a highly-qualified doctor who trained at one of the best schools in the country, she was at a loss: nothing was working, so she went around the world looking for answers. \n \nDuring her healing journey, Dr. Anna began to realize the importance of lifestyle choices and habits, and the impact they have on our hormonal health and mental and physical wellbeing. She recognized the importance of a holistic mind and body approach to health, and now teaches others how they too can heal and live their best lives!\n \nThis podcast was made possible by our sponsor Kettle & Fire- my all time favorite bone broth company! To get 15% off your Kettle & Fire bone broth order see: Kettleandfire.com/drleaf or use code DRLEAF at checkout. \n \n \n \nPodcast Time Stamps\n4:20 Why Dr. Anna has always loved medicine, and how her own struggles inspired her to help others\n8:20 The Hormone Fix, and how to deal with negative effects of perimenopause and menopause\n13:31 Hormones and mental health: how are they connected and what you can do about it\n20:09 Cortisol: the good, the bad and the ugly\n22:01 Insulin resistance, hormonal imbalance and weight gain\n32:22 What your urine pH says about your stress levels   \n36:07 What are bioidentical hormones and why are they important?\n42:20 Is the keto diet good for our hormones?\n \nRead the full show blog and transcript here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/is-a-hormonal-imbalance-making-you-moody-anxious-and-overweight-the-hormonal-problem-and-solution-with-dr-anna-cabeca-ob-gyn-and-hormone-expert\n \n \nFor more info on Dr. Anna and to get her books visit: https://drannacabeca.com\n \n \nAdditional Resources:\n \n-Join my text group for more tips, notifications of sales, and more!
