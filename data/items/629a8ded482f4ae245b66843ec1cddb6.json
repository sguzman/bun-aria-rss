  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast we take a question from anchor that inspired the topic for the episode, self doubt. \nSelf doubt is something that we all deal with in some capacity but it is especially relevant for creators and artists. We deal with self doubt on a regular basis and we share some stories from our personal experience with the emotion. \nWe also give advice on how to deal with self doubt and give an update on our skydiving experience from last week. \nThanks to everyone who has reviewed the podcast and everyone who has left us a voice message on anchor, we seriously appreciate all the support. Enjoy the episode and tweet at us @colinandsamir",
