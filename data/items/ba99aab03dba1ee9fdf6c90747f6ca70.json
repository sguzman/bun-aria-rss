Most notably, they power electric vehicles, which have the potential to replace emissions produced by road transportation. \n\nBut thereâ€™s a problem. These batteries require nickel. And in Indonesia, where the majority of nickel is produced, the production process emits large amounts of carbon and pollution. Itâ€™s impacting the people who live by the production centers, who are registering an increase in respiratory illnesses. The US is essentially outsourcing carbon emissions and pollution in exchange for green energy. \n\nIt doesnâ€™t have to be this way. Indonesia sits along the Ring of Fire, one of the most geologically active regions in the world, making it an ideal place to produce geothermal energy.\n\nGeothermal energy taps into the heat beneath the ground mostly found in volcanic regions. To use the heat beneath the earthâ€™s surface, we need to drill into the ground, draw up the hot water, and use it to turn turbines that produce electricity. After, the water is funneled back underground, making geothermal a mostly clean and renewable energy source. \n\nWhile the exploration and development process of geothermal energy can be expensive, Indonesia already has more than 30 active geothermal facilities. \n\nAs the worldâ€™s need for lithium-ion batteries increases, Indonesia and the companies invested in the region have the opportunity to make their processes greener from start to finish â€” and protect the people that live next to nickel production centers.\n\nTo understand the repercussions of nickel production in Indonesia and how geothermal energy could help fix the air pollution and emissions it produces, watch our video.\n\nThe Future Perfect team at Vox explores big problems and the big ideas that can tackle them.
