  "description": "<p>Oprah Winfrey says that for many people searching for peace and purpose, one of the biggest obstacles can be the struggle to forgive. Especially if one has suffered trauma, abuse or personal betrayals, forgiveness can seem like an insurmountable hurdle. The journey to releasing resentments and vengeful thoughts, and the letting go of all hope for a better past, are probably some of the biggest spiritual challenges any of us will ever face. Oprah says if we accept these challenges, the rewards are great because on the other side of forgiveness is freedom. In this episode of Super Soul, Oprah sits down with such luminaries as Dr. Maya Angelou, Karen Armstrong, Marianne Williamson, Adyashanti, Mark Nepo, Wayne Dyer, Gabrielle Bernstein, Don Miguel Ruiz, Tracey Jackson, Shaka Senghor, Bryan Stevenson and Michael Singer to discover what it means to truly forgive and the steps we all can take to find personal freedom. These interviews with talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from her Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday</em>. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s New York Times best-selling book <em>The Wisdom of Sundays.</em></p>\n",
