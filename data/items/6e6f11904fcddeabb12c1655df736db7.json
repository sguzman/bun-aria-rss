  "description": "You can't turn on a TV these days without hearing a song by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros: \"Janglin'\" and especially \"Home\" have popped up in countless ads and musical montages, everywhere from 'American Idol' to 'Community.' Still, the absolute best place to take in the 10-piece band's gloriously uplifting ruckus is on the concert stage, where the music takes on the celebratory and intense air of a revival show. When singers Edward Sharpe (a.k.a. Alex Ebert) and Jade Castrinos lock eyes and sing to each other, it conjures images of Johnny and June, if Johnny Cash were a towering figure with dreadlocks and no undershirt. Here, the L.A. band performs live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
