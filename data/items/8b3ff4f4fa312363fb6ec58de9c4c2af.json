  "description": "<p>Community is so incredibly important! In a culture today that values self-sufficiency and where it's every man for himself, we felt it was necessary to spend an episode covering one of the key fundamental values in our lives: community. Specifically we discuss how <strong>community can save you money</strong>, how it can <strong>help you out in a pinch</strong>, and how it <strong>contributes to a healthy and balanced life</strong>. Even though we love to talk about saving money, there are things you just can’t purchase that community provides, and we really had a great time covering those topics.</p><p>We also spend a minute talking about digital communities and how they are awesome… but they shouldn’t replace physical and neighborhood community in your life.</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we shared a bottle of Hello Beautiful by Monday Night Brewing, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
