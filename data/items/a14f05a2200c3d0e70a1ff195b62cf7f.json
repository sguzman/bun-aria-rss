  "description": "When it comes to the people we vote for, how corrupt is too corrupt? With Herb Jackson, Washington correspondent for USA Today and The Record. We take a whirlwind tour of the U.S. politicians hitting the campaign trail with a dark cloud hanging over their heads. We land in New Jersey, where Senate Democrats suddenly have to worry about a tighter race. The reason? Their incumbent, Bob Menendez, narrowly escaped corruption charges last year. \nWe’ll be piloting What Next in public for the next several weeks. Tell us what you think: whatnext@slate.com.  Follow us on Instagram for updates on the show, our weekend reading lists, and occasional posts about pita chips.\nPodcast production by Mary Wilson and Jayson De Leon. Engineering by Terence Bernardo. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
