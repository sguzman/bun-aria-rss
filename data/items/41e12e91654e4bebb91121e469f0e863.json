  "description": "<p>We love to visit cemeteries. They are so peaceful and many of the older ones are like parks. We will be talking about a couple of these park-like cemeteries today. We'll be in New York to check out a graveyard that inspired Central Park, Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. Then there is Spring Hill Cemetery in West Virginia that is home to victims of epidemics and a plane crash. Indiana's Clark County has several old cemeteries with unique legends and finally our listener Dannah Jones joins us to discuss Maple Hill Cemetery and its creepy legend that will make you think twice about the swings at the playground. All of these places of rest have several spirits at unrest! Moment in Oddity features a tale from listener Chelsea Bishop about a ghost cemetery guide and This Month in History features Jamaica's Second Maroon War.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pics can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-217-haunted-cemeteries-3.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-217-haunted-cemeteries-3.html</a></p> <p>Become a part of our growing team dedicated to keeping us ad-free: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>",
