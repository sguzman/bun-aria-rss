  "content": "<p>I joined ASAPP in August 2017 as its 78th hire. I'd just finished my Open-Source ML <a href=\"https://willwolf.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/\">\"Master's\"</a> in Morocco; I wanted to <a href=\"https://willwolf.io/2022/10/25/my-next-role/\">join</a> \"a small company with ML at its core.\" I was referred by an old colleague. We barely had a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170825060205/https://www.asapp.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>51 months went by quickly. ASAPP was a magical place. To my colleagues, know that you made a profound personal, professional, intellectual, and creative impact on my life. That our time by the whiteboard with fickle black markers, the monsoon swell of positive energy and \"is there an extra chair for me?\" that were our daily lunches, our unfettered excitement for the field and optimism for the technologies we build are golden memories that I'll hold close to my heart for years to come.</p>\n<p>All great stories must one day end. For me, that was yesterday. It was peculiar and bittersweet. I'm sincerely lucky to have worked at ASAPP, and I look forward to seeing all they accomplish in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>From the bottom of my heart, thank you.</strong></p>\n<p>From here, I'm starting something new! I'll share an update soon.</p>\n<p>@will</p>",
