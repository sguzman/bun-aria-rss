The algorithm aims to produce warning signals when risk is emerging, rather than after it has already arrived.\nThe last four months the model has been giving a clear buy signal. More recently, however, \"the metrics are tapering down\" to right above the bullish threshold, says Gettings. \"If I were to see much more deterioration, I would probably call a sell, but it hasn't happened yet.\"\nTopics Covered\n\n2:15 - Investing strategy\n\n3:30 - How did you develop your algorithm?\n\n9:00 - What do your models tell us about the present day?\n\n12:40 - A lesson you've learned over time\n\n14:45 - January sell single.. how bad and when will it turn around?\n\n16:45 - What scares you about the market?\n\n18:45 - Something that gives you confidence\n\n21:15 - Leveraged ETFs... more or less risk?\n\n25:00 - Portfolio warning signs/stock picks.
