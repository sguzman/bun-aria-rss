  "description": "We are so thrilled to welcome back our guest today, Janie Molster, who you may have heard on episode 117. She is an interior designer from Richmond, Virginia known for decorating spaces with exuberant color and a masterful mix of antique and contemporary pieces. Since we last spoke to her in 2019, she has written a book called House Dressing: Interiors for Colorful Living. Today we chat about her signature color usage, antiques, the importance of balance, and designing your house for TODAY and not waiting for someday!\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nTrials & Triumphs with gallery walls and wires, soft washing a 90 year old house, getting rid of bats, new windows and doors, finding the perfect nursery rug, and doggies ruining the perfect nursery rug.\n\nJanie’s philosophy is to make homes glamorous yet durable.\n\nBalance is the key!\n\nWhat are Janie’s rules when it comes to window treatments?\n\nHow does Janie do pink so well?\n\nHow to still have fun and be bold with neutral colors.\n\nWhat are Janie's tips to shop for antiques?\n\nWhat antique piece is Janie currently in love with?\n\nJanie’s design philosophy on ceilings and floors.\n\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nHi Christie,\nI love where you’re going with the performance fabrics! To your point about patterns, I’m with you and think you should stick with a solid color. They have come a long way. If it were me, I would definitely consider going slightly darker on your sofa and in a warm taupe or gray to ground your room. Overall for your space go for warmth. On that back wall, I would do some sheer curtains (you can hear my rant earlier in the episode about curtains!). Then I would consider a console table for the back of that sofa. I can tell you’re drawn to a quieter mix of materials, so for patterns I would focus on pillows and lampshades. You could add something like an upholstered bench for when you have guests over and you could potentially add some pattern there. I would not get hung up on adding pattern to the pair of chairs; I would go with performance linen white. Art, like you said, is a great way to add color! Lastly, with the spaciousness of your room I think you can size up on your coffee table. Your furniture is rather spread out so I would consider pulling it in to make it more convivial. Don’t create a “time out” space for your guests!\nIn your dining room, the chandelier is great. But it could also really use some beautiful and bold curtains! I would also consider painting the walls all the same color. If you’re nervous about patterned curtains, you could use the same color as the paint for warmth. And the colors from the rooms should speak to each other. Then I would put something fabulous that lives in the center of your dining table. It doesn’t have to literally be “alive” as it could be a collection of vases, sculpture, etc.\nYou have such a great space with wonderful lighting. We love it and can’t wait to see what you do!\nMentioned in This Episode:\nJanie Molster Designs\nJanie Molster Designs on Instagram\nHouse Dressing also available at Target, Amazon, Barnes & Noble\nHTD Episode 117\nChairish\n1stDibs",
