  "description": "<p>This week we finish breaking down The Job. We start off on the streets of New York with Jim and Karen and get some great background catches, and Angela does a fun deep dive on the \"bar that used to be a Church\" mentioned by Jim. Then, we discuss the very funny scene's back in Scranton where Pam accepts Dwight's offer to be the Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager and we get the introduction of the Schrute Bucks. Finally, we chat about those hilarious scenes with Jan leaving corporate, that iconic moment when Jim interrupts Pam's talking head, and Jenna reveals there was an alternate ending of this episode. Thank you for finishing season three with us, you served the podcast with great dignity. </p>\n",
