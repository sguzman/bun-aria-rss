  "description": "The two books in today's episode point up how authors write and empathize with characters that aren't exactly likable. First we hear from Anthony Doerr who spoke to NPR correspondent Arun Rath about his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel <em>All The Light We Cannot See</em>. Doer talks about how we can better understand the moral choices people make by tuning into untold stories. Then, Scott Simon of NPR's Weekend Edition interviews author Yiyun Li about her new novel <em>The Book of Goose</em>. It's a story of two ruthless French girls who write a book that alters their lives. ",
