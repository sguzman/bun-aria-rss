  "description": "<p>John Green's&nbsp;Looking for Alaska&nbsp;is another young adult coming-of-age novel in a long tradition of young adult coming-of-age novels. A young man goes away to school and becomes close with a small group of friends. They smoke, they drink, they have sexual experiences, they lose, they mourn.</p><p>It's nothing that hasn't been done, but Green's light tone and deeper thematic questions make&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;worth reading whether you're still a young adult or not. Join us for more thoughts on this book, as well as the great Central Air Conditioning vs. Dishwasher debate of 2015.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
