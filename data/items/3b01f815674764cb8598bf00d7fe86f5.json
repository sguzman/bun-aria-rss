  "description": "<p><b>For the final week of our Advent 2020 series, Raechel and Amanda talk with the very neighborly singer-songwriters, Drew and Ellie Holcomb. As the couple shares about the time they took cover from a tornado in the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, they also marvel at the audacity of God wrapping Himself in flesh to become one of us. Together, our musical guests play two carols and remind us that no matter where we find ourselves—whether the rim of the Grand Canyon or the stage of an empty auditorium—we can keep singing hope into the darkness. During a time when it feels like we’ve been “adventing” all year, we find comfort in the never-changing heart of the Christmas story: God is with us, always. </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 4 of the She Reads Truth Advent 2020 reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Advent 2020 collection at </b><a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/advent-2020-week-4-with-drew-and-ellie-holcomb/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/advent-2020-week-4-with-drew-and-ellie-holcomb/</b></a></p>",
