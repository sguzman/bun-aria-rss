  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys recap Tony and Nick's escape from the clutches of Covid (they didn't have it), and dive right into the Pod FOD which features their ultimate Halloween candy lineups, an asteroid that is potentially worth quintillions of dollars, what the appropriate age to stop trick or treating is, they pay homage to the wrestler from the last episode who needs a bit of help after breaking both of his legs in a backyard wrestling match, decide whether or not they'd like to hibernate or be nocturnal, control fire or water, among many, many other things. Plus Nick goes through a few spooky songs to help you get ready for the weekend in a special Halloween edition of Friday Bangerz. Don't forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD into @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram, and subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow to become a member of the McAfee Mafia and watch the video version of the show. We appreciate you all for listening, stay safe this holiday weekend, and Happy Halloween. Enjoy.</p>\n",
