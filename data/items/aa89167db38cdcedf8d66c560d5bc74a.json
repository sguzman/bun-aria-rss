  "description": "I hope you enjoyed your Independence Day weekend! I start today’s show with a quick rant about those who oppose this national holiday… and highlight my own fun experiences from the weekend. While the Fed must force a recession to moderate inflation, the tactic appears to be working. I highlight some positive signs we’re seeing across markets, from bonds to commodities… And why I believe the Fed’s rate hikes could end sooner rather than later—which would cause the market to surge. I reiterate why you should start scaling into positions right now… and share my 3-part checklist for finding the best opportunities. Finally, I’ll be a keynote speaker at TCG World’s , held July 8–10 in Las Vegas. I’d love to see you there (booth B02).  In this episode:  A rant about July 4 haters [0:15] A recession is inevitable [6:15]  Why the Fed will end its rate hikes soon [9:59]  Why you should start scaling into positions now [16:40] My checklist for the best buying opportunities [23:00] Meet me at TCG World’s  [26:43]  Enjoyed this episode?
