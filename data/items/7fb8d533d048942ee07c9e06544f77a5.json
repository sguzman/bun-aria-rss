  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the media is upset about a vote to award the congressional gold medal to all of the officers that defended the capitol on January 6th. Yet it was this same media that shunned local police, federal police, and park police when they did their jobs to defend their communities and federal property from arsonists and rioters last summer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn went as far as calling the brave men and women of law enforcement \"storm troopers\" (Nazis). In 1954, when four Marxist F.A.L.N. terrorists shot five Congressmen inside the Capitol building, no police were given medals. Democrat Marxists only seem to care about the Capitol Police, not the police that serves the rest of America. Then, President Biden is thin-skinned and gets frustrated with CNN reporters asking him legitimate questions. Meanwhile, Putin criticized Biden by focusing on all the shootings in the US. Afterward, Republican Conference Chair, Rep. Elise Stefanik calls in with a critique of Biden and his awful overseas trip.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
