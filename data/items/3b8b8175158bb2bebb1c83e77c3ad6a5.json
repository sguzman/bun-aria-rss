  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming two guests to the show. My first guest writes “I was all night fishing by myself at the same lake as the other times. It is my first sighting and I don’t know, it has really shaken me up. It was about 10:30 pm on Friday night . Dead calm, light fog but only on the water. It was fairly good visibility. I had my boat starting to go down the long channel on this “T” shaped lake. I heard a very deep gut type growl, but didn’t see anything. I pulled out my spot light which is 2,000,000 candle light power. It died in acouple of seconds. The growl was becoming more aggressive. I reached in my storage bin and pulled out my Taurus millennium pro pt111 9mm. I chambered a full metal jacket round and aimed it in the direction of the noise. This thing had been squatted down by a bush next to where 4 old boats are turned upside down. When it stood up it was massive.I could see it from the waist up. It started to move away from me but kept looking at me. I stepped on the trolling motor, turned the boat away from it to put more distance between us. I watched it the whole time. As I was going away, it turned, threw its arms in the air (yes arms) and charged about 10 feet or so. I spun the boat around and it violently threw its arms down. It was breathing so heavily it sounded like it was hyperventilating.  I still had my weapon aimed at it. I knew a 9mm wouldn’t do much with a chest shot, so I had it trained towards where its testicle may be. I couldn’t see them but was locked on to the general area.It let out a scream and stomped off. It continued to vocalize for 20 min or so as it left. I couldn’t make out much facial features except lighter skin on its face. It was black colored approx 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall. I would guess at least 600-700 lbs. Broad shoulders, its hands were down to its knees. I will also be speaking to Greg who had an interesting encounter in Washington State.</p>",
