  "description": "<p>“Mistress, we’re already in Quarantine; must we add orgasm denial, too?!” Marcia B’s non-binary partner Cami loves chastity play and humiliation, and Marcia soon realizes how compatible their kinks are - power exchange and cock cages work well together. But when Marcia’s Chastity cards determine that Cami’s cock will be locked up for over 100 days, she creates a sadistic zoom board meeting and enlists her meanest femme domme friends to determine Cami’s fate. Will Cami the Submissive be able to earn their way out of Chastity? #Psychological #Gamify #NoPants #EarnIt</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Locked Out of Heaven’ (Bruno Mars)</p> <p> </p> <p>About this storyteller: Marcia B is an internationally-recognized speaker, writer, coach and expert on sexual communication, relationships and women’s empowerment.
