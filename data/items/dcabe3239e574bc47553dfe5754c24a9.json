    "media:description": "A few years ago we tested Shimano's 105 and Dura-Ace mechanical groupsets against each other, and learnt that they were pretty much, in terms of feel, exactly the same. But Shimano has since released new versions of both, and what's more they're both Di2 only! So is there any difference? Is Dura-Ace still virtually exactly the same as 105? Alex and Si conduct a series of tests to find out! \n\nIn association with @#RideShimano  ðŸ‘‰ https://gcn.eu/Shimano\n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro \n02:28 - Challenge 1: Hot Lap \n05:32 - Challenge 2: Blindfolded Outdoors\n08:10 - Challenge 3: Braking And Climbing\n11:49 - Challenge 4: Blindfolded Indoors\n16:28 - Conclusions\n\nUseful Links:\nAdventure Documentaries, Exclusive Shows & Live Racing on GCN+: https://gcn.eu/plus\nDownload the GCN App for free: https://gcn.eu/app\nVisit the GCN Shop: https://gcn.eu/winter-kit\nJoin the GCN Club: https://www.gcnclub.com/\n\nWhat do you think of Shimano 105 being Di2 only?
