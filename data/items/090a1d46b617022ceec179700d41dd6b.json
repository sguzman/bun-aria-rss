  "description": "<p>What Are Zombie Cells? | This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://perfectketo.com/drmark\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Perfect Keto</a></p><br><p>We used to think that aging is synonymous with decline but we’re now learning that this doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. We’re also learning that there are ways we can harness our body’s innate repair mechanisms to slow down, and even sometimes, reverse the aging process. One such way is to reduce the number of senescent--or zombie--cells that we have. So what are zombie cells, and how can we get rid of them? Dr. Hyman recently discussed this in his conversation with Dr. David Sinclair, Dave Asprey, and Max Lugavere.</p><br><p>Dr. David Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School, where he and his colleagues study longevity, aging, and how to slow its effects. More specifically, their focus is on studying sirtuins—protein-modifying enzymes that respond to changing NAD+ levels and to caloric restriction—as well as metabolism, neurodegeneration, cancer, cellular reprogramming, and more. Among other awards, he was included in Time Magazine’s list of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” and Time's “Top 50 in Healthcare.”</p><br><p>Dave Asprey is the founder and CEO of Bulletproof 360, creator of the global phenomenon Bulletproof Coffee, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, the host of the Webby award-winning podcast Bulletproof Radio, serial entrepreneur, and global change agent. By employing the principles of biohacking (a term added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in September of 2018 with Dave’s influence) Dave has lost over 100 pounds, upgraded his brain, learned to sleep more efficiently in less time, and become a more effective entrepreneur, husband, father, and overall human being. In this episode, he shares his top tips and tricks for being superhuman and living to be 180 or beyond.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Max Lugavere is a filmmaker, health, and science journalist and the author of the New York Times bestselling book Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life. He is also the host of the #1 iTunes health podcast The Genius Life. Max’s sophomore book, The Genius Life: Heal Your Mind, Strengthen Your Body, and Become Extraordinary, is a lifestyle guide to living happily and healthily with proven, research-based lifestyle tactics, which we dig into more throughout this episode.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Perfect Keto.
