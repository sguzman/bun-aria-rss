  "description": "<p>It’s over... After a 2 1/2 year wait, The Wilbur is finally over. Both shows came and went and Kirk gives them two thumbs up. The crew goes over the positives of the event and also go over what went wrong. A former Thursday sidekick doesn’t understand what a “clean break” is and decided to show up the 2nd show and now Kirk HATES him (00:52:48). A former Minifan is concerned with Kirk’s antics while performing and wants to get him help ASAP (01:11:40). Dave is excited to see pictures of The Wilbur and Kirk is announcing that the show will have a “Pizza Picture Party” (PPP).  Justin pitches his buy 5 get 1 free beer deal to a room full of sharks and a whole lot more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
