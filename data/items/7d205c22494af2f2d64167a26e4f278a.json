  "description": "<p>The schedule of events for the Barstool Sports Mini-Golf exhibition is absolutely outrageous. Kirk graciously releases all the tickets held back for family and friends to his adoring fans. The Wilbur gave us a plan for the VIP Meet and Greets and Kirk was not happy. Chris Klemmer went on Stoolie Clubhouse to vocally suck Kirk off. Brittney Griner should be home but does she carry some blame? A protest is taking place outside the studio, calls & much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
