  "description": "<p>On today's ep the Bayers welcome their good friend, the hilarious and supremely talented John Early! They reminisce about hanging out at Bonnaroo in Nashville and Vanessa does a really good rendition of an Ellie Goulding song and tries to convince everyone that she's genuinely friends with Chance the Rapper. They also get into nineties ab machines and how the Bayers owned an ab roller that Jonah didn't even know about, and how John almost burned himself many times with an ab toning belt. Finally, they play an incredible round of Change.Dork where they debate whether it's more important to support adding a burger chain to Nashville or a teenager who is fighting to keep the blender on the counter. You won't want to miss this honestly perfect episode.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
