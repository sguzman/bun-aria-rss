  "description": "<p>This week, we take a look at a man who was as much of a failure on the basketball court as he was in life. His career was short, but that just left him more time to pursue other activities, such as finding crack, smoking crack, then finding ways to get more crack. He was a menace to any polite society, especially the poor pizza delivery men of Los Angeles. It's sad, twisted, sordid tale of human disaster. In other words, he's right up our alley.Get cut by your team, grab a screwdriver, and steal anything that isn't bolted down with Darrell Allums!! Check us out, every Tuesday.
