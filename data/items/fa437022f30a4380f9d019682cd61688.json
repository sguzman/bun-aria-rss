  "description": "<p>Responding to the twitter poll, you guys want more finance and #DeFi explanations. So instead of assuming you know how to use #option strategies to help with risk management, let's do it in this video. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No overwhelm. Just simple basic strategies for now. &nbsp;&nbsp;We cover 3 strategies today: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Covered call — think of it as being LP on HEGIC's platform &nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Married put — think of it as insurance for price falling &nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Bull spread call — think of it as LP on #HEGIC and insurance for price falling &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why am I covering this? Because next week's #OPYN's protocol has such strategies available. So it might be useful to understand them when we do the deep dive. It's better to explain to a few who don't know, than to assume everyone knows and skip this!</p>\n",
