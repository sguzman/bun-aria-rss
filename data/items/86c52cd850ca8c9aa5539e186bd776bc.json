  "description": "Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) practice periodic surveillance of member states to ensure they are adopting effective economic policies. Despite the importance of these practices, they remain understudied by scholars until now. Martin Edwards has written The IMF, the WTO & the Politics of Economic Surveillance (Routledge, 2018). Edwards is an Associate Professor in the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University and is also department chair.\nThe world is paying increasing attention to issues of transparency and accountability, questioning whether the IMF and WTO are in part responsible for the global economic crisis, as well as assessing their responsiveness to the crisis. Examining the influence and effectiveness of surveillance, Edwards offers recommendations of how surveillance can be designed differently to make it more effective in the future.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
