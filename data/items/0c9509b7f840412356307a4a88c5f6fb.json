  "title": "156 - The Confession Killers: Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole",
  "description": "<p>Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole committed at least four murders, or maybe five. They were, collectively, convicted of seventeen. But they definitely didn't kill some of the people they were convicted of killing. They would confess to over 600. And they for sure didn't kill all of them. But they may have killed others they never confessed too. They were definitely murderers and they were definitely liars and they seemed to enjoy lying more than murdering. And unlike most criminals, they loved to lie about crimes they definitely didn't commit. They were terrible men who wanted to be known as pure evil men. And their tale is a strange one, a dark one, and a fascinating one. Join me as I try to separate dark fact from even darker fiction, today, on Timesuck!</p>\n<p><strong>Moretta |</strong> <strong>In Need of Better | Official Music Video:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ff8CEnHj64U\"><strong>https://youtu.be/Ff8CEnHj64U</strong></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Donating $3000 this month to </strong>the nonprofit - Youth on Record.
