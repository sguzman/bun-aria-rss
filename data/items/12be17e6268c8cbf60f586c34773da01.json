  "description": "Supermodel Georgie Badiel grew up in a small village in Burkina Faso where the closest source of water was many miles from home. After launching her successful modeling career, she began to speak out about the vital importance clean water can have on a community, drawing on her personal experience to educate others. Author Susan Verde and New York Times bestselling illustrator Peter H. Reynolds were inspired by Georgie’s story, and together all three have crafted a poignant picture book called, The Water Princess (G.P. Putnam’s Sons Books for Young Readers, 2016). Perfect for classroom teaching and for bedtime reading, The Water Princess illustrates one girl’s dream of helping her community, while educating readers on this important global issue. A percentage of the proceeds are being donated to the Ryan’s Well Foundation and to the Georgie Badiel Foundation. Susan Verde writes children’s books and teaches kid’s yoga and mindfulness. She is also the author of the picture books The Museum, and You and Me, I Am Yoga.
