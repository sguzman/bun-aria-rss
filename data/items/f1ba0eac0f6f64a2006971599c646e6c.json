That’s around $100 off their regular price of $278, and much better than the typical $30 discount we see.</p>\n<p id=\"Y8NhKL\">The WF-1000XM4 frequently come up when we’re talking earbuds, namely because they’re just that good. The excellent all-rounders offer terrific sound quality, lengthy battery life, and some of the best noise cancellation you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. They’ve remained our top pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\">best earbuds you can buy</a> since their debut because of this, even if the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23353777/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review\">Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II</a> recently edged them out in the ANC department. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review\">Read our review</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"OXyNkU\">\n<div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10848037\"></div>\n<aside id=\"ojVneq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sony is bringing multipoint to its earbuds lineup including the WF-1000XM4\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423007/sony-multipoint-earbuds-bluetooth-announced-wf1000xm4-linkbuds\"},{\"title\":\"Now’s the time to buy last year’s iPad\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439082/ipad-apple-tablets-10th-gen-buy-last-years-instead-new\"}]}'></div></aside>\n</div>\n<p id=\"P7coAr\">There may be a new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23427142/apple-ipad-pro-12-9-2022-tablet-ipados-apple-pencil-review\">M2-powered iPad Pro</a> available, but I’m here to tell you, “no.” No, you should not pay $1,199 for the 12.9-inch configuration of the iPad Pro. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/4/23439082/ipad-apple-tablets-10th-gen-buy-last-years-instead-new\">savvy move</a> would be to pick up a last-gen iPad Pro with Apple’s M1 CPU while it’s still available.</p>\n<p id=\"2bIuc6\">Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is selling the <strong>12.9-inch M1 iPad Pro from 2021 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage for just $899.99</strong></a> ($200 off). That’s as low a price as you’ll find on this very capable tablet, which offers a beautiful Mini LED screen and just about everything the newer model does, save for some small stuff like the second-gen Apple Pencil’s new “hover” mode. Simply put, the M2 model doesn’t do a whole lot more to justify its higher price tag.</p>\n<p id=\"WfURyr\">With the M1 iPad Pro, you get the same Apple Pencil compatibility (sans hover), great battery life, Face ID, and — once again, because it bears repeating — that awesome 12.9-inch display. If you want a spacious iPad for doing laptop-like things, this is the one to get. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor\">Read our review</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"73P0w1\">Oh. And if you <em>really</em> do want the latest iPad Pro, you can currently get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0BJLBKMV8/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch base version with Apple’s M2 chip at Amazon for $749</a> ($50 off) — we’ll concede that much.</p>\n<div id=\"xqbioN\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10474637\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"The iPad Pro on a person’s lap while they use an Apple Pencil to edit a photo on the tablet.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lF20kEwDsHsYdlIqMirweSX1rmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524091/vpavic_210512_4592_0110.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Kayla Murkison / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>Bet you can’t tell if this is an M1 iPad Pro or an M2 iPad Pro.

Now, full disclosure, we have seen the KickScooter Max on sale for less before, but that was before Segway increased the price mere months into the pandemic. The current deal is just $50 shy of its all-time low, and definitely helps soften the blow of its inflated sticker price.</p>\n<p id=\"vq2pVW\">In terms of specs, the KickScooter Max can go up to 40 miles on a single charge, with a top speed of 18.6 mph. It also folds down for easier storage, so it’s great for short trips around a city or on a small commute. Just be careful out there if you’re surrounded by aggressive cagers.</p>\n<div id=\"B2SxU7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9570530\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"SrbGfz\">In case you missed it, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23432652/amazon-device-day-echo-show-kindle-fire-tv-blink-camera-deal-sale\">a bunch of Amazon devices are currently on sale</a> in celebration of Alexa’s birthday (because in addition to gendering the robots, we must apparently commemorate their “births”). These discounts apply to the <strong>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which is on sale for just $39.99</strong> at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-streaming-devicefire-tv-stick-4k-max-streaming-device-wi-fi-6-alexa-voice-remote-includes-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-82801903&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals110522\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/ciqZdO2RsWG\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. That’s $15 off one of the best streaming devices you can get, one that supports HDR for better color and contrast as well as Wi-Fi 6, ensuring a more reliable connection with less risk of buffering.</p>\n<p id=\"raxq5M\">You can spend a lot more to get a better streaming device, like the latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23435393/apple-tv-4k-2022-third-gen-review-price-details\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple TV 4K</a>, but it’s hard to beat the Max in terms of value at this price point. Just remember that while Amazon supports a wide variety of apps, it loves nothing more than feeding you ads for Amazon Prime shows on its dashboard. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"LslPJs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11172961\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"QzEVpX\">If you play games on PlayStation or Xbox consoles, you can grab some nice discounts on gift cards for either the PlayStation Store or the Xbox storefront. Right now, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;clickref=vergedailydeals110422&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-100-usa-psn-key-united-states\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eneba is offering a <strong>$100 PlayStation Store digital gift card for $82.44</strong></a> (about $18 off) when you use code <strong>PSNWknd</strong> at checkout, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;clickref=vergedailydeals110422&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-live-100-usd-xbox-live-key-north-america%2Fregentgames\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$100 Xbox gift card for $77.67</strong></a> (about $22 off) with offer code <strong>XboxWknd</strong>. Both of these deals are good through November 7th at 7AM ET.</p>\n<p id=\"nf42rg\">These gift cards are delivered digitally, and they make for an excellent value if you have a console without a disc drive or simply prefer digital media — especially since the digital versions of most games don’t go on sale as frequently as the physical ones. The prices on Eneba may fluctuate by as much as a dollar or a few cents, but that’s normal since the retailer is Europe-based and the conversion to USD can slightly change from moment to moment.</p>\n<div id=\"kRPfPe\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11301725\"></div></div>\n<div id=\"64iUih\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11301689\"></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"O65dE2\">The people, they demand more deals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"GggX6H\">Want some premium noise-canceling earbuds for less than our lead deal?
