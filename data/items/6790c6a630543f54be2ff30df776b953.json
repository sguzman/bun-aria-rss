They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.  I do not give medical advice over the internet.\n\nPeptic Ulcers need to be diagnosed by a clinician and appropriate treatment needs to be monitored. Psychiatric signs and symptoms from antibiotics are a rare reaction and should be monitored by a physician. This does not mean to avoid antibiotics, the benefit in the face of a bacterial infection generally outweighs the risk, at the discretion of the prescribing physician for the specific patient's illness. Milk Alkali Syndrome has been increasing in incidence over the last decade, despite H2 Antagonist and Proton Pump Inhibitor over-the-counter availability in the United States. This could be due to the common use of over-the-counter preparations of calcium for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Calcium carbonate is also frequently prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Milk-alkali syndrome now accounts for more than 10% of the cases of hypercalcemia and is the third most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients.
