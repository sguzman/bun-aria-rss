  "description": "<p>SPEND ON THE THINGS YOU LOVE.<br />\nWe all have an area of life we love spending money on. For me, it’s relationships. For you, it could be travel, food, wellness or something else. This is called your “money dial.” Once you figure out your money dial, you can spend intentionally on that rather than spending lots of money on everything. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Ramit Sethi where he shared about his concept of “money dials” and how to spend money on the things that bring you joy. Ramit says that we should cut back spending on things we don’t care about but spend without apology on the area that makes us the happiest. We can also stop judging other people for having different money dials than us. Learn how to identify your money dial and how it can take your life to the next level in Episode 798.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout the different “money dials” people have (1:40)<br />\nThe most common “money dial” (2:03)<br />\nRamit’s personal “money dial” (2:56)<br />\nWhat you should cut back spending on (4:18)<br />\nFollow me on:<br />\nInstagram @LewisHowes<br />\nTwitter @LewisHowes<br />\nFacebook @LewisHowes</p>\n",
