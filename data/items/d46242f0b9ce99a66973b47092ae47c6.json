  "description": "<p>Another incredible day of Olympic action is behind us and there are gold medals coming from everywhere for both Canada & Australia, so it's time to recap everything that happened on day 13 to bring you up to speed! How shocked is Australia at winning two gold medals that perhaps we didn't expect? Has Canada calmed down after Andre de Grasse's run yesterday and their gold medal decathlon success today? Are these the greatest Olympics ever? Is Canada now a powerhouse in both canoe and cycling? How does our commentary sound over artistic swimming? And how will we celebrate New Zealand's greatest ever Olympian being crowned today? So much to get through, so get to listening!</p>",
