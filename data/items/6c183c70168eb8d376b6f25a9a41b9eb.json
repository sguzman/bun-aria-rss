  "description": "Chelsea Peretti, Pete's \"worst best friend\" comes BACK to make it weird a second time, this time playing clips of the many times Pete has mentioned her on the show before and giving her a chance to retort. This is 99% new stuff, weirdos, just with some clips to give us jumping off points. Please enjoy, especially as Chelsea gives a detailed description of how she would kill Pete (they're close friends, we swear!).",
