  "description": "<p>It can often feel like stress is all around us. Stress can come in many different forms. Socioeconomic stress is a real burden for many people, as is the stress of taking care of several generations within a family, or meeting the demands of our jobs. Stress can also come in the form of bad food and poor or inadequate sleep. In all its many forms stress leads to inflammation. And inflammation actually kills the brain cells that help us make good decisions, and it makes those in the fight or flight part of the brain grow. This leads to anger and opposition and supports negative behavior and decision making.</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman explores how stress can lead us to make unhealthy choices in his recent conversations with Drs. Rangan Chatterjee, Austin Perlmutter, and David Perlmutter. They also share information about what we can do to stop the negative effects of stress in our lives.</p><br><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK and wants to change how medicine will be practiced for years to come. He hosts the biggest health podcast in Europe, Feel Better, Live More, which Apple has announced as one of the most downloaded new podcasts of the past year. His first book, How to Make Disease Disappear, is an international bestseller all over the world and has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide in just 18 months. His most recent book, the #1 bestseller, The Stress Solution, tackles what the WHO calls the health epidemic of our time—stress.</p><br><p>Dr. David Perlmutter is a Board-Certified Neurologist and four-time New York Times bestselling author. He serves on the Board of Directors and is a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition. He serves as a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and has published extensively in peer-reviewed scientific journals including Archives of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and The Journal of Applied Nutrition.

He received his medical degree from the University of Miami and completed his internal medicine residency at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland Oregon.
