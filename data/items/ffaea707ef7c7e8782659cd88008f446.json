  "description": "“Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is a ridiculous one.” Voltaire\nYou know too much, yet understand too little. And it’s the same for me, and everyone you and I happen to know.\nAnd, so it begins.\nWhat follows are a series of posts and audio-casts that respond to this living human condition, bringing together practice materials from non-Buddhism, post-traditional approaches to Buddhism, and the work of Peter Sloterdjik. Each post represents a visit to the Great Feast and provides ideas for practice for those who simply cannot find a home in mainstream Buddhism, Mindfulness, Atheism, or some other form of spirituality.\nThis second part engages Peter Sloterdijk and the challenges of creating a practice in our contemporary moment.\nIt can be read and re-read here if you have appetite for more here.\nMatthew O'Connell is a life coach and the host of the The Imperfect Buddha podcast.
