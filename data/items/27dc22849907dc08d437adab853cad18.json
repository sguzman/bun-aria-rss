  "description": "<p>David Williams is Executive Producer of Singletown on HBO Max, which begins with a unique ending as five couples press pause on their relationships and spend one incredible summer living their best single lives in the city. The newly separated couples and their four new flatmates move into two luxury Singletown apartments, which, to their surprise, are located in the same building and come with a celebrity mentor. Supported by their mentor’s matchmaking skills, the singletons embark on an indulgent summer full of money-can’t-buy exclusive dates, out of this world parties and unforgettable experiences. At the end of each week, the couples meet to take part in the Love Locket ceremony. Will they choose to reunite and leave the show as a couple or will one, or both of them, choose to stay single and remain in Singletown? </p><p> </p><p>Lisa from One Funny Mommy on IG reviews Real Housewives of Potomac and New Jersey, and discusses Dorinda Medley leaving Real Housewives of New York.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Reality Life with Kate Casey</p><p>Patreon: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.patreon.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Cameo: <a href=\"https://www.cameo.com/katecasey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cameo.com/katecasey</a></p><p>Twitter: @katecasey</p><p>Instagram: @katecaseyca</p><p>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/113157919338245/</a></p><p>Facebook.com/loveandknuckles</p><p>Amazon List: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/shop/katecaseyca</a></p> \n <br><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
