  "description": "In today’s episode, Sharon chats with author and scholar Anna Makaika Tubbs about the mothers of three well-known Civil Rights activists, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin. Anna, influenced by the Black women in <em>Hidden Figures</em>, began researching Black mothers, a demographic that often goes unnoticed or even erased. Through their own stories, and through their love for their sons, the mothers of these three men significantly impacted their lives. Sharon and Anna discuss the art of research, and how intricate the work is, especially when writing narrative non-fiction, and how the writer ultimately has a responsibility to relay the truth through the craft of the story.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
