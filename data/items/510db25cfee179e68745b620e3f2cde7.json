  "description": "<p>This week, I've invited my friend Brittany Meeks to talk about our growth over the past few decades. And why you may ask? Well, it's my birthday this week. As with any birthday that ends with a zero, a lot of emotions come along with it.</p> <p>On Thursdays, I will be doing a bonus episode where my friends and I will discuss about some of our own personal discoveries and opinions on beauty, health and wellness.</p> <p>And I also want to hear from you. Share some of your aha moments on beauty, health and wellness, and have a discussion. If you're on Apple podcasts, write your aha moment in the comment section. Or you can email me at <a href= \"mailto:beautyuncovered@olaplex.com\">beautyuncovered@olaplex.com</a>. And maybe you could be chosen to come on our Thursday discussion panel.</p>",
