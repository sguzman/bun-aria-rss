  "description": "<p>The costs and impacts of government corruption range from impairing a\ncountry's economic growth to affecting its citizens' well-being and safety.\nPublic contracting between government dependencies and private sector\ninstances, referred to as public procurement, is a fertile land of opportunity\nfor corrupt practices, generating substantial monetary losses worldwide. Thus,\nidentifying and deterring corrupt activities between the government and the\nprivate sector is paramount. However, due to several factors, corruption in\npublic procurement is challenging to identify and track, leading to corrupt\npractices going unnoticed. This paper proposes a machine learning model based\non an ensemble of random forest classifiers, which we call hyper-forest, to\nidentify and predict corrupt contracts in M\\'exico's public procurement data.\nThis method's results correctly detect most of the corrupt and non-corrupt\ncontracts evaluated in the dataset. Furthermore, we found that the most\ncritical predictors considered in the model are those related to the\nrelationship between buyers and suppliers rather than those related to features\nof individual contracts. Also, the method proposed here is general enough to be\ntrained with data from other countries. Overall, our work presents a tool that\ncan help in the decision-making process to identify, predict and analyze\ncorruption in public procurement contracts.\n</p>",
