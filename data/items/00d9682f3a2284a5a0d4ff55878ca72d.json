  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, Brent Reaves and Clay Newcomb hit the two-lane highways and byways of America in search of taxidermy in gas stations. This type of public display of bucks, bears and ducks is becoming rarer - and we’re in search of why. The public display of taxidermy is something deep in the root system of American identity and symbolic of a way of life. The American gas station at one time acted as the “town square” and relational hub of small communities, but things are changing. We’ll talk with podcaster, JB Shreve about how the oil and gas industry has impacted America since World War 1, and we’ll also talk with an expert on the tangible effects of social capital on communities, but not before the crew makes finds incredible gas-station bucks and people. Get a cold fountain drink and buckle up because we’re about roll down the road – we doubt you’re going to want to miss this one.</p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
