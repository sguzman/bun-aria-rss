  "description": "<p>Does this melodious voice sound familiar? Maybe even like it was cursed by a witch in order to achieve paranormal radio stardom? That's right, we have the one and only Terry Carnation from Dark Air as our first, best (and only) guest. He's known by many names and we've heard the moniker Rainn Wilson floating around too but we firmly believe that identity theft is real, so we're hoping the latter isn't a fraudulent imposter. Happy April Fools Day! Don't forget to store your souls (NOT sperm) in a crystal pendant and wear it non-stop in case you expire in the Venice canals and have to be fished out by a gondolier (or Em's bare hands)... and that's why we drink!<br /><br />Make sure to listen to Terry's triumphant return to radio in Dark Air, premiering April 1st, 2021! You can also hear Terry on Radio Rental and explore his collection of spooky stories on VHS - both are available on all your favorite listening platforms! <br /><br />Please consider supporting the companies that support us! <br /><br />Right now, you can get $75 off your first order at Burrow.com/DRINK<br /><br />To help you welcome the new season in style, Rothy’s is doing something they’ve never done before.
