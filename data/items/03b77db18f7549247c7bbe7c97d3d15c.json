  "description": "<p>We’ve all played the “what does that cloud look like” game. Maybe you saw a bunny… or an airplane… or a unicorn. What if that same cloud could also be seen by someone in a far off continent? That’s what a listener in Minnesota wondered. He wanted to know if the same cloud he saw in a park near his house could also be seen in Africa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We talk to Deanna Hence, one of our favorite weather experts, and she tells us about how clouds travel. We also dust off the Zoom Ray to learn about what is inside of a cloud. And have you ever noticed the similarities between cloud types, like cumulonimbus, and magic spells from <em>Harry Potter</em>? Well, we have, and we made a game out of it!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We also have a brand new Mystery Sound for your guessing pleasure and a Moment of Um that answers the question: Why do pugs have such scrunchy faces?  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Indeed.com (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
