  "description": "<p>Today I'm joined by my buddy Garrett who's a huge Wiz fan. Wiz Khalifa is a raper and producer. He's as big as it gets in the rap world. He has a really interesting conversation with Joe that goes into everything from how he started out to his new quest with fitness and MMA training. I Didn't know a great deal about Wiz before I went to review his podcast with Joe and I was impressed by how he thinks.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
