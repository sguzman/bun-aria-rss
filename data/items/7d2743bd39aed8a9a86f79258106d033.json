  "description": "<p>Non-negative matrix factorization is a popular unsupervised machine learning\nalgorithm for extracting meaningful features from data which are inherently\nnon-negative. However, such data sets may often contain privacy-sensitive user\ndata, and therefore, we may need to take necessary steps to ensure the privacy\nof the users while analyzing the data. In this work, we focus on developing a\nNon-negative matrix factorization algorithm in the privacy-preserving\nframework. More specifically, we propose a novel privacy-preserving algorithm\nfor non-negative matrix factorisation capable of operating on private data,\nwhile achieving results comparable to those of the non-private algorithm. We\ndesign the framework such that one has the control to select the degree of\nprivacy grantee based on the utility gap. We show our proposed framework's\nperformance in six real data sets. The experimental results show that our\nproposed method can achieve very close performance with the non-private\nalgorithm under some parameter regime, while ensuring strict privacy.\n</p>",
