In this episode of 365 days with mxmtoon, Maia shares the strange story of how Edgar Allan Poe died. Known for writing gothic horror and mystery novels, how perplexing is it that his death is a mystery as well! But moving onto the musical fact of the day, which we are glad is not a mystery, is the launch of Spotify! Spotify needs no explanation for how it has shaped artist platforms and the music industry; rather, Maia gives details to how it became popularized in the United States and where the name “Spotify” comes from. Join this episode today and make sure you’re following along with the daily updates @365daysmxmtoon on all platforms.
