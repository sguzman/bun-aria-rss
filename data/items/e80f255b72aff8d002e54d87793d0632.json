  "description": "<p>Waitomo is a beautiful natural location on the North Island of New Zealand that is known for its lush bush area and sea caves. The original people of this land, the Maori, have developed a culture rich in legend. A main draw for people from around the world are the Waitomo Glowworm Caves. The caves are not only known for their natural beauty, but for the creature for whom they are named: the glowworm. A popular tourist destination needs lodgings for the visitors and that is where the Waitomo Caves Hotel comes in to fill the need. The hotel has existed for over a hundred years. Situating a hotel in a land rich with lore, limestone and strife has led to rumors of this hotel being haunted. Join us as we share the history, lore and hauntings of the Waitomo Caves and their hotel! The Moment in Oddity is by Bob Sherfield and features George Wyman's cross-country journey and This Day in History is by Kristin Swintek and features the Whiskey Rebellion. Our location was suggested by listener Erin Olivia.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-141-waitomo-caves-hotel.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/08/hgb-ep-141-waitomo-caves-hotel.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Our interview on The Abracast: <a href= \"http://www.hipcast.com/podcast/HzgDK92f\">http://www.hipcast.com/podcast/HzgDK92f</a></p> <p> </p>",
