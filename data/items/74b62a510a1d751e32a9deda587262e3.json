  "description": "In this episode of The Sound of Economics, we focus the issue of decarbonisation and the fight against climate change.\n\nDecarbonisation is at the heart of EU energy and climate policy. And the recent ratification of the Paris Agreement makes decarbonisation targets some of the EU’s most important international commitments.\n\nProgress towards the 2020 targets has been impressive. But the 2020 framework is now being replaced by new targets. The EU wants an 80-95 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, with an intermediate target of 40 percent by 2030.\n\nWe asked Simone Tagliapietra, Research Fellow at Bruegel, what progress the EU has already made towards its climate targets and what will change with the new emission targets.\n\nWe also spoke with Georg Zachmann, Senior Research Fellow at Bruegel, about the recent drop in Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions and the future of EU’s emission trading scheme.\n\nLászlo Varro, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, shared his insights on which energy sources will be most important in the future.\n\nWe discussed with Connie Hedegaard, former European Commissioner for Climate Action, which other sectors need to be prioritised in the fight against climate change.\n\nSPEAKERS\nSimone Tagliapietra, Research Fellow, Bruegel\nGeorg Zachmann, Senior Fellow, Bruegel\nLászlo Varro, Chief Economist, International Energy Agency\nConnie Hedegaard, former European Commissioner for Climate Action\n\nCREDITS\nPresented by Antonija Parat and Bryn Watkins\nProduced by Vanessa Cotterell and Bryn Watkins",
