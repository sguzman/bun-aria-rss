  "description": "Longtime friend, Andrew Horowitz, and I were talking on the phone the other day…   Apart from catching up as close friends, we dove into some interesting talks about today's economy…   I mean, how could we not?   Oil and financials are rolling over, wage growth & home-sales are weakening, auto sales are down, commercial real-estate… yikes.   And, on the other hand, you have only a select group of stocks (FANG) that’s really pushing this market… all while the “investor fear gauge” known as the VIX is sitting below 10.   Basically, we're seeing correlations we've never seen before... intertwined with market highs that have never been reached.   Andrew is calling today's market \"terribly euphoric.\"   And although I love proving him wrong, with that statement, I couldn't agree more.   So on this week’s episode, as two guys sitting at a bar over some beers would do - we're taking this conversation in every direction.   No agenda..   No bullish or bearish anything…   Instead, we're taking a step back. And looking at the market as a whole - analyzing the recent “hard” economic data, earnings, politics, bitcoin, and even fishing.   Conversations like this is what my podcast is all about.   Just click here to listen…   As always, thanks for tuning in and good investing,   Frank Curzio",
