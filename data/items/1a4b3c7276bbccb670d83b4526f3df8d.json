  "description": "If you were playing in the Trump Division of a Fantasy Felony League, who would you pick in the draft to accumulate the most points for subpoenas, indictments, convictions, appeals, counts of perjury, lawyers, lawyer resignations, and/or denigrating “Godfather” movie references in the press?  Fredo (Don, Jr.)?  Jared?  Flynn?  Manafort?  Roger “Crazy Eyes” Stone?  Agent Orange himself?  Our experts including Georgetown’s Rosa Brooks and Colin Kahl, New America’s Heather Hurlburt and our host, David Rothkopf, debate and discuss the breaking news about America’s favorite crime family, the state of the investigation, next steps, and what this all means for the world.
