  "description": "The book Beast Without Purpose: On Post-Domestication and Other Monstrous Rules (Resling, 2021) emerges from the idea of an end to human sovereignty over non human animals. From this A-humanistic approach, the author conceptualizes several ideas for rethinking the crisis of non humans, and for rethinking non human animals themselves. The non human, be it a domesticated animals, a beast or a monster, is being reconsidered through the concepts of radical grace – an act of human grace in its favor, or through a geographical concept of true animal liberation and human restraint. Beast without Purpose is a beast that does not sit in wait for a humanistic judgment, but rather heads out to a new soil, free from human domination.\nOren Ben Yosef is a writer, an animal rights activist and an art teacher from Israel. He has talked and written extensively on human-animal relations and has published three books on this subject (all of them in Hebrew, so far). His books are: Behold the Beast: The Destruction of Animals in the Hands of Mankind (Dror, 2015) Beast Without Purpose: On Post domestication and Other Monstrous Rules (Resling, 2019), and World Eaters: Human Violence against Earthly and Extraterrestrial Beings (Resling, 2021).\n Dr. Yakir Englander is the National Director of Leadership programs at the Israeli-American Council.
