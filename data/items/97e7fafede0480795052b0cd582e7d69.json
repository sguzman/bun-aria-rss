This show talks about the practice and the unbelievable results that can be achieved by farming in this way.

Using very specialized cover crops, they have managed to lower soil temperatures and keep sugar levels under control by practicing the tenets he discusses.</p> <p> </p> <p>May people claim to do great things, but Jean-Baptise is the real deal.
