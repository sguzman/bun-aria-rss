Karida tells us about how she got started dying yarn, walks us through the full dying process at their studio, and tells us about how she tries to weave connections with Baltimore's wider community.\nIn a Slate Plus Extra, Collins tells us about her own knitting projects and the special qualities that make a friend or family member \"knit-worthy.\" If you’re a member, enjoy bonus segments and interview transcripts from Working, plus other great podcast exclusives.
