  "description": "<p>After a golden day for Australia and a silver day for Canada, it's time to bring the squad back together for another epic recap of the Tokyo Olympics by going over everything that happened on day 2 of the games! Just how pumped are we all to have so many medals won by both nations? How great are we at swimming commentary? Is it time to finally praise Cate Campbell for not actually pulling a Campbell? Why are we happy to see the great Olympic nation of Tunisia finally get rewarded? How much did we hate skateboarding? How much did we actually enjoy surfing? Would we like to all attend the Storm Sanders Barty Party? Why do Canadians not know the difference between softball and baseball? And are we starting to miss Ryan Lochte or have we found a solid replacement? Get yourself silver and gold to make the listening even better as you tune in once again!</p>",
