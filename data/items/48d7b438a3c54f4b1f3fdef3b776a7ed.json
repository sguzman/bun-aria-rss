  "description": "<div>This week's Book Club podcast guest is Charles Spencer, whose book <em>The White Ship: Conquest, Anarchy and the Wrecking of Henry I's Dream </em>is new out in paperback. On the pod tells Sam Leith why his story is like \"<em>Game of Thrones </em>meets <em>Titanic</em>\", about the piety and the startling cruelty of medieval kings, the tantalising suggestion that the wreck of the White Ship may have been found off Barfleur -- and how this 12th-century maritime disaster changed the course of English history.</div>\n",
