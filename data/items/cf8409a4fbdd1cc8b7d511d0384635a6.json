    "media:description": "For Nisha Devasia, It all started in the 8th grade with a single video game. Her passion for games led her to study Computer Science and Comparative Media Studies at MIT, where she designed creative learning video games with the Personal Robots Group at the Media Lab. As she moves forward post graduation, her dream is to one day build a game that inspires others as much as she was inspired.",
