  "description": "<p>IT’S TIME TO TRANSFORM. At some point in our lives, we have let go of our old selves and grow into something greater. Think about the king cobra. It starts to feel uncomfortable in its skin. It’s not able to see- its skin makes its vision blurred. So it moves in seclusion. It gets rid of the old skin, and a new shiny skin comes up. Suddenly, its vision is clear. We all need this process. We all need to let go of the past and embrace our future. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about freeing ourselves from suffering with one of my most influential teachers: Preethaji. Preethaji is the co-founder of the O&O Academy near Chennai, India. O&O’s campus and teachings are designed to free humans from all forms of suffering. Combining ancient wisdoms and teachings with neuroscience and neurobiology, Preethaji helps students develop a personal practice of mindfulness, meditation, and breathwork with the goal of personal transformation. I studied with Preethaji in India, and it changed my life. She taught me that there are only two states in life: a suffering state and a beautiful state. So get ready to learn how to stop suffering on Episode 830.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy did this calling come to you when it did? (6:30)<br />\nHow do we stop suffering? (18:00)<br />\nWhat happens when we fixate on past experiences? (23:00)<br />\nWhy do so many people hold onto heartbreak (39:30)<br />\nWhat happens when our outer world is thriving but the inner world is suffering?
