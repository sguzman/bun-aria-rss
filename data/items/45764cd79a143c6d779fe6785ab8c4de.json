  "description": "<p>A listener writes “Hey Wes I just wanted to start out by saying that I’m a huge fan of the show.I wanted to share a possible encounter my dad and I had back in ’99. We live in Southern California and decided to go camping in a remote area of the San Bernardino mountains. I was around 15 or 16 at the time. I don’t know where or how my dad found this place but it was out in the middle of nowhere, the place is called Paiute Canyon and it’s near Lytle Creek, anyway we got to the camp site and set up and were already finished with dinner and we’re just enjoying the sights from the campfire and we heard a very loud howl coming from our left.</p> <p>The howl was a good deal away from us and was coming from the entrance to the canyon (there’s only one way in and one way out of this canyon which kind of resembles a horseshoe) and was very similar to the Ohio howls. At the time both my dad and I had never heard anything like that in the woods before. Whatever it was vocalized a few times and seemed to be getting closer. We kept wondering what the hell it was and decided to load up the guns. After the guns were all loaded up we were back at the campfire when we heard another vocalization (still from our left side) and then we heard a response vocalization coming from our rear right side. The response was more of a whoop. This kinda got us on our toes and pretty alert as to what was going on around us.\"</p> <p>I will also be welcoming Bob Gimlin and Russell Acord to the show to talk about some new events coming up and to discuss the International Bigfoot Conference. Get your tickets now at <a href= \"http://www.internationalbigfootconference.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.internationalbigfootconference.com</a>.</p> <p>My final guest will be sharing an encounter with a very strange creature about 10 years ago. After speaking with the witness, I am fascinated with her encounter. She said that the creature's body reminded her of the creature with the gas mask on the Pink Floyd The Wall, except the head was different. But the way the creature was sitting and how it’s body appeared was very much like the picture posted HERE on our site (just remove the head).</p>",
