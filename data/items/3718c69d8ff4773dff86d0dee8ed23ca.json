  "description": "<p>This episode I talk about how the only way to get anywhere is to do stuff you don't feel comfortable doing. How do we do that?? Also, why does every self help guru talk about \"doing what you love\"? That phrase seems so empty, but I think I can make sense of it. I answer emails - one person wonders if they should quit their horrible job. Another emailer asks if I've ever felt isolated from friends. Also, should a 19 year-old girl with so much going on start a podcast? What if her friends laugh at her? All this and more. Let's get super deep on it all, bros! </p>\n",
