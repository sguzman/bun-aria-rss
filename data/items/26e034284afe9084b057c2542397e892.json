Just open up your mind and if you really do want it bad enough, you can achieve it through hard work.”</p><p>Conor Dwyer</p><br><p><br></p><p>I know what you’re thinking. It's rather convenient for any Olympic athlete&nbsp;to say that hard work trumps talent.</p><p>For perspective, take a glance at the palmarès of this week's guest:</p><br><p>* 2012 London Olympics: Gold in the 4×200 meter freestyle relay</p><p>* 2016 Rio Olympics:&nbsp;Gold in the 4×200 meter freestyle relay</p><p>* 2016 Rio Olympics: Bronze in the 200 meter freestyle</p><br><p>In total, Conor Dwyer&nbsp;has won seventeen medals in major international swimming competitions: nine gold, six silver, and two bronze. I could geek out on his statistics forever but you get the picture. The dude is super fast in the pool; one of the fastest swimmers of all time.</p><p>An extraordinary athlete, Conor is obviously immensely talented. So this idea that hard work beats talent can't possibly apply to him, right?</p><p>Not so fast. Conor was the furthest thing from a natural talent right out of the gate. His performances out of high school were so mediocre in fact, he couldn't even get the attention of college coaches let alone a swimming scholarship. I simply cannot overstate how rare it is in competitive swimming that an athlete of his current caliber had yet to distinguish himself by 18.&nbsp;It just doesn't happen.</p><p>But Conor refused to give up. Through persistence and a robust work ethic relentlessly applied, a series of circumstances slowly aligned. A believing coach appeared to mentor him, followed by training partners to push him to new levels of possibility and further fuel his self-belief in potential. Over time, all the important ingredients alchemized to bake the cake that is the superstar athlete we know today as&nbsp;Conor Dwyer.</p><br><p>This week Conor shares his extraordinary story from bench warmer to Olympic champion. A story that lays bare a simple core truth I have experienced myself:</p><p>when the heart is pure and fueled by self-belief, extreme faith, unwavering patience and an unabating work ethic, the universe conspires to support the dream.</p><p>One of the good guys, Conor lives it with every breath. A recipe for success that has fueled his accomplishments and will support anyone — irrespective of talent level — in the pursuit of an audacious dream.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the&nbsp;exchange.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p>Listen & Subscribe on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a></p><p>Join us for our next retreat in Italy, May 20-27&nbsp;— for info visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.plantpowerworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">plantpowerworld.com</a></p><p>Thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p><p>Headspace.com: Train your mind for a healthier, less-stressed life.&nbsp;Download the <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/ROLL\" target=\"_blank\">FREE&nbsp;app</a> and begin their Take10 program, for 10 days of guided meditation at <a href=\"http://www.headspace.com/ROLL\" target=\"_blank\">headspace.com/ROLL</a></p><p>MeUndies:&nbsp;The world’s most comfortable underwear!
