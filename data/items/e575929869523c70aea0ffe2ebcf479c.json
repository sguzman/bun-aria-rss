  "itunes:summary": "Melbourne Georgian Choir (MGC), led by celebrated Georgian-Australian ethnomusicologists Dr Nino Tsitsishvili and Dr Joseph Jordania. The choir features 20 vocalists singing together in the rich Georgian polyphonic tradition which dates back to at least the 4th century CE. In challenging works from its repertoire, the choir demonstrated the outré scales and clashing dissonances characteristic of Georgian polyphony.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/polyphonic-social-2017\n\nPolyphonic Social 2017\n13 May, 2017\nAbbotsford Convent\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Abbotsford Convent and the City of Yarra\n\nAudio: Recorded and Mixed by Lauren Squire, Edited by Mara Schwerdtfeger\nImage: Keelan O'Hehir\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
