  "description": "In the year since the pandemic began, the coronavirus has severely impacted inmates and staff in U.S. jails and prisons.  According to <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons\">The Marshall Project</a>, in the last year, over 380,000 prisoners tested positive for the coronavirus. Of those, 2,400 died. The close quarters make social distancing nearly impossible, leaving the incarcerated population vulnerable. <br/><br/>Josiah Bates, staff writer at TIME, reflects on how the pandemic has played out behind bars — in both jails and prisons. We also hear from Ronnie Hoagland Jr., who contracted COVID-19 while incarcerated in a Texas county jail. ",
