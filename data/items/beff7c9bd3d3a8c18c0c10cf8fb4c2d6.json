  "description": "Max Boot's great new book \"The Road Not Taken\" about American intelligence officer Edward Lansdale not only offers great insights into an intriguing character and a pivotal moment in American and modern world history, it is searingly relevant to today.  Would an expert like Lansdale even be heard today by a disconnected president who is trying to discredit the intelligence community?  Would the kind of carefully built expertise he accumulated be valued in a government that doesn't even care to have ambassadors in key outposts worldwide?  Max Boot joins Rosa Brooks of Georgetown and Deep State Radio host David Rothkopf for a discussion of the book and why its lessons are so important today.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
