  "title": "PMS 2.0 138 - Ryan Fitzmagic Is BACK.. Brian Westbrook, Eddie George, & Pep Hamilton Stop By To Talk The Football",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat covers the entire weekend slate in the NFL including all the marquee matchups. He discusses whether or not the Patriots offense will eventually turn it around after Tom Brady looked as visibly frustrated as he ever as Sunday night in Houston, whether or not the Packers defense will prevent them from making a run in the playoffs, the potential Super Bowl preview in this past weekend’s 49ers/Ravens game in Baltimore and why Baltimore continually shows how tough of an out they will be. Pat also dives into why the NFC East stinks, and the guys chat about the Cowboys still potentially getting a home playoff game after the Eagles lost to the Dolphins in Miami after a magical performance from Fitzmagic himself.. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and member of the Eagles Hall of Fame, former running back, Brian Westbrook, joins the show. They discuss what the problem with the Eagles is and whether or not they can turn it around in time, why certain players have difficulty scoring touchdowns on the goal line, he chats about the work he’s doing with his foundation, and talks about which teams he sees making a run in the NFC and AFC (32:00-43:47). Next, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Offensive Rookie of the Year and Heisman Trophy winner, Eddie George, joins the program. Eddie and Pat discuss their bet on the Colts/Titans game this past weekend, and why Eddie thinks the Titans may have the formula to be successful in the playoffs. They also chat about Ohio State mollywhopping Michigan on Saturday, and give their takes on the Dr. Pepper tuition giveaway halftime show in a hilarious interview (43:49-57:43). Lastly, one of Pat’s offensive coordinators while he was with the Colts, a man who has coached nearly everywhere in college and the NFL, and now current Head Coach and General Manager of the DC Defenders of the XFL, Pep Hamilton, joins the show. Pep and Pat chat about their time together while at the Colts, why Pep thinks the XFL is going to be successful with some of the rule changes that make it different than the NFL, the allure of being a Head Coach and General Manager, what it’s like coaching in the Ohio State/Michigan rivalry, and Pat helping his son diversify The Brand (1:00:56-1:11:47). Today’s show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
