  "description": "<p>Jim Wilson was one of God's main characters in our part of the world -- and there's nothing stopping you from being equally faithful in your own character arc. This episode celebrates the life of Nate's grandfather, James Irwin Wilson, an oak tree of a man when he was on earth, and someone more strong and glorious now in Heaven. Follow the story beginning with Jim's childhood as a Nebraska farm kid \"tricking\" his teachers and working in stockyards, to his Navy years wooing a missionary lady eight years older than him who was absolutely not interested, to the intermission of the Korean War, to the move to Idaho and his life's work of giving books away (leading in part to you all sitting here listening). RIP, Grandpa Jim!</p>",
