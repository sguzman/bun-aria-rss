  "description": "  Earnings season is in full swing... and some of the largest companies report this week. I highlight a few winners and losers—like Tesla, Facebook, UPS, and Intel—and the most important characteristics to pay attention to as companies report. [0:40] Gold—which has been out of favor for some time—is quietly moving higher… and conditions are perfect for certain stocks to explode from current levels. [3:05] As cryptocurrencies continue towards new highs… the biggest story in the space this week has been the partnership between Mastercard and crypto payments network Bakkt—which will bring bitcoin access to more than two million people. [5:25] Next, I share some exciting news in the security token industry... and how investors can take advantage of this multitrillion-dollar opportunity. [12:20] Plus, I recap an incredible offer on my Crypto Intelligence advisory—including how to lock in a free crypto pick. [20:50] Crypto exchange Exodus recently began trading on tZERO. I give my take on the recent price action in Exodus and explain why both companies have bright futures... Plus, I share a simple rule to keep emotions—and your portfolio—in check. [26:00] Finally, with several  recommendations trading on different exchanges, a subscriber wants to know why I typically only discuss a few. This is a great question and it’s nothing personal... I break down some of the features of different exchanges… and my goal to get as many people into the space as possible.  [31:45] Enjoyed this episode?
