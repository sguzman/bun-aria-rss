  "description": "Sex Matters: How Male-Centric Medicine Endangers Women's Health and What We Can Do About It (Hachette, 2020) tackles one of the most urgent, yet unspoken issues facing women's health care today: all models of medical research and practice are based on male-centric models that ignore the unique biological and emotional differences between men and women -- an omission that can endanger women's lives. \nThe facts surrounding how male-centric medicine impacts women's health every day are chilling: in the ER, women are more likely to receive a psychiatric diagnosis with regard to opioid use, while men are more likely to be referred for detoxification; the more vocal women become about their pain, the more likely their providers are to prescribe either inadequate or inappropriate pain relief medication; women often present with nontraditional symptoms of stroke, which causes delays in recognition by both them and their health professionals; and a government accountability study found that 80% of drugs that are withdrawn from the market are due to side effects that happen to women (a result of testing drugs mostly on men). \nLeading expert on sex and gender medicine Dr. Alyson McGregor focuses on the key areas where these differences are most potentially harmful, addressing: \n\nCardiac and stroke diagnosis and treatment in women\n\nPrescription and dosing of pharmaceuticals;\n\nSubjective evaluation of women's symptoms;\n\nPain and pain management;\n\nHormones and female biochemistry (including prescribed hormones);\n\nHow economic status, race, and gender identity are additional critical factors. \n\nNot only does Dr. McGregor explore these disparities in depth, she shares clear, practical suggestions for what women can do to protect themselves. A work of riveting exposé with revelatory insights and actionable guidance for navigating the medical establishment, Sex Matters is an empowering roadmap for reinventing modern medicine -- and for self-care. \nAlyson J. McGregor, MD, MA, FACEP, is an Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, and the Co-Founder and Director for the Division of Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine (SGEM) at Brown University's Department of Emergency Medicine. A co-founder of the national organization Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative, Dr. McGregor has written or co-written over seventy peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals and was also the lead editor for the medical textbook, Sex and Gender in Acute Care Medicine (Cambridge University Press, 2016). \nDr. Christina Gessler’s background is in women’s history, anthropology and literature. She is a historian, and photographer. In seeking the extraordinary in the ordinary, Gessler writes the histories of largely unknown women, and takes many, many photos in nature. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
