  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, It’s concerning how many people claim to support liberty and individualism while rejecting it entirely. The idea of a big centralized government is being embraced by people who pretend they’re not embracing it. Globalism has nothing to do with the denunciation of capitalism – it is a global economic system and the United States would be a destitute country without it. Progressivism has clearly conquered the Democrat party, but now it’s starting to conquer the Republican party too. Also, President Trump is not a perfect man but he is a remarkable president. Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus and Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty bill; they weren’t perfect but they are still two of our greatest presidents. The history books will be very kind to President Trump. Finally, Mark speaks with Greg Gutfeld about his book, The Gutfeld Monologues: Classic Rants from The Five.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
