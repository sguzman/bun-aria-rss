  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the NFL continues to balkanize their sport and many Americans won't be participating as they resume their season. Marxists in the media are obsessed with their notion that all human distinction comes from systemic racism, not individuality. Similarly, Joe Biden has no coronavirus plan to share with Americans, just as he had no plans when he managed previous pandemics as Vice President. Then, ABC News' John Karl asked President Trump a question alleging that he \"lied\" to the American people. Yet it was the Democrats who downplayed, misled and lied to America about Obamacare, Islamist terrorism, the Iran deal, Russian collusion, and the 'mostly peaceful' rioters that have killed dozens in recent months. Afterward, several DOJ officials claim they accidentally wiped 15 phones during the Inspector General's investigation into their potential wrongdoing. They claimed that they entered the wrong passwords into the phones while in airplane mode thus disabling them. Finally, Sarah Huckabee Sanders calls in to discuss her new book, Speaking for Myself: Faith, Freedom, and the Fight of Our Lives Inside the Trump White House.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
