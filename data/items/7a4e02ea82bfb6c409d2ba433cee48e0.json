    "media:description": "Ariana Grande - positions (Official Live Performance) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov” and “safety net” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Go Team Ari. In a typically inventive move, our hero chose to loop her vocals when it came time to perform the album’s title track. Watch her augment the band’s moves with a little layering of her voice. As she references both the kitchen and the bedroom in her lyrics, the sound stacks up, taking on its own internal rhythm. Beautiful.\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of “positions\" by Ariana Grande.
