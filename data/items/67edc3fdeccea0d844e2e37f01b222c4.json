  "description": "Dr. Joshua Sharfstein has learned a lot as from his years of experience as a public health leader. He has dealt with everything from a rabid raccoon, to protestors, to potentially losing refrigeration on the city of Baltimore’s stock of vaccines. And now he has turned the insight gained from all these experiences into a guidebook for public health officials. The Public Health Crisis Survival Guide: Leadership and Management in Trying Times (Oxford University Press, 2018) details not just how to survive, but to lead and thrive in the most trying of circumstances. He digs into the history of some public health crises and explains what worked and what didn’t. Taboo topics, such as when and how to apologize for mistakes, are discussed in an honest and thoughtful way. This book is the definitive new manual for recognizing, managing, and communicating in a public health crisis.\n\n\n\nJeremy Corr is the co-host of the hit Fixing Healthcare podcast along with industry thought leader Dr. Robert Pearl. A University of Iowa history alumnus, Jeremy is curious and passionate about all things healthcare, which means he’s always up for a good discussion!
