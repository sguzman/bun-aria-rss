  "title": "Special Episode: 2nd Annual Cryptids Unscripted Poetry Slam and Charity Auction!",
  "description": "<p>In lieu of a cursed livestream we're bringing you our second annual poetry slam as a special bonus episode! This year we're diving into the realm of Squonk self love and Sasquatch affirmations. Mothwoman walks onto the scene (at the bridge) as well as a new lemon-themed cryptid. There's talk of America's Hircine Shifter and Emothy, King of the Pukwudgies makes a special and dangerous woodland appearance. As expected there is also some thirst for Mothman yet again. Snaps for everyone who submitted. Snaps for everyone who donated auction items and bid on all the incredible, creepy offerings. We love you all! Thank you so much for your patience and understanding while we had health and tech issues. You heard it all straight from the mongoose's mouth... and that's why we VANISH!</p>\n",
