  "description": "<p><a href=\"http://romanmars.com/\">Roman Mars</a> is a public-radio producer. But the definition of what public radio is has become malleable, especially with his show, <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.org/\">99% Invisible</a>, which has enormously more listeners for its podcast version than the broadcast flavor. The show is about design and architecture, and more particularly about the inner workings of things we take for granted. Roman raised <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/99-invisible-season-3\">a significant sum on Kickstarter</a> in July 2012 — $170,000 for season 3 of his show. He launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/99-invisible-season-4-weekly\">a second Kickstarter for season 4 today</a> (October 22) to expand to weekly episodes and add staff.</p>",
