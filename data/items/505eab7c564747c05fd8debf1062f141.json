For this post though I’m aggregating GitHub profiles together over the population of an entire country or city, meaning that the impact of the data sparsity and noise issues I was talking about shouldn’t be nearly as significant.</p>\n\n<p>The results ended up being pretty interesting. While top developers live all over the world, an extraordinary amount of\nthem seem to live in the San Francisco Bay area. Likewise, it seems that developing open source software is a luxury for the\nrich, India has an unusual lack of famous developers, and Eastern Europe might offer the best value on hiring remotely.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/github-developer-locations/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
