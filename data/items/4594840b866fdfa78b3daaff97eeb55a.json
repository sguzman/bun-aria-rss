  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Cathy McIlwaine | As part of ongoing debates within feminist geography and beyond, the discussion explores the intersections among multiple types of direct and indirect gendered violence across borders and territories. The lecture draws empirically on research conducted over the last 5 years on violence against Brazilian migrant women in London and among women living in the favelas of Maré in Rio de Janeiro. The discussion reflects the feminist co-production of research with a range of organisations and on the role of arts-based methods and engagements in enhancing understandings of gendered violence and through which diverse forms of resistance emerge.",
