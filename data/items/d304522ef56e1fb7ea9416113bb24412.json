  "title": "PMS 2.0 172 - Kyle Rudolph Confirms He Pushed Off Against The Saints.. & Aaron Jones Joins Us For A Feel Good Friday",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about The Boston Herald report that Tom Brady and Bill Belichick had a phone conversation that did not go well, and what that means for Brady's upcoming decision. They also try to figure out whether Brady will end up back in New England, or move onto Tennessee, San Francisco, LA, Miami, or somewhere else. Later, 2x Pro Bowler, one of the best Tight Ends in the NFL, friend of the show and current Minnesota Viking, Kyle Rudolph. He explains to Pat whether or not he pushed off against the Saints in New Orleans in the playoffs this year, how things are going to be different in Minnesota after losing their OC, his relationship with Kirk Cousins, and his thoughts on the 450 page document that the NFLPA is sending players to sift through ahead of their vote on March 12 (12:49-27:01). Also joining the show is the starting Running Back for the Green Bay Packers, last year's league leader in rushing touchdowns, Aaron Jones. Pat and Aaron chat about his relationship with Aaron Rodgers and what their relationship is like, what his offseason has consisted of thus far, why he thinks he took such a big jump on the field this year, and what the Packers need to do in order to reach the Super Bowl (28:28-37:35). Also included in today's show is some News We Missed With Nick, and Pat and the guys react to Nik Wallenda's \"death defying\" volcano walk from the other night. Today's show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
