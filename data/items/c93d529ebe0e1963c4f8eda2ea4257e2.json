  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about last night's Monday Night Football game between the Chiefs and the Giants, if this is who the Chiefs are now, what the hell is going on with the Giants, the Manning Cast, and everything revolving around the NFL trade deadline, which was official as of 4:00 PM today. Joining the program for his eighth appearance, is the reigning MVP, Quarterback of the 7-1 Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers. Pat, Aaron, and AJ chat about Thursday Night's huge win shorthanded on the road against the undefeated Cardinals, what his advice would be to Patrick Mahomes right now with all he's dealing with, if he expects the Packers to do anything at the trade deadline and what the communication has been like, when he anticipates some of the Packers key components returning, the next book in the Aaron Rodgers Bookclub, and much more (49:17-1:31:43). Next, Kicker for the Buffalo Bills, Tyler \"Big Ball\" Bass joins the show to chat about his success in Buffalo, his mentality when it comes to kicking big balls, how he's dealt with the weather in Buffalo, what the culture is like with the Bills and what Josh Allen is like as a teammate and much more (1:31:47-1:49:56).
