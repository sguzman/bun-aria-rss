Like a big Venn diagram of overlapping circles — ultra-endurance multi-sport athlete, dad, husband, Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher.</p><p>Today's guest is unique in that he is the only guy I have ever had on the show who, like me, has competed in both the <a href=\"http://ultramanlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a> and EPIC5 (not that there are very many of us – I think only a few).</p><p>Today’s guest is also unique for his strong sense of faith, directed purpose and commitment to giving back in service to others the blessings bestowed upon him.</p><p>Today’s guest is <a href=\"http://www.christianisakson.com\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Isakson</a>.</p><p>Christian and I first connected online several years ago on the eve of his 2011 attempt on EPIC5 (one year after I completed that challenge). Christian absolutely rocked it, completing the distance within the five day period I strived for, yet fell short. In the wake of that effort, I vividly recall several conversations in which I encouraged him to ply his trade at Ultraman. Ironically, Christian was unsure — at the time not yet wholly confident in his abilities despite the potential I clearly saw in him. Yet he obliged. To be clear, not because of me – I just gave him a nudge. And at this past year's World Championship in Hawaii, he proved his mettle and then some. His race was far from perfect, but Christian more than distinguished himself as a future contender for the top podium spot, putting his imprimatur on the race with a stunning Day 2 bike effort that had him leading the field for the majority of the brutal 170-mile day.</p><p>Since our first Facebook exchange, Christian and I have been e-mail pen pals and phone buddies — corresponding consistently over the years about everything from balancing parenting & marriage to nutrition, training strategies, racing, the role of faith and most importantly service — how best to give this whole ultra-endurance experience greater meaning for others beyond mere race results.</p><p>And yet Christian and I had never actually met in person. But no matter — from our first conversation we have been close; meeting in person existing as nothing more than a formality. All that changed a few weeks ago when Christian came down to Los Angeles for a short overnight visit with me and my family.&nbsp;The hug he gave me when I picked him up at the airport just made our brotherhood official.</p><p>Today we sit down and sift through it all – the pain, passion, love and faith that fuels and drives him. The unique push-pull allure of ultra-distance racing. And how he balances this brutally demanding lifestyle to maintain a healthy and happy marriage, great relationship with his kids, and a rewarding career as a paramedic / firefighter.</p><p>But what makes Christian really tick is his faith. His fidelity to his church. And how service plays into his success equation – from his endeavors with various church organizations to his involvement with <a href=\"http://chrislieto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Lieto's</a>&nbsp;non-profit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.morethansport.org/\" target=\"_blank\">More Than Sport</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://ameenaproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ameena Project</a> – an NGO which took him to Kenya recently to provide much needed medical care to underprivileged in urgent need.</p><p>I can attest to the fact that Christian returned from Kenya a changed man.
