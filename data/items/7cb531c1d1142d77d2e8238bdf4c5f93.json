I found a doctor who combines the systems-based approach of Functional Medicine along with the most cutting-edge practices of Regenerative Medicine for maximum effect. Dr. Matthew Cook is my guest on today’s podcast and the one who was able to finally fix my back pain.

His practice, BioReset™ Medical, provides treatments for conditions ranging from pain and complex illness to anti-aging and wellness. His approach is to use the most non-invasive, natural, and integrative ways possible.&nbsp; Regarding the current pandemic, Dr. Cook has spent the past several months distilling the latest research, talking with experts around the world, and integrating his vast clinical experience to provide up-to-date information to the public and medical practitioners.
