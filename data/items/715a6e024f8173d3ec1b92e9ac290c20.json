  "description": "<p>The Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium during World War I would be one of the bloodiest of the war, killing half a million men. The weather and mud at the field would contribute to dealing that heavy blow. Battlefields of all kinds seem to be epicenters for the paranormal. The blood becomes a part of the earth and seems to cry out from the afterlife. This area of ground would come to be known as Flanders Fields and there are spirits here. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jennifer White and features Myrtle Corbin and This Month in History features the death of Howard Hughes. Our location was suggested by listener Brian Morse.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/04/hgb-ep-296-battle-of-passchendaele.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/04/hgb-ep-296-battle-of-passchendaele.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Eulogies by Mort music is Long Time Gone by 5 Alarm Music on Drones & Beyond album.</p> <p>Underworld by 5 Alarm Music on ECK - Orchestral Textures Album<br /> Military Drums 1A and Battle Plans A by 5 Alarm Music on History, Heroism, Conflict Album</p>",
