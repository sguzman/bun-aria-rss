  "description": "<p>In this episode, Indianapolis Wedding Photographer Raymond Hatfield talks about failing as a photographer. Since the explosion of digital photography, the amount of photographers has skyrocketed. It can be difficult to gain traction and notoriety. What can be more frustrating is when there are a half-dozen other photographers who give twice as much for half the cost (Double Frustrating if their work is sub-par!). But there is good news.  You're going to fail.  How is that good news? Well if you go into anything with blinders on you might miss out on the bigger picture. Photography isn't photography. It's not like you can pick up a camera and love every aspect and subject there is to shoot. Someone's job is to photograph giant hairy spiders all day. Would you love that? Regardless of the answer, I'm sure that person didn't go to school for \"Giant Hairy Spider Photography\". They had to have failed at a million other things before they got that job. Photography is a journey. You're going to get a few bumps and scrapes along the way but if it was easy, I promise you it wouldn't be as rewarding.   Check out more at www.BeginnerPhotographyPodcast.com Have A Question?
