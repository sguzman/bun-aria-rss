  "description": "<p>Friday 5/25- Today on the show before the hip hop talk The Breakfast Club had to handle something that has been undetermined for awhile and that is to find out where Charlamagne lies on the gay spectrum. The conversation sparked when Andy Cohen visited us the other day and informed how to see if someone is on the gay spectrum, so we had our gay listeners call up to try to seduce Charlamagne. Afterwards we had \"Good Music\" Artist Pusha T stop by to speak on his new album \"Daytona\", and let us know hes ready for any Hip Hop beef coming his way. Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a 30 year old man who was overstaying his welcome at his parents house and comedian Lil Rel stopped by where he discussed his new projects, and more. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
