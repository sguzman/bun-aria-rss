  "description": "In Media Culture in Nomadic Communities (Amsterdam University Press, 2021), author Allison Hahn examines the ways that new communications technologies have changed how nomadic and mobile communities engage in political advocacy, activism, and struggles for self-representation. Through a series of case studies focused on herding groups in different parts of the world, from Mongolia to Kenya to Scandinavia, Hahn examines how modern communications technologies and infrastructures are shaping nomadic communities and practices. Hahn argues that, contrary to popular belief, contemporary communications tools not only play an important role in how herding groups organize internally and for political ends, but also allow herding lifestyles to flourish and remain relevant into the 21st century.\nMaggie Freeman is a PhD student in the Department of Architecture at MIT. Her work focuses on histories of nomad-state relationships and uses of architecture in nomadic contexts.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
