  "description": "In this message, Joel reminds us that just as seasons of growth are necessary in our lives, so are seasons of pruning. Unless we go through the process of pruning, we will never reach the fullness of who God created us to be. During these times, we can remain at peace because Jesus told us that pruning is part of the process. God is still in control. It is often in the time of being cut back that we learn what it truly means to walk in faith and abide in God. How we react when God is refining us determines the quality of the fruit that will be produced in our lives. Keep being faithful and trusting God where you are—He is working behind the scenes.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
