  "description": "<p>In this 133rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss the surge of Covid cases during the northern Summer. We talk about a new paper which finds that the mRNA vaccines against Covid do more harm than good, and the fact that both Canada, and the state of Washington, are implementing new vaccine mandates now, despite ever growing evidence that the Covid vaccines are not doing what we were told they would do. We ask whether Elmo knows what he’s talking about when he advocates for young muppets everywhere to get vaccinated. And Heather talks to an anti-vaxxer who turns out not to be an anti-vaxxer at all; she is a trad-vaxxer.  Then we discuss Jordan Peterson’s twitter suspension, and what “deadnaming” means, and whether it’s a real thing. Finally: what is the value of work?</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>LMNT: Electrolyte drink mix with all the good salts, and none of the bad stuff.
