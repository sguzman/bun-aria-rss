    "media:description": "I tried to tell the whole story about archery in 6 minute, which was totally impossible!\nI suddenly got a lot of extra time when Corona closed everything.\nSo I've spent the time make the video I long wanted to make. \nThe very very long video, which tells, among other things, tells the rather funny story behind the viral video \"A new level of Archery\" \nShadiversity has helped me with this very long video asking a lot of critical questions. \n\"A new level of Archery\"   is by far the most discussed archery video ever, no wonder ! when so much was told in such a short time, and much was very controversial without the time for proper explanation.\n\nThis long video also allows me to thoroughly explain what I think about archery today about:\nWhy Historical fast shooting\nPowerful bow\nThe bias we all have from modern archery\nWhy trick shooting was once a necessary part of archery\nSafety\netc. ...\n\nMany have helped with this video.:\nShad M. Brooks\nMihai Cozmei\nClaus raasted\nNicoline Mondrup\nAnders Hovgaard Møller\nJørgen Philipp\nIda Kirstine Stubbe\nRonny Thillemann Hansen\nGudmund Thai Moltsen\n\n\nSincerely\nLars Andersen",
