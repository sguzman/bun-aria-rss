  "description": "<div>\n<strong>This is part 2 of our 2 part coverage of West of Memphis. </strong><br>\n<br>\nTHE DOCUMENTARY WE ALWAYS SAID WE'D NEVER DO!</div>\n<div>\n<br>\nThe film focuses on the 18-plus year plight of the “West Memphis Three”: Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley who, in 1993, were convicted of the murders of three young boys in West Memphis, Arkansas.  Jason and Jessie each got life, Damien was sentenced to death. The film brilliantly chronicles the movement that fought for their release, shows the evidence that can prove their innocence, and points to a possible new suspect. AND. WE. ARE.
