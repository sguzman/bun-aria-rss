So in the first hour we will light up the United Natural Churchill while we look into what you can do with your old cigar boxes. There are some interesting things out, and we might even have a little show and tell for our YouTube audience.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will light up the Avo Syncro, which was the cigar we were originally scheduled to smoke on the show. As we do it, we will take a look at some of the early contenders for Cigar of the Year and ask the question if they will be worthy to be a final contender.</p>\n<p>We also have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at http://www.2GuysCigars.com/.</p>\n",
