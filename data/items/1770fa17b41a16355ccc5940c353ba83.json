  "description": "I’ve spent a ton of time on the road lately for… gymnastics. My daughter’s competitions have given me a front-row seat on some impressive athletes… and some made-for-TV drama. [0:30]  I share a few observations from my travels—including a bullish sign for Disney (DIS)... and how interest rate hike fears appear to be impacting the Florida housing market. [3:40] A big unknown right now is whether we’ll see any economic fallout from the Russia sanctions. I explain the war’s effects on two critical market factors: oil and inflation. [8:00] Another unknown is how aggressive the Fed will be in 2022… Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Wall Street thinks the Fed will only hike interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) this month—instead of the 0.50% increase it was previously expecting. I disagree… and explain why you should be ready for a 50-point rate hike. [12:05] I highlight some names that are doing great and a few that are struggling… my strategy for buying stocks in this volatile market… one “no-brainer” sector right now… and another I expect to keep surging due to Russian aggression. [20:10] Pivoting to digital assets… crypto is rallying hard this week. I break down why this asset class continues to attract money from around the globe. [28:10] The current market shows why hedging your portfolio is more important than ever. I share some of my preferred hedging strategies… and things to look for if you’re putting money into the market right now. [32:40] Enjoyed this episode?
