  "description": "<p>As a privacy-preserving paradigm for training Machine Learning (ML) models,\nFederated Learning (FL) has received tremendous attention from both industry\nand academia. In a typical FL scenario, clients exhibit significant\nheterogeneity in terms of data distribution and hardware configurations. Thus,\nrandomly sampling clients in each training round may not fully exploit the\nlocal updates from heterogeneous clients, resulting in lower model accuracy,\nslower convergence rate, degraded fairness, etc. To tackle the FL client\nheterogeneity problem, various client selection algorithms have been developed,\nshowing promising performance improvement. In this paper, we systematically\npresent recent advances in the emerging field of FL client selection and its\nchallenges and research opportunities. We hope to facilitate practitioners in\nchoosing the most suitable client selection mechanisms for their applications,\nas well as inspire researchers and newcomers to better understand this exciting\nresearch topic.\n</p>",
