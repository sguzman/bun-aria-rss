  "description": "<p>Jessimae Peluso is the host of at least 147 podcasts and a killer standup comic. She's a terrible influence and made Jeremy smoke some serious loud during the show so the conversation is absolutely insane but probably the funniest thing you'll hear all week. We're talking mansplaining, hairy ankles, and most importantly Jeremy's butt related g-spot. It's so good we had to break it up into two episodes... Enjoy!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We want to hear from you!
