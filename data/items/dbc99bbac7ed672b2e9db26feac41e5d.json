Today’s conversation may not be suitable to listen to with children in the room, but it is an episode you will want to hear. Sharon and Dr. Peterson discuss the myths and media around violence and mass shootings, and how they compare to the research. They also touch on reframing the idea of the “monster with a gun” and what actions and resources can help diminish gun violence across the country.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
