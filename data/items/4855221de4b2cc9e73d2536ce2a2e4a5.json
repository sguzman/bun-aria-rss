  "description": "<p>Sarah Polley is a storyteller – and a remarkable one. Whether as a precocious child actor in <em>Road to Avonlea</em> and <em>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, </em>as a documentarian unpacking her family history in <em>Stories We Tell </em>or as screenwriter and director of the Academy Award-nominated <em>Away From Her, </em>Polley is adept at portraying complex and honest depictions of humanity.<em> </em>And now, she is the author of a revealing and insightful collection of essays, <em>Run Towards the Danger: Confrontations with a Body of Memory</em>. The book pulls together reflections from challenging chapters in her life and career that explore how a change in approach can provide a path forward. Polley joins guest host Talia Schlanger for a candid and revelatory conversation that goes deep into Polley’s decision to pivot from a successful actor to writing and directing, to the difficulties she experienced working in Hollywood and the decision to step forward with her own #MeToo story.  Their discussion turns personal when Polley turns the tables on host Talia Schlanger and invites a discussion about Schlanger’s own experiences of #MeToo. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
