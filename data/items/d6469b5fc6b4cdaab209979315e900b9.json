  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. In the fifth century BC Thucydides wrote The History of the Peloponnesian War, an account of a conflict in which he had himself taken part. This work is now seen as one of the first great masterpieces of history writing, a book which influenced writers for centuries afterwards. Thucydides was arguably the first historian to make a conscious attempt to be objective, bringing a rational and impartial approach to his scholarship. Today his work is still widely studied at military colleges and in the field of international relations for the insight it brings to bear on complex political situations.\n\nWith:\n\nPaul Cartledge\nEmeritus Professor of Greek Culture and AG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, Cambridge\n\nKatherine Harloe\nAssociate Professor in Classics and Intellectual History at the University of Reading\n\nNeville Morley\nProfessor of Ancient History at the University of Bristol\n\nProducer: Thomas Morris.",
