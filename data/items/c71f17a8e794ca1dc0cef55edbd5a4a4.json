  "description": "<p>Why do we eat Ayurvedically? Why do we take care of our bodies? What is the POINT of all this self-care and wellness rituals? To become your highest self. In this straight-to-the-heart episode, I share my philosophy on how health is not the end-goal but rather a means to the end. That end point is your Dharma-- living out your life purpose. Health matters SO you don't have to worry about your health anymore. Instead, you can use that energy to live out your purpose.</p> <p>Eating right for your Dosha is just scratching the surface of Ayurveda- it's living according to your Dosha to be in alignment with your Dharma that matters.
