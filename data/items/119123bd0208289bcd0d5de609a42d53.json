  "description": "<p>Just like how we can idolize ‘finding the right one’ when looking for a partner or spouse, the same can be true of passive income as we’re talking about our personal finances. We can be tempted into thinking that if we only find the right person then it’s smooth sailing. But as anyone who has been in a long-term relationship knows- the work has only just begun! The same is often true of the different passive income opportunities that we hear pitched in social media or hawked in YouTube videos. Passive income is a legit and real concept, but the way it’s often presented doesn’t include the full story, or they leave out some crucial details. There are very few sources of 100%, purely passive income and so that’s why we are dispelling the myth that there are opportunities around every corner, but have a listen because there <em>are</em> ways you can begin establishing your own future streams of income, today.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Radix by Halfway Crooks!
