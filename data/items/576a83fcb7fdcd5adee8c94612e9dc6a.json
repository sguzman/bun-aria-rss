  "description": "<p>Are you afraid to ask for what you want? When award-winning storyteller Jannelle Codianni ends her 10-year marriage, she realizes that the fear, abuse and rejection mean that now she’s sexually broken. Unable to voice her own desires and not ready for love or commitment, she hires a ‘spotter’ in the form of Marty, one of the only sexological bodyworkers in puritan New England. Can receiving pleasure be silly and playful? More importantly, will these expensive training sessions ever change from awkward to orgasmic?</p> <p>#Invocation #KnowYourDesire #JerkoffSchool #WhatIsThisFeeling</p> <p> </p> <p>Song: ‘Good Thing’ (Zedd, featuring Kehlani)</p> <p> </p> <p>Episode Links</p> <p>BAD NEWS: we’ve lost our Summertime pop-up venue, so this Saturday’s Live show will be our last for a while (the first one sold out, let’s make that happen again this Saturday!)
