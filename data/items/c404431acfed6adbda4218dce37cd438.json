Effective dissent looks like encouragement and collaboration for the good of many. Change does not always happen as an immediate result from going against the status quo, but it does open up others to the idea that there is more than one way to do something. It is healthy to welcome dissent into our lives and into our homes because it makes us realize that our perspectives are not the only approach to finding effective solutions.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
