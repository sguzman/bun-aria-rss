  "description": "<p>Episode 215 - Foundation was one of my favorite hardcore bands in recent years, so I was very much looking forward to speaking to Thomas Pearson, the vocalist of said band. We hopped on Skype one afternoon and had a great discussion about the Atlanta hardcore scene, the process of being a teacher and frankly, why independent music is the best. While I am sad the band is no longer, they left a great legacy in their recorded music. Listen and enjoy!
