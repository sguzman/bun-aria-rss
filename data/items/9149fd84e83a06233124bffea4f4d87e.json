    "media:description": "► In this week's video, I discuss Calm, a rock band formed in 1994 by Clay Parton, prior to Duster and Valium Aggelein. Clay's now iconic, signature sound was first explored with Calm on their debut 12\" in 1995. With the absurdly long song titles and memorable instrumentals, the band remained  unknown and nearly forgotten for many years. Until Duster's unexpected upswing in popular helped them ascend from total obscurity. This is the story of Calm.\n\nFootage of the band comes from The Numero Group\n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
