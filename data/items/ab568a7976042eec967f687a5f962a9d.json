    "media:description": "The Field Museum in Chicago preserves everything from fish and snakes to frogs and Komodo dragons in their basement. \n\nThese 11 million fluid specimens are preserved in jars or tanks. Preparing and storing them is a centuries-long commitment, so why do it? This method effectively keeps their shape and, in some cases, even DNA. Not only that, but it has helped researchers do groundbreaking work, like developing new techniques for getting old DNA and discovering new species right among the shelves. \n\nWe went to the Field Museum to see how new specimens are added to the ever-growing collection.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:53 - Acquisition\n1:15 - Water Snake\n3:40 - Catfish\n4:19 - Komodo dragon\n4:56 - Diaphonized Fish\n6:40 - Spider-Tailed Horned Viper\n7:45 - Frogs\n\nMORE SCIENCE INSIDER VIDEOS\nWhy Over 600,000 Bird Specimens Are Preserved At The Smithsonian | Colossal Collections\nhttps://youtu.be/jtU_IoznyKU\nHow 4 Million Fossils Are Excavated At La Brea Tar Pits | Colossal Collections | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/ZMuxQWvok2M\nDermatologists Debunk 8 Body-Odor Myths | Debunked | Science Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/bJ-CmpYifB4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#WetSpecimen #ColossalCollections #ScienceInsider\n\nScience Insider tells you all you need to know about science: space, medicine, biotech, physiology, and more. \n\nVisit us at: https://www.businessinsider.com\nScience Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsi...\nScience Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/science_ins...\nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider\nTech Insider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/techinsider\n\nWhy 11 Million Embalmed Specimens Are Stored In The Field Museum's Basement  | Colossal Collections",
