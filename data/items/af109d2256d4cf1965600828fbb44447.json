We then discuss sleep: beginning with an excerpt from chapter 6 of A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century—Sleep—we discuss dreams and hallucinations, the use of entheogens across human cultures, and the role of different qualities and intensities of light in modulating melatonin, mood, and alertness at various times of day. Finally, we speak to whether the phase of the moon affects our sleep, and conclude by noting that right now, the moon is full.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>ReliefBand: Get relief from nausea without drugs.
