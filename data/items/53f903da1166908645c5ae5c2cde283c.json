This includes denying it exists, denying it is caused by humans, and denying government regulation will fix anything.\n\nWe will be tearing apart a terrible Ben Shapiro take, looking at the UK's Tory pundits and analysing the way Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have been approaching the issue by blocking streets in protest and generally holding street parties that look like Burning Man. \n\nI'll also be critising the way the media has been participating in false balance by platforming denial, and pushing the blame onto the consumer with 'carbon footprint' propaganda, all of it funded by right-wing libertarian think-tanks, and the Koch Brothers among other oil barons, of course.\n\nAnd then, we shall be asking, well, how do we fix this? Is there a solution? Has neoliberalism doomed us all, or is there hope? Does Jeffrey Bezos have the answer?\n\nSources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_VdKfHiIl0W94yrzYUj1Q_23RycfSFjaeL8ywGBG5E/edit?usp=sharing\n \nAFFILIATE LINKS\n \nCAMERA EQUIPMENT\nMy camera: https://amzn.to/3BtyOj6\nMy lens: https://amzn.to/3baf7Tg\nMy ringlight: https://amzn.to/3e9D5zZ\nMy teleprompter: https://amzn.to/3bWBTxb\nMy mic: https://amzn.to/3uR6wwQ\nMic mount: https://amzn.to/3e2dx81\nGreen screen: https://amzn.to/2NYssp1\n \nVideos are edited with Adobe Premiere Pro, I also use Photoshop for thumbnails etc.\n \nMUSIC EQUIPMENT\nAbleton Push 2: https://amzn.to/3qhEWoF\nKeyboard: https://amzn.to/3qgmsVE\nAudio Interface: https://amzn.to/3beqs4E\nAbleton Live Suite software: https://amzn.to/3bbfvks\nKomplete 13 Ultimate software: https://amzn.to/3bZahaB\nSoundproofing: https://amzn.to/3uQC5Xv and https://amzn.to/2NW6jHO\nSpeakers: https://amzn.to/3bVJ4Wo\nHeadphones: https://amzn.to/2PwMdo8\n\n--timestamps--\n0:00 Clussy\n1:16 The world is on fire, but it isn't very good for ratings\n19:09 Why are we arguing about peer reviewed science again?\n29:26 Why does Ben Shapiro exist again?\n33:55 Personal Responsibility, AKA Don't forget to scrub out your used tub of marmite, so when it gets stuck on the head of a turtle, at least it can still see\n42:09 Why COP26 was a failure and we're all going to die on a fiery ball in space\n48:57 The Military Industrial Complex\n54:38 A solution?\n1:00:09 B E Z O S W A V E",
