  "description": "As Republicans embraced anti-elitism under Trump, Democrats reacted by embracing the values of the upper-middle class. \n\nThe result, according to historian Matt Karp is a party that often - intentionally or unintentionally - distances itself from the working class, which it used to champion. The professional class has made all opposition the \"other,\" embracing a partisan identity politics that says \"if you're not with us, you're against us.\"  \n\nBut pushback is coming from both the right and the left. Karp discusses how the mainstream media has mischaracterized what Bernie Sanders is trying to do, and then digs deep into his historical research to provide analogies from the past that explain the present moment.
