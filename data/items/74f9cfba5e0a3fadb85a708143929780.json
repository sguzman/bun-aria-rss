  "description": "<p>We’re talking all about teeny, tiny robots in today’s episode. You know, the ones that are as light as a postage stamp and as look like insects? They may be small, but these robots can still take in information and make decisions on their own. Find out how bees and cockroaches are teaching us about the future of small robots and what <em>big</em> tasks they might take on. There’s also a new Mystery Sound to rattle your ears. Plus a moment of Um that answers the question: Why does the sun stay in one place?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.kiwico.com/mlp/brainson\" class=\"default\">KiwiCo</a> (www.kiwico.com/brainson)</p>\n",
