Doing deep emotional work can not only help us find better health and happiness, it can also help us discover our true purpose and understand how to fully share our gifts with others. Being vulnerable and open to reality, rather than focusing on the stories we tell ourselves, is a major step in the right direction. </p><br><p>My guest on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy has done all of that and more. You probably recognize Lisa Lampanelli’s name from the world of comedy, with a career spanning more than 30 years. She has numerous tours, Grammy nominations, and national TV guest appearances and specials under her belt. Lisa made national headlines in 2012 when she lost more than 100 pounds with the help of bariatric surgery. The comedian went on to speak with unflinching honesty about her lifelong food and body-image issues and has since gone from insulter to inspirer. Now, in her 50’s, she’s done a career overhaul and works as a life coach, food and body-image workshop leader, speaker, and storyteller.</p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
