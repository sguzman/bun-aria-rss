  "description": "<p>Season 9 ends at the beginning — with the man who changed Hollywood forever and wrote the blueprint for A16Z’s upending of Silicon Valley a generation later, Michael Ovitz and his “Dream Factory”, Creative Artists Agency. From Jurassic Park to Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Goodfellas, Rain Man, ER, and even the Coca-Cola polar bears... almost nothing in 80s and 90s pop culture didn’t have CAA’s stamp on it. Speaking of dreams, this episode was totally one for us, and we hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we did making it!!</p> <p>Big news!! <strong><a href=\"http://pod.link/acquiredlp\">All back catalog LP Show episodes are now free</a></strong> and available to anyone!

Happy listening and happy holidays to everyone!!</p> <p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Thank you to our presenting sponsor for all of Season 9, <a href=\"http://pilot.com/\">Pilot.com</a>! Pilot takes care of startups' bookkeeping, tax and CFO services so busy founders can focus on what matters. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos's AWS analogy: bookkeeping and tax don't make your product any better — so you should let Pilot handle them for you. Pilot is in fact backed by Bezos himself, along with other all-star investors including Sequoia, Index, and Stripe. They are truly the gold standard for startup bookkeeping, and many of the companies we work with run on them. You can get in touch with Pilot here: <a href= \"https://bit.ly/acquiredfmpilot\">https://bit.ly/acquiredfmpilot</a> , and Acquired listeners get 20% off their first 6 months!
