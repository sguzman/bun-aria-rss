  "description": "<p>So we don't typically post DailyVees to the podcast because a lot of the context can get lost without the footage but this one was special, where I decided to talk through my day to provide the necessary context for all those watching and listening. The theme in this one is patience and is dedicated to everybody with a ‘I want it NOW’ mentality. Whether it’s the stock market, passing up on a 1st class plane ticket, or charging money for content… I THINK LONG TERM, and it pays off, LONG TERM. Remember, marathon runners don't win sprints. Hope you enjoy this one !! </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5484175.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
