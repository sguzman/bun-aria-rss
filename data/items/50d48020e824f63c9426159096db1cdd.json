On the panel for this week’s episode are New Scientist journalists Rowan Hooper, Penny Sarchet, Jacob Aron and Clare Wilson. The team is joined by Katrina Pollock, a vaccine scientist from Imperial College London, who explains the work that needs to be done before we have a safe and effective vaccine for covid-19. Also on the show is the surprising finding that subatomic and ghostly <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2236184-neutrinos-determined-where-galaxies-formed-in-the-early-universe/'>neutrinos may have influenced the structure of the early universe</a>.
