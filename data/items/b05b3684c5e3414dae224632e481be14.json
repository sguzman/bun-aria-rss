We eliminate all the big things that can go wrong, and then it turns out that a couple little things still didn’t go right. It’s just never perfect.</p><p>That’s one lesson.

He also talked about picking ourselves up when we fall—because we will fall. <a href='https://dailystoic.com/epictetus/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=convertkit&utm_campaign=never-perfect'>Epictetus said</a> that he never expected to meet a full sage—he just wanted to meet someone <em>trying</em> to get better. (Confucius, as it happens, said something very similar). </p><p>So don’t expect to be perfect today. Don’t expect things to be as good as they were in your head or how you practiced them. Be content to be as good as you can be, while still trying to get a little bit better next time.
