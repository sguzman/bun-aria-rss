  "description": "<p>There has been plenty of action in the first week of the 2022 Commonwealth Games and the boys are back to go over it all in our massive review of the first 7 days of Birmingham 2022! Just how have the Aussies and Canadians faired compared to how we thought they would do? Should other countries even bother to show up in the swimming when Australia is so dominant? Do we care about the Aussie swimming love triangle? What does Kylie Masse have to do to win anything else but a silver medal? How excited are we that so many of our guests have been doing so well? And are we sad we haven't seen much of the bull since the opening ceremony? Get yourself locked and loaded and ready to listen for another epic episode you won't want to miss!</p>",
