  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In this episode, we’re talking about vision. But this episode is a little unique. Instead of our usual format, we wanted to give you a taste of an event we host every year called Live2Lead.</p> <p class=\"p1\">This year’s event was incredible. We had an amazing speaker line-up. And so we wanted to give you a taste of what this event is all about.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> So in this episode, we’ve taken the audio from both of John sessions from a previous Live2Lead, and pieced them together for you here. You can find out everything you need to know about Live2Lead at Live2Lead.com.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Our bonus resource for this episode is the videos for the sessions you’re about to hear. So if you want to play this for your team, or sit around a conference table and discuss how to apply this, you can visit MaxwellPodcast.com/Live2Lead. To get the videos just visit that page and click the Bonus Resource button. With that being said, this is a great message, and we hope you enjoy it. And we also hope to see you at our next Live2Lead event.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://live2lead.com/\">Check out Live2Lead.com for all the info.</a></strong> </p> <p> </p> <p>Resources:</p> <p><em><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Developing-the-Leader-Within-You-20_p_1666.html\"> Developing the Leader Within You 2.0 by John C.
