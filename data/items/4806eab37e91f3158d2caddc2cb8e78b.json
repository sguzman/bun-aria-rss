  "description": "“I reject your proposals … and shall defend myself to the last extremity.”\nThis is the story of the Revolution's new hot spot: the South. Down here, British leaders hope to score some quick victories with the help of enslaved Americans and Loyalists. This new \"Southern Strategy\" enjoys a strong start. It will cause the greatest losses of the whole war for the Americans. But other important events are happening all over the globe in 1779, too. The Continental dollar's inflation is getting out of hand. Spain is entering the war. Battles are being fought all over the globe. Massacres of all sorts are happening. But we'll keep the focus on the South ... and on that guy whose body gets flung against the steeple of a church.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
