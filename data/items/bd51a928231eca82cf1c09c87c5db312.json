  "description": "The first *pew-pew-pew* Brady Quinn Football Show of 2021 is here and it's a loaded one. Host Will Brinson and Brady address some rumors about Pete Prisco to start the podcast before getting to the real football stuff. The guys take a further look at GM and coach vacancies across the league and evaluate what organizations should aim for as they fill those jobs (4:00). Brady then dismisses most of the outrage directed at Doug Pederson and the Eagles over Sunday's game vs. Washington (20:30). BQ approaches the argument from a player's perspective and notes contradictions from the critics of what transpired. The Carson Wentz saga continues, as the guys take a look at the mental side of the once-promising QB, rather than his physical limitations from this season (29:00) Lastly, the Browns just can't catch a break (37:00). After an 18-year playoff drought Cleveland is finally back in the postseason, but will be without head coach Kevin Stefanski in the Wild Card Round vs. the Steelers due to COVID-19. Brady offers a glimmer of hope for desperate Browns fans and breaks down the impact of missing a head coach on game day.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @Brady_Quinn, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
