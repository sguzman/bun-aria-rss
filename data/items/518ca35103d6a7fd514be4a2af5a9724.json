  "description": "Owen Jones is a star in the world of political commentary. The most prominent Corbyn supporter in the British media he is also a highly successful author and shot to fame with his work 'Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class' which he followed up with 'The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It'. He joins Matt for a wildly meandering conversation about his own brand of left-wing politics, his Corbyn wobble, the personal cost of being a political activist, Alan Partridge and a whole load of other things. It's long but it flew by. You can follow Owen on Twitter here: @OwenJones84 You can buy Owen's books here: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chavs-Demonization-Working-Owen-Jones/dp/1844678644 (not sure if he'd want you to buy them off Amazon) You can follow Matt on Twitter here: @mattforde You can buy tickets to Matt's brand new Edinburgh show 'Brexit Through The Gift Shop' here: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/matt-forde-brexit-through-the-gift-shop and to his two Political Party specials in Edinburgh here: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/matt-forde-s-political-party-podcast<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
