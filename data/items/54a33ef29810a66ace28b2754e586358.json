  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, we have a president bankrupting our economic system and making reckless comments about nuclear Armageddon. Yet, the media says that Donald Trump is the biggest threat to our country. If Biden seriously thoughtwe were facing a nuclear strike from Putin he should probably be in the situation room with military officials instead of talking smack at a Democrat Party fundraiser. Then, when Russia put missiles on the Island of Cuba it created a crisis, it happened because JFK was perceived as weak. He pressed them and they removed them. But the Cuban Missile Crisis scenario is no longer the case because missiles reach targets that are way further away. So, in effect, the United States faces a Cuban Missile Crisis from enemy states every single day. Later, the New York Times is trying to influence every election they can. Democrats are trashing Republican candidates for things most Democrats have actually done and would be praised for. Democrats attack liberty and If America won't support its own freedom it can't support the freedom of others. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
