  "description": "<p>We're launching a new monthly series and wanted to give you a preview and some context before it goes live! Every month between now and November 2020, we're going to have a bonus episode centered around a political topic. Each month, we'll invite an expert to help school us on an issue or break down what's happening in the election. We can't wait to share our first episode with a repeat visit from Alyssa Mastromonaco.</p>",
