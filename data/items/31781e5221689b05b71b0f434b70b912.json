The exhibition displays avant-garde artworks and installations by a diverse group of artists — including</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jr/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">French Artist </span><b>JR</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Egyptian sculptor </span><b>Ahmed Karaly</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/emilioferroextra/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Italian Artist </span><b>Emilio Ferro</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elseed/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">French-Tunisian graffiti artist </span><b>El Seed</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> — and an immersive experience of art set against the iconic backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza.  Each filter features a guide, Bastet, an animated cat inspired by the ancient Egyptian deity of the same name, who accompanies people as they explore the backstory of each art piece and its creation through immersive videos, images and illustrations — all powered by AR technology. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36672\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593\" alt=\"Demo of the AR filter \" width=\"890\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=4500 4500w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=2048 2048w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=1620 1620w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=800 800w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=1780 1780w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/OZ_02801.jpg?resize=890%2C593?w=2670 2670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“The AR/VR technology provides our creator community with infinite potential to build more meaningful, inspiring and impactful content. Through our partnership with Art d’Egypte on Forever is Now II, we hope to illustrate one of many ways this could be achieved and how technology can help immerse people in the artistic journey,”<br />\n&#8211; Fares Akkad, Country Director, MENA at Meta. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creators from around Europe and the Middle East, including</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hadiaghaleb/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hadia Ghaleb</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marisa/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marissa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mohammed/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mohamed ElHabtour</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/heybrandonb/?hl=en\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BrandonB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,  were some of the first to trial the filter, making and sharing experiential videos with their friends and followers on Instagram. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“This experience was surreal and memorable. Surreal, because we were in one of the world&#8217;s most ancient landscapes experiencing futuristic AR technology, and memorable because it was a fresh and novel approach to content creation. For me as a creator, the filters were a very cool way to see how technology and art were being brought together to uplift and enhance our experience.”<br />\n&#8211; Brandon Baum, UK-based Creator</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is our first XR investment in Egypt geared towards blending digital overlays onto the physical world by creating interactive, creative and immersive content around an experience.  Augmented reality technology will play a big part in the metaverse and help more  communities worldwide experience art in new and immersive ways.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/launching-egyptian-art-inspired-ar-filters-on-instagram/\">Launching Egyptian Art-Inspired AR Filters on Instagram</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com\">Meta</a>.</p>\n",
