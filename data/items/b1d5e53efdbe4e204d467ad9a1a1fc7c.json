  "description": "The public hearings start on Wednesday! But while everyone is dead set on Trump and Biden, we’re asking WHY the Democrats suddenly ran toward impeachment (did somebody say “Hail Hydra”?). All the chaos is bumping right up against the holidays. But come the new year, the Senate must start playing offense and expose EVERYTHING. Kanye West might run for president in 2024 – but don’t laugh! He’s serious. And the new James Bond movie is even more politically correct now. The Democrats’ defense of Joe Biden is laughable, but Trump is actually HELPING Ukraine by providing it missiles to deter Russia, not just blankets. Rep. Chris Stewart joins to give a firsthand view of the hearings, Schiff’s heavy hand, and the GOP’s plan forward.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
