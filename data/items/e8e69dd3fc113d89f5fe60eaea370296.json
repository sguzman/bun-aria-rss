  "description": "What a great conversation I had recently with John Higgs about his new book, William Blake vs the World! Poet, artist, and visionary, William Blake is an archetypal misunderstood genius. His life passed without recognition, and he worked without reward, often mocked, dismissed and misinterpreted. Yet from his ignoble end in a pauper’s grave, Blake now occupies a unique position as an artist who unites and attracts people from all corners of society—a rare inclusive symbol of human identity. \nWith 30 integrated illustrations throughout the book, William Blake vs the World is a beautiful, wild adventure into unfamiliar territory. John Higgs places the bewildering eccentricities of a most singular artist into fascinating context, and although the journey begins with us trying to understand Blake, we will ultimately discover that it is Blake who helps us to understand ourselves.\nPlease enjoy this bonus episode, featuring my discussion, via Zoom, with John Higgs.
