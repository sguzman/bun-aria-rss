I'm Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley. Along with my colleagues, bring you a variety of perspectives, I'll be talking about trends across the global investment landscape and how we put those ideas together. It's Friday, December 17th, at 2 p.m. in London.</p><p><br></p><p>Every year, the economists and strategists at Morgan Stanley come together and try to forecast what the next year could look like. And then, as always seems to be the case, something happens. The world, after all, is an unpredictable place.</p><p><br></p><p>This year, these 'somethings' have come thick and fast. As my colleague Matthew Harrison, U.S. biotechnology analyst, and I discussed on this program last week, the Omicron variant appears to be highly contagious and likely to lead to a large wave of winter infections.</p><p><br></p><p>At almost the same time, the US Federal Reserve, arguably the world's most important central bank, has been sounding less tolerant of inflation, leading Morgan Stanley's economists to now expect a quicker end to the central bank's bond purchases and also a larger, faster increase in Federal Reserve interest rates relative to what we thought just a month ago.</p><p><br></p><p>Both are major developments. But while they change some of our investment strategy around the edges, we don't think, for now, they change the main story for 2022.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand why, let's start with the Federal Reserve. Yes, the Fed is now likely to end bond purchases and raise interest rates sooner than we had previously assumed. But from an investment perspective, we always thought the central bank would signal an intent to be less supportive to start the new year, hoping to convince markets that they were taking inflation seriously. We had previously thought that this 'tough talk' might shift in the spring, when inflation data would come down, and the Fed wouldn't ultimately follow through on interest rate hikes. But now, it looks like they will.</p><p><br></p><p>But in either scenario, the strategy for investors should be to position for a central bank that is indicating it wants to be less supportive. As such, we expect interest rates to move higher, especially around five-year maturities, the dollar to appreciate and U.S. and emerging markets stocks to underperform those in Europe and Japan, where the central banks are going to be more accommodating for longer. We think financials outperform as an equity sector, seeing them as a beneficiary of less central bank accommodation.</p><p><br></p><p>The other development, of course, is Omicron, while the new variant appears to be highly contagious. Our economists at Morgan Stanley had always assumed some form of a 'winter wave' of COVID in their growth numbers, given the virus's seasonal characteristics. Economic data, for the moment, has actually held up quite well and global activity has been less impacted by each incremental COVID wave. And we also need to consider the entire year, not just what could be a very difficult month or two of high COVID cases. All of these together are why our base case remains for strong global growth in the next year, despite the currently worrying headlines.</p><p><br></p><p>Both new developments, however, require close observation. The Fed looks much more willing to shift in either direction than it has before, while the full impact of Omicron may not be seen for several more weeks. For now, however, we think a backdrop of good global growth and less central bank support remains the outlook for 2022.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for listening.
