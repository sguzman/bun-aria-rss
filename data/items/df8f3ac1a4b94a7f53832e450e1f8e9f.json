  "description": "<p>This week, I want to introduce you to another podcast that I make, called <a href=\"https://partners.show\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Partners</a>. It’s a show about partnerships that was born out of Song Exploder. I’ve made a bunch of episodes with bandmates, or co-writers, or an artist and a producer who worked together, all these stories where the songs were the result of a really special collaboration. And I was always fascinated by the origins of the relationship, as part of the story of the origin of the song. When you hear those stories, it becomes clear that what these people made together is something that reflects not just each of them individually, but this other, unique entity that only exists where the two of them meet. And I wanted to make a podcast that was entirely about that idea. And I feel like all successful long-term partnerships could be thought of as love stories. It’s a matter of luck, and being in the right place at the right time, and also work and patience, plus some ineffable magic spark. So that’s what Partners is about. The first season came out in 2020, and the second season just began last week. You can subscribe to the show at <a href=\"https://partners.show\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">partners.show</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts, etc, but I also just want to play you this episode from season 2, with two music greats, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, who have made two incredible albums together.</p>\n\n<p>For more, visit <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/partners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/partners</a>.</p>",
