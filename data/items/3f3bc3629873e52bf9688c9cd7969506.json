  "description": "<p>It's a double hitter this weekend! SC EP:211 is coming! I am in the process of uploading it to the site. Here is EP:210 with Dan Baker who describes an encounter while investigating a property.</p> <p>Dan Baker will be my guest, and will be sharing with us his personal encounter. Dan writes “I was a 12 year old boy in 1967 when Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin made the historic film of “Patty” in Bluff Creek California. I always sat with my mom and dad in the evenings to watch the news. One evening, I saw that epic film of a large, hairy creature walking away from the camera. That was the film that sparked a lifelong interest in bigfoot. Over the years, I watched as many films and documentaries as I could and read about as much. The Internet allowed me to further my research, in some areas but I needed to start getting into the field, which I did along with my wife, Sue. On June, 6, 2013, I finally had a night time sighting through my night vision in Carroll County, Ohio. Soon after that, I began researching anthropology, paleoanthropology, and primatology in an effort to piece together possibilities of just what these creatures might be. Studying early hominids and great apes has given me a better understanding of bipedalism as well as an idea of how it works. I’m constantly exploring possibilities.”</p>",
