  "description": "<p>In the late 1990s, Jerry Colonna co-founded the iconic Flatiron Partners with Fred Wilson. Flatiron became one of the world’s most successful, early-stage investment funds. Five years later, Jerry's work and life fell off a cliff and he found himself questioning whether he wanted to stay alive. Sage advice from a therapist sent him on a journey that would eventually lead him away from the industry, into Buddhism and his own personal reclamation. Stepping back into the light, he decided to devote his life to profound service and compassion, becoming one of the most sought-after coaches and advisors to founders of many of the fastest growing ventures in the world.
