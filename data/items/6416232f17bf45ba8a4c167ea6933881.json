  "description": "It’s been a crazy several months here at Curzio Research. (If you haven’t heard, our  will soon be trading here in the U.S. on the tZERO platform.)   My wife and I decided to get away for the weekend... And inflation is everywhere… from the cost of food and drink… to hotels and parking (which we found out at a Guns N’ Roses concert). [00:30]   If that wasn’t bad enough, the casino’s jackpot sizes were tiny.    The casino we visited is on Native American land. I share some wild stats on how Native American casinos are regulated... and what makes them different from other casinos. [12:05]   Next, I explain why FedEx is warning about the rising costs of raw material and labor… and why we need to be prepared for a lot more companies to do the same. [18:00]   A listener gives me a pat on the back for my COVID coverage and shares his experience with the virus. I share some data on why some folks are willing to get the vaccine... while others are still reluctant. Plus, I reiterate why it should be a personal choice to make. [27:10]   Carbon Streaming Corporation just announced a reverse stock split. I’m an investor in this company, and a listener wants to know if I'm concerned. In short, no. I explain why management is taking this action... and why it’s great for investors. [30:17] Enjoyed this episode?
