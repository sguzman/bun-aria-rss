  "description": "An Arizona band led by singer-guitarist Joey Burns and drummer/multi- instrumentalist John Convertino, Calexico has spent a decade and a half as a go-to purveyor of atmospheric, even cinematic desert pop. With the aid of trumpets, pedal-steel guitars and piano, Calexico has become a festival favorite (playing a set at Bonnaroo earlier this summer), recorded high-profile collaborations (including 'In the Reins,' a tremendous album with Iron & Wine), and evolved into a consistent studio force (most recently releasing the well-received 'Carried to Dust'). Here, Calexico performs live at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, R.I.",
