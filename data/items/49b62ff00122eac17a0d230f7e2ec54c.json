  "description": "<p>There are a lot of different types of insurance out there and it can be tough to know which types of policies you should look into and which ones to avoid. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the amount of information related to insurance, and that can lead you to not making any decisions at all. The end result is that things remain the same- and you’re underinsured. And then you might hear an anecdotal story of when a warranty or insurance policy came in handy for someone else, so you feel that should be a product to look into, but should you? You don’t want to end up overinsuring and paying too much every month for something you don’t really need! In this episode we’ll cover the role that insurance should play in our lives and then dive into the specifics of which plans we should absolutely have, the ones we should just consider, and then the ones we should completely avoid altogether.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a PB&J Sour by Shades Brewing- a big thanks to Andy for donating this one to the show!
