More than four thousand passengers and crew were on board. Ian and Janice Donoff were hoping to get away in a lifeboat, but it got stuck as it was being lowered into the sea, so they had to find another way off.  Thirty-two people died in the disaster. The captain was later found guilty of manslaughter for needlessly navigating the ship too close to the shore of an island it was sailing past.   \n \nProduced and presented by Nick Holland\n\nPHOTO: The Costa Concordia lying aground off Giglio (2012)",
