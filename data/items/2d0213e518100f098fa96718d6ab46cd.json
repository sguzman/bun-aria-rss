  "title": "Ep. 249: A Sustainable Approach to Design with Laurence Carr",
  "description": "Today we are discussing the very important and fast-growing topic of sustainability in design with expert, Laurence Carr. Laurence is the creative director and CEO of her award-winning New York-based design studio Laurence Carr Inc. Her signature style blends well-being practices with contemporary design and smart technology. She shares with us her passion for educating the design community on its impact on the environment, how our well-being is inextricably intertwined with our surroundings and materials, and where we can focus our efforts to design with sustainability in mind.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nWhen did Laurence first combine her design, wellness, and environmental work?\n\nWhat does it mean to design a healthy interior?\n\nBiophilic design and how Laurence uses it.\n\nWhat is “forest bathing” (Shinrin-yoku in Japanese) and how does it relate to design?\n\nIn the practice of engaging every sense in design, how can you incorporate scent?\n\nWhat it means to buy sustainable items.\n\nMaterials and fabrics that are more sustainable.\n\nAre solar panels on your home worth it and what needs to be considered in the installation?\n\nThe best way to upcycle your home goods.\n\nHow does smart technology tie into sustainable design?\n\nThe #1 wellness item in Laurence’s home that has made the biggest difference.\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nHi Kimberly,\nMy first inclination would be to mount the TV on the orange painted wall so it’s not a focal point, is easy to watch, and is out of reach for young kids. To distract from the bulkhead I would find a way to incorporate it into the design of the living room. You can paint it the same color as the ceiling, use recessed LED lighting to highlight parts of the mantle, or you can decorate it to make it look like a wood beam. Or even replace it with an actual wood beam! No matter what you need to paint that current wood trim so it blends instead of sticks. For the best flow, I would have a sofa that faces the fireplace with armchairs on either side instead of a sectional. Your final question about hidden storage for kids' books and toys, I would suggest putting a wall system in that very long wall where the fireplace is. You can make the height go up to the height of the mantle and you can play around with doors, movable shelves, etc. The key is making it easy to reach while also reducing clutter. You want efficiency but also for it to be multi-purpose for longevity purposes; you want to be able to use it for built-ins after the kids outgrow this phase. Don’t forget to of course use GREENGUARD gold-certified materials!\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nLaurence Carr Inc\nLaurence Carr Inc on Instagram\nLaurence Carr Inc on Pinterest\nChez Laurence\nBallard Designs Performance Fabrics by Sunbrella\nWren Dining Table\nThe LBC Red List\nSustainable Furnishings Council \nWhat does GREENGUARD Certified mean?",
