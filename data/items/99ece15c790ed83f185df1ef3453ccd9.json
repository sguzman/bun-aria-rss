  "description": "Today I talked to Melody Wilding about her new book Trust Yourself: Stop Overthinking and Channel Your Emotions for Success at Work (Chronicle Prism, 2021).\nAre you what Wilding calls a Sensitive Striver like herself, somebody who indexes high on the personality traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness? If so, this episode is for you. The dilemma of doubting yourself at the same time that everybody depends on you to do great work and likely carry more than your fair share of the workload is the dilemma Sensitive Strivers know all too well. What’s the way out? Wilding takes listeners through steps like recognizing your core values and overcoming what she calls the Honor Roll Hangover. Getting “unstuck” is a process that can benefit from Wilding’s tips, like those captured in Speak Up Shortcuts and her Four Feelings Test. Become your own hero, and in the process of self-discovery you may join the 60-80% of Wilding’s clients who have made a major career shift since the onset of Covid-19.\nMelody Wilding has been named one of Business Insider’s “Most Innovative Coaches,” with clients that range from Fortune 500 companies to the United Nations. Her work has been featured in The New York times, Oprah Magazine, The Washington Post, Fast Company, and on NBC News. A licensed social worker, Wilding received a master’s degree from Columbia University.\nDan Hill, PhD, is the author of eight books and leads Sensory Logic, Inc. (https://www.sensorylogic.com).
