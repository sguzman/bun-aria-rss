  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast, we’re on part two of our look into the cultural impact of the book, “Where the Red Fern Grows” by Wilson Rawls. He drove the bus to the game where the coonhunters showed pop culture what was up, and made us all proud. We’ll talk with the childhood actor, Stewart Peterson, who starred in the original 1974 Walt Disney movie and learn how he got into acting and why he got out. His reason might surprise and challenge you. We’ll talk again with redbone coonhound man, Ronnie Smith, to get some perspective on the real dogs used in the movie. We’ll have discussion around a key emphasis in the book with Dr. Sean Teuton of the University of Arkansas as we look into that period of life when an adolescent boy becomes a man (and we’ll talk about crying). Lastly, we'll talk with Misty Newcomb about the development of boys and how the system is sometimes rigged against them. If you haven’t watched the original movie or read the book, you ought to go check it out, but regardless you’re not going to want to miss this one. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
