  "title": "Blac Chyna’s Courtroom Showdown with the Kardashians",
  "description": "<p>Blac Chyna’s big break came when she’s discovered at a strip club by Drake. She’d go on to star in music videos, date Tyga and become friends with the Kardashians. But after Tyga leaves her for Kylie Jenner, Chyna ends up engaged to Rob Kardashian, lands herself a show on E! called “Rob & Chyna” and gives birth to their daughter Dream. But their relationship was more like a nightmare. After a night of partying ends with Rob accusing Chyna of trying to strangle him and pointing a gun to his head, they break up and E! cancels their show. Chyna denies Rob’s accusations, claims the Kardashian-Jenners conspired against her to cancel the show and sues them for over $100M. Tune in as we break it all down!</p><p>Patreon: <a href='https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy'>https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy</a><br/>LinkTree: <a href='https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy'>https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy<br/></a>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en'>https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en</a><br/>Twitter: <a href='https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy'>https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy</a><br/><br/>Intro Song:<br/>Trick or Treat (instrumental) by RYYZN <a href='https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn'>https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat'>https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc'>https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc</a><br/><br/>Outro Song:<br/>Sundown Drive by Ghostrifter Official<br/><a href='https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official'>https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive'>https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs'>https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs</a></p>\n",
