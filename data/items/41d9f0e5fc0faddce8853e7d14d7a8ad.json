Once he had profit and prestige, he could have all things his heart desired. </p> <p class=\"\"> Jack, having suspected that Andy had given a poor response, said he wished to cultivate humanness by helping others to help themselves. He wanted to allow others to see how their selfishness prevented them from becoming truly human and from experiencing true joy. </p> <p class=\"\"> Finally, Olly simply responded that he wished not to make any promises he couldn’t keep but that he hoped to learn from the ancients, respect the roles he had been assigned, and care for his friends and family. </p> <p class=\"\"> Confucius sat quietly for a moment and then said: “Andy, you have mistaken what made the Duke of Zhou so well pleased.
