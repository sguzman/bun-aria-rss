  "description": "You have an idea of how this parenting thing will go… and then life gets messy. Your toddler isn’t walking yet. Or your baby has food allergies. Maybe your first-grader needs extra support at school. What do we do in these moments when things don’t go as expected?

No matter what unexpected twists and turns you’ve faced with your kids, their conversation will remind you you’re not alone and equip you with the tools to handle whatever comes your way.<p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
