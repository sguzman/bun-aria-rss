    "media:description": "For about eight months I have been working to develop a new kind of crankshaft. It now appears that both the crankshaft and the entire leg system are redundant at once. It is a hard decision to declare all that work unnecessary. But from the experiments on the beach there was only one clear conclusion: These new cross walkers will no longer have legs. Many youtubers will regret it. But there's nothing I can do about that. It is the conditions on the beach that dictate to me. The criterion is surviving! I think this new species will survive better, especially the storms. This will become apparent from the experiments I will be conducting this summer.",
