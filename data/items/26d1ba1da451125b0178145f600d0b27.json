  "description": "<p>The construction of a meaningful hypergraph topology is the key to processing\nsignals with high-order relationships that involve more than two entities.\nLearning the hypergraph structure from the observed signals to capture the\nintrinsic relationships among the entities becomes crucial when a hypergraph\ntopology is not readily available in the datasets. There are two challenges\nthat lie at the heart of this problem: 1) how to handle the huge search space\nof potential hyperedges, and 2) how to define meaningful criteria to measure\nthe relationship between the signals observed on nodes and the hypergraph\nstructure. In this paper, to address the first challenge, we adopt the\nassumption that the ideal hypergraph structure can be derived from a learnable\ngraph structure that captures the pairwise relations within signals. Further,\nwe propose a hypergraph learning framework with a novel dual smoothness prior\nthat reveals a mapping between the observed node signals and the hypergraph\nstructure, whereby each hyperedge corresponds to a subgraph with both node\nsignal smoothness and edge signal smoothness in the learnable graph structure.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on\nboth synthetic and real world datasets. Experiments show that our proposed\nframework can efficiently infer meaningful hypergraph topologies from observed\nsignals.\n</p>",
