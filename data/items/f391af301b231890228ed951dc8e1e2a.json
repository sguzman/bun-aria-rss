  "description": "<p>Capturing the dependencies between joints is critical in skeleton-based\naction recognition task. Transformer shows great potential to model the\ncorrelation of important joints. However, the existing Transformer-based\nmethods cannot capture the correlation of different joints between frames,\nwhich the correlation is very useful since different body parts (such as the\narms and legs in \"long jump\") between adjacent frames move together. Focus on\nthis problem, A novel spatio-temporal tuples Transformer (STTFormer) method is\nproposed. The skeleton sequence is divided into several parts, and several\nconsecutive frames contained in each part are encoded. And then a\nspatio-temporal tuples self-attention module is proposed to capture the\nrelationship of different joints in consecutive frames. In addition, a feature\naggregation module is introduced between non-adjacent frames to enhance the\nability to distinguish similar actions. Compared with the state-of-the-art\nmethods, our method achieves better performance on two large-scale datasets.\n</p>",
