  "description": "<p> #QOTD: What YouTube star would you like to see me make a video with?</p>\n<p>I have always said that my #1 most important trait is self-awareness. I mean that. People come to me and they ask all these personal questions that I just can't answer because I don't know them! My number one advice to everybody reading this is to step back and take a really honest inventory of your strengths and weaknesses. Are you a strong writer? Are you good on video? Do you have an awesome voice? Are you a photoshop wizard? The answer to these questions will point you in a very clear direction and show you whether you should be on YouTube, Souncloud, Medium, or Slideshare. They're all out there waiting for you!</p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578253.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
