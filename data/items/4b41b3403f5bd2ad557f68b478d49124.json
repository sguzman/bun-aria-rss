  "description": "<p>When Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus released their book \"Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland\", which recounted in excruciating detail their decade of captivity at the hands of pedophile serial rapist abuser Arial Castro, every news outlet clamored to be the first to interview them. BBC producer Sam McAlister, incredibly moved and haunted by their horrifying case, knew she wanted to give them a chance to tell their story on \"Newsnight\". So she did what she did best, after meticulous research she gave the publishers her best pitch, and assurance that Amanda and Gina would be given the \"dignity and compassion\" to share their experience.
