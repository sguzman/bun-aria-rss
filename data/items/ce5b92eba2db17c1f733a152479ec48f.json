  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin! On this July 4th, we take a look at the article V Convention of States to prevent instrumentalities of the federal government like the Supreme Court from reshaping the Constitution. The federal government is a creation of the states and hence the states should have control, not a countercultural ideology that opposes the founders' intent in our Constitution. Then, we step back and look at the state of our government today and how it has become completely unmoored from the people through its massive size, taxes and issues with the separation of powers. What’s happened here is that a poison has been let loose into the body politic a poison known as collectivism or statism. Hegelism and Marxism have evolved today into progressivism and it completely and utterly rejects Americanism as our Founders intended. Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer and others might not recognize that their thinking is Hegelian, but Bernie Sanders knows. Our Founding Fathers reject everything with the philosophy that is progressivism, this movement seeks to alter the history of the Founding. Today’s progressives look to radicals like Karl Marx and Georg Hegel for their ideological guidance. This is one of the reasons Bernie Sanders will not debate Mark on any of his media platforms because Mark knows what he knows. He knows what Mark knows. If they sat down for a discussion Mark would thoroughly and completely expose him. Later, the Supreme Court has done some horrific things that have led to horrific outcomes, and yet the Left wants you to believe the Court is better than the other branches of government. Sen Susan Collins says she would not support certain potential Supreme Court nominees because they have demonstrated a disrespect for the vital principle of stare decisis. She is an absolute radical on the issue. If Collins believes in stare decisis and legal precedent, does she believe in the precedent in the Dred Scott case or Plessy v Ferguson? They were abominations. We’ve had judicial precedent in slavery and segregation in the past that lasted longer than Roe v Wade. Activist Supreme Courts in the past have justified slavery, segregation, and racism, and rather than learn the painful lessons of the past we have several current Justices who are committed to the same kind of judicial activism.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
