  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Back in July we had a very fun crossover episode with Erin and Clayton of Learning the Tropes. It was a delight and you should absolutely listen to it. During the event, we received so many questions from listeners that we didn’t have enough time to answer them all…so here we are, answering them! We talk about the kinds of romances we love, Normal People, morality chain and villains turned heroes, COVID and Romance Novels, Ted Lasso, and romance main character names. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And, of course, we talk about our mutual adoration for Lisa Kleypas, which is extremely timely, as next week, on February 4th, we will be celebrating Derek Craven Day 2021! So look for a very special episode on Thursday instead of Wednesday next week…and if you want to be a part of it, visit fatedmates.net and take our “Would Derek Craven?” poll (questions change every day until the 4th!).  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">After that, we’re back to our regularly scheduled programming with Naima Simone’s Blackout Billionaires series (With a little Derek Craven Day excitement in there, too!) In order, the books are: The Billionaire's Bargain, Black Tie Billionaire, and Blame it on the Billionaire. Find them at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, or Apple Books.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah and Jen both adore Blackwing Pencils, but Sarah has really achieved new heights of nerd with her Carl CC-2000 Custom hand crank pencil sharpener.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tessa Bailey is a Fated Mates favorite, and has a new, very charming book out this week called The Sweetest Fix. You should read it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Stay tuned for more show notes later in the week.</p>",
