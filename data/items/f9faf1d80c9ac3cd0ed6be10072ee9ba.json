  "description": "They say that life imitates art. That's rarely as true when we consider the transformative, evocative, challenging, and inspirational work Black artists have been creating for decades. From Clementine Hunter to Emory Douglas to Kara Walker, Black artists have influenced society by changing opinions, instilling values, and translating experiences across space and time. Art is a language that expresses who we are, connects us to ancestors, and speaks to our strength and humanity. It rouses us to action and it has the ability to liberate us from the present into a more just future.\n\nIn this episode, we speak with Rosalind McGary, an artist and founder of SEPIA Collective, an artist-run organization whose mission is to engage artists, build community, and empower youth.\n\nBHY is produced by PushBlack, the nation's largest non-profit Black media company - hit us up at BlackHistoryYear.com and share this with your people!\n\nPushBlack exists because we saw we had to take this into our own hands. You make PushBlack happen with your contributions at https://BlackHistoryYear.com​. Most people do 5 or 10 bucks a month, but everything makes a difference. Thanks for supporting the work.\n\nThe Black History Year production team includes Tareq Alani, Abeni Jones, Patrick Sanders, Tasha Taylor, William Anderson, Jareyah Bradley, Brooke Brown, Shonda Buchanan, Briona Lamback, Akua Tay, Leslie Taylor-Grover, and Darren Wallace.
