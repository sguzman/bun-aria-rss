  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing some of the shenanigans going on involving our local Los Angeles elected officials enriching themselves and those around them in a way that is very possibly illegal. They also discuss the dishonesty that runs rampant in the news media using the infamous 'Carollaectomy' as reported by Entertainment Weekly back in the day. They also speak with a caller who has a theory surrounding the death of George Floyd and discuss the importance of factoring in one's 'batting average' when accessing information. They also speak with a caller who has thoughts on homelessness especially as it exists in California. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nFastGrowingTrees.com/ADS\nRocketMoney.com/ADS",
