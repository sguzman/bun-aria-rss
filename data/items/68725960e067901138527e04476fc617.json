  "description": "<p>Spooktacular Crew Member Lynn Weingarden-Marston said, \"I have traveled all over the world. The quickest way to find out about the history of a city or town for that matter is the Graveyard! You can see the whole history of a town or area on the tomb stones. From what was the main industry of the town to plagues and outbreaks of illness. Life expectancy to infant mortality.\" And that really says it all about cemeteries. They are one of the best historical records of an area. And they are the best place to pay our respects to those who have gone on before us. In this episode, I feature four cemeteries that have reports of paranormal activity. these are Waverly Hall cemetery in Georgia, El Campo Santo Cemetery in San Diego, Bayview Cemetery in Bellingham, Washington and Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. Join me as we explore these historic graveyards! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Anthony Ortiz and features Takanakuy and This Month in History features The Nautilus crossing under the North Pole.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/08/ep-269-haunted-cemeteries-10.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2018/08/ep-269-haunted-cemeteries-10.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p>",
