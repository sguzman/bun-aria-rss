  "description": "<p>Guten tag! Sprechen Sie Deutsch? This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is talking to Jeremy Nolen, chef and author of the recently released “New German Cooking: Recipes for Classics Revisited.” Jeremy tells Cathy how he became interested in German cuisine and his process researching for the dishes, though he shares that many of the dishes are featured on the menu of his restaurant Brauhaus Schmitz in Philadelphia. Very cozy and homestyle, the book celebrates fresh vegetables, grains, herbs, and spices as obsessively as it does pork, pretzels, and beer. Jeremy goes on to preview recipes from his family table, inspired by travels in Germany, such as the fischgulasch. After the break, Cathy gets Jeremy’s background and learns that he’s basically been cooking his whole life. Tune in for an interesting show! Auf Wiedersehen!
