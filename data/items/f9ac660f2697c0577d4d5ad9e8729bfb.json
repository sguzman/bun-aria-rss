  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about cyber and information operations in Eastern Europe that look disturbingly like battlespace preparation. The FBI finds that the scope of the Democratic Party hacks is much greater than initially believed. The Bureau seems ready to ask for more authority to unlock devices, but opponents point to Microsoft's inadvertent leak of Secure Boot keys as an object lesson in why that's a bad idea. USENIX proofs-of-concept include Linux and car-hacking exploits. Samsung Pay is criticized as vulnerable to token skimming. Senior Law Analyst Ben Yelin outlines the FBI's request to expand the reach of National Security Letters. Deputy Director Rick Lipsey explains the mission of the ISAO Standards Organization. New ransomware features disappearing extortion emails. And how do you solve a problem like Pokémon-GO?",
