  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss everything happening around the NFL as training camp has started to heat up. They dive into Baker Mayfield shotgunning a beer at the Indians game this past weekend and proceeding to light things up on the practice field, which has Pat feeling like his Browns to win the Super Bowl pick was correct, discuss Freddie Kitchens and Bob Wylie's dust up with each other, and why all these things contribute to a different mentality for the Cleveland Browns. They also chat about Hard Knocks, which premieres tonight and how they're excited for Gruden and AB to be highlighted a bit, and they discuss Andrew Luck's bum calf which has Colts fans everywhere very concerned. Pat also covers some of the things that he watched this weekend, including trying to finish the new Avengers movie, and he has some recommendations for next years Hall of Fame speeches after watching all seven hours of them over the weekend. Pat also chats about going to his 5th Indiana State Fair with Sam, and covers everything they did, all the different foods available, what some of his favorite carnival games are (and some of the ones he despises the most), and tells the hilarious story about the caricature that he and Sam got of themselves and the artists interesting and aggressive decision for the final product. Lastly, Pat teases the big news which should be revealed in 48 hours or less that is certain to ramp things up even more this fall. It's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
