  "description": "Today we talk about figuring out what your style is and how to discover what works best for you. If you think about design as making choices that are super authentic to who you are, then we’re going to be able to tell your story for you, and you’re also going to be a part of that story telling. We discuss traditional design and the role it plays in understanding where design originates, which can often be the basis of your individual style. We then go over transitional style and how this can blur the lines between the traditional and modern, providing an awesome opportunity to blend multiple styles and giving you that unique look that shows your personality. We discuss the difference between modern and contemporary styles, modern being that 1950’s look and contemporary being something that’s looking toward the future. Sue tells what her style is, what works for her, and why she loves what she does, and then Jess explains hers as well. <br /><br />Traditional design 6:16<br />Transitional style 10:00<br />Contemporary versus modern 19:45<br />Jess’s style 31:15<br />Learn about traditional design 37:21<br /><br />“You guys have instincts. You know what you love when you see it. You know what you love when you smell it. You know what you don’t love when you see it.” 35:20<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW</a>",
