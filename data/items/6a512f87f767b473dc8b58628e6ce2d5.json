    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, Matthias Felleisen demonstrates the benefits of the Racket programming language. \n\nFull Presentation Description:\n\nRacket, a functional language in the Lisp family, promotes a language-oriented style of programming. Developers create many domain-specific languages, write programs in those, and compose these programs via Racket code. This style of programming can work only if creating and composing little languages is simple and effective. This talk will demonstrate how Racket achieves this goal, starting from bare-bones functional code and moving through a range of examples from classical research (Algol '60) to modern end-point programming for the Web.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
