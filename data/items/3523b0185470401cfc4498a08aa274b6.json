  "description": "On this special bonus episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Adam Hambrick is the guest. The country singer-songwriter is a Capitol Records artist who has written songs for artists like Dan + Shay, Justin Moore, Lindsay Ell, the Eli Young Band and others. In 2019, his solo single \"Rockin' All Night Long\" hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. His latest EP, Give Her a Rose, was released in December 2020. On the show, Adam and Fred talk songwriting, Nashville, Elvis Presley, whiskey, cellphones and plenty more.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nAngel's Envy Finished in Tawny Port Casks (21:16)\nOld Forester Rye (22:49)\nKentucky Owl 11 Year Rye (22:49)\nMichter's 20 Year (38:09)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and Adam touch on a number of points, such as:\nFred starts the show by noting this bonus interview with Adam Hambrick happened in person, pre-Covid.\nAdam talks about the writing of the Lindsay Ell hit, \"I Don't Love You,\" which he co-wrote, and how he got into writing songs.\nAdam talks about singing and how he's been singing since age 3, followed by his shift into songwriting - and then back into being a recording artist.\nAdam says it's \"the Wild West\" in terms of putting out music in modern times.\nAdam's impression of Will Ferrell impersonating Harry Caray is a highlight at around the 17:36 mark.\nHambrick says he's a slow sipper and details his relationship with whiskey. Fred then breaks down Adam's palate by asking his food and flavor preferences. The verdict: Sweet tooth - but not too\nAdam: \"I'm sneaky old. I've got two kids at home and a mortgage.\"\nAdam explains how songwriters do what they do and tells Fred he essentially does something similar with his whiskey and bourbon writing.\nThey talk about how modern phones have become a constant distraction and shortened our attention spans, changing how we think and how we process information. Adam admits this knowledge has given him a \"healthy disdain\" for his phone.\nFred notes that he is in the \"eyeballs\" business - attracting people's eyes - while Adam is in the \"earballs\" business, drawing chuckle from the songwriter.\nOf the Michter's 20-year-old bourbon, Adam says, \"Oh my goodness. Holy cow.\" That about sums it up.\nThey talk \"special occasion\" whiskeys. Fred says, \"You know what's a special occasion to me? Waking up in the morning.\"\nOn the way out, Fred and Adam decide to \"solve some world problems.\" At that point, the conversation turns back to how cell phones have taken over our world. Adam notes that positive reinforcement on social media offers a hit of dopamine, which makes it a literal addiction. But then they talk about bologna sandwiches and mayonnaise.\n\nQUOTABLES\n\nAsked if he considers himself more singer or songwriter, Adam responds, \"It's kind of all one river. When I'm writing songs, I'm always writing for myself in some way. And sometimes those songs don't fit the project, they don't fit what you're going to put out, so you just leave it open-handed and, like, if this fits for somebody else, by all means please record it.\"\n\nRESOURCES\n\nhttps://www.adamhambrick.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/adamhambrick\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/adamhambrick\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/adamhambrickmusic/\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nDistillery 291: https://distillery291.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
