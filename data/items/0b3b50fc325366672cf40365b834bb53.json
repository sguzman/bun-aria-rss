And a mother raises a quarter of a million dollars based on a horrific story of her son being bullied. The only problem is that the story doesn’t seem to be true. When will people stop falling for these scams? And in our Daily Cancellation, the Left is justifying child drag shows by comparing them to 90s cross dressing comedies like Mrs. Doubtfire. But this argument actually undermines and destroys their own premise. I’ll explain why. \n\nJoin us for Backstage Live At The Ryman on June 29th.
