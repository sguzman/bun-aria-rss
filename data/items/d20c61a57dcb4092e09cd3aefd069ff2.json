  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, September 11th was a time where America saw great heroes and great leaders emerge during a tragedy resulting from an enemy strike. Regrettably, that very same enemy is back. Leaders like Mayor Giuliani are now being destroyed by the left, the police that were lauded as heroes are now met with calls to defund them. This program will always honor their dedication and sacrifice. President Biden is a president to be despised and should hide his face. Young soldiers and experienced officers have sacrificed for 20 years only for Biden to come and reverse their efforts. Later, the time has come to reclaim what is ours. If we close our eyes and ears we will lose this struggle and will define us as they wish. The American Marxist live off of the sweat and toil of others and hate America and its founding. Afterward, Debra Burlingame, the sister of American Airlines pilot Chip Burlingame, calls the show to express her sentiments on 9/11 and recent developments. Burlingame reiterated how ruthless the Taliban was and is and how their radicalism stems from Islamist extremism dating back to the 7th Century. In their view, this is a holy war. Finally, Anthony Fauci fails to make the case for how natural immunity stacks up against the vaccines. While Jen Psaki similarly can't articulate why American citizens working for companies with 100 employees or more are required to be vaccinated but employees of smaller companies are not. Why is OSHA now involved in medical decisions? And if it is an emergency, why aren't migrants crossing the border into the US is mandated to take the vaccine?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
