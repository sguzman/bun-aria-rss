  "description": "Tired of politics? I grew tired of campaign commercials, especially once Mitt Romney identified Pennsylvania (where I live) as a battleground state. Now that the ad wars have ended and the ballots have been counted, I am really interested in understanding what has happened to modern American conservatism. That is why I had Patrick Allitt on to discuss his new book, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History (Yale University Press, 2010).\n\nProfessor Allitt traces the evolution of American conservatism from its Federalist roots up through the George W. Bush administration. Accessible and written in a lively style, this is a fine book that deserves a wide reading.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
