  "title": "ICYMI: Edward Norton’s theory of mind, movies, and power",
  "description": "Due to a technical glitch this interview with Edward Norton did not find it’s way into most people’s feeds.  If you were able to download the first one this is indeed the exact same interview, but if you missed it please give a listen and enjoy - we had a lot of fun with this one.\nYou’ve heard of Edward Norton. He’s starred in critically acclaimed films like American History X, Fight Club, and Birdman, been nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and, most recently, wrote, directed, and starred in Motherless Brooklyn, a film about a detective with Tourette’s syndrome who ends up taking on the most corrupt and powerful forces in New York City politics.\nMotherless Brooklyn, as it happens, is one of my all-time favorite books.\nAnd so this conversation was an unexpected pleasure. In addition to a joint love of Motherless Brooklyn, Norton and I share an unusual number of interests: Meditation, the uncontrollable nature of the mind, the difficulty of solving problems by thinking about them, the psychology of power, media analytics, cultural ideas of heroism, thwarted masculinity in politics, Ralph Nader, and more.\nIt’s rare that I think a conversation could’ve gone for hours more. But it’s true for this one.\nReferences:\nMotherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem\nThis Could Be Our Future by Yancey Strickler\nCatching the Big Fish by David Lynch \n *The world according to Ralph Nader* \nBook recommendations:\nBarbarian Days by William Finnegan \nWind, Sand, and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\nBuddhism without Beliefs by Stephen Batchelor\nIf you like this episode, check out:\nWhat Buddhism got right about the human brain\nYou will love this conversation with Jaron Lanier, but I can’t describe it\n\n\nMy book is available for pre-order!
