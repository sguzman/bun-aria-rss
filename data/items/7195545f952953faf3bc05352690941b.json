  "description": "<p>Alan Brochstein, a friend of the podcast and now a 3peat guest, is the founder of 420 Investor and  New Cannabis Ventures. We talk uplisting - which doesn't require full legalization - and why the longer legalization takes the better for cannabis companies. The need for education and separating Canadian players from those in the US. Alan's thoughts on [[MSOS]], volume and valuation issues and confronting the California cannabis landscape, including The Parent Company and Glass House. Why there's no winner take all in U.S. cannabis until federal legalization. (We apologize for a less than stellar audio experience but do have a transcript available: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4450076-alan-brochstein-the-longer-legislation-takes-the-better-for-cannabis-companies-podcast-transcript\">https://seekingalpha.com/article/4450076-alan-brochstein-the-longer-legislation-takes-the-better-for-cannabis-companies-podcast-transcript</a>)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
