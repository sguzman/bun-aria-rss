  "description": "<div>My guest in the Book Club podcast this week is my namesake (but no relation) William Leith – whose new book <em>The Cut That Wouldn't Heal: Finding My Father </em>describes the death of his father and the way it caused him to revisit and re-evaluate his childhood. We talk about the perils and possibilities of autobiography, the difficulty of looking death in the face, and an awkward moment with Karl Ove Knausgaard.  </div>\n",
