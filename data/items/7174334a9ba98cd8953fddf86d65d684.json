  "description": "Chris Mayer, author of  and fan-favorite guest, is back. Last time Chris was on the podcast, he recommended Texas Pacific Land (TPL)... which is now up over 150% for  members. [0:30] Today, he returns to the show to discuss recent winners, current market conditions, and small-cap opportunities. [2:25] As markets near all-time highs and inflation ramps up, listen to how Chris still finds great ideas. [4:00] Turning to emerging markets, Chris explains why overseas companies tend to be cheap compared to U.S. stocks—and whether it makes sense to invest across the border. [7:00]  Next, Chris highlights the research that went into his book… and the 3 characteristics of companies that become 100-baggers. [12:45] We discuss the changes we've seen in the markets during our careers… the importance of balancing growth with profits... and the rise of passive investing. [24:00] Chris also shares his favorite way to gain exposure to the exciting crypto space… [27:00]  And of course, he names a few stocks he likes right now. [31:30] Finally, I explain why Luke Downey is the Michael Jordan of options trading… why I’m incredibly proud of his new options advisory, … and how he makes the strategy easy for anyone to understand—and follow.
