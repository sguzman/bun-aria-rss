  "description": "<p>In this episode, Middlekauff puts the SEC's total dominance in the Draft into perspective, why it will only continue to separate, and why declining or exercising the 5th-year option is ultimate judge of a team's draft class. He also looks at Cam Newton's future is more uncertain ever as teams fill QB slots, and why it's only a matter of time before Nick Foles starts over Mitchell Trubisky, and answers questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
