  "description": "Valerie Brown grew up in poverty in Brooklyn, New York. When she was a teenager, her mother passed away and her father left her to fend for herself. Valerie was forced to become an adult before anyone should have to. She put herself through school, becoming a successful lawyer and lobbyist before realizing that she had been running away from something her whole life. She had been trying to escape her past. Even with all of her success and overcoming hardships, Valerie still found herself unhappy and unfulfilled. That’s when she found mindfulness and meditation. With a new clarity in life, she no longer felt the need to run away because she could now happily live in the present. Valerie is now a leadership coach, educator and retreat leader, helping those in need of clarity in their lives. Though she loves to help everyone, Valerie focuses on people of color who face adversity.\nPlug Zone\nWebsite: www.leadsmartcoaching.com\nBooks: www.amazon.com/Valerie-Brown/e/B00MDBD72M\nEl Camino de Santiago in Spain Pilgrimage: https://www.leadsmartcoaching.com/services/pilgrimage-art-sacred-travel/\nTen Percent Happier Plugs\nPodcast show-notes: www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/valerie-brown-228\nPodcast Survey: www.tenpercent.com/survey\nEvent with Dan at New York Press Club: https://www.nypressclub.org/in-conversation-with-10-happiers-dan-harris-on-march-4-2020/\nTen Percent Happier Podcast Insiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
