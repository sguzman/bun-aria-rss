  "title": "263: The Buddha's Four-Part Strategy for \"Ultimate Happiness\" | Sally Armstrong",
  "description": "\"Mindfulness\" has become a buzz phrase. There are books on mindful parenting, mindful lawyering, even mindful sex. But what does the word even mean? And how do you actually do it? In one of his most famous and foundational discourses, the Buddha was said to have laid out, in great detail, four ways to establish mindfulness. In today's episode we’re going to walk through these four \"foundations\" of mindfulness with Sally Armstrong, who started practicing in 1981, began teaching 15 years later, and now leads retreats all over the world. Before we start, I should note that we recorded this interview shortly before the pandemic and the racial justice protests, but we thought it might be a good time to drop a good, old-fashioned, meat and potatoes, stick to your ribs dharma episode to help us get back to basics. \nWhere to find Sally online: \nSpirit Rock Profile: https://www.spiritrock.org/sally-armstrong\nSally Armstrong on Dharmaseed.org: https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/153/\nYou can find meditations from our world-class teachers and much more on our app. Visit tenpercent.com to download the Ten Percent Happier app and kickstart your meditation practice.
