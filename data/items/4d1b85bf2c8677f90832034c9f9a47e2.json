  "description": "<p>On today's show, standup comedy legend, Margaret Cho, joins the crew live in studio for 30 minutes of pure hilarity. She gives her thoughts on Robert Kraft, what it was like working with Will Smith on \"Bright,\" her thoughts on Nicolas Cage from their time on set together while filming \"Face/Off,\" and gives a little sneak peek of her set (3:27-35:28). The guys also cover the potential Cartel tunnel system from LA to Mexico, Gorms tells a few stories about his time working at the popular nightclub, Tatou, in Los Angeles, dive into what they think the witness protection system is like for famous people, and Pat gives a documentary recommendation as the guys discuss \"Operation Odessa,\" dealing with a man trying to sell a Cold War era Soviet submarine to the Cartel in order to smuggle drugs into the United States. The guys also discuss their preference on binging TV shows as opposed to watching them every week, and they look ahead to the final two Game of Thrones episodes. As always, the guys close out the show with another edition of Friday Bangerz to help propel you into the weekend. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas</p>\n",
