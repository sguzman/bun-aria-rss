We sit down with Shane and talk about his journey and what brought him to the lifestyle he currently lives. We talk about everything from gun violence, sustainable living, clown school, modeling and Dolly Parton. What did Shane see when growing up that inspired him to be more active in the communities around him? How does he see where we all enter into the conversation that Jesus started?\n\nWe intro and outro this episode with reflections on Shane's reflections. Reflecting on reflections. Tim shares a new song at the end called 'Misfit Tribe,' a song he hasn't released yet that plays on some of these themes.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
