  "description": "When Bloomberg’s Matt Levine sent an enticing email about “a big thing coming out about crypto in Businessweek,” Recode’s Peter Kafka couldn’t resist. Turns out, the “big thing” is a 40,000(!) word piece that took over the entire magazine, titled “The Crypto Story.\" Levine explains why he wrote a 40,000(!) word piece about cryptocurrency, which he thinks is fascinating even if the boom has turned to a bust. Plus some bonus thoughts on the end (?) of the Elon Musk Buys Twitter Saga, and What It All Means.\nAnd then, Ankler Media CEO Janice Min talks about Hollywood's favorite thing to read about: Hollywood. In 2021, Min joined Richard Rushfield to expand his Substack newsletter into a full-on media business. Min talks about how running Ankler differs from running The Hollywood Reporter, and what happens when two media journalists hit up Y Combinator for seed capital. Plus, Min reflects on the heyday of the iconic celebrity news magazine Us Weekly, where her role as editor-in-chief meant she was a celebrity who didn’t plan on becoming a celebrity.\n\n﻿Featuring: Matt Levine (@matt_levine), Reporter for Bloomberg\nJanice Min (@janicemin), CEO of Ankler Media\nHost: Peter Kafka (@pkafka), Senior Editor at Recode\nMore to explore: Subscribe for free to Recode Media, Peter Kafka, one of the media industry's most acclaimed reporters, talks to business titans, journalists, comedians, and more to get their take on today's media landscape.\nAbout Recode by Vox: Recode by Vox helps you understand how tech is changing the world — and changing us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
