  "title": "88 - Aokigahara: Japan's Suicide Forest",
  "description": "<p>An alarming number of Japanese citizens have taken a dark pilgrimage to the Aokigahara forest, more commonly known as Japan’s suicide forest, to end their lives, most commonly by hanging themselves from some of the forest's tree branches. Why? Why here? Why is a small patch of serene forest the second most popular suicide destination in the world, thought to trail only the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco? We’re gonna break down Japan’s suicide dilemma, both within the suicide forest and outside of it - it has one of the highest suicide rates of any country in the world, and look into all sorts of explanations, including some terrifying Japanese paranormal legends, today, on Timesuck .</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you be <strong>Leesa!</strong> Get $160 off when you go to <a href=\"http://Leesa.com/timesuck\">Leesa.com/timesuck</a></p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to by <strong>Hims!</strong> Get everything you need to keep your hair for just $5 while supplies last.
