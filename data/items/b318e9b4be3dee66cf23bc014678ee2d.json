  "description": "<p>Part 3 - Freedom from Othering: Undoing the Myths that Imprison Us (2018-01-31) - A primary source of our suffering is the conditioning to create “bad other,” or “inferior other.” This same conditioning leads us to creating a bad self and turn on ourselves. These three talks explore how we subscribe to societal myths and beliefs that perpetuate this “bad othering,” and “bad selfing.” They then guide us in bring a healing attention that can reveal the goodness that lives through all beings, and our innate connectedness. A core teaching is, “the boundary to who we include in our hearts is the boundary to our freedom.”</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
