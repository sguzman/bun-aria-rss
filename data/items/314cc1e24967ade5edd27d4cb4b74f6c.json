  "description": "Do you remember that band, The Shins? They had a popular song that appeared on the soundtrack for that Zach Braff movie Garden State. Anyway, they also had a song called “Caring is Creepy.” I always thought that was kinda funny. In this episode, however, we’re going to establish that not only is caring not creepy, it’s also not — as many people fear— a sign of weakness. Caring, or having compassion, for other people— or for yourself— is a baller move. It takes courage, and it gives you courage. Particularly during this dumpster fire of a presidential election.\nThis is part two of our special “election sanity” series. The series is built around a classic Buddhist list, called the Four Brahma Viharas. These are four allegedly heavenly states of mind. Don’t worry about the seeming grandiosity; it’s all, as I said last week, very down to earth. You can think of these four mind states as mental skills that are powerful correctives against the vitriol that characterizes the modern political scene. Last week, we talked about the first Brahma Vihara, called metta, or loving kindness— or, as I prefer, friendliness. This week, it’s compassion.\nMy guest is the Rev. angel Kyodo williams. She’s the second black woman to be recognized as a teacher in the Japanese Zen lineage and author of such books as Radical Dharma and Being Black. \nWhere to find Rev. angel Kyodo williams online: \nWebsite: https://angelkyodowilliams.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zenchangeangel \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/zenchangeangel \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zenchangeangel/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ZenChangeAngel \nTo help you get the most out of this series, we're launching an email guide.\nIt will recap all of the podcast episodes each week.
