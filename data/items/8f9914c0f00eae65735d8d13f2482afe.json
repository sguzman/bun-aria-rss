But most people don’t realize what kind of impact many of the foods they eat are having on their blood sugar—and subsequently their entire body. The symptoms of blood sugar imbalances are everyday occurrences for most people. Feeling hungry even when you just ate, craving sweets, and dealing with acne, hormonal imbalances, and signs of aging, like wrinkles, are just a few of the many symptoms of blood sugar swings. When these continue to go unchecked, more severe dysfunctions can occur, like type 2 diabetes, infertility, fatty liver disease, and dementia.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Ben Bikman, Dhru Purohit, and Dr. Ronesh Sinha about how common dietary patterns like eating simple carbs throughout the day create constant insulin spikes leading to insulin resistance, which in turn contributes to many diseases and aging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Ben Bikman is a renowned metabolic research scientist and a popular speaker on human metabolism and nutrition. Backed by years of research, Dr. Bikman’s mission is to help the world appreciate the prevalence and relevance of insulin resistance. He is the author of the book <em>Why We Get Sick</em>, which offers a thought-provoking yet real solution to insulin resistance and reversing prediabetes, improving brain function, shedding fat, and preventing diabetes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, <em>The Dhru Purohit Podcast</em>, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads. His interviews focus on the inner workings of the brain and the body and feature the brightest minds in wellness, medicine, and mindset.</p><br><p>Dr. Ronesh Sinha, author of <em>The South Asian Health Solution</em>, is an internal medicine physician who runs a lifestyle clinic in Silicon Valley focused on reversing insulin resistance in ethnically diverse patients. He is also an expert in corporate wellness and serves as the Chief Medical Officer for the Silicon Valley Employer Forum, where he serves as a global advisor to shape health benefits for over 55 major Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Paleovalley is offering my listeners 15% off their entire first order.
