  "description": "In this episode, we talk about “The icing on the cake\" (as Jess would call it) a.k.a finish work and moulding. Finish work is baseboards, casing around your windows–it’s the paneling that people love and adore in your homes. We go over different styles you’ll find in various homes or buildings, such as coffered ceilings found often in libraries, or shiplap. You can also see various examples of finished work on our portfolio, such as Tiger Oak, House of Kennedy, etc. Another type of finish work we discuss is chair rail, which if done correctly can look great, but there are other styles that will create a look far from what we want if not done right.<br /><br />Something that is often missed 3:45<br />Shiplap 8:05<br />Rules of where to start/stop 10:44<br />Chair Rail 13:11<br />Pro tip 21:28<br />Crown Mouldings 24:59<br />Styles 30:02<br /><br />“I would say libraries, oftentimes you’ll see the coffered ceiling, which is also the work of a finish worker. They’ll create those boxed beams, and do that tic tac toe pattern that you guys have seen before on the ceiling and it’s got a lot of depth. Maybe it’s like 8-10 inches, even a foot deep coming down from the ceiling. That’s finish work.” 7:05<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
