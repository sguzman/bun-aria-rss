  "description": "<p>Leona Kinsey disappeared from La Grande, Oregon, on October 25, 1999. A friend last saw Leona at a local Walmart. According to her friend, Leona said she planned to meet a man at a nearby grocery store and then stop by her friend's house around 7 PM that night. Leona never showed up at her friend's house and was never seen again. In Part 1, we discussed the circumstances surrounding Leona's disappearance and how those close to her began pointing fingers at others. In the beginning, investigators had many people to look at, but later they began to focus on one man. The more they learned about this man, the more they began to believe he might be the one who made Leona disappear.</p><p>If you have any information about Leona Kinsey's disappearance, please call the La Grande Police Department at (541) 963-1017.
