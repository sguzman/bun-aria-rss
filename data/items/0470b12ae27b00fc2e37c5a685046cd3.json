Get his book.\nDoctors work in life-and-death situations every day. But what happens when they encounter something even they can’t explain scientifically?\nDreams foretelling future events, apparitions, and other miraculous experiences fill this book, as practicing doctors recount the most unusual moments of their careers.\nMeant to awe, instruct, and inspire, these tales will convince even the harshest skeptic that there are things beyond this physical world and that sometimes, all we need to do is believe.\nPhysicians’ Untold Stories doesn’t stop at chronicling these occurrences. Scott J. Kolbaba, MD, provides a glimpse into the lives of doctors that few get to experience. Learn their agonies and joys. In their own words, doctors reach out to you and show you how faith in the divine has shaped their lives. Even in the darkest of times, as they comfort terminally ill patients and make impossible choices, moments of light shine through. \nLike the popular Chicken Soup for the Soul series, Kolbaba has catalogued inspiration moments into small stories perfect for bite-size reading—or maybe for gobbling up all at once!\n\nEnjoy the AD-FREE versions of our latest episodes and our archives right now from anywhere in the world.\n\nPre-order Kim's new book 'Say This, Not That: When Someone You Know Is Grieving on Amazon\nFollow Kim's Page on Facebook\n\nDo you enjoy paranormal episodes?
