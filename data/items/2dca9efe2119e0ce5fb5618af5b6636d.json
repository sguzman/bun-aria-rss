  "title": "Alice M. Kelly, \"Decolonising the Conrad Canon\" (Liverpool UP, 2022)",
  "description": "With the pressing work of decolonising our reading lists gaining traction in UK higher educational contexts, Decolonising the Conrad Canon (Liverpool UP, 2022) shows how those author-Gods most associated with the colonial literary canon can also be retooled through decolonial, queer, feminist readings. This book finds pockets of powerful anti-colonial resistance and queer dissonance in Joseph Conrad's lesser-known works - breathing spaces from the colonial rhetoric that dominates his novels - and traces the female characters who voice them off the page and into their transmedia (digital/illustrative/cinematic) afterlives. From Immada and Edith's queer gaze in The Rescue and the periodical illustrations that accompanied its initial serialization, to Aïssa's sustained critique of imperialism in An Outcast of the Islands and her portrayal on mass-market paperback book covers, to the structural female bonds of Almayer's Folly and Nina's embodiment in Chantal Akerman's adaptation La Folie Almayer, this book centres Conrad's female characters as viable, meaning-making citizens of the canon. Through this intervention, Decolonising the Conrad Canon proposes an innovative model for teaching, reading and studying not just Joseph Conrad's work but the colonial literary canon more broadly.\nDr. Alice Kelly is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
