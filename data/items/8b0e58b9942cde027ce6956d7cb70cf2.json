So busy that you don't &nbsp;notice that \"enjoyably in demand\" has turned into \"totally overwhelmed and frazzled?\" As artists, it's often a challenge to ask for help - partly because some of our work HAS to be done by us, and partly because we can't accept that anyone could do things as well as we do!</p>\n<p>If you feel like you don't have enough time to get everything done, you're not alone. We ask if systems and tools can help you plan your time, how being honest with your choices makes all the difference, and when it is really time to delegate tasks. (And if it IS time, how on earth do you decide which ones and who to trust?!) We also discuss overwhelm in the context of preparing for exhibitions - we have some ideas of how to display unfinished work and wonder if perhaps someone will fall in love with the raw unfinished state of a work in progress.
