  "title": "What was the best thing we cooked this year?",
  "description": "It’s that old, familiar season, and we’re not just talking about eggnog, we’re talking about the season of “Best Of” lists. Here at BA, we’ve got plenty of best recipe round-ups in the pipeline, but those lists only tell half the story. In our eyes, the best recipes aren’t always the ones that “break the internet” (though sometimes they are—we’re looking at you Caramel Apple Cookies). They’re the ones that surprised us, taught us something new, or became our back-pocket go-tos week after week and month after month. This week, Amanda is joined by senior cooking editor Sarah Jampel and Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco to talk about which of this year’s recipes have stuck with them most. The result is a Best Of list that’s a bit less objective, a lot more opinionated, but still extremely delicious. Then, associate food editor Kendra Vaculin is back to talk about her favorite holiday recipes for kids.\nStuff we talk about in this episode: \n\n\nBA's official Top Ten Recipes List of 2021: https://bonappetit.com/gallery/most-popular-recipes-2021\n\n\nRoxanna Jullapat’s Granola Scones recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/granola-scones\n\n\nBon Appétit on Roxanna Jullapat’s Book, Mother Grains: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/mother-grains-roxana-jullapat\n\n\nShilpa Uskokovic’s Air Fryer Chile-Honey-Glazed Fries recipe : https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chile-honey-glazed-fries\n\n\nHetty McKinnon’s Pea and Ricotta Potstickers With Homemade Dumpling Wrappers recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pea-and-ricotta-potstickers\n\nDumpling Articles from Hetty McKinnon: \n\n\nHow to Fold Dumplings For Novices and Experts with Hetty McKinnon: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dumpling-folding-guide\n\n\nThe Many Ways to Cook Dumplings, Explained: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dumpling-cooking-methods\n\n\nHetty’s 12 Tips for Homemade Dumplings : https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dumpling-making-tips\n\n\nHetty McKinnon’s article on the dumpling dowel: https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dumpling-dowel\n\n\nKelly Janke’s Salted Caramel Apple Cookies recipe : https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salted-caramel-apple-cookies\n\n\nRachel Gurjar’s Yogurt-Marinated Mushrooms With Flatbread recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/yogurt-marinated-mushrooms-with-flatbread\n\n\nAndy Baraghani’s Za’atar Chicken Cutlets With Cabbage Salad recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/zaatar-chicken-cutlets-with-cabbage-salad\n\n\nAsha Loupy’s Cheesy Tomato Hand Pies recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cheesy-tomato-hand-pies\n\n\nRed Jacket Orchards (Sarah’s Choice Apple Cider) website: https://redjacketorchards.com/\n\nKendra Vaculin’s Recipes for Cooking with Kids\n\n\nCandy Cane Ice Cream in a Bag : https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/candy-cane-ice-cream-in-a-bag\n\n\nSohla El-Waylly’s Salty-Sweet Party Mix: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-and-savory-miso-party-mix\n\n\nBA Party Mix: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ba-party-mix\n\n\nSplatter Paint Sugar Cookies: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spatter-paint-sugar-cookies\n\n\nLooking for merch for the food people in your life?
