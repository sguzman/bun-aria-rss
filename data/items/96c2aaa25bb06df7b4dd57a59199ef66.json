  "description": "<p>Boston is one of the oldest cities in America and full of history. One center of this history is the Boston Common, which is considered America's oldest park. The Common has been around for well over 350 years and has been witness to some of the most important moments in American history from public hangings to wars to victories to protests to public mourning and so much more. Nearly every war since the city was established has had a connection to this central heart of Boston. So much emotion is wrapped up here, it's not surprising that strange experiences are reported all over the Common. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Boston Common. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Robert Kruse and features The Green Mist of Chino Hills and This Month in History features the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender.</p> <p>Our sponsors for this episode include:</p> <p>Smile Brilliant, use this code for 30% off: https://www.smilebrilliant.com/?coupon=bump#podcast</p> <p>Laura Ruby's book \"Thirteen Doorways, Wolves Behind Them All.\" The audiobook is deeply discounted through May 2021 at your favorite digital audiobook retailer and get the paperback from Balzer + Bray wherever you buy books.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2021/05/ep-384-boston-common.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Colonists by Strike Audio<br /> Pilgrims by Strike Audio<br /> It Happened One Night by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
