    "media:description": "This video is intended as a springboard for a series looking at my video game collection for PS2/3/4, Vita and 3DS/DS, focusing on the issues, problems and strategies to be aware of if you're becoming serious about building a collection.\n\nI've had numerous requests over the years from subscribers for me to \"show\" my collection.\nWell, I always felt kind of embarrassed about doing that - in case it might look like \"showing off\". But now I feel I have found the right topic around which to organise showing games  from my collection: to exemplify and analyse the points I want to discuss! ðŸ˜ƒ\n\nBackground music is from the OST for Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Intro\n02:25 Plushie Boguin\n04:00 Tackling the Topic\n05:00 Console Platforms I will cover\n08:45 What/Who is a collector?\n09:25 Investment Collector\n12:00 Gamer Collector\n13:05 Beachcombing\n13:30 Example of a low-value treasure!\n15:00 Gaming Collectibles\n17:20 Collecting by game genre or series\n19:40 Topics for Discussion - Collector Skills\n23:00 FOMO\n23:30 The Bread & Butter of Collecting\n25:15 Collecting = Hard Work\n26:00 Regional differences\n27:50 Strategy Guides\n29:03 wrap-up and good-byes\n\nVarious titles shown in this video are rated M (Mature 17+) by the ESRB.\nMy video is therefore NOT suitable for children as per the COPPA legislation.\n\n#collecting #videogames #collection #collector #collectibles",
