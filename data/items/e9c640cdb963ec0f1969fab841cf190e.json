  "description": "<p>We study global and local geometry of forms on odd symplectic BV\nsupermanifolds, constructed from the total space of the bundle of 1-forms on a\nbase supermanifold. We show that globally 1-forms are an extension of vector\nbundles defined on the base supermanifold. In the holomorphic category, we\nprove that this extension is split if and only if the super Atiyah class of the\nbase supermanifold vanishes. This is equivalent to the existence of a\nholomorphic superconnection: we show how this condition is related to the\ncharacteristic non-split geometry of complex supermanifolds. From a local point\nof view, we prove that the deformed de Rham double complex naturally arises as\na de-quantization of the de Rham/Spencer double complex of the base\nsupermanifold. Following \\v{S}evera, we show that the associated spectral\nsequence yields semidensities on the BV supermanifold, together with their\ndifferential in the form of a super BV Laplacian.\n</p>",
