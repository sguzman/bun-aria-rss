  "description": "<p>Simultaneous Localization &amp; Mapping (SLAM) is the process of building a\nmutual relationship between localization and mapping of the subject in its\nsurrounding environment. With the help of different sensors, various types of\nSLAM systems have developed to deal with the problem of building the\nrelationship between localization and mapping. A limitation in the SLAM process\nis the lack of consideration of dynamic objects in the mapping of the\nenvironment. We propose the Dynamic Object Tracking SLAM (DyOb-SLAM), which is\na Visual SLAM system that can localize and map the surrounding dynamic objects\nin the environment as well as track the dynamic objects in each frame. With the\nhelp of a neural network and a dense optical flow algorithm, dynamic objects\nand static objects in an environment can be differentiated. DyOb-SLAM creates\ntwo separate maps for both static and dynamic contents. For the static\nfeatures, a sparse map is obtained. For the dynamic contents, a trajectory\nglobal map is created as output. As a result, a frame to frame real-time based\ndynamic object tracking system is obtained. With the pose calculation of the\ndynamic objects and camera, DyOb-SLAM can estimate the speed of the dynamic\nobjects with time. The performance of DyOb-SLAM is observed by comparing it\nwith a similar Visual SLAM system, VDO-SLAM and the performance is measured by\ncalculating the camera and object pose errors as well as the object speed\nerror.\n</p>",
