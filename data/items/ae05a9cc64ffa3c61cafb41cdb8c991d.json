She shares her experiences on the films Angry Harvest, To Kill a Priest, Darkness, Europa Europa, and Charlatan. She speaks of her responsibility to the story versus historical accuracy and what she feels the role of the director is. A fascinating conversation with a talented director.</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Darkness, Europa Europa</p> <p> </p>",
