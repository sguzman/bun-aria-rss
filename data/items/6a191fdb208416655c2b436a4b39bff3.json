As we anticipate, each weekend (and every day, really) in November brings with it a new round of discounts on popular, big-ticket items, typically at their lowest prices of the year. Today that includes headphones from Sony, Beats, Jabra, and a deal on refurbished AirPods Max.</p>\n<p>Sony has two great offers on its latest- and last-generation noise-canceling headphones. The frustratingly-named but high-quality WH-1000XM5 (<strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ysb540\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$348</a></strong>, <del>$400</del>) and WH-1000XM4 (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3U85ZTm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>$228</strong></a>, <del>$348</del>) are discounted to match the lowest prices we've tracked for either. Since Sony released the latest WH-1000XM5, it continues to sell the previous generation WH-1000XM4 alongside it. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-come-with-a-new-design-50-price-hike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When we tested</a> the 5 versus the 4, we found it to improve slightly on just about every aspect of the previous gen headphones. They're better for phone calls, a bit lighter, and can charge more quickly. They also cant fold up for storage like the 4. These aren't what we'd call paradigm-shifting leaps, but rather moderate improvements, for the most part. Selling for over $100 less at its current price, the WH-1000XM4 remains a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=sony+wh-1000xm4+review&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS924US924&oq=sony+wh-1000xm4+review&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i20i263i512j0i512l5j69i61.4493j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very well-reviewed</a>, capable set of noise-canceling headphones that we couldn't fault you for picking up instead of the newer WH-1000XM5.</p>\n<p>Apple's AirPods Max are our favorite noise-canceling headphones, though. And if you're comfortable buying refurbished, they're currently on discount for <a href=\"https://fave.co/3fzUogG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>$355</strong></a> (<del>$475</del>) from Woot, shaving off a couple of hundred dollars from the MSRP. Woot's website states that these headphones have no visual scratches or blemishes and come with a 90-day warranty from Woot.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895592#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1895592&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"
