Prof Steve Keen tells Phil Dobbie that we will still be reliant on autocratic regimes for mineral resources, and the world really needs to come together to tackle climate change. Even if that’s a pipedream we at last need a plan for how we manage the world’s resources and ensure we have a reliable source of food and energy, without kowtowing to despotic regimes.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
