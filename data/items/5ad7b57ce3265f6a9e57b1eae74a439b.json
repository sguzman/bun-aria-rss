  "description": "<div>A child has regular conversations with a dead loved one, in the dark.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Here is a preview of the story.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>“I could see him, and he would talk to me.  It really creeped my mom out.  After we moved out of that house and into the house my mother had built, she proceeded to tell me that the name I gave her of the spirit in the old house was our landlord Father's name, who had died before we moved in there.  I never had any actual experiences in our new home, just unsettling vibes from the basement, always feeling like I am being watched.  Well, I moved out at 17 and did not have any more experiences tile my middle son was born.  We lived in Pennsylvania, right off Lake Erie.  My middle son came crying out of his room, saying he saw creatures in his room.  Well, I blew it off and climbed into bed with him to calm him down, then suddenly I hear growling come from under his bed.”<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Follow Tony:<br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski\">HTTP://www.instagram.com/tonybrueski</a><br>\nTikToc: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski\">https://www.tiktok.com/@tonybrueski</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski\">https://www.facebook.com/tony.brueski<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Watch more at: <a href=\"http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/\">http://www.realghoststoriesonline.com/<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you have a real ghost story or supernatural event to report, please write into our show or call 1-855-853-4802!<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>If you like the show, please help keep us on the air and support the show by becoming an EPP (Extra Podcast Person).
