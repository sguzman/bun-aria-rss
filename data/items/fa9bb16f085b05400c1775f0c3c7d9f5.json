  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Robert Mueller’s investigation is all about the impeachment of President Trump. The Constitutional process of impeachment and how it is separates from criminal prosecution is discussed from Professor Raoul Berger’s book \"Impeachment and Constitutional Problems\". The term \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is broken down by the same British Common Law and history that the Framers used as guidance for the Constitution. Meanwhile, the person pushing hardest to expose Mueller's usurpation of the Constitution is Rep Devin Nunes who is currently being challenged in California. Also, John Kerry is meeting with foreign leaders to try and save the Iran deal. If the Democrats thought the long dead Logan Act should be thrown at Trump officials, then how does Kerry escape its enforcement? Finally, NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been accused of physically abusing four women. In his private life he’s beating and threatening to kill women but in his public light he’s the champion of women.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
