  "title": "PMS 2.0 124 - Adam Amin: A Muslim In A Non Muslim World. Also, Dwight Freeney",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record from Waco, Texas ahead of tonight’s West Virginia vs. Baylor game. They are joined in the box truck by Pat’s Thursday Night Football play-by-play man, one of the most interesting men at ESPN, Adam Amin. They chat about what it was like growing up Muslim in the Chicagoland area, and the impact that 9/11 had on his life, he tells the story about how his father immigrated from Pakistan and had to save money for several years before he could bring the rest of his family over, and he dispels some common misconceptions about being Muslim. They also chat about how things have been going in the Thursday Night booth, what Adam’s dream job would be in terms of calling games, some of the most memorable games he’s called, and he tells a few hilariously stories about his career before he got to ESPN in a very deep and incredible interview (6:36-55:09). Also included is an interview in studio with Super Bowl Champion, 7x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro, member of the NFL 2000s All Decade team, newly minted member of the Colts Ring of Honor, and Pat’s former teammate, Dwight Freeney. They discuss the change of the defensive end position throughout his career and why guys like him made such an impact in their careers, what he thinks of this years Indianapolis Colts team and why he thinks they are built for success, he remembers a few of his better gambling stories while with the Colts, and chats about the NFL trade deadline, and why he doesn’t believe the NFL trade market will explode the way fans want it to (57:55-1:20:36). Don’t forget to send pictures of your Halloween costumes to Pat and the guys using the hashtag <strong>#CoolCostumeCuz </strong>for a chance to win a $500 gift card to <a href=\"http://store.patmcafeeshow.com/\">store.patmcafeeshow.com</a>.
