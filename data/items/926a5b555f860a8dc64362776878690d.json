Dr. Hayes describes the core processes involved in effective change and presents a model that breaks free from diagnoses and protocols. Dr. Hayes shares how he uses principles of process as a parent, leader and ally to underrepresented populations in psychology.

Hayes is Nevada Foundation Professor in the Behavior Analysis program at the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. An author of 44 books (most recently Process-Based CBT: The Science and Core Clinical Competencies of Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (Context Press, 2018)) and nearly 600 scientific articles, he has shown in his research how language and thought leads to human suffering, and has guided the development of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a powerful therapy method that is useful in a wide variety of areas.
