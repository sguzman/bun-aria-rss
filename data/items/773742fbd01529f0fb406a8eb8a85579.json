  "description": "<p>Sam Harris is a neuroscientist creator of a new meditation app which I’ve been using. He is always a great guest on Joe Rogan’s podcast and this conversation is another example of that. Really enjoyed hearing their take on the Jack Dorsey issue. That saga continues lol</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
