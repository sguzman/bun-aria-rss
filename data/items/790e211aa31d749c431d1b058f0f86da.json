  "description": "It's Penny Oleksiak day on Off The Podium as we once again do an episode without a Canadian but somehow talk up Canada more than Australia! We also manage to work out just why Australia is so down on ourselves despite winning medals and wish we were more like Fiji when it came to being humble. Jarrod also puts more athletes on the blacklist for returning home while Ben discovers golf is kind of boring to watch and that rowing has some very confusing categories.",
