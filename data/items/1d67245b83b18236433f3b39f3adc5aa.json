It is 56 km/35 miles north of Potenza at an altitude of 1,326m/4,350 ft, close to borders with Puglia and Campania. Woods surround the area and the top of the slope has more volcanic soils and lower lying vineyards have more mixed, colluvial, and clay soils. The elevations are specified by the DOC – too low or too high and you won’t get great flavor development or quality wine, so the range is 200-700 m/660 -2300 ft. The variety of soils, elevations and exposures mean that there are different styles of Aglianico del Vulture.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Basil5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"301\" /><br /> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: Getty Images</em></span></p> <p><strong>Vulture’s climate…</strong></p> <p>Vulture is continental in climate and it has lower average daily temperatures than Sicily or Tuscany. There are cool breezes that sweep in from the Adriatic, cooling the area and preventing humidity. Elevation also keeps things cooler, especially at night, which means the grapes experience a long growing season, building flavor in the hot sun during the day, and cooling at night to hoard acidity.  The rain shadow of Mount Vulture also keeps the weather cool and dry.  That said, in some years the drought is fierce, grapes can get sunburned, the tannins can be tough, and the wine can be overly alcoholic.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Characteristics of Aglianico del Vulture</strong></p> <p>Aglianico is a thick-skinned grape that needs mineral-rich soils with clay and limestone (like what is on Vulture). It can be overcropped, so careful tending to the grapes leads to better results (this is kind of a dumb thing to say, since that’s the case with all grapes, but I’m putting it out there anyway!).</p> <p> </p> <p>Flavors range in Aglianico del Vulture. Younger wines are high in tannins and acidity, with black cherry, chocolate, flowers, minerals, dark-fruit, and shrubby, forest notes. With a few years (5 or more), you may get nuances of Earl gray tea, black tea, licorice, earth, tar, spice, and violets. The tannins calm with age, but the acidity remains – with age (7-10 years) these wines are pretty impressive. We discuss the fact that there are some lighter styles and some savory, complex ones, but most are minerally with tannin in some form.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Basil6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"400\" /><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo of Aglianico: Getty Images </em></span></p> <p><strong>Aglianico del Vulture</strong> was made a DOC in 1971</p> <ul> <li>It is 520/1,284 acres, and it’s average production is 235,000 cases</li> <li>The wine is red or spumante – all is 100% Aglianico (the sparkling must be made in the Champagne method).
