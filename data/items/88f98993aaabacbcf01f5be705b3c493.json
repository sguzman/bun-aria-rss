  "description": "<p>Do you fear being misunderstood by others? That if you are vulnerable, you’ll lose your strength and ultimately become more lonely? In a #liveauthentic world, it’s tough to decipher what living vulnerably looks like and how to execute that in a healthy way. But sometimes, it’s the questions that you ask, rather than the answers you’re given, that open the door to your peace and steadfastness. In this episode, listen in as Jordan invites on music artist, Amanda Lindsey Cook, as they dive into how rhythms of rest can feel like a crash landing, why social media isn’t necessarily the problem (spoiler: it’s our unconscious behaviors that are), and how to come to a place where your faith isn’t fantasy. Sister, if you’re walking through a season of grief or frustration and you’re ready to put yourself at the mercy of love, peace, patience, and kindness – this episode is for you. Lose the fear of being misunderstood because you’re welcome here.</p>  <p>Pre-order the book:<a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/book\" target=\"_blank\"> jordanleedooley.com/book</a></p> <p>Grab your preorder bonuses! <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies\" target=\"_blank\">jordanleedooley.com/oye-freebies</a></p> <p>Book tour info: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/oye-tour</a></p>  <p>  <p>Say hi on social!</p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jordanleedooley/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p></p>\n",
