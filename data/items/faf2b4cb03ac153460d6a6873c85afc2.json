  "description": "<p><strong>You dared to set a boundary with your parents: you would only communicate with them if they were respectful to you and your family.</strong> This means zero tolerance for name-calling, swearing, threatening, or yelling at you or your husband whenever there's a disagreement. Now they've leveled false accusations against your husband for being abusive, going as far as involving the CEO of your company and the police department! Of course you've cut them off completely since then, but you're wondering: will this be enough to protect your family against them?
