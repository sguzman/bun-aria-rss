Each had his own methods. Speaking broadly, Lenin's Bolshevik approach could be considered top-down, imposed by government and its seized industries, and Mao's \"Marxism-Leninism with Chinese Characteristics\" might be considered bottom-up, a youth rebellion, and inside-out, a cultural revolution ushered in by his radicalized youth. The most infamous Neo-Communist figure of the early 21st century will be Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, who has figured out how to combine these approaches into a top-down, bottom-up, inside-out push. His primary tools: ESG and SEL. Join James Lindsay in this episode of New Discourses Bullets, where he succinctly explains how Schwab's \"stakeholder capitalism\" Is a Leninist-Maoist project to mold a new economy and society in his image using a two-pronged vanguard model and a cultural revolution.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
