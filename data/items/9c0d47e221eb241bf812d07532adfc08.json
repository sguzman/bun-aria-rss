  "description": "Cat hair may be something you brush off, but cat hair is also a slang term that means \"money.\" In the same way, cat beer isn't alcoholic -- some people use cat beer as a joking term for \"milk.\" And imagine walking on a beach with a long stretch of shoreline. With each step, the ground makes a squeaking sound under your feet. There's a term for the kind of sand that makes this yip-yip-yip sound. It's called barking sand. Plus, a listener describes some of the English she heard in a small Alaskan coastal town. It's a rich mixture of fishermen's slang, along with the speech of native people, and the Norwegians who settled there. All that, and a triple-threat puzzle, paternoster lakes, barely vs. nearly, comprised of vs. composed of, cark, kittenball, the pokey, happy as a boardinghouse pup, and close, but no tomato.\n Podcast listeners who donate to A Way with Words make new episodes possible.
