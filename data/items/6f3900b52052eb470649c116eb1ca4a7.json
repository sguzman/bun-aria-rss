  "description": "<p>As many of our U.S. listeners may know, we are in the middle of the famed March Madness college basketball tournament, where some of the best college athletes and coaches have marked their place in sports history. This week we begin a two-part series in which we celebrate one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time, John Wooden, who was a friend and mentor of John Maxwell as well as today’s guest co-host, Don Yaeger.</p> <p>If that name sounds familiar to you, that’s because we’ve had Don on the podcast before. Don is the author of more than 35 books, eleven of which have become New York Times Best-sellers. He has written books with NFL icons like Walter Payton, Warrick Dunn, and Michael Oher, among many others including, you guessed it, John Wooden! Like John Maxwell, Don was mentored by John Wooden over the span of 12 years. Don is a celebrated storyteller, and you certainly don’t want to miss the stories he shares in this series!</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Why John Wooden’s Team Won Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Win and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/UdmrTPPiDrM\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://donyaeger.com/corporate-competitor-podcast/\">Corporate Competitor Podcast</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://donyaeger.com/corporate-competitor-podcast/episode-81/\">Relevant Episode: John Maxwell on the Corporate Competitor Podcast</a></p> <p><a href= \"http://johnmaxwellleadershippodcast.com/episodes/john-maxwell-you-are-worth-it-with-kyle-carpenter\"> Relevant Episode: You Are Worth it With Kyle Carpenter</a><br /> <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Road-J-Y-Leading-Playing/dp/0785291652/ref=sr_1_1?crid=VV6HZPJA4ZCW&keywords=the+road+to+JOY&qid=1647281031&sprefix=c2g+8-in-1+usb+type-c+mini+dock%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-1\"> <em>The Road to JOY</em> by Scott Drew with Don Yaeger</a><br /> <a href=\"https://donyaeger.com/shop/a-game-plan-for-life/\"><em>A Game Plan for Life</em> by John Wooden with Don Yaeger</a></p>",
