In this jam packed THP, friend of the gang Bridget Van Means with Thrive St. Louis Women's Healthcare (thrivestlouis.org) joins the show to talk all things from marketing to kangaroos, we hear from prolific singer-songwriter, Randy Stonehill, and, another call-in from the Hawkin’s dear friend, Dr. Fauci, who gives us the new and improved 7 step vaccine process (find the nearest small cliff next to your home for the last one).
