  "description": "<p>In this episode, Middlekauff thinks the NFL's free agency period feels off in the midst of the unprecedented Coronavirus impact, and why the NFL continuing with free agency in the midst of the panic feels weird. He also runs down Bill O'Brien's GM malpractice with the DeAndre Hopkins trade, his take on the Stefon Diggs, DeForest Buckner trades, other signings on an insanely active off season day 1. He also discusses how the Coronavirus impacts QB's changing teams, why 2020 will make or break Baker Mayfield, and answers listener questions in Middlekauff's Mailbag.
