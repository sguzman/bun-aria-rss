  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, there's another pseudo-event in Washington, DC, with all Democrats and some Republicans running away from President Trump's tweet which said, “All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!” This is the same word that was used by Democrat members of Congress during the Clinton impeachment period; this outrage is selective. Then, career diplomats continue to malign Trump in secret, behind closed doors, affording the President of The United States no due process. In our country, we guarantee due process to terrorists and mass murderers but Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats won't allow Trump the right to defend himself, to confront his accuser, to call a witness, or even to have counsel present during these interviews. The house is not like a grand jury it's more like it has abandoned all precedent for this process and has adopted tyrannical thuggery as its guide in this process. Later, according to the 'secret' testimony of William Taylor that was leaked to the media, it seems that there was an irregular channel of diplomacy set up by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Ukrainian officials. However, the media will only report what serves their own best interest, never in the interest of objective truth. It's the same way they misrepresent polling data on how voters feel about impeachment. Afterward, Kimberly Strassel joins the show to discuss her new book \"Resistance (At All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
