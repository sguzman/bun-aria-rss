  "description": "<p>How do you use light to enhance your memory?</p> <p>As the world becomes increasingly digital, you’re likely spending more time indoors with artificial light. Blue light from screens can interrupt your sleep, focus, and concentration. But can some types of light actually make you stronger or smarter?</p> <p>To go in-depth on this topic, I’m thrilled to welcome Dr. Shelley James on our show today. She’s an international expert on light and well-being, as well as a trained glass artist and electrician. Her TEDx talk, <em data-stringify-type= \"italic\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvIL1p6Z1k\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvIL1p6Z1k\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">How Can Space Station Lighting Help Us Here on Earth?</a></em>, was one of the top three most-watched talks the month it was released.</p> <p>In the same way that sunlight directly affects your biochemistry, artificial light can influence how your body and your brain perform. By understanding how to use light effectively, you can harness some incredibly powerful health benefits. Listen in, as Dr. James talks about how she used light to heal from a traumatic brain injury and how you can use it for greater wellness and mental acuity.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
