I think they&#8217;re simultaneously <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/nfts-are-digital-signaling/\">the future of digital signaling</a> and currently mostly hype. But whatever&#8212;that&#8217;s not what this post is about.</p>\n\n<p>Most NFTs rotate around a piece of collectible art in a baseball card-like format. So you look at something like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and it&#8217;s a bunch of personalized apes with stylization.</p>\n\n<p>So the art is a big piece of it. You still need to hype it, get people to believe in its value, etc. But the art is the starting point, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/03/24-year-old-artist-made-over-300000-dollars-in-10-months-selling-nfts.html\">many artists are finding new life</a> in creating these art collections.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2/\">DALL-E 2</a> for a few weeks now&#8212;which is an AI project from OpenAI that generates customized art based on prompts. I&#8217;ve been telling everyone who&#8217;ll listen about how this is the clearest example we&#8217;ve ever seen of AI cutting into a previously-human domain of creativity. It&#8217;s one thing to do spreadsheets faster, but DALL·E 2 can make you multiple examples of &#8220;A Synthwave Dog Riding a Rocket Skateboard&#8221; in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how this will directly affect human jobs in the artistic space, but I was just jostled awake by an idea of telling DALL·E 2 to make NFT art. Like, <em>specifically</em> NFT art.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<p>So I started with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an nft of an 80&#8217;s giraffe wearing headphones, digital art</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which was decent:</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138012\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138012\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-giraffe-dalle-miessler.png\" alt=\"nft-giraffe-dalle-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"263\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138012\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My first attempt at NFT art using &#8216;digital art&#8217; as a prompt</p></div>\n\n<p class=\"note\">The trick is prompt it with the text you would likely read in the caption describing it.</p>\n\n<p>But within a couple of iterations I got to this:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an nft of a steampunk giraffe wearing headphones, digital art</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler-650x263.png\" alt=\"dalle-2-nft-artwork-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"263\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138006\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At a glance those look identical to high-quality NFT art. Importantly, they&#8217;ve captured the &#8220;NFT-ness&#8221; element to the artwork, which you would have trouble even trying to describe. I&#8217;m guessing it has something to do with the gradient background combined with a type of quasi-reality.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the point is&#8212;that&#8217;s precisely what DALL·E 2 figures out and does effortlessly! It figures out <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/machine-learning-will-capture-the-je-ne-sais-quoi-of-human-existence/\">the Je Ne Sais Quoi of NFT-ness</a>&#8212;whatever that is&#8212;and applies it to content prompt you give it. Let&#8217;s try robots with a similar prompt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an nft of a steampunk robot wearing a turtleneck and an eye patch, digital art</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"note\">The &#8216;digital art&#8217; prompt at the end is key to the realistic look and feel.</p><div class=\"inline-auto-newsletter\"><div class=\"inline-subscribe px-2 pb-8 pt-8 mb-8 border-t border-b\">\n<div class=\"text-lg font-bold\">The UL Newsletter: Finding the Patterns in the Noise…</div>\n<div class=\"text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-lg\">Get a weekly analysis of what's happening in security and tech—<em>and why it matters</em>.</div>\n<div class=\"mt-2\"><form action=\"https://danielmiessler.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292&id=49fdb7d723\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form validate inline\" novalidate > \n            <div>\n            <div class=\"mc-field-group\">\n            <input  placeholder=\"your best email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button text-system\">\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_6a9e465ab1570df8aaecb2292_49fdb7d723\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\"></div>\n            </div>\n            </form></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138014\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138014\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-dalle-robots-miessler.png\" alt=\"nft-dalle-robots-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"264\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138014\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">NFT robots, Attempt 1</p></div>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another pass at something similar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an nft of a steampunk robot with an eye patch, digital art</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138016\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138016\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/nft-dalle-robots2-miessler.png\" alt=\"nft-dalle-robots2-miessler\" width=\"650\" height=\"261\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138016\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Attempt 2 for Robot NFTs</p></div>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not an expert in the space, but I have to think you could crank through a few iterations (I&#8217;ve spent like 6 minutes doing this so far) and come up with some truly stunning results.</p>\n\n<h2>Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>So I think the short version of this is that&#8212;yes&#8212;DALL·E 2 can already generate pretty convincing NFT art. And that feels weird.</p>\n\n<p>You have this moment with NFTs where quirky artists suddenly have a spotlight shown on them. And out of nowhere DALL·E can suddenly&#8212;and casually&#8212;do a lot of what they can do.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=3></div>\n\n<p>Some think we&#8217;re in an AI winter still, but I feel it&#8217;s more like outer space where a piece of metal facing the sun will be super-heated, while the backside is deeply frozen.</p>\n\n<p>GPT-3, DALL·E, and Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent\">Gato</a> represent the sunlight where the theory collides with practicality. Exciting for sure&#8212;but in a scary way.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, if you find any prompts that create even better NFTs, <a NFT rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">let me know</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"note\">\n<li>There&#8217;s one aspect of DALL·E where humans still have an advantage for things like NFT collections, and that&#8217;s in making a full set of related art. The problem with DALL·E is that if you iterate 20 times you&#8217;ll get widely different results, and it won&#8217;t be easy to sell the idea that they&#8217;re part of the same collection.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>"
