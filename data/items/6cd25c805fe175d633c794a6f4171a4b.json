  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden said that America is systemically racist and xenophobic and that Americans are hateful people when speaking of the shooting in Georgia. Biden, the Democrats, and the media have become so pernicious, notice how they ignore the background of the Colorado shooter and the backgrounds of the victims because they don't drive their narrative. Biden shifts gears from race to gun control; if they can't racialize and exploit and tribalize people, they're not interested. All one has to do is look at the mass shootings of African Americans that occur each weekend in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to name a few. Biden has obscured these gun control bills and is in a rush to pass them before anyone can read them because he's taking advantage of inflamed emotions over these horrific recent events. Corporatists have embraced socialism, they sided with the left on free speech and now they're on their own. Later, the media has not explored the fact that the Colorado gunman traveled 20 miles from his home to get to the King Sooper grocery store where he murdered 10 people in the Table Mesa section of Boulder, Co. Given Andy Ngo's reporting, the Colorado shooter, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa supported radical Islamist elements. Was there any significance in the fact that King Sooper's sells Kosher foods and has a Kosher Bakery?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
