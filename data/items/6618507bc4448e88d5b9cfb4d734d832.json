    "media:description": "NOT JUST FOR KIDS?\n\nYou know how it is. You’re a writer or an animator at Pixar, Dreamworks, Disney, ILM, Blue Sky, Weta, Warner Bros, Nickelodeon, Sony, Nippon or any other major animated studio. You’ve been toiling away on your new Toy Story, the next Spirited Away, a future Minions sequel, or the latest Shrek adventure. And someone decides, why not sneak a few adult references into these animated movies? A dirty joke, maybe, or some dark subtext? A double entendre or innuendo? A visual detail that no child would pick up on, though a more mature viewer might pause and say, wait a minute!\n\nFrom the days of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, through Pinocchio, The Jungle Book, Dark Crystal, The Black Cauldron, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Despicable Me, Big Hero 6, Frozen Elsa singalongs and whatever other CGI or hand-drawn cartoon is currently giving young theatre goers joy around the world, the staff behind the scenes have been finding ways to make their movies work on multiple levels. And now, we at Screenrant - or Screen Rant, if you like - are here to gather together every cute, grim and / or bawdy reference we could find - or at least, 20 of them - in one handy video, not in chronological order, well, sort of. Vaguely structured in the order that the adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear came out. But it does leap around a bit. So don’t worry about continuity, is what we’re saying.\n\nOK? OK. To infinity and beyond!\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:38 - Toy Story\n1:43 - Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs\n2:29 - Shrek\n3:16 - How To Train Your Dragon 2\n3:40 - The Lego Batman Movie\n4:16 - Toy Story 2\n5:05 - Emperor’s New Groove\n5:42 - The Rugrats Movie\n6:22 - Coco\n7:18 - Hercules\n8:00 - Despicable Me\n8:46 - Toy Story 3\n9:19 - Robots\n9:56 - Cars\n10:37 - Aladdin\n11:38 - Ratatouille\n12:29 - Monster House\n13:11 - Zootopia\n13:46 - Inside Out\n14:27 - Toy Story 4 \n\nCheck out Screen Rant’s official TikTok! \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@screenrant \n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant  \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/ \n\nOur Website:\nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nWritten by: S Mohamed\nNarrated by: Justin Freitas\nEdited by: Gullivar Du Katt\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",
