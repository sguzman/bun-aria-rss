  "description": "<p><em><strong>Jesus and the Forces of Death</strong></em>. Today Mike and Tim are joined by Suzie P. Lind and Dr. Matthew Thiessen, who is an associate professor of religious studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, to discuss ritual impurity. Heyo! What is ritual impurity? How do ritual impurity and moral impurity differ, or do they? Can we fully appreciate how the Gospel writers communicate Jesus’s significance apart from an accurate understanding of the ways in which first-century Jews constructed their world? Do we often misunderstand the Gospel writers’ depictions of Jesus because we naturally force what we read through our modern lenses and definitions? &nbsp;How do we translate what we read into what we can understand currently? Was Jesus Jewish, but not that Jewish? Do we pick and choose as readers what Jewish aspects we want Jesus to have to support our narrative? Where do corpses and blood fit in?? This one is a wild ride into theologically nerdy territory.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
