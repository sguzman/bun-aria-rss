  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming on three guests on tonight. Mike writes “My encounter happened when I was about 12 years old in 1975. My parents had property in the Pocono mountains in Bushkill Falls, and my mother wanted to go check on the property and decide to go with her. We went and looked at the land because they did not have a house on the land, they just owned it. It was a beautiful fall day around October, the leaves were starting to turn and the air was crisp. As we were heading back about 2:30 in the afternoon, I believe we were on Bushkill Falls Road heading towards route 209- There is very little traffic on this road and Bushkill Falls Road has twists and turns. At one point as we turning to the left to go down the curving road, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was sitting about 6-8 feet in from the edge of the road in the small saplings. And at first I thought someone tossed out a stuffed animal and it was just sitting on the side of the road. But as we pasted it, I saw this thing turn it’s head and watch the wheels go by as it leaned on one arm.   https://sasquatchchronicles.com  </p>",
