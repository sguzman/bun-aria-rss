  "description": "<p>This paper presents Navigation and Rendering Pipeline for Astronautics\n(NaRPA) - a novel ray-tracing-based computer graphics engine to model and\nsimulate light transport for space-borne imaging. NaRPA incorporates lighting\nmodels with attention to atmospheric and shading effects for the synthesis of\nspace-to-space and ground-to-space virtual observations. In addition to image\nrendering, the engine also possesses point cloud, depth, and contour map\ngeneration capabilities to simulate passive and active vision-based sensors and\nto facilitate the designing, testing, or verification of visual navigation\nalgorithms. Physically based rendering capabilities of NaRPA and the efficacy\nof the proposed rendering algorithm are demonstrated using applications in\nrepresentative space-based environments. A key demonstration includes NaRPA as\na tool for generating stereo imagery and application in 3D coordinate\nestimation using triangulation. Another prominent application of NaRPA includes\na novel differentiable rendering approach for image-based attitude estimation\nis proposed to highlight the efficacy of the NaRPA engine for simulating\nvision-based navigation and guidance operations.\n</p>",
