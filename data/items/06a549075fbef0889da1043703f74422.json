  "description": "<p>In Episode 7 of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast, we welcome <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/finance/cfo/leadership/angela-blanton.html\">Angela Blanton,</a> the Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer of the world-renowned Carnegie Mellon University.</p><p>In this engaging interview, Angela shares with us the journey she has taken in becoming the finance leader for an organization with a $1.3 billion operating budget and a mission, not only to prepare the next generation for the challenges ahead, but also to instill in them the responsibility to shape the future. </p><p>She credits the support of having an executive coach (in this case, Heather Marasse) as being crucial to her success in her first C-Suite role. As CFO she took on the leadership of a team of 120 people, over a time period that includes the current pandemic. Her first year in the C-Suite taught her three things:</p><ul><li>To learn and adapt to others’ unique perspectives</li><li>To accept her own strengths and recognize her areas for development</li><li>To learn to ask for help when she needs it </li></ul><p>Angela says, “Coming into this job, I lacked self-confidence and felt more than a little overwhelmed. With Heather’s support, I’ve learned to trust in my abilities as a leader and to trust in my team.  It has really helped us manage through the pandemic and since early March, my team has not skipped a beat.”</p><p>Her coach, Trilogy Effect Managing Partner Heather Marasse says, “Learning to trust is a lesson that’s central to the work we do. When you learn to trust, you understand that people come to work to contribute and make a difference. People don’t need to be ‘fixed’. Instead, leadership is about illuminating potential in yourself and in others.” </p><p>Enjoy this episode and learn: </p><ul><li>How the Enneagram framework provides a lens to discover your gifts & challenges</li><li>How great leadership is an ongoing process of discovery </li><li>How to keep your team motivated even when everyone is working from home </li></ul><h2>Resources:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/how-to-use-the-enneagram-to-become-a-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram to Become A Better Leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/is-your-career-at-a-tipping-point\">Is your career at a tipping point?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-bret-furio-accelerate-business-growth\">How to accelerate business growth</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/what-is-a-leadership-coach\">What is a leadership coach?</a></li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the <i>Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast </i>on iTunes, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
