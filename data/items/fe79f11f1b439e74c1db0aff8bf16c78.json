  "description": "<p>Climate change used to feel like one of those things that was <em>way off</em> in the future. But then we see the headlines of extreme weather, or perhaps you’ve experienced it first-hand, and we realize that it could be more imminent than we used to think. It’s no longer an abstract concept but a concrete reality. And so it is with our perception of Social Security- it used to just be an annoyance that shrunk our paychecks as teenagers. But now as more responsible adults, we’re looking ahead and wondering if Social Security will even be a thing by the time we’re retirement age. And recent reports say that the Social Security fund will be insolvent by 2033?! That’s why today on the show we’re asking- whether or not we can count on Social Security retirement benefits and the additional steps we can start taking now to ensure a comfortable future.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Roosevelt Coffee Stout by Olentangy River Brewing- thanks to Scott for sending this one our way!
