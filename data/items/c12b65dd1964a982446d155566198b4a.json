One of the top safety concerns with Li-ion batteries is thermal runaway and its cascading effect through the whole pack. To predict thermal runaway, it is necessary to account for several different physical phenomena, including chemical reactions within the cell, heat transfer at the cell and pack level, the structural design of the pack, and fluid flow in the battery pack's cooling system.</p><p><span></span>Join us for this live webinar to see how multiphysics simulation can help you accurately model battery cells and packs, predict thermal runaway, and optimize the design of thermal management for battery packs. The webinar will include demonstrations in the COMSOL software and conclude with a Q&A session. </p><p><a href=\"https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3860127/EB6AC3A7FDE6ADC9CD9EB634FADE8F51\" target=\"_blank\">Register today!</a></p>",
