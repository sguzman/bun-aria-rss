  "description": "<p>You probably know Melissa Gilbert best from her time playing Laura Ingalls for nine seasons on the classic NBC television show, &ldquo;Little House On the Prairie.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s done a lot since then &ndash; she&rsquo;s continued to act, tried her hand at directing, served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild, and even briefly ran for Congress. But a dozen or so years ago, she left her native Los Angeles to live with her husband, the actor and director Timothy Busfield, in rural Michigan and eventually ended up settling in a rustic, fixer-upper cottage in the Catskills Mountains. It was a pretty radical lifestyle change for Melissa and it sparked a number of realizations about her old life &ndash; and the way she wants to live now. For this episode of Next Question, she sits down with Katie to talk about this new phase of her life, the challenges &ndash; and rewards &ndash; of growing older, and her new book, &ldquo;Back to the Prairie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
