  "description": "Today on the show, we live in the least racist, least sexist, most tolerant and open minded civilization ever -- so why aren’t liberals happy? Also, Democratic presidential candidates are coming out in favor of reparations for slavery. We'll talk abut why that idea is insane. And we’ll discuss an old theological chestnut: how we can have free will even if God knows what we’re going to do ahead of time? Date: 02-22-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices.
