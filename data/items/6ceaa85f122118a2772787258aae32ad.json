  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, on the anniversary of the 2001 9/11 attacks, America mourns the loss of innocents and first responders who were murdered by foreign enemies. For months America has witnessed how police and law enforcement have been demonized and character-assassinated by enemies from within. Then, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani joins the show to remind listeners of what New York was like on September 11th. Giuliani warned that America must focus on law and order and embrace the police in order to move forward into a safe and healthy future. Later, professional athletes are disrespecting the country with their 'moment of unity' against America. This is the country that broke Hitler, Mussolini, and Yamamoto. Americans are awake and they will not give up because there is not another constitutional republic that upholds a free market system that empowers humanity more than the United States. Afterward, wildfires are consuming western states because they don't properly clear the underbrush. Finally, Congressional candidate Sean Parnell calls in to discuss his crucial race in Pennsylvania.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
