This show was a bit different from the other Spanish learning shows out there: it was a gradual introduction to basic Spanish presented by teacher Mark, teaching student Kara. At this stage no-one really knew if the idea would work, but <em>Coffee Break Spanish</em> grew to become one of the most popular ways to learn Spanish online.
