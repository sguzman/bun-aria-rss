  "description": "<p>Architected 2D lattice materials are appealing for shape-shifting\napplications due to the tunable sign of Poisson's ratio. It is commonly\nbelieved that the positive and negative Poisson's ratios lead to anticlastic\nand synclastic curvatures respectively when the material is bent in one\ndirection. Here, taking 2D beam lattices with star-shaped unit cells as\nexamples, we show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that this is not\nalways true. At a fixed Poisson's ratio, we find a transition between\nanticlastic and synclastic bending curvatures controlled by the beam's\ncross-sectional aspect ratio. Such an unexpected behavior roots in the\ncompetition between torsion and bending of the beams, and can be well captured\nby a Cosserat continuum model.\n</p>",
