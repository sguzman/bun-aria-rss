  "description": "The Prince of Wales College, Achimota School, opened in 1927 north of Accra in the Gold Coast (Ghana). Achimota was to be a ‘model’ school—but a model of what, exactly? And for whom? Shoko Yamada’s book 'Dignity of Labour' for African Leaders: The Formation of Education Policy in the British Colonial Office and Achimota School (Langaa RPCIG, 2018) delves into the multiple discourses and contested politics that resulted in Achimota. Her careful analysis pulls apart the different strands of American and British educational models that influenced Achimota, while also attending to the specificities of Gold Coast politics that shaped the school’s creation. Yamada then tracks how those influences combined, in the context of the 1920s and 1930s Gold Coast, to create an entirely new colonial institution.\nElisa Prosperetti is an Assistant Professor in International History at the National Institute of Education in Singapore. Her research focuses on the connected histories of education and development in postcolonial West Africa. Contact her at here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
