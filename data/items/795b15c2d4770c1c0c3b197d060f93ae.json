  "title": "The Crusades in an Islamic Context",
  "description": "<br><center>narrated by Chris Gratien<div class=\"moiwnames\"> featuring Joshua White, Maryam Patton, Zoe Griffith, and Gary Leiser </div></center> <div class=\"hidden_synopsis\">  | The Crusades loom large in the Western imagination of medieval history and Christendom&#39;s relationship with the Islamic world. But what did these wars of the 11th-13th centuries mean for Muslims at the time?  In this episode, we explore the history of the Crusades and their impact on the Islamic world. While the wars of the Crusades were bloody, they were not necessarily the main event of Islamic history beyond the regions bordering the Crusader states. In the Eastern Mediterranean, these states emerged as sites of both conflict and contact between European Christians and Muslims. In our episode, we go beyond the battlefield to discuss the gendered portrayals of the Crusaders within Islamic sources, and we consider the intellectual implications of access to the Islamicate scholarly tradition offered in the Crusader states. We also discuss the history and memory of Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi or Saladin, whose chivalry and military prowess inspired awe both among Europeans of his day and among Arab nationalists many centuries later during their struggle with Western imperialism.  </div>  <a href=\"https://www.ottomanhistorypodcast.com/2020/11/crusades.html#more\">« Click for More »</a>",
