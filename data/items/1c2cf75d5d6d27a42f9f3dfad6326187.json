  "description": "<p>We reconsider $D\\geq4$ dimensional asymptotically flat eternal Schwarzschild\nblack hole, and focus on the situation where the inner boundary of the\nradiation region is chosen to be near the horizon (i.e. $\\beta\\ll 1$). The\ntension between the near horizon condition and the short-distance approximation\nemerges in large dimensions in previous papers. We remove this tension by\nintroducing a more proper near horizon condition, thus the resulting island\nsolution is well-behaved in any $D\\geq4$ dimensional spacetime. Interestingly,\na novel constraint is obtained in this situation as required by the existence\nof the island solution, which directly leads to the constraints on the size of\nthe Schwarzschild black hole, the position of the inner boundary for the\nradiation region, or the value of $c\\cdot\\tilde{G}_{N}$ in any $D\\geq4$\ndimension. When considering the large $D$ limit, the constraint on the size of\nthe Schwarzschild black hole obtained in this situation is in agreement with\nthe result given in $[Phys.Rev.D 102 (2020) 2, 026016]$. We interpret these as\nthe unitary constraints implied by the presence of island in semiclassical\ngravity.\n</p>",
