  "description": "Today we're talking about using different textures, which is especially interesting in any room where you’re doing furnishings. Something that at times is overused is shiplap which we discuss, as well as using too much of one thing. Many people may not realize that velvet can be dry and so we discuss other textures with dry or wet looks. People used to style their homes with all whites, but now approaching texture is like picking out your outfit. You don’t want to wear a blue shirt with blue jeans, but wear something that will go with those jeans. <br /><br />Is there such a thing as too many textures? 3:44<br />Fabrics 5:15<br />Velvet 9:11<br />Any one texture within an entire space 15:59<br />Rug 17:54<br />Textures feeling more formal 21:01<br /><br />“Be aware that textures can feel more formal. We wanna make sure and not have the room feel cheap by using certain satins or certain velvets that don’t look good. You’ve seen it at Home Goods, you know, in the isle. Those little chairs that have the satiny velvet. It’s too thin and it’s the wrong color, and the legs are usually too long and it just kinda looks like a nervous piece in the room. Yeah, it’s not going to be doing you any favors.” 21:06<br /><br />Grove.co/dearalice<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
