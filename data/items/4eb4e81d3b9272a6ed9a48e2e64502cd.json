  "description": "<p>The counterfactual distribution models the effect of the treatment in the\nuntreated group. While most of the work focuses on the expected values of the\ntreatment effect, one may be interested in the whole counterfactual\ndistribution or other quantities associated to it. Building on the framework of\nBayesian conditional mean embeddings, we propose a Bayesian approach for\nmodeling the counterfactual distribution, which leads to quantifying the\nepistemic uncertainty about the distribution. The framework naturally extends\nto the setting where one observes multiple treatment effects (e.g. an\nintermediate effect after an interim period, and an ultimate treatment effect\nwhich is of main interest) and allows for additionally modelling uncertainty\nabout the relationship of these effects. For such goal, we present three novel\nBayesian methods to estimate the expectation of the ultimate treatment effect,\nwhen only noisy samples of the dependence between intermediate and ultimate\neffects are provided. These methods differ on the source of uncertainty\nconsidered and allow for combining two sources of data. Moreover, we generalize\nthese ideas to the off-policy evaluation framework, which can be seen as an\nextension of the counterfactual estimation problem. We empirically explore the\ncalibration of the algorithms in two different experimental settings which\nrequire data fusion, and illustrate the value of considering the uncertainty\nstemming from the two sources of data.\n</p>",
