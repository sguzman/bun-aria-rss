  "description": "<p>Going to Bible study in the early years of motherhood can feel like an Olympic feat. In our minds, getting everyone ready requires some gymnastics, enough snacks to feed a sumo wrestler, and the ability to marathon your way across a parking lot. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss common struggles that keep moms from being involved in women’s ministry and reasons to get yourself out the door. While podcasts, websites, and books are great gifts of encouragement, God specifically gives the local church to train, equip, and nourish his children. Getting there will be worth it.</p> <ul> <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"http://risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-128-i-just-cant-make-it-to-bible-study-how-busy-moms-get-involved-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-128-i-just-cant-make-it-to-bible-study-how-busy-moms-get-involved\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><img src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/75993/BibleStudy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p>",
