  "description": "<p>By May 23, 2020, Ian Eckles had not been seen in a week. He had plans to go hunting with a friend but never showed up at their agreed meeting location. The next day, Ian didn't report to work. Ian's family and friends launched a massive search across a vast territory encompassing the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest along the eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains in Washington. They had been going for days without sleep, searching tirelessly for Ian on nothing but desperation and adrenaline. Then, Ian's silver FJ cruiser burst out of nowhere, bounding down the mountain toward them in what sounded like a horrible nightmare, but it was actually happening. Even more strange was the fact that Ian wasn't driving the car. Ian's friends had a brief altercation with the man behind the wheel, and then he took off. A chase ensued, but they lost sight of Ian's vehicle. This chance meeting with the man driving Ian's FJ Cruiser sparked a massive manhunt for an armed and dangerous fugitive.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://thredup.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thredup.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://grove.co/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Grove Collaborative</a>&nbsp;- For a limited time, when&nbsp;my listeners go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://grove.co/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Grove.co/VANISHED</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>you will get to choose a FREE gift&nbsp;with your first order of $30 or more.</p><p><a href=\"http://vionicshoes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vionic Shoes</a>- Visit<a href=\"http://vionicshoes.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VionicShoes.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED for free shipping.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
