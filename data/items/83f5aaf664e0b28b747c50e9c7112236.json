  "description": "Every year, thousands of people clamor to eat at The Lost Kitchen, Erin French’s restaurant in Freedom, Maine, population 722. Don’t visit your favorite reservations app. The only way to snag a seat is by mailing in a postcard, and needless to say, a lot of folks come up empty-handed. Fortunately, the disappointed now have a way to console themselves, as Erin and her crew are the subjects of a new show on the Magnolia Network. Erin also penned a bestselling memoir, \"Finding Freedom,\" that came out earlier this spring and detailed the adversity and addiction she struggled with over the years on the road to opening her restaurant. Erin took a break from her kitchen duties to talk with host Kerry Diamond about freedom, Freedom, and the resilience that fuels everything she does. \n\nThank you to Cypress Grove, the makers of award-winning goat cheese, for supporting this episode! \n\nRadio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City. \n\nOur theme song is by Tra La La. \n",
