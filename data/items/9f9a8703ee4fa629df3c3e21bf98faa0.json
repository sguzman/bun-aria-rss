  "description": "<p><em>“Let’s create not only some healing here but some real change. … Change is automatic, but progress is not. And so this is a conversation today to see if we can create some progress. … What this is really about is getting to what we can do to tap into unity, and love, and compassion, and connection to one another. What can we do to move forward?” – Tony Robbins</em></p> <p> </p> <p>It’s been over three months since the death of George Floyd, the unarmed, 46-year-old black man, who was unconscionably killed by police in broad daylight during an arrest in Minneapolis. Captured on cell-phone video and amplified in the media, the whole world witnessed his horrific death, and it has reignited a centuries-long conversation around race supremacy in the United States and the injustice that African Americans can face.</p> <p>The aftermath of George Floyd’s death — and combined stacking of others like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, and most recently the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis.  — has brought this nation to a threshold. With thousands of people around the world in grief, humanity is speaking loud and clear: enough is enough, the time is now to create real change rooted in our nation’s foundation of ‘justice for all.’ Beyond change, we need progress. As Tony said in the first episode of this special two-part podcast series, change is automatic – but progress is not.</p> <p><strong>The conversation continues</strong>. In this 2-hour episode, Tony hosts a panel of five unique, multi-generational leaders who share their experience of what it is to be Black in America and lend their voice to what we, as a unified society, need to listen to and hear, to unite, to make progress, and ultimately to tap into love, compassion, and our deep connection to one another.</p> <p><strong><em>“If love is not yet won, the battle is not yet over.”</em></strong></p> <p><em>– Martin Luther King III</em></p> <p><strong>Part 2 Guests:   </strong></p> <p>Charlamagne tha God (Radio show host, author, influencer)</p> <p>Rev. Jesse Jackson (Civil rights activist, former aide to Martin Luther King, Jr.)</p> <p>Barbara Becnel (Journalist, film producer, prison reform advocate)</p> <p>Van Jones (Author, television host)</p> <p>Derrick Johnson (President and CEO of the NAACP)</p>",
