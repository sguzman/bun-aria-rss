  "description": "In early January of 2000, an 18 year old boy living in Asheville, North Carolina, disappeared one night after his work shift. Weeks later, his car was discovered in parking lot and the contents inside only left police more confused. Between suspicious phone calls, a jealous boyfriend, and strange clues, this case proves to be one of the most bizarre we have covered. This is the story of Zebb Quinn. \n\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\n\nCASE SOURCES\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/197782873/?terms=Zebb%20quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/197782873/?terms=Zebb%20quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/194665575/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/197822311/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-admits-killing-ex-food-network-contestant-and-husband-burning-bodies-in-wood-stove/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/200606011/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/199280148/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/197805493/?terms=Zebb%20quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/15/warrant-details-zebb-quinn-related-search-leicester-property/71262232/\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/119090171/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/194665647/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/200648063/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/200606011/?terms=Zebb%20Quinn&match=1\n\nhttps://www.hulu.com/watch/8e8fbb11-ea48-4971-a4fa-6d29982300a4\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/200635616/?terms=Zebb%20quinn&match=1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
