  "description": "<p><em>Dear Young Rocker</em> Season 3 launches April 7th, 2021. Tune in for a music-themed audio memoir podcast where musicians tell the stories of their teenage struggles and triumphs and how they became the artists and people they are today. On each episode of <em>Dear Young Rocker,</em> host Chelsea Ursin introduces a rising musical guest star who reads a heartfelt story about their teenage life and a letter to their younger self full of the advice they wish someone could have given them back then. In seasons 1 and 2, Chelsea told her own story of overcoming struggles with anxiety and shyness and finding a home in music and reconnected with her own younger self. Now, in Season 3, we again are transported back to a time of intense teenage feelings and the joy of discovering music, but this time we'll hear from other artists on their own unique paths to self-acceptance who grew up in different places with different challenges and felt like 'weirdos' for their own reasons. Catch up on seasons 1 and 2, available now from <a href=\"https://www.doubleelvis.com/\">Double Elvis</a> and iHeart Radio.
