An Emmy Award-winning actor (with another nomination under his belt this year). Currently, Porter stars in the acclaimed FX show <em>Pose</em>, all about New York's underground ball culture in the 80s and 90s. It's also takes place during the height of the HIV-AIDS crisis.<br/><br/>Sam talks to Porter about the parallels between that crisis and the one we're living in today, about growing up in the church, and why — despite everything that's happened this year — love will always win.",
