  "description": "1. Why guns are now the leading cause of death for American children and teens, and who is profiting from America’s suffering.\n2. What to say today when your child leaves the house to help protect them from gun violence.\n3. The lie our leaders are selling us about why they won’t pass the reforms that 90% of Americans want, and how one mom became the NRA’s biggest nightmare.\n4. How to safeguard our kids from the negative impact of for-profit active shooter drills in schools. \n\nAbout Shannon:\nShannon Watts was a stay at home mother of five when she founded Moms Demand Action, the nation’s first and largest grassroots movement fighting against gun violence – and the most powerful counter-movement the gun lobby has ever faced. Moms Demand Action now has a chapter in every state and, with over 8 million supporters, is now larger than the National Rifle Association. For almost ten years, Moms Demand Action volunteers have stopped the NRA’s priority legislation in statehouses roughly 90 percent of the time, helped pass hundreds of gun safety laws across the country, changed corporate policies and educated Americans about secure gun storage. Shannon’s book, Fight Like a Mother: How a Grassroots Movement Took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women Will Change the World, is now available in paperback.\n\nTW: @shannonrwatts\nIG:@shannonrwatts\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
