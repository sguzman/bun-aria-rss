  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>If there isn’t a grovel, is it even a romance? This week, we’re getting to the bottom of one of our favorite moments in a romance novel — the grovel. Love it or hate it, some of the best loved books of the genre go all in on hero (because let’s face it, it’s almost always the hero) on his knees…and we are here. for. it. We talk about the hows and whys of the grovel, about the reasons we love it, about the difference between a grovel and a grand gesture, and about the books that installed this particular button for us. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This episode is sponsored by Janna MacGregor, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3t9bQfz\"><em>Rules for Engaging the Earl</em></a>, and Adriana Herrera, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3m6sGrr\"><em>A Caribbean Heiress in Paris</em></a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Virginia Henley’s <em>The Dragon and the Jewel</em>, a deep cut from Sarah’s childhood.
