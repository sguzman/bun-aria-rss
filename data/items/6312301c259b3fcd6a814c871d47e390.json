  "description": "Our audiobook this week is DILLON’S HEART by Loni Nichole\n\nJules\nI don&#039;t have time to date, especially not the infuriatingly bossy, ridiculously hot sheriff. But Dillon Armstrong won&#039;t take no for an answer. And the more he shows up at my office, the harder it is to resist him and his high-handed, insufferable, oddly endearing ways. He&#039;s going to make me fall for him, I just know it.\n\nDillon\nThe first time I lay eyes on the little firecracker, I know my life will never be the same again. She’s determined to resist me, but I refuse to take no for an answer. I’ll play dirty if necessary. The feisty nurse stole my ornery old heart and now she’s stuck with me. I just have to convince her to take a chance on me. Or I’ll kidnap her.
