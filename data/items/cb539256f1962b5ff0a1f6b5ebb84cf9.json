  "description": "r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, a Karen criticizes OP for being a bad wife, so OP claps back by mocking the Karen for being single in her 40s. The Karen can dish it out, but she can't take it! She starts whining and complaining that OP is soooo mean to her when she doesn't deserve the criticism. Is OP a butthole, or is Karen being a total hypocrite? Let me know in the comments!
