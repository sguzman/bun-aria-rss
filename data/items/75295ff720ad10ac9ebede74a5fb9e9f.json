  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re watching your favorite series on your phone, computer, or TV - the shows that we’ve grown to binge watch and/or critique were created by teams of people invested in the power of storytelling. Whether it’s a Youtube based comedy series or an HBO original, the tales told on our screens allow us to live vicariously through characters that remind us of ourselves, the people we love, and even the people we don’t want to be like. But, who are the people behind these characters? Who are the talented individuals who translate stories to reality? </p>\n<p>In this week’s session, I'm joined by industry powerhouse and triple threat Writer, Director, and Showrunner, Amy Aniobi. Amy is one of the incredible Black women behind iconic shows like Hoorae Media’s Awkward Black Girl, HBO’s 2 Dope Queens, and HBO’s Insecure. Our conversation explores the characteristics of working in film and television as a Black woman and the necessity of mentorship in the industry. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://www.sisterhoodheals.com\">Sisterhood Heals</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Amy</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyaniobi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amyaniobi/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.besuperspecial.com/\">SuperSpecial Production Company</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.antidoteshow.org/\">The Antidote Podcast</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
