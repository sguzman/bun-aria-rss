  "description": "<p>EVERYONE BE COOL, KATHLEEN ZELNER IS IN THE HOUSE!!!</p>\n\n\n<p>Before she became a household name with her work on the Steven Avery case in season 2 of \"Making A Murderer,\" Kathleen Zelner used her brilliant, no-nonsense bad-assery to exonerate Ryan Ferguson. Ferguson had been convicted in 2005 at the age of 19 of a murder he didn't commit. There was no physical evidence, the \"eye witnesses\" were unreliable to say the least, and Ferguson was failed by an incompetent lawyer. AND. KATHLEEN. ZELNER. IS. NOT. HERE. FOR. IT.Â </p>\n\n\n<p>Come for Zelner, but stay for Ryan's dad who's a super adorable Inspector Gadget type who learns how to use google and get on the online in an obsessive attempt to save his son.</p>\n",
