In a time when some in the industry are questioning the multiline model, Ryan and Steven have created a destination that does everything showrooms are supposed to do—showcase product in new ways, inspire designers, and draw visitors from near and far. In this episode of the <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, they tell host Dennis Scully why they moved from a new development to a design center, the importance of putting their own brand first, and how everything from hardwood flooring to the right Spotify playlist can make all the difference. <i>This episode is sponsored by Henrybuilt's Primary Objects and Industry West</i>.</p>\n",
