    "media:description": "► Title Fight is one of the most recognizable names in the world of heavier music today. Having released quintessential albums such as Shed (2011), Floral Green (2012) and Hyperview (2015), the band has developed a die-hard fanbase. Fronted by Ned Russin (of Glitterer), this is the story of the group, from their humble beginnings in 2003 to present day, in which the band's future is uncertain.\n\nAlso a huge thank you for 3,000 subscribers, very much appreciated!\n\n► Leave a like if you enjoyed!
