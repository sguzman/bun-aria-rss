  "description": "<p>JRE Review of 1322 wtih Reggie Watts</p>\n <p>Reggie is hilarious and super talented. I first saw him on Comedy Bang Bang which was a crazy funny show. He now is a band member on a late night talk show. Joe and him get super high and get into all kinds of shit from 80s cocaine music to the infinite universe and beyond. It was a blast to review and I hope Reggie comes back on soon!</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
