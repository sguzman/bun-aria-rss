  "description": "Hey HBs! It's week one of our winter hiatus! We're here with The Covert Captain, or A Marriage of Equals by Jeanelle M. Ferreira, a historical that's so historical, even two ladies who can read and understand Shakespeare couldn't quite decipher it a lot of the time. What we understood, we loved, though! It's about a Captain in the army with a Big Secret and the spinster with nothing to lose bonding over pianos, horses, promiscuous relations, and the idea that ladies are capable and worthwhile just as they are. Make sure to check out our back catalogue for the climactic finish in PART 2! It's episode 105. \n Bonus Content: Melody's apologetic spoken word poem, frogs, *things* eating their own tails, secret passage ways, duckies (not), absconding via windows, diets of postage, and so much more. \n Get more content on PATREON!\n Subscribe!
