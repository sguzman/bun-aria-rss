Later, Bills OL Jon Feliciano joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about the fight he got into with AJ Epenesa at practice and what the environment is like in Buffalo, his tweet about wanting to fight Pat at the next Showtime boxing event for \"taking away Toradol,\" and how it is actually AJ's fault, plus much more (48:10-1:02:42).
