  "description": "<p>Jared \"The Rocket\" Carrabis joins the Kirk Minihane Show in studio to talk about how shitty the Red Sox are this year, his move back to Boston, his COVID-19 Era love life, the sweet city of Saugus, and more. Kirk covers the fallout from his move to the dark side (a.k.a. The Mincels) and names his new Mount Rushmore. CNBC's Jim Cramer apologizes for his \"Crazy Nancy\" remark. USA Today columnist Christine Brennan says the Big Ten's decision to reinstate football is its \"darkest day,\" which will come as a relief to Larry Nassar and Jerry Sandusky.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
