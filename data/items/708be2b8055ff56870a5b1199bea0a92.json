Today on Past Gas: how did Amati become a ghost badge haunting Mazda’s dreams? Why does Mazda refuse to discuss the failed brand? How did Mazda go from zoom zoom, to doom and gloom?\nMore about Show:\n\n\n﻿Follow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey.  \n\n\n\nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes.  \n\n\n\nFollow Joe on IG and Twitter @joegweber.\n\n\nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels!  \n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast for free wherever you're listening or using this link: http://bit.ly/PastGas.\n\nIf you like the show, telling a friend about it would be helpful!
