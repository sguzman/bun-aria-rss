    "media:description": "In the future, the Sahara Desert will turn green. Due to the Earth’s slightly elliptical shape and the gravitational pull of other planets in our solar system, the Earth’s orbit, tilt and wobble gradually fluctuate over time in a process called the Milankovitch cycles. By affecting how much and where sunlight hits Earth, these cycles have a significant impact on the long-term climate of Earth. One of these effects impacts the climate of northern Africa. Every 26,000 years, more sunlight hits northern Africa, causing a positive feedback loop that spreads vegetation across the region. While we are currently in a dry period, in about 13,000 years, it is expected that the Sahara will enter a humid period and turn into a green, lush region. To speed up this process though, there are ways to artificially green the desert while also harvesting green, renewable energy.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more similar content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.climate-policy-watcher.org/tropical-rainforest/the-green-sahara-of-the-past.html\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-really-turned-sahara-desert-green-oasis-wasteland-180962668/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200607-sabu-jaddi-the-site-revealing-the-saharas-verdant-past\nhttps://www.livescience.com/will-sahara-desert-turn-green.html\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/green-sahara-african-humid-periods-paced-by-82884405/\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/#:~:text=This%20wobble%20is%20due%20to,is%20known%20as%20axial%20precession.\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/milankovitch-cycles-paleoclimatic-change-and-hominin-evolution-68244581/\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/milankovitch-cycles-paleoclimatic-change-and-hominin-evolution-68244581/\nhttp://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/milankovitch-cycles\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146304/remnants-of-an-ancient-lake?src=ve\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period#:~:text=The%20African%20humid%20period%20was,Stage%205%20a%20and%20c.\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/04/land-restoration-africa-sahel-climate-change/\nhttps://www.scientia.global/dr-francesco-pausata-exploring-the-sahara-deserts-past-to-understand-its-future/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45435593#:~:text=%22Wind%20farms%20increase%20surface%20roughness,will%20lead%20to%20increased%20rainfall.%22\n\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nGoogle Earth\nStoryblocks\nScienceAtNASA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7lVGhTPQAY\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:04 - Milankovitch Cycles\n02:58 - A Positive Feedback Loop\n04:32 - Modern Evidence\n05:55 - The Future Sahara\n07:25 - Artificial Greening",
