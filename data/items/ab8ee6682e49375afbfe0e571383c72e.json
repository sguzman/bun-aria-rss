  "description": "<p>Today marks the anniversary of Kevin Cullen's downfall. Kirk Minihane revisits the time he exposed the Boston Globe columnist as a serial plagiarist who, on multiple occasions, led his readers and viewers to believe that he was present at the Boston Marathon bombing carried out by the Tsarnaev Brothers (0:34:00). Dan from Brooklyn joins the show to tell us how he's holding up during the quarantine. He agrees that he will participate in the Dave Portnoy Memorial 5k, which you can sign up for at KirkMinihaneShow.com (1:49:00). Matt from Providence exposes Steve's hatred for Canada geese, the callers wonder why Kirk takes it easy on Blind Mike, and Michael Buble is under fire.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
