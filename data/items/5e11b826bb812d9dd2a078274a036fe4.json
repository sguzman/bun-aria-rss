  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the January 6th Committee is a trojan-horse front for the Department of Justice to cast a wider net than a law enforcement agency is legally permitted to. This is unconstitutional as it violates the individual's Constitutional rights in a criminal proceeding. Earlier, Peter Navarro was held in contempt of Congress by the Congressional January 6th Committee. Navarro was indicted and immediately arrested at the airport and placed in handcuffs and leg irons for his political opposition to the committee's document request. Similarly, former Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress and was never arrested; clearly, there's a double standard. Democrats use Congress and its subpoena powers in the legislative branch to work as an apanage of law enforcement agencies in the executive branch. Then, some who advocate for judicial review reject the notion that then VP Mike Pence lacked the authority to send the electoral college votes back to their respective states. The constitution specifically points out that it is the state legislatures that decide and to ignore that would be a violation of the federal Constitution. Democrats repeatedly violated state legislatures in the 2020 election and the Supreme Court of the United States did nothing about it. Later, Candidate Dave McCormick conceded the PA Senate primary race after a recount and a lawsuit he filed on bad advice from his lawyer Chuck Cooper. It's critical that counter-culture Democrats be stopped in the midterms. The reason the culture is rotting is because the American Marxists are focused on destroying Americanism. They destroy the culture to seize more power and expand their ruling class which seeks political power above anything else. Afterward, tyrannically tinkering with the law for the sake of defending crimes and punishing the law creates a permanent place for plunder in society. In time the misery and corrosiveness of the American Marxists' utopian cause will rot the culture if not checked. Finally, Biden and Putin speak the same language and the economy is tanking while Biden keeps blaming Russia. They claim that fossil fuels must be replaced by electricity, yet electricity requires fossil fuels. Democrats will lie and blame others every step of the way. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
