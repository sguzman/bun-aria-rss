  "title": "Howie Mandel, Movie Night At Barstool, and Cleaning Out The JT",
  "description": "<p><p>We help Howie Mandel conquer hisÂ germaphobia by giving him the most disgusting chair in the office, discuss how he inspects hotel rooms with a blacklight and salad tongs, Deal or No Deal guy who gets stuck with $5, the time he got mad at Megan Markle, how he tried to turn down Deal or No Deal and had to be talked into it by his wife, and how he is the Tom Brady of gameshows. Movie night at Barstool and KFC, Feits and Kayce watch Jigsaw and debate what they would do if they were about to die. Voicemails include: cleaning out the JT, hot or cold car, and cum out the mouth or 1 liter.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
