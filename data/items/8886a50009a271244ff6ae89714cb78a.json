    "media:description": "http://www.abctragedy.com\n\nMost decidedly NOT for children. \n\nWickedly penned by Dr. Jordan B Peterson, An ABC of Childhood Tragedy unforgettably depicts the doomed and desperate lives of Adella, Bertram, Cynthia and their cohort of catastrophe. \n\nTwenty-six dark and witty poems, each a tragic comedy of innocence and vulnerability. Twenty-six hauntingly beautiful portrayals of injustice and suffering, each from the gifted imagination of Juliette Fogra, illustrator of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. \n\nIf A Nightmare before Christmas or Coraline struck you to the heart; \nif the gothic raillery of Edward Gorey’s Gashlycrumb Tinies seduced you to smile satirically;\nif the Brothers Grimm were nowhere near grim enough for you; \nthen An ABC of Childhood Tragedy might just be the book you’ve been pining for. \n\nThis video/audio project is an adjunct to the first  of the illustrated book An ABC of Childhood Tragedy (verses by Jordan B Peterson; illustrations by Juliette Fogra). One song will be released every two weeks, and a vinyl album is planned. \n\nNote: The verse for the letter W spoken/whispered in this prelude is part of An ABC of Childhood Tragedy, and the photographic portraits are derived from the book illustrations. One song will be released every two weeks for the next few months, and a vinyl album is in the works. \n\nComposition: Skutch Tully and Jordan B Peterson \nLyrics: Jordan B Peterson \nVideo: Jordan B Peterson and Juliette Fogra \nVoices: Skutch Tully and Jordan B Peterson \n\nArrangement: Skutch Tully and Jordan B Peterson \nInstrumentation: Skutch Tully\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",
