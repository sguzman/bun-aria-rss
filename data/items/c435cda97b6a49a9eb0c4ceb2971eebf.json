  "description": "Messy data, buggy software, but all in all a good learning experience...\nEarly last year, I had some free time on my hands, so I decided to participate in yet another Kaggle competition. Having never done any price forecasting work before, I thought it would be interesting to work on the Blue Book for Bulldozers competition, where the goal was to predict the sale price of auctioned bulldozers. I&rsquo;ve done alright, finishing 9th out of 476 teams."
