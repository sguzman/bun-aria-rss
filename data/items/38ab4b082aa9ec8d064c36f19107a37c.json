  "description": "<p>A new study finds evangelicals see most thing in society in categories of good and evil while nonbelievers see more nuance. Phil, Skye, and Kaitlyn discuss the implications. Bob Jones University has a fashion design department. What could possibly go wrong? Pretty much everything when a student discovered his androgynous Jesus coat was a fundamentalist fashion faux pas. Then, art historian Matthew Milliner talks about his new book “The Everlasting People: G.K. Chesterton and the First Nations.” Milliner explains the arrogance and injustice of progressivism, and the surprising story of Christianity among indigenous North Americans that rarely gets told. Plus, 100 monkeys on a truck and drunks on a plane.</p> <p>News Segment</p> <p>0:00 - Intro<br /> 3:29 - Animal News<br /> <a href= \"https://apnews.com/article/oddities-pennsylvania-monkeys-animals-52100c02527985f7dde4674724bb3332\"> https://apnews.com/article/oddities-pennsylvania-monkeys-animals-52100c02527985f7dde4674724bb3332</a></p> <p>8:16 - News of the Butt<br /> <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/us/covid-flight-passenger-violent.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/us/covid-flight-passenger-violent.html</a></p> <p>16:34 - Fundamentalist fashion faux pas<br /> <a href= \"https://baptistnews.com/article/how-a-students-fashion-design-project-upset-the-created-order-at-bob-jones-university/#.Ye7fBS1h1B0\"> https://baptistnews.com/article/how-a-students-fashion-design-project-upset-the-created-order-at-bob-jones-university/#.Ye7fBS1h1B0</a></p> <p>39:50 - Can society be split into good and evil?<br /> <a href= \"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/12/21/christians-religiously-unaffiliated-differ-on-whether-most-things-in-society-can-be-divided-into-good-evil/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/the-yuck-factor/580465/\"> https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/12/21/christians-religiously-unaffiliated-differ-on-whether-most-things-in-society-can-be-divided-into-good-evil/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/the-yuck-factor/580465/</a></p> <p>Sponsor<br /> 51:40 - This episode is sponsored by Abide: <a href= \"http://abide.co/holypost\">http://abide.co/holypost</a></p> <p>Interview with Matthew Milliner<br /> “The Everlasting People: G.K.
