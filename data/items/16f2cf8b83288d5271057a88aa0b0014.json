  "description": "Before the Egyptian revolution, Bassem Youssef was a heart surgeon who moonlighted as a political comedian. He went on to become the Jon Stewart of Egypt, poking fun at the regime with an audience of 40 million people. Then he was forced to flee the country. Preet spoke with Bassem live on stage at the Apollo Theater about his journey from doctor to comedian to, now, podcast host in America. Bassem's show, \"Remade in America,\" launches later this month. \n\nPlus: Preet reflects on the accusations against former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman — and what might happen next for himself. \n\nDo you have a question for Preet?
