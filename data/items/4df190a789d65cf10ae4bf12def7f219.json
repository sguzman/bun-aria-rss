We are going to talk about her new book ‘Sew Many Notions’ and dispel a few common fears quilters have about diving into working with wool.\n---------\nFussy cutting fabric is contagious. I’ve followed posts from Elisabeth Hardey, the event manager in the marketing dept at Robert Kaufman, for awhile. Then when she and her friend Nichole Ramirez wrote ‘The Fussy Cut Sampler’ I was thrilled to see all their tricks & tips documented in a great book. You might have even done a sew along for their book!\n-----------\nI know you’ve seen the amazing block of the month designs from Sassafras Lane. They also create loads of other designs and I have Shayla Wolf, who is half of the Mother/Daughter team of Shayla Wolf and Kristy Wolf here to give me some pointers on creating their foundation designs.\n------------\nPam Damour of the Decorating Diva has so many great projects and tutorials. She is an author and fellow Baby Lock ambassador. It’s always fun to learn how to use our fabric for projects that are not quilts. I asked Pam to share some ideas and tricks today with us!\n================\nVisit American Patchwork & Quilting at www.allpeoplequilt.com.\nVisit host Pat Sloan at www.patsloan.com.\n================\nBONUS for our podcast subscribers!
