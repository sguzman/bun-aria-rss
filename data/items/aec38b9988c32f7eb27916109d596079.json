  "description": "Adrian Belew’s career in music was influenced by many and has influenced many more. As a completely self-taught guitarist, Adrian absorbed as much music as possible on the way to establishing his own sound and style. After getting his big break with Frank Zappa, Adrian went on to collaborate with David Bowie, Talking Heads, and Nine Inch Nails, just to name a few, and recorded 25 solo albums.
