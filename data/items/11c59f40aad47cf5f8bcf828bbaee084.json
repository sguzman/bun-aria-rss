Sometimes I don&#8217;t update it, but I reviewed my 2020 version and will try to take out some takeaways.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Covid-19 was incredibly disruptive to our lives, but it accelerated &#8216;digital transformation&#8217; in a number of industries, and we saw at <a href=\"http://www.aflorithmic.ai\">Aflorithmic </a>that some industries grew and others were forced to come up with &#8216;digital-first&#8217; product offerings. Since we are focused on helping businesses enhance their audio experiences this was good for us. </li><li>Managing remotely is hard. Really important to spend a lot of time on zoom calls with your team. And it&#8217;s very easy with slack and emails to be misinterpreted. </li><li>I learned a ton of leadership lessons. Some of which exposed some of my failings (I&#8217;ll do another post on this at some point) and some which made me realise that when stuff goes wrong, it&#8217;s STILL your fault.</li><li>It&#8217;s really important as a manager to get into the trenches, it&#8217;s very easy for &#8216;metrics&#8217; to lie to you. </li><li>We onboarded our first paying clients and pilots this year. And went through various iterations where we discovered what worked and what didn&#8217;t work. A key lesson we learned over and over again &#8211; is that you can be &#8216;too early&#8217; for a market, and if you&#8217;re &#8216;too early&#8217; it doesn&#8217;t work. </li><li>Learning a ton about building teams/ building platforms and the importance of great design and user experience. <em>User experience is a first order problem to solve. Machine Learning is a second order problem.</em></li><li>Learning a ton about communication styles and about how important it is to spend time on whatever &#8216;story&#8217; or &#8216;vision&#8217; you want to portray to others. And it&#8217;s important as a leader to provide that. People need to understand how what they&#8217;re working on, connects to the big picture. </li><li>Learned a ton about fundraising, cashflow, growing a team, shipping product, negotiating with lawyers, fixing bugs, responding to customers and the importance of  reliability and operational excellence. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Onwards and upwards. Lots more to learn. It&#8217;s great to reflect on how we&#8217;ve gone from an MVP to a working product in the space of a year and a bit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
