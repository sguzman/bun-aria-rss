  "description": "It is conventional wisdom that Americans want nothing to do with the world save for cheap imports and K-Pop music. Even New York Times columnists say so. But, the reality is far different. In fact, polling suggests the opposite is true. America's welcome foreign engagement and support our allies and alliances. We discuss what's true and what this may mean in the 2020 elections with Ivo Daalder, President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kori Schake of IISS, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Evelyn Farkas of the German Marshall Fund. Take that conventional wisdom! \nThis episode of Deep State Radio is brought to you by Mova Globes.
