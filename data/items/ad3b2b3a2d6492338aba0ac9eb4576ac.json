  "description": "Janie Molster, Interior Designer in the Richmond, Virginia area, is known for her fun and light-hearted designs, mixing the beautiful with the well-choreographed messy. She joins the show this week to talk about her love of pink, decorating for the holidays, and why we don’t always have to go with the traditional red and green. We also all talk about decorating with comfort in mind first, when twin beds may be the way to go and creating symmetry that is pleasing to the eye.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nMore about Janie’s style, recently described as “pretty, happy, and layered.” To some, it may look like it’s done with abandon, but really it is choreographed with a ton of thought.\n\nThe juxtaposition between the old and new in a home, and Janie’s suggestion that people mix and match objects they most love together even if it’s different style-wise.\n\nJanie’s top tree decorating tips including ribbon, colors, and not worrying about blending homemade with fancy.\n\nJanie’s love of pink since she was little, and ways we can create a Christmas-y feel without having to be tied to the traditional red and green.\n\nWhat a story about Disney cartoons with hairy arms has to do with design!\n\nNew idea: Christmas trees that come with a remote?\n\nWhen twin beds and be engaging and pleasing, especially for people like Janie who do a lot of hosting.\n\nWhy she loves pairs to create symmetry that is pleasing to the eye, and constantly recycling and swapping items from room to room.\n\nJanie explains her love of an upholstered headboard and gives some unique design thoughts on using them to spruce and liven up a room.\n\nMentioned In This Episode: \nJanie Molster Designs\n@JanieMolsterDesigns\nHouse Beautiful \n“In Defense of Twins”\nDecorating Dilemma \nIf your budget allows, Janie loves your idea of wallpaper. She would not only wallpaper the walls, but the ceilings as well, wrapping front to back. A stripe or vertical pattern can be really fun, and you can run it up the eaves vertically and across on top to create a cabana tent effect. The funky trimmed doors are so fun and filled with personality, and they could be so fun to accent as well. Great job and we are very impressed by you! One final note: Janie also thought having a custom headboard made could be really cool to get the feel of an arched headboard.\n__________________________________________________________________\nIf there is room on the other end of the sofa, a chair could go nicely there. Janie recommends creating two seating arrangements: one that is oriented to the TV and the other one under the windows. If you layered a room size rug and your current rug on top, it could hide a little of the asymmetry. If you are looking to fill up some wall space, more artwork or mirrors can look great — and only get a bookshelf if you are really needing space for more books! Our final thought is that adding some drapery could be great for adding some softness to the room.",
