A book club win for kids, a book train with friends, and strong opinions about a bookish movie.</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. There’s some serious gushing over books in this week’s titles, plus a couple “I didn’t like this” strong opinions. Hold onto your earbuds.</p> <p class=\"\">We are doing a brief Slow But Steady check-in this week to let you know what we’re choosing for our next reads for this challenge.</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are playing around with book pairings for TV shows that we’ve enjoyed in the past. We each chose two shows to dive deep into and then find ways to replicate some of those same feelings in our reading. What fun!</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands: we’ve got a “very favorite” read-aloud book, one that will work, even if you’re down to the wire on a challenge category, and a book that is perfect for gift-giving.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode.
