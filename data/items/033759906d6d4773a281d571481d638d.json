  "description": "<p>Richard Stanley is a South African filmmaker, known for his boundary-pushing work in the horror and science fiction genres. Stanley grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, studying anthropology and filming tribal dance and initiation rituals. In the 90s, he directed the horror features <em>Hardware </em>and<em> Dust Devil</em>. He was then famously fired from an adaptation of <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau</em> starring Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer after only three days on set, an event which later became the subject of the documentary, <em>Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley’s Island of Dr. Moreau.</em> Stanley went on to direct several documentaries and returned to narrative film in 2019 with <em>Color Out of Space </em>starring Nicolas Cage. Richard Stanley and Alec discuss Stanley’s upbringing in South Africa, what it’s like directing Marlon Brando and his biggest regrets from the failed Moreau production.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
