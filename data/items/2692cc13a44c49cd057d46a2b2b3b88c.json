  "description": "As you know, it’s my mission to help teach you how to build the MINDSET and SKILLS that will help you live an extraordinary life - and over the last few months I’ve been working hard behind the scenes to help create a brand-new tool that will help you do that.<br />It’s called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life. To learn more, join my Discord at impacttheory.com/discord!.<br /><br />Big goals require DISCIPLINE. By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com<br /><br />Have you ever realized that the very things that lead to success, purpose, and fulfillment are the things nearly everyone runs away from? Discomfort, hard work, uncomfortable situations and conversations, are the things that no one desires more of, and yet…<br /><br />The ability to build a wildly successful and scalable business is within reach for nearly everyone reading this, and yet through self-selection on the few will do what needs to be done to rise to the top. Of the few that rise to the top, even fewer will do so feeling fulfilled in their life. <br /><br />It takes much more than skills and relationships to be successful. It takes grit and determination to do the hard things. It requires you go through emotionally taxing, ego killing moments of failure, humility, and self-realization to become adaptable and become who you want to be.<br /><br />In this keynote, Tom reveals the hard facts of entrepreneurship and what it takes to be in the 1%. “If you’re only good in the beginning you lack grit.” After watching this it’s time for a hard self-talk and challenge to yourself. It’s time for a no B.S. approach of what will it take to build yourself into the person you desire to be. Don’t underestimate what you are capable of, stop thinking too small and get uncomfortable.<br /><br />Tom’s 6 Ways to Develop New Skills:<br />Always be reading<br />Open yourself up to change<br />What you believe is a choice<br />Be an eternal student<br />Become antifragile<br />Develop Grit<br /><br />Resources Mentioned:<br />Poem, Richard Cory: <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44982/richard-cory\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44982/richard-cory</a> <br />David Foster Wallace, This Is Water: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8CrOL-ydFMI\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/8CrOL-ydFMI</a> <br />Tom’s Reading List: <a href=\"https://impacttheory.com/reading-list/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://impacttheory.com/reading-list/</a> <br /><br />“To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill treatment, indignities - I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures.” -Nietzche<br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to The Journey Is the Win<br />0:22 | Entrepreneurs Survive Rock Bottom<br />9:12 | Connect to Purpose (Not Money)<br />16:41 | Develop Your Mindset First<br />24:16 | 6 Ways to Develop New Skills<br />37:13 | How to Develop Grit<br />46:16 | Identify Your Passion & Develop It<br />51:03 | Building a Scalable Business<br />1:01:29 | Value of Online Community <br />1:14:17 | Success Requires Clear Goals <br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“Each and every one of you at some point in your life, you’re going to hit rock bottom. The question isn’t will you hit rock bottom? The question is what are you going to do with yourself when it happens?” [2:15]<br /><br />The game you think you’re playing is money, but I promise, the game you’re actually playing is brain chemistry.” [4:36]<br /><br />“I don’t care if you have a dream. I’m so uninterested in empty dreamers, I can’t see straight. What I care about? Do you have the fortitude to fail.” [8:00]<br /><br />“Saving the world, doing the right thing, thinking about your customer, wanting them to win, wanting them to shine, wanting great things for your employees, it’s big f*cking business.” [15:35]<br /><br />“I’m a grand fan of doing and believing that which moves you toward your goals.” [18:34]<br /><br />“Everyone is your superior in some way, and once you learn to check your ego, sit at their feet with absolute humility and be open to their ideas, especially the one that contradicts what you believe today, then you’ll get somewhere”  [26:06]<br /><br />“Doing more work than anyone else is required for greatness” [50:16]<br /><br />“Now you’re going to have to be transparent, now you’re going to have to tell people what you stand for, and the thing you stand for better be the creation of value.”  [1:00:19]<br /><br />“What’s going to keep people from losing faith in your company as you get bigger is feeling connected to a person.” [1:04:41]<br /><br />“As much as you can be an early adopter, so much the better. It’s always the early adopters that win.” [1:09:51]<br /><br /><br />Follow Tom Bilyeu:<br />Website: <a href=\"https://impacttheory.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://impacttheory.com/</a> <br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu</a> <br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tombilyeu\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/tombilyeu</a> <br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu/</a>",
