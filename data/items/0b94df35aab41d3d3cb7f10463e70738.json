  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane recognizes a new low in his own sanity as he spent the early morning hours arguing with @GerryCallacanned in the Minifan Discord thread. Blind Mike is upset with Intern Justin and we're not sure how to handle it. Minihane and Steve Robinson sent Barstool CEO Erika Nardini some cheese to thank her for being awesome, and Mike's a little upset he wasn't included even though he wasn't a part of it. CAIR Director of Government Affairs Robert McCaw joins the program to explain why Amazon and other large retailers should stop selling certain inflammatory books (1:10). Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy joins the show to tell Minihane that he's headed to Miami to spend a week co-hosting Barstool Radio for Super Bowl LIV (1:47:00). Pardon My Take host Dan \"Big Cat\" Katz does the Mount Rushmore of famous blind people with the crew and explains the importance of putting timestamps in the description of podcasts (2:32:00). Minihane hears his new favorite parody song of all time (3:13:00). The boys talk about whether they should experiment with time-stamping the podcast considering the host of one of the most-listened podcasts in the history of podcasts says you should time-stamp podcasts (3:19:00).Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
