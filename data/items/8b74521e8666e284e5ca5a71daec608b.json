  "description": "Clifford Bob is the author of the new book The Global Right Wing and the Clash of World Politics (Cambridge University Press 2012). Bob is an associate professor of political science at Duquesne University. This new book draws on the rich literature on the politics of public policy making, but adapts them to the international arena. Bob argues that too little focus has been placed on right wing groups and their causes in favor of progressive movements. Part international relations, part comparative politics the book traces the competing policy networks in several countries in the areas of gay rights and gun rights. The book is provocative, readable, and a real contribution to a variety of subfields of political science.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
