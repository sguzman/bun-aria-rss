  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, since our founding, freedom of speech remained relatively unchanged until the Supreme Court changed that in the New York Times v. Sullivan case. The problem with allowing entities to besmirch public figures as a part of free speech has created a space for the constant character assassination of political and ideological foes. Therefore, organizations like Media Matters can malign this program and related emails that they suggest participated in a 'coup plot.' As usual they're wrong. Then, President Biden is still pushing critical race theory in schools all over the country. Now in the form of a bill misleadingly named the 'Civics Secures Democracy Act' creates a federal mandate for this curriculum to enhance the teaching of 'racial inequities' and a national test with a new woke vision of history and civics. This national test would usurp the power of local school boards and nationalize neighborhood classrooms. Stanley Kurtz, Senior Fellow at Ethics and Public Policy Center, warns that the poison pill bill known as the 'Civics Secures Democracy Act’ will be passed by unsuspecting Republicans if parents don't intervene right now. Kurtz added that the bill ought to be known as the 'Critical Race Theory Destroys Democracy Act.' Afterward, Congressman Mo Brooks calls with an update on his campaign for the US Senate in Alabama. Mitch McConnell and phony conservative-sounding front group PACs are outspending the real conservative in this race. Brooks has been endorsed by this program, Sean Hannity, Ted Cruz, Jim Jordan, and Rand Paul and is calling on Alabamans to show up and vote in tomorrow's primary election. \n \n \n \nune 20, freedom of speech, 1st amendment, free speech, john eastman, eastman, jan 6, January 6, media matters, alabama, mo brooks, brooks, stanley kurtz, kurtz, crt, economy, inflation, critical race theory, grant, education, john corny, cornyn, Civics Secures Democracy Act, civics, naep, csda, suburbs, homes, school, britt, New York Times, ny times, mitch mcconnel, mcconnell,\nLearn more about your ad choices.
