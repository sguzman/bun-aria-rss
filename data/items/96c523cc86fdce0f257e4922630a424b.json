  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to Andrew who had a run in with a dogman back in the late 70’s in Maryland. I asked Andrew to come on the show and he has been reluctant but finally agreed and I am glad he did because he has one of the best encounters I have heard. Andrew said “My girlfriend and I were parked and a bunch of deer came running towards the car. The deer went passed and than we heard a thump on the car, almost like someone had hit the back of the car. Several weeks earlier my friends from the football team pulled a prank on us and  rocked the car, I went chasing after them. I thought it was my buddies messing with me so I jumped out of the car. I came face to face with this giant thing with a wolfs head. I had never seen or heard of such a thing. It was growling and drooling. It had red eyes, Wes this thing was evil.” I will also be speaking to Robert who is former Delta Force. Robert writes “I saw a Dogman a few months ago. I never would have believed it until we almost hit it while in our car driving north between Georgia and South Carolina late one night. I have traveled all over the world and I never would have believed it unless I saw it in-front of me. This creature was lite up in the car headlight. My girlfriend and I both saw this creature. I am very credible. I have no problem giving you my name as well as my military background. I was shocked when I saw this creature. It moved at an incredible speed.”</p>",
