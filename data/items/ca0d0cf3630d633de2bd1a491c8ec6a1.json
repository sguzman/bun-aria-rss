  "description": "<p>Today's show is packed with football talk. First, Colts Kicker, the all-time NFL points leader, 4x Super Bowl Champion, the GOAT, Adam Vinatieri, calls into the show. He and Pat discuss his season now that the dust has settled, Adam Schefter breaking the news that he plans to return for his 24th season, what he learned from Bill Belichick when playing for the Patriots, and he looks ahead to next season (4:04-20:56). Next, longtime friend of the show, creator of Pro Football Talk, Mike Florio calls in to recap the Conference Championship games. They also discuss what needs to be done to change the officiating in the NFL and Mike proposes a rule change for overtime (20:57-36:29). Pat and the guys also give their takes on the Conference Championships, chat a little bit about the plans for Super Bowl week in Atlanta, and Pat talks about a couple of the recent documentaries he's watched including Murder Mountain, the Fyre Fest documentary, and Avicii's documentary. It's a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
