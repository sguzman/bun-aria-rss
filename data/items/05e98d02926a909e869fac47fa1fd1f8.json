  "description": "<p>We devote our studies to the subject of weakly nonintegrable dynamics of\nsystems with a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom. Our main points of\ninterest are the relations between the timescales of thermalization and the\ntimescales of chaotization; the choice of appropriate observables and the\nstructure of equations coupling them; identifying the classes of weakly\nnonintegrable dynamics and developing tools to diagnose the properties specific\nto such classes. We discuss the traditional in the field methods for\nthermalization timescale computation and employ them to study the scaling the\ntimescale with the proximity to the integrable limit. We then elaborate on a\nnovel framework based on the full Lyapunov spectra computation for large\nsystems as a powerful tool for the characterization of weak nonintegrability.\nIn particular, the Lyapunov spectrum scaling offers a quantitative description\nallowing us to infer the structure of the underlying network of observables.\nProximity to integrable limit is associated with the rapid growth of\nthermalization timescales and, thus, potential numerical challenges. We solve\nthese challenges by performing numerical tests using computationally efficient\nmodel - unitary maps. The great advantage of unitary maps for numerical\napplications is time-discrete error-free evolution. We use these advantages to\nperform large timescale and system size computations in extreme proximity to\nthe integrable limit. To demonstrate the scope of obtained results we report on\nthe application of the developed framework to Hamiltonian systems.\n</p>",
