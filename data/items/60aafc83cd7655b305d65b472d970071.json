  "description": "ATTENTION LAWYERS: THIS IS NOT THE HEISMAN TROPHY WE\"RE TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE DO NOT SUE US, AS WE DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY ANYWAYS. This episode is about the People's Heisman, an entirely different award in that it doesn't currently exist in trophy form and has never formally been awarded to anyone, and a very similar award in that we only sort of kind of decided who qualifies for it. Simply put, the People's Heisman is for the players we remember fondly not necessarily because they were the best or most accomplished but because they were just so very memorable. It's for a Quinton Flowers, or a Joel Lanning, or a Scooby Wright, or a Jared Lorezen (RIP). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
