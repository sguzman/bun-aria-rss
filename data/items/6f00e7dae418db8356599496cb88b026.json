  "description": "Psalms 120-134, designated the “Songs of Ascents,” form their own distinct collection within the Psalter. Who wrote these psalms and for what occasion? David Mitchell, a biblical scholar, musicologist, and Hebraist, is here to answer these questions. His book, The Songs of Ascents: Psalms 120 to 134 in the Worship of Jerusalem’s Temples  (Campbell Publications, 2015), aims to reconstruct the ritual and liturgical context in which the Songs of Ascents were first sung, providing not only a commentary for each of the psalms but also sheet music, attempting to recapture the original music through the Masoretic cantillation.\n\nDavid C. Mitchell is Director of Music for Holy Trinity Pro-Cathedral in Brussels. His publications include The Message of the Psalter (1997), The Songs of Ascents (2015), Messiah ben Joseph (2016), along with various papers and musical works. You can visit his website at: www.brightmorningstar.org.\n\n\n\nL. Michael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
