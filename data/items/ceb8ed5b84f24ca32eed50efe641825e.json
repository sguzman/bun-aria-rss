Joining the program is NFL Network Analyst and former NFL scout, Daniel Jeremiah from the Senior Bowl in Mobile. Pat and Daniel chat about why this year the Senior Bowl serves as the combine as well, why it's different than usual seasons, who's performing well and which QB's might be going where, and Daniel tells his travel experience down there that is one of the worst ever (25:44-44:57). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is Super Bowl Champion, NFL legend, 3x Pro Bowler, co-host of The Man-To-Man Pod, and friend of the show, Antoine Bethea to chat about the Super Bowl matchups, some Peyton Manning stories, and much more (46:29-1:08:29). Also joining the program is ESPN MMA Insider and friend of the show, Ariel Helwani to chat about the Bills being defeated, not being able to find him anywhere on TV, and how everything has been going since he mushed last weekend (1:08:31-1:25:08).
