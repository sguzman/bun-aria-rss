I met Giovanni several years ago and loved his wines and his family story. This podcast is so many things all at once:</p> <ul> <li>A great education on the Roero region, by the most famed producer there</li> <li>The story of a grape that was reborn in this place</li> <li>A lesson in the politics of the Piedmont and how some simple choices have brought fame to Barolo and Barbaresco and kept Roero down</li> <li>A fascinating family story that includes a talented champion of Roero, horrible tragedy, triumph of a widow who had nothing to do with wine and her unbelievable strength of character and perseverance for the legacy of her kids, and the current generation (Giovanni) with its shining positivity, great vision and promise of a great future for the <a href= \"http://www.matteocorreggia.com/en/homepage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Correggia</a> family and its wines.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/correggia_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"192\" /></p> <p><br /> I truly love the wines of <a href= \"http://www.matteocorreggia.com/en/homepage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Matteo Correggia</a> and I believe that the Nebbiolos he makes  (just called Roero on the bottle) are the exact style of wine so many of us love – elegance, minerality, balance with none of the heaviness or the tannins that we sometimes get from Barolo. The Arneis, it goes without saying, is a white for the ages – a minerally, floral, saline wine with real gravity and the Barbera also has a lighter touch than some of the versions from over the river. Although hard to find, Giovanni’s Brachetto is as tasty as he will describe as well.</p> <p> </p> <p>I have to say that in interviewing <a href= \"http://www.matteocorreggia.com/en/homepage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Giovanni</a> and then in editing this show, I laughed and teared up many times. I felt indignant on his behalf, and also triumphant. I hope the conversation we had evokes the same emotions in you. If nothing else, it’s a great story and a great education on an underestimated region.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ol> <li>We discuss Roero, its location across from Barberesco and Barolo, and what that means for the climate of the area versus the other famed Nebbiolo areas of Piedmont<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li style=\"text-align: left;\">Giovanni describes the soil types and how a small sea that once existed here, as well as the changing course of the Tanaro River, created a terroir with seashells, a canyon, and steep slopes covered in sandy soil that imbues the wines with a unique minerality that only exists in Roero<br /> <br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.matteocorreggia.com/en/homepage/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/1EE73BD2-97F1-4046-A815-CFC1A1927F5A.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"302\" height=\"403\" /></a><em style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Val </em><span style= \"font-size: xx-small;\"><em>dei Preti Vineyard, </em></span><em style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Matteo Correggia.

We talk about Matteo’s early relationship with the founder of Slow Food, Carlo Petrini, and how that led to great opportunities for the winery and the philosophy around organics.
