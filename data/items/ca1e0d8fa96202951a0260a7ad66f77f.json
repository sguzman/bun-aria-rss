  "description": "Elements of Visual Design in the Landscape (Routledge, 2019) presents a vocabulary of visual design, structured in a logical and easy to follow sequence. It is profusely illustrated using both abstract and real examples taken from a wide range of international locations together with cross referencing between related principles and case studies demonstrating how the principles can be applied in practice.\nThe visual aspects of design have often been treated as 'cosmetic' and therefore not meriting attention or purely subjective and therefore open to personal preference. Few attempts have been made to explain how we see the landscape in any rational and structured way, and to demonstrate how visually creative design and management can be undertaken. This book aims to fill that gap.\nSimon Bell is a forester and landscape architect. He is Chair Professor and Head of the Chair of Landscape Architecture at this Estonian University of Life Sciences and Associate Director of the OPENspace Research Centre at the Edinburgh School of Architecture and landscape Architecture at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
