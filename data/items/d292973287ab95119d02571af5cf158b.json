  "description": "<p>David is an author and environmentalist. He is very concerned about global warming and the consequences that will have on the planet and its inhabitants. During his discussion with Joe he paints a dark picture of our future over the next 30 years if we donâ€™t clean up our act. I got a lot out of their talk and really enjoyed reviewing it.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
