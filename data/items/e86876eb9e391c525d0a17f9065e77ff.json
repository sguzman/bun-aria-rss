  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about all the drama surrounding Sunday Night Football between the Buccaneers and Chiefs in New England, all the different quotes allegedly coming from sources close to Bill, Tom, and Bob Kraft, why Connor is incredibly worried about the game, and all the other stories from around the NFL as we get ready for week 4. Joining Pat and AJ for Coach Us Up Wednesday is a man with 37 years of experience coaching, the former Head Coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano. Pat, Chuck, and AJ chat about Matt Nagy's situation in Chicago, what mindset Bill Belichick has going into Sunday, how a Coach handles a guy like Carson Wentz, who plays too reckless for his own good, and what type of things surprised him this weekend in the NFL (28:42-50:31). Later, joining the show is 9 year NFL veteran on the Defensive Line, Chicago Bear, San Francisco 49er and Penn State legend, Spice Adams. Pat and Spice chat about what's going on in Chicago, the Bears moving to Arlington Park, his thoughts on the taunting and roughing the passer penalties in the NFL, what he's been doing since retirement, and much much more (1:17:56-1:39:07).
