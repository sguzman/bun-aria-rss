  "title": "Episode 114: Tim Legler",
  "description": "Ok let's be honest, there are some basketball conversations - whether it be on TV, podcast or whatever - that just don't deliver anything concrete or new. Well, it's pretty much an ironclad lock that today's episode of the OM3 won't leave you feeling that way. That's because joining the pod is former NBA 10 year vet and current ESPN and Sirius XM NBA analyst Tim Legler, and the sheer amount of hoops talk that is covered is staggering. From a complete breakdown of the playoffs thus far, to Legler's playing career, what it was like playing in the 90's, the evolution of the game, social media pitfalls, Kobe and MJ, and more, there isn't much that wasn't discussed. An amazing pod for any hooper, especially with the playoffs in full swing. Don’t miss it.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
