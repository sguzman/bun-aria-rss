  "description": "This is the story of Phil Hartman and the episode is a little different than some we’ve done in the past. We all know Ash loves an “Old Hollywood” kind of case, this one while not very old at all fits under the umbrella. Phil Hartman was one of the most beloved comedians of all times, often referred to as, “The Man of 1000 voices.” When you dive into his life as a whole you find all kinds of hidden gems, like the fact that Phil had a run in with Jimi Hendrix, and so many more little anecdotes like that! Unfortunately, Phil was taken from this world far too soon and in such a horrific way. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/You-Might-Remember-Me-Hartman-ebook/dp/B00IQOJE40\" target=\"_blank\">You Might Remember Me by Mike Thomas<br>\n</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Live-New-York-Complete-Uncensored/dp/031629506X\" target=\"_blank\">Live from New York: The Complete Uncensored History of Saturday night Live as told by its stars writers and guests (James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales)<br>\n</a><br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: Get sixteen free meals, plus three gifts, with code morbid16 at <a href=\"http://HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16\" target=\"_blank\">HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16</a><br>\n<br>\nBetterHelp: This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp and Morbid listeners get 10% off their first month at <a href=\"http://BetterHelp.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">BetterHelp.com/morbid</a><br>\n<br>\nRothy’s: New customers get $20 off your first purchase at <a href=\"http://rothys.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">rothys.com/MORBID</a><br>\n<br>\nNative: Go to <a href=\"http://NativeDeo.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">NativeDeo.com/morbid</a>, or use promo code morbid at checkout, and get twenty percent off your first order.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
