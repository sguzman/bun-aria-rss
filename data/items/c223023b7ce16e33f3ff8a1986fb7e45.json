  "description": "<p>We start the show trying to clear the air from a SHOCKING event last week between Jake and Hank (3:24 - 11:25). Medina Spirit got caught doping and Bob Baffert's explanation is hilarious (11:25 - 26:51). Who's back of the week including dick punching, Canelo Alvarez and Rory McIlroy (26:51 - 47:21). Our good friend Dan Haren joins the show to talk some baseball, no hitters, his dear pug that passed away, avoiding the dentist and pimping home runs (47:21 - 86:54). We finish with Embrace Debate with DK Metcalf and Dogecoin update after Elon Musk's SNL appearance.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
