News headlines have left many concerned, and with more questions than ever, so the team devotes a large chunk of the show to unpacking the findings of the report, and emphasising hope and action over doom and gloom. Linked to the issue of climate change is the agricultural industry’s impact on the environment, but there’s hope there too. The team explains how <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133470-900-real-milk-no-cows-needed-lab-made-dairy-products-are-now-a-reality/'>precision fermentation technology is being used to create guilt-free milk, cheese and ice-cream</a>! And the team finds out about a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2286616-insect-killing-plant-found-by-australian-highway-is-new-to-science/'>killer tobacco plant</a> - a newly-described species that kills insects and could provide a natural solution to pest control. On the pod are Rowan Hooper, Penny Sarchet, Graham Lawton and Adam Vaughan.
