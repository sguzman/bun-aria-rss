  "description": "Public spaces tend to over-represent facilities and spatial design for the young and the middle-aged, whereas elderly citizens are all too often neglected by contemporary urban design practice. Dominique Hauderowicz and Kristian Ly Serena's edited volume Age-Inclusive Public Space (Hatje Cantz, 2020) establishes a dialogue between architects and academic contributors from a range of disciplines.\nCollecting examples and showcasing architectural case studies as well as providing a broad portrait of age-inclusive design methodology, it provides practitioners with inspiration and theoretical and practical knowledge on how to design public space to meet the needs of people of all ages.\nDrawings, photographs and illustrations of contemporary built environments, historic gardens, art installations and atmospheric landscapes provide a range of contexts for spatial practitioners of all stripes.\nMarshall Poe is the editor of the New Books Network.
