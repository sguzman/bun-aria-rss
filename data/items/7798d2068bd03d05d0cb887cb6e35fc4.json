The cult mentality of Red Pill think, how they monetise it, the narrative they are selling to their followers, and how this can result in some young men being funnelled into the alt-right pipeline.\n\nI looked into influencers like Fresh and Fit, Kevin Samuels, Rich Cooper, Anthony Dream Johnson of the 21 Convention, Donovan Sharpe, Roosh V, Owen Cook and Julien Blanc to weave together how they are selling the ‘alpha male’ dream to their followers - some of whom will end up classing themselves as incels, after realising that the ‘foolproof’ pickup artist game techniques don’t work for them.\n\nAnd they’re all having their misogynistic ideas backed up by the one and only Jordan B Peterson, of course.\n\nSources:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2VawDpszhhOsGxhhve5F8u4yig2g4cdyBd-8v9ui5k/edit?usp=sharing \n\n0:00 Intro\n3:51 RedPill YouTube Channels & Podcasts\n24:39 Spelling Out Red Pill Theory\n28:17 Debunking 'Hypergamy'\n33:44 Debunking 'Monkey-Branching'\n37:42 Debunking the Dating Apps 'Evidence' for Hypergamy\n48:29 **CW** Debunking 'R Culture is a Myth'\n54:37 **CW** Debunking the 'False R Accusation Epidemic'\n1:00:02 Debunking 'Single Mothers Raise Criminals'\n1:02:35 Debunking 'The Wage Gap is a Myth'\n1:07:00 Debunking 'Women are Unhappy bc of Feminism'\n1:11:16 Bad Female/Male Anatomy\n1:15:06 The Alt-Right Pipeline **CW Racism/Sexism**\n1:22:15 The Manosphere's 'Edgy' Humour **CW R/SA**\n1:26:53 PUAs **CW R/SA**\n1:30:50 **CW** The Manosphere & Violence against Women\n1:35:28 Extremism **CW Racism/R/SA/DV**\n1:39:17 Misogyny not being taken seriously\n1:40:53 The Manosphere's \"Experts\"\n1:43:22 MRAs\n1:44:53 The Solution?\n1:46:46 Song & Outro\n\nAFFILIATE LINKS:\nCAMERA EQUIPMENT\nMy camera: https://amzn.to/3BtyOj6\nMy lens: https://amzn.to/3baf7Tg\nMy ringlight: https://amzn.to/3e9D5zZ\nMy teleprompter: https://amzn.to/3bWBTxb\nMy mic: https://amzn.to/3uR6wwQ\nMic mount: https://amzn.to/3e2dx81\nGreen screen: https://amzn.to/2NYssp1\nVideos are edited with Adobe Premiere Pro, I also use Photoshop for thumbnails etc.\nMUSIC EQUIPMENT\nAbleton Push 2: https://amzn.to/3qhEWoF\nKeyboard: https://amzn.to/3qgmsVE\nAudio Interface: https://amzn.to/3beqs4E\nAbleton Live Suite software: https://amzn.to/3bbfvks\nKomplete 13 Ultimate software: https://amzn.to/3bZahaB\nSoundproofing: https://amzn.to/3uQC5Xv and https://amzn.to/2NW6jHO\nSpeakers: https://amzn.to/3bVJ4Wo\nHeadphones: https://amzn.to/2PwMdo8",
