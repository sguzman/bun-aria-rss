He met some key people that would change his life forever and spent over 20 years together on the road as the lead guitarist for Montgomery Gentry while being sponsored by Jim Beam. After the tragic passing of Troy Montgomery, it sent Bo to a dark place and he needed something. After a fateful run-in with Jimmy Russell while having dinner with Fred Noe, he started giving tours at Wild Turkey and discovered a new passion and became one of their esteemed Brand Builders.
