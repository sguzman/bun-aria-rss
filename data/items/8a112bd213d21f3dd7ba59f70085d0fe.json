He’s now a published author as well. In this episode we chat about his new book, <em>The End is Always Near</em>. The conversation covers more than should theoretically be possible to cover in little over an hour—from Dan’s understanding for Thanos’ plight to the collapse of civilizations, the concept of Gross National Happiness, the delusion of infinite growth in a finite system, Jared Diamond, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, meteors, nuclear weapons, James Burke, the need for nuance, the future of <em>Common Sense</em>, what to do when people can’t agree on basic evidence, social media, incredibly fast historical changes, and the nicest guilt trip in Dan’s life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"> If you'd like to keep following my work on Luminary, please follow my personal link to their platform to sign up.
