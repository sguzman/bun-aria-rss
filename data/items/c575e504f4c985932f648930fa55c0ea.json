  "description": "Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” enters the latest season of Stranger Things during a brooding high-school hallway scene right out of the John Hughes playbook, and it has since bounded up the charts, hitting No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and performing better now than when it peaked at No. 30 upon release. Stranger Things, whose latest season has logged more viewer minutes for Netflix than any other English-language release to date, has leaned heavily on ’80s nostalgia since its premiere in 2016: Its iconic theme song is reminiscent of John Carpenter B-movies, and, in an email, used-instrument resale site Reverb.com tells us the show has boosted interest in analog synthesizers.\n\n“Running Up That Hill,” then, is a natural fit for the show, and it plays a pivotal, spoiler-ridden plot point in the show, requiring us to hear the hook multiple times throughout the season — a perfect earworm. But its success is owed to more than just repetition. It waffles between major and minor, and the show’s composers, Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, told Switched on Pop that both it and the rest of the Stranger Things score have “moments of darkness and lightness in it, constantly trading places.” Plus, they’re composed from the same set of instruments: classic synthesizers and drum machines like the LinnDrum. The song is part and parcel with the soundtrack itself: “There’s these little melodies that we always refer to as ‘And then the Kate Bush part comes in,’” Dixon says.\n\nListen to Switched On Pop to hear how Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” is an exquisite song placement and hear how it blends seamlessly with the Stranger Things soundtrack.\n\nMORE\nCheck out Reverb Machine’s sounds of Kate Bush\nReverb.com made a tutorial on the synth sounds of Stranger Things\nThe story of the Kate Bush renaissance from The Ringer\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Stranger Things\n\nKate Bush - Running Up That Hill\n\nDead Or Alive - You Spin Me Round\n\nTalking Heads - Psycho Killer\n\nMusical Youth - Pass the Dutchie \n\nCarly Rae Jepsen - Cut To The Feeling\n\nThe Weeknd - Blinding Lights \n\nPrince - When Doves Cry\n\nPhil Collins - Sussudio\n\nTangerine Dream - Sorcerer Theme Song\n\nJohn Carpenter - Night\n\nS U R V I V E - A.H.B.\n\nS U R V I V E - High Rise \n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Eggo in the Snow\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - She Wants Me to Find Her\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Starcourt\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Eight Fifteen\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - Boys and Girls\n\nKyle Dixon & Michael Stein - The Ceiling is Beautiful\n\nKate Bush - Waking the Witch\n\nKate Bush - Hammer Horror\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
