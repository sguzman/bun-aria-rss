  "description": "<p>The interplay between disease spreading and personal risk perception is of\nkey importance for modelling the spread of infectious diseases. We propose a\nplanar system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the\nco-evolution of a spreading phenomenon and the average link density in the\npersonal contact network. Contrary to standard epidemic models,we assume that\nthe contact network changes based on the current prevalence of the disease in\nthe population, i.e.\\ it adapts to the current state of the epidemic. We assume\nthat personal risk perception is described using two functional responses: one\nfor link-breaking and one for link-creation. The focus is on applying the model\nto epidemics, but we highlight other possible fields of application. We derive\nan explicit form for the basic reproduction number and guarantee the existence\nof at least one endemic equilibrium, for all possible functional responses.\nMoreover, we show that for all functional responses, limit cycles do not exist.\n</p>",
