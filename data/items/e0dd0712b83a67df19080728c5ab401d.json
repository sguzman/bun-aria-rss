  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nBhairavi Raman reflects on her early love for the violin, the questions that push her musical practice to new parameters, and expands on her inquiries into the space between Western and Carnatic classical music.\n\nBhairavi Raman is an Indian-Australian violinist, classically trained in Western and Carnatic forms. She merges concepts and techniques to express her bicultural identity, representing a formidable blend of traditional knowledge honed in India, technical mastery, musical boldness and an authentically Melbournian voice.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/yl-hooi-bhairavi-raman-with-nanthesh-sivarajah\n\nRitual Community Music\n10 July 2022\nThe Oratory, Abbotsford Convent\nPresented by Abbotsford Convent and Liquid Architecture\n\nImage: Amar Ramesh\n\nProduced by Mara Schwerdtfeger. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
