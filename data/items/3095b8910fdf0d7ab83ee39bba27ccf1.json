We talk to a gentleman who had an encounter with a Sasquatch back in the 1940's that appeared to be carrying a person who came up missing. It's a strange tale that happened in Oregon.</p> <p>In the Missing 411 books, a lot of the people who come up missing do so without their clothes. We talk to a gentleman who had an encounter and the result of the encounter is very strange and ties into a lot of missing people.</p> <p>The final encounter we speak with Amanda who has Sasquatch on her property and one of the creatures chased her 10 year old son.</p>",
