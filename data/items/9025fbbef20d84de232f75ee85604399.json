  "description": "<p>Neil Gaiman started 2013's The Ocean at the End of the Lane as a novella for his wife, who \"doesn't really like fantasy.\" This gives the book a different vibe from some of Gaiman's other work, though any book that features a tattered sentient bedsheet clears the \"fantastical\" bar for us. </p><p>This breezy book deals mostly in Bradbury-esque musings on the nature of childhood and adulthood, and we spend a lot of time on that as well as the Great Page Count Race of 2016 and our new t-shirt empire.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
