  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Many of the personal care products that are marketed as healthy have actually been chemicalized overtime to contain carcinogens and endocrine-disrupting compounds. These little hits of toxic chemicals can accumulate in our bodies over time and wreak havoc on our overall health. This is what Darin Olein refers to as fatal conveniences.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On today’s show, we’re diving into common fatal conveniences like store-bought mouthwashes, cough syrup, commercial flights, laptops, and so much more. But Darin isn’t here to bombard you with scare tactics about the products you might be using. Instead, he’s going to inform you on how to find healthy alternatives to your personal care products and ways to reduce your exposure to these fatal conveniences.</p> <p class=\"p1\">If you want to eliminate or mitigate your exposure to common harmful toxins, Darin is a well-informed and conscious resource on this subject. I hope you’ll leave this episode with at least one small tweak you can make to support your health, your household, and the environment.
