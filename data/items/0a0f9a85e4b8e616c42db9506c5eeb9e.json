  "description": "<p>Standing at the edge of a desert, surveying the stars on a December morning, the speaker in this poem observes the everything of everything. He is so small; the universe is so loud and so silent. Thinking about the enormity of all this, he thinks of the smallness of the hearts of birds, wasps, moths, bats, and dragonflies — all flying things around him, suspended in space, like the earth is suspended in space. His own heart, too, echoes the universe’s noise.</p><p><strong>Alberto Ríos</strong> is Arizona’s inaugural poet laureate and a recent chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, as well as the author of twelve collections of poetry, most recently, <i>Not Go Away Is My Name</i>. Published in the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Paris Review</i>, <i>Ploughshares</i>, and other journals, he has also written three short story collections and a memoir, <i>Capirotada</i>, about growing up on the Mexican border.  Ríos is also the host of the PBS programs Art in the 48 and Books & Co. University Professor of Letters, Regents’ Professor, Virginia G. Piper Chair in Creative Writing, and the Katharine C. Turner Chair in English, Ríos has taught at Arizona State University since 1982.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/alberto-rios-december-morning-in-the-desert/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
