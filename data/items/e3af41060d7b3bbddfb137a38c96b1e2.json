  "description": "\"Investing is a matter of probabilities... Not how things should be\"   Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   Today I’m joined by the one-of-a-kind, Chris MacIntosh - Co-Manager of the Asymmetric Opportunities Fund and founder & owner of the popular financial publication, Capitalist Exploits.   Chris has a track-record unlike anyone I’ve met.   Whether it’s speculating on events like Brexit and Trump’s victory, to predicting Bitcoin’s uprising or the collapse of the South African Rand - Chris has never been afraid to ask the questions people don’t want to.   He focuses on macroeconomic trends that contribute to massive market disconnects.   He calls it: Exploiting asymmetry in the markets...   Tune in as Chris unfolds his theses on the topics of bitcoin, blockchain, private-equity, European bond markets, and one hated energy sector that will be the darling of the next decade.   In a world riddled with dangerous thoughts and unsound monetary shenanigans, you’ve come to the right place.   Just click here to listen...   Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
