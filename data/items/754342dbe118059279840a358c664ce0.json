  "description": "<p><p>With Army-Navy set to kickoff this weekend, we bring you a jam-packed show. The hosts of Pardon My Take (Big Cat & PFT Commenter) joins us to break down some prop bets like \"How many times will Captain Cons step on the field?\" and \"Will there be more than 20 passes thrown?\" Angelo Paolantonio (played by Barstool's very own Rone) joins the show to break the game down from a Philly correspondent's point of view. We call up Navy football alum/New England Patriot Joe Cardona and Army football alum/Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva to get their predictions for the game. We finish the show by interviewing Ross Greenburg, who has beenÂ filming with Navy football all season for a Showtime documentary. Also we talk about Donald Trump's dentures.
