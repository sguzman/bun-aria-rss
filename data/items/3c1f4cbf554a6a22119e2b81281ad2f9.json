They have the potential to become many other types of tissue—they are essentially like a smart-bomb that we can use to target a specific problem. But the magic doesn’t stop there. Not only can stem cells home in on damaged cells and tissues, they then send signals to those damaged cells or tissues encouraging them to heal. As someone who is always trying to improve my own health, and since I want to live to be 120, I love to seek out the latest therapies and try them myself so I can truly understand the benefits and improve my longevity.</p><br><p>27 years ago I had surgery for a ruptured disk and I’ve been plagued with issues from that as I’ve aged (which I know many of you can relate to); I was excited to try stem cell therapy as a treatment option for my own pain and mobility. So today on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> podcast, I’m going to share my conversation with the very doctors I trusted to do my own stem cell makeover. Dr. Harry Adelson, Dr. Amy Killen, and Dr. Duckworth sat down with me at Docere Clinics in Park City, Utah to talk about regenerative medicine and what stem cell therapy can do for every part of the body from joints to hair and even our sex organs.</p><br><p>Learn more about Dr. Adelson’s work by visiting <a href=\"https://docereclinics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://docereclinics.com</a></p><p>Learn more about Dr. Killen’s work by visiting <a href=\"https://doceremedical.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://doceremedical.com</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
