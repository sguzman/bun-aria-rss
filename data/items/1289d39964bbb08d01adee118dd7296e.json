  "title": "Halloween Recap, QR Codes in China & Coach Harsin Fired | Daily Best of November 1 | Rick & Bubba",
  "description": "We recap our Halloween festivities and decide there's nothing cuter than a toddler dressed as Elvis. China's authoritarian government gets even spookier, as it forces the Chinese people to scan QR codes to access transportation, food, and even their homes. Auburn's head football coach, Bryan Harsin, is fired mid-season after going 3 for 5. And we suggest women's soccer should allow fighting between the players, kinda like hockey, to increase viewership.\nSponsor: Allegiance Gold - We recommend you diversify with Gold & Silver. Allegiance Gold can help you protect your IRA or 401K with physical gold and silver, or, if you prefer, have it delivered securely, right to your front door. Their approach is different; they focus on educating and developing a long-term strategy that's right for YOU.
