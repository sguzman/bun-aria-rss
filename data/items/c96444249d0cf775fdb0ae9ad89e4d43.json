We all know you gotta put in the time to learn your craft, but what’s the gap between being technically proficient and really truly finding yourself creatively?\n\nI think the secret is finding yourself personally.\n\nToday on the show we have designer and lettering artist Cymone Wilder. I wanted to have Cymone on the show not only because her work is fantastic, but also because as I started to see her work pop up everywhere, I also noticed that it was on the back of a personal journey. I wanted to see what the catalyst of this journey really was for Cymone and her answers did not disappoint!!\n\nThis episode is a moving personal story mixed with talking shop and creative mechanics that I’m sure will bring a lot of pep to your step!",
