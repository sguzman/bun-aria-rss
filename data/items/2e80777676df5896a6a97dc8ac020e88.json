  "description": "<p>For a certain subset of HTM listeners, it might be easy to not see the forest for the trees. You might naturally be drawn to the finer details of personal finance like expense ratios and Excel formulas in an attempt to ensure that you’re living the most efficient and optimized life that you possibly can. But, that’s when the subtle shift can take place. That’s when the <em>means</em> to the end begins to overshadow the actual end, which for many is to simply live a good and happy life. Instead, we should live our lives with the end in mind and that’s why we’re talking with Dr. Jordan Grumet, also known as Doc G. Jordan was an internal medicine physician when he discovered the personal finance community. Since then he started an award winning podcast and is now the author of Taking Stock: A Hospice Doctor's Advice on Financial Independence, Building Wealth, and Living a Regret-Free Life, which will be published in a couple of weeks. Listen as we discuss meaningful work, resisting the traditional American work culture, what it takes to set priorities in life, and much more!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed an Indolence, which is an American sour, by Pretentious Barrel House!
