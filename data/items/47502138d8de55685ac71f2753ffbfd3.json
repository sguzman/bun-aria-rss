Naturally, many scientists have research they'd like to do that involve the telescope. Today on the show, Emily talks with correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce about who gets time on it, and how decision-makers are working to stay focused on the proposed science instead of who will be doing it, in the hopes of making the process fair for all proposals.<br/><br/>For more of Nell's reporting, check out, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/01/11/1071752559/who-gets-to-use-nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-astronomers-work-to-fight-bias\">Who gets to use NASA's James Webb Space Telescope?
