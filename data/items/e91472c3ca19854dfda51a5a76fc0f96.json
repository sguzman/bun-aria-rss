Actor and former SNL cast member Sasheer Zamata tells Tig how she found her later-in-life bestie — none other than fellow comedian Nicole Byer — now her co-host on the podcast Best Friends. Sasheer and Tig give advice on how to keep kids from binging on granola bars first thing in the morning and brainstorm about how humor can rescue someone from a sticky situation. Sasheer, who stars in the Hulu series Woke, gives her take on the word \"woke\" and dishes about her first crush — hint: he's out of this world!</p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Betterhelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy). </p>\n<p>Need advice?
