  "description": "Natasha Razouk wants to give her 7-year-old the best possible life. She buys big boxes of fresh tomatoes at Costco, and she gets her daughter warm boots, a good coat, and school supplies each year. \nBut all that is expensive. Natasha’s daughter grows out of clothes quickly, and she needs books and health care and day care. That’s why the Canadian government gives every parent, including Natasha, a little money each month — a few hundred Canadian dollars — to help cover the cost of raising a child. \nIt’s called the “child benefit.” In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised it would lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. Now, a number of US presidential candidates have signed onto a similar proposal.\nIn this episode, we see whether the Canadian child benefit delivered on Prime Minister Trudeau’s promise. We find out how that money changed Natasha’s life and her daughter’s. And we look at what US presidential candidates can learn from our neighbors to the north.\nWe always want to hear from you! Please send comments and questions to impact@vox.com.\nFurther listening and reading: \n\nVox’s Dylan Matthews explains what child benefits are and the plan to introduce one in the US.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences recently studied child benefits as a tool to cut child poverty in half; here’s what it found.\n\nIn the episode, we talk about a graph Kevin Milligan drew.
