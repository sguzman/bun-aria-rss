  "description": "<p>This special podcast episode features the first-ever conversation between Oprah and the five exonerated men who were once known as The Central Park Five. Their story is dramatically told in the Netflix series, “When They See Us,” a historical account of the five teenagers wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in Central Park in 1989. The four-part Netflix series focuses on the young men—Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise—who were sentenced between five and 15 years in prison and juvenile detention centers. In 2002, all five men were exonerated of their crimes after DNA evidence and a confession from the lone attacker, Matias Reyes, proved their innocence.</p><p> </p>\n",
