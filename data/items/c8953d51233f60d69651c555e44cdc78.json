  "description": "During the 2016, journalist Salena Zito, who is based in Western Pennsylvania, sensed a brewing conservative populist in the white working-class when many thought the election would be determined by other demographic groups. Her dispatches from the back roads proved prescient when Donald Trump won the presidency. She teamed up with Republican political consultant and data guru Brad Todd to produce The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics (Crown Forum, 2018). The authors created an in-depth survey of Trump voters, which allowed them to define seven archetypes of people who composed the new political coalition that hadn’t been previously detected. In the book, Zito also introduces readers to some of people she met on the campaign trail who exemplify the different profiles. The authors argue that no matter what happens with the Trump presidency, the Great Revolt has disrupted the two-party system to such an extent that the Democratic and Republican parties will no longer “have the same sway.”\n\n\n\nBill Scher is a Contributing Editor for POLITICO Magazine. He has provided political commentary on CNN, NPR and MSNBC. He has been published in The New York Times, The New Republic, and The New York Daily News among other publications. He is author of Wait! Don’t Move to Canada, published by Rodale in 2006.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
