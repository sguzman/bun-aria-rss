  "description": "<p>In this episode, Grant tells a familiar story from a less-popular angle. Venezuelan oil interests, for-profit media, and a right-wing coalition launched a coup against the early years of Hugo Chavez' presidency. It also had all the hallmarks of 21st Century American Imperialism, but with a veneer of deniability. Who planted the seeds of today's unrest? How can you see true intent through rhetoric? Why hasn't Elliott Abrams been tried for war crimes?</p>\n<p>Links!</p>\n<ul><li><a href='https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Venezuela_2009.pdf'>Text of the 1999 Constitution</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1k065Qe9lE'>Al Jazeera mini-documentary on the events of 2002</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/8133'>50 Truths about Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela'>Venezuela coup linked to Bush team - The Guardian</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://soundcloud.com/sex_archie'>SEX ARCHIE</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please help our show succeed by sharing it.
