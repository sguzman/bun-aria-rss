  "description": "<p>Dave Dameshek is joined in Studio 66 by Cleveland Browns legend Willie Mcginest and the 2002 first overall selection, David Carr, to kibitz about the return of their favorite show <em>The Hills </em>(2:10). The group also pokes fun at the shirtless underwear ad that Baker Mayfield did with a tiger while leaning on a Rolls Royce (4:10). Shek asks David and Willie who the best player they've ever played with was (8:20) and if Brian Hoyer became the Patriots starting QB this season could he win the AFC East (13:50)? Finally, we hear from Eddie Spaghetti who had the chance to speak with Mark Wahlberg before the release of his new movie, <em>Mile 22</em>, about his Patriots losing the Super Bowl and where Tom Brady ranks all-time in Boston sports (29:07).</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
