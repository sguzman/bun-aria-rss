Today on the show, we revisit the worst night of clashes between protestors and police in Ferguson.\nThis episode originally aired in August 2019 and is part of Ferguson Revisited, a series from What Next looking back at Michael Brown’s death, the protests that followed, and their legacy five years later. \nGuest: Joel Anderson, writer at Slate, co-host of Hang Up and Listen, and the host of season 3 of Slow Burn.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
