  "description": "<p>June 23, 2018. Randle, Washington. Benjamin Eastman III, or Ben as his friends and family liked to call him, went missing after leaving his house early one morning. His father, BJ, and other family and friends worked to get the word out to find Ben and to bring him home. Just days later, though, his body was located. Based on his injuries, he had been cruelly assaulted before being killed. Detectives on the case didn't have much trouble figuring out who had killed the 16 year old. Who did was surprising as it turned out to be a lifelong friend and his older brother.&nbsp;The real question was why they did it and who was in on the plot.
