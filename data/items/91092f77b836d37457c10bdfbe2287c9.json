Come with us on a magical journey as we share the history and hauntings of Disneyland! The Moment in Oddity features famous people's weird pets and This Day in History features the fire at Paris' Rue Jean Goujon.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and video can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-44-haunted-disneyland.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-44-haunted-disneyland.html</a></p>",
