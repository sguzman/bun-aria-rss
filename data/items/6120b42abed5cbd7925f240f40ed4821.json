It's unlikely that Watson will be moved, but the thought at least has to be entertained at this point. JJ details some of the inner workings of the Houston organization and their leadership. The guys also take a look at the other GM and head coach vacancies around the league and how we expect those situations to develop (26:00). \n*Note: This episode was recorded prior to the Eagles firing Doug Pederson.
