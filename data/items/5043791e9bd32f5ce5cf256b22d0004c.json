  "title": "PMS 2.0 140 - Justin Tucker, Mike Florio, & More NFL Chatter",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by friend of the show, owner and creator of Pro Football Talk, Mike Florio. They discuss Florio’s bombshell on Twitter a few days ago that he has an inkling that Andrew Luck will be the Las Vegas Raiders Quarterback to start the 2020 season, and what the Raiders would potentially have to give up in order to get his rights. Pat also asks Mike whether or not another coach will get fired before the end of the season, and where a possible landing spot for Ron Rivera might be, when Jason Garrett will be fired, and addresses the idea of Tom Brady potentially playing for a different team next year (1:57-12:07). Next, 4x All-Pro, 3x Pro Bowler, Super Bowl Champion, the most accurate kicker in NFL history, Baltimore Ravens Kicker, Justin Tucker calls in. Justin and Pat discuss his game winning kick against the 49ers in the miserable conditions in Baltimore this past weekend, what his mindset and ritual is before he lines up to kick, what he has seen in Lamar Jackson over the last two years and if there is anything he can point that has led to his massive success. He also chats about his relationship with Matthew McConaughey, his potential career as an opera singer, and why this Ravens team has bonded so quickly (12:09-32:40). Pat also reacts to the news that Adam Vinatieri has been dealing with a knee injury for some time and the Colts having to bring in a kicker and what that process is like, and why it magnifies how important having a great kicker is, and gives a couple of thoughts on some of the early lines from this weekend’s NFL games. Also included are a few calls from the radio show including questions about why Browns fans are having a hard time hating Duck Hodges, and whether or not the Chiefs have a shot to knock off the Patriots this weekend in Foxborough. Today’s show is a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
