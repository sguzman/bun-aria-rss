  "description": "Sean Drenth. Oct. 18, 2010. A Phoenix police sergeant seems to have a great life. He has a great marriage and a young child. He is also well respected in his department. One night, though, changes everything. He would be discovered on the ground outside of his patrol car. His life had ended by way of a shotgun that now rested vertically, barrel up, on his chest. According to the investigation, though, there are questions about the placement of the weapon. How could a shotgun discharge and come to rest as it did? Other evidence points to murder as well, but the medical examiner finds Drenth's death to be a suicide. Many in the department disagree with this finding. Did Sgt. Sean Drenth commit suicide? Or was he murdered...and why? Please take our survey.
