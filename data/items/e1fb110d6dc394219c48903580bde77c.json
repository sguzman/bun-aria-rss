  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss their favorite soundtracks.</p>\n<p><span><strong>Introducing the Band</strong></span>:</p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (@<u><a href=\"http://twitter.com/scotbertram\">ScotBertram</a></u>) and Jeff Blehar (@<u><a href=\"http://twitter.com/esotericcd\">EsotericCD</a></u>) with . . . no guest at all! Yes, this is a Very Special Episode of <em>Political Beats</em>, in which Arnold learns to avoid the local bike shop and Jessie finds out about the very real dangers of caffeine pills. In other words, this is PB’s second format-bucking episode where, instead of having on a guest to discuss her favorite artist, the subject is Scot and Jeff’s favorite soundtracks of all time.</p>\n<p>To give a general sense of how the show is structured, we begin by discussing soundtracks composed of all-new material then move to soundtracks made up of older songs, previously released. Finally, we look at the hybrid soundtracks with both vintage and fresh material. What makes a great soundtrack? Why aren’t certain candidates on our lists? Are there any that actually appear on both Scot and Jeff’s Top Ten? Listen to find out!</p>\n",
