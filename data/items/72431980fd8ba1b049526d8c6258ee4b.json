Eric's case had gone cold until last year when his car was suddenly found. However, that wasn't the only surprising turn of events in Eric's case. Today you will hear the rest of the tale that spans from a possibly faked death, to an airplane in Mississippi, and an investigation that found its way to Florida and back to Michigan. Eric's disappearance has never truly been dormant because every time investigators think they've found an answer, another turn of events changes everything.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Eric Franks, please call the Michigan State Police at 989-495-5555.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Boll & Branch</a>- To experience an entirely new standard of comfort, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bollandbranch.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bollandbranch.com</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Get 15% off your first set of sheets with promo code&nbsp;MIA.</p><p><a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QUIP</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://getquip.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GetQuip.com/VANISHED</a>&nbsp;and you'll get your first refill free.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
