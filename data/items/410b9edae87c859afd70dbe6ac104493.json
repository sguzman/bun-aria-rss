  "description": "<p>“I wanted to tell my story in a way that made you feel like you were having a beer with me. And…even though I delve into things like identity and politics and family history and things that things that I'm really excited to share with everybody, I want it to be accessible to people who might disagree with me or might not have experience with the things that I have experiences with.” From the Hollywood to the White House, Kal Penn’s careers have been anything but boring; he’s just published a very funny and honest memoir called <em>You Can’t Be Serious</em>, which covers the work and the people he loves and the lessons he’s learned. He joins us on the show to talk about growing up South Asian, stereotyping and <em>that</em> accent, Jhumpa Lahiri’s fiction and more. Featured books: You Can’t Be Serious by Kal Penn and Interpreter of Maladies and The Namesake, both by Jhumpa Lahiri. Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
