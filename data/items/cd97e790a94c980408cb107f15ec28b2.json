Author and folklorist Christopher Balzano follows lingering campus whispers and trails that vanish into the swamp to track down the urban legends and ghostly lore of Sunshine State love affairs that live on even after death.<br>\n<br>\nGet the book here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://amzn.to/3snKTTF&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2Jvhx7ki-hIoBZpoWDVGRh\">https://amzn.to/3snKTTF<br>\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Visit his site here: <a href=\"https://trippingonlegends.com/\">Tripping on Legends… – Standing at the Crossroads…</a></p>\n",
