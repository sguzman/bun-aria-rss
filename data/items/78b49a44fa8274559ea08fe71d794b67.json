  "description": "<p>Charlie is LIVE from FLASHPOINT LIVE in front of a group of students doing a rapid fire Q&A all about The College Scam. Charlie lays out his argument against college, and why generally college is a bad investment in 2022 America, putting the entire industry on trial. Other questions include: How do you identify RINOs? What is driving the rise in suicide among young people? What is Charlie's advice for young people who want to get into politics and why are young conservative candidates so much more conservative? What does Charlie recommend should happen for DACA kids? How should people effectively deal with censorship? How do we remove the stigma from discussing politics among Christians? And so much more! </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
