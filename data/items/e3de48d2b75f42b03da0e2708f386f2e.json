  "description": "<p>Multi-wavelength observations indicate that some starburst galaxies show a\ndominant non-thermal contribution from their central region. These active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN)-starburst composites are of special interest, as both\nphenomena on their own are potential sources of highly-energetic cosmic rays\nand associated gamma-ray and neutrino emission. In this work, a homogeneous,\nsteady-state two-zone multi-messenger model of the non-thermal emission from\nthe AGN corona as well as the circumnuclear starburst region is developed and\nsubsequently applied to the case of NGC 1068, which has recently shown some\nfirst indications of high-energy neutrino emission. Here, we show that the\nentire spectrum of multi-messenger data - from radio to gamma-rays including\nthe neutrino constraint - can be described very well if both, starburst and AGN\ncorona, are taken into account. Using only a single emission region is not\nsufficient.\n</p>",
