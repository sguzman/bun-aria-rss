Rob Paone is the founder of Proof of Talent, a recruiting and search firm that places candidates in professional roles in the crypto space. Few people are more equipped to discuss the job market in the cryptocurrency industry.</p> <p>Rob is also known by his Youtube persona, Crypto Bobby. He has transitioned into the space's premier career recruiter and is taking advantage of crypto's huge growth potential. In the legacy world, most of the profitable ideas and services have already been capitalized. Crypto exists on the other end of the spectrum, where the market gaps are vast and ripe for opportunity.</p> <p>Rob's fundamental approach for candidates seeking employment is one of bootstrapping. The market is geared towards those with a technical background, but the key is finding what sets you apart and proving it. Passion and knowledge should naturally turn into finding like-minded communities and contributing.</p> <p>There is a premium on authenticity, commitment, and value. For those actively seeking a profession in crypto, there are ways to get involved and make yourself invaluable. Are you a tourist, or are you a settler?</p> <p>------<br /> RESOURCES:</p> <p>Proof of Talent:<br /> <a href= \"https://proofoftalent.co/\">https://proofoftalent.co/</a> </p> <p>Rob on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/crypto_bobby?s=20\">https://twitter.com/crypto_bobby?s=20</a> <br />  ------<br /> THIS WEEK ON BANKLESS:</p> <p>⚒️ How to Stream Money (3/30): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-stream-money\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-stream-money</a> <br />  🎙️ EIP-1559 With Hasu (3/29): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-eip-1559-hasu\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-eip-1559-hasu</a> <br />  📈 Market Monday (3/29): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/visa-is-going-to-pay-eth-holders\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/visa-is-going-to-pay-eth-holders</a> <br />  🧢 Weekly Action Recap (3/27): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/fidelitys-bitcoin-etf-weekly-recap\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/fidelitys-bitcoin-etf-weekly-recap</a> <br />  🗞️ Weekly Rollup (3/26): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-uniswap-v3-fidelity-etf-btc\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-uniswap-v3-fidelity-etf-btc</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
