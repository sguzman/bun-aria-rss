  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this impeachment debate is over objective standard versus subjective conclusion when it comes to the definition of a high-crime or misdemeanor. Will we use the Constitution as our standard or the opinions of politicians. Moreover, can we in good faith remove a President from office based on these unconstitutional phrases? Where is their eye-witness? There isn't one. Speaking with passion and drama doesn't make it anymore impeachable. The irony of suggesting that a crime is not necessary despite the precedent of President Johnson’s acquittal is in effect rewriting the impeachment clause. Given the basis established in our constitution and the precedent of other impeachments (derived from British common law) the task at hand is to define and make the case for these platitudes. So clearly, \"Abuse of Power\" and \"Obstruction of Congress\" don't match the gravity of \"Treason\" and \"Bribery\" and with no crime, this case becomes weaker and weaker. Later, Sen Ted Cruz calls the show for his first interview since the Senate Impeachment trial began. Cruz agrees that the standard of an impeachable offense has not been met. He added that calling Hunter Biden as a witness is becoming increasingly more important, should new additional witnesses be added. Afterward, Congressman Jim Jordan joins the program to discuss exactly what happened leading up to the impeachment hearings.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
