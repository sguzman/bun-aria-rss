I fell in love with them when they released \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1MtHTmOWEN7bpDj8sgCmHt?si=fAstpGhKQmuDigHYn0u6_A\">Anymore</a>\" and even more so with \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0RjtEnaoDqLhxCRc3i9q3J?si=Y0LaaTEORPWmR3j4boYQMw\">Down Through</a>.\" I had to have Corey Coffman from the band on the podcast to pick his brain and find out more about life in Colorado, recording bands and the process of making music. It's metaphysical, it's fun and above all...a great new band you need to check out.
