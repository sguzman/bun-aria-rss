We talk about some veteran winners (17:40) like Joe Burrow and Myles Gaskin and losers (22:46) like James Robinson. Then we'll get into the Aaron Rodgers mess (27:10) and talk a little Dynasty (31:00). What do the Dynasty rankings look like right now after the first round? Who is QB2? Should the WRs be picks 1-3? ... We have a bunch of Twitter polls about Round 1. Which Bengals WR is our favorite? Which rookie WR is our favorite? Najee Harris or Nick Chubb? D'Andre Swift or Travis Etienne? And we finish with some offensive line talk ... More from the NFL Draft including our thoughts on the QBs and the offensive linemen ...
