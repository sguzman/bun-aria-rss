I originally\nstarted this project to practice my web scraping and data engineering skills,\nbut as it&rsquo;s evolved I hope it can be a resource to solvers and constructors of\ncryptic crosswords.</p>\n<p>The project scrapes several blogs and digital archives for cryptic crosswords.\nOut of these collected web pages, the clues, answers, clue numbers, blogger’s\nexplanation and commentary, puzzle title and publication date are all parsed\nand extracted into a tabular dataset. The result (as of September 2021) is <strong>a\nlittle over half a million clues from cryptic crosswords over the past twelve\nyears</strong>, which makes for a rich and peculiar dataset.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, please check out\n<a href=\"https://cryptics.georgeho.org/\"><code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code></a>!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to cryptic crosswords, rejoice!
