According to Andy Frisella, most people don't understand that success takes time and tenacity. They don't have the aggressive patience necessary to succeed. Without it, they will bounce from one thing to the next and never enjoy the amazing results that are bound to come. Second: When it comes to personal branding, are you comfortable tooting your own horn? You need to be.  If you don't, nobody else will do it for you.</p>",
