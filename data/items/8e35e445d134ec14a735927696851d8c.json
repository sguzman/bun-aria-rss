  "title": "ZBT #49: Sailors Aren't Pussies",
  "description": "<p>This week's Zero Blog Thirty intro is given you to by some dandy a capella singers from the United States Air Force. Then they go over the recent comments from Secretary Mattis insisting that sailors are not, in fact, pussies, some news out of West Point (Cons went there, not sure if he's told you yet) and Chaps declaring it #PumpkinSZN. Also Michael Malice, author of Dear Reader, comes in to discuss North Korea and Cons gives us a Badass of the Week!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
