  "description": "A fateful moment in Kyle Mooney’s life was when his high school hip hop group went up in flames. Quite literally. All his equipment was destroyed in a fire. Lacking an outlet for his creativity, Kyle gravitated toward improv and making digital videos, two skills that would eventually land him on Saturday Night Live. Kyle tells Marc his SNL story (of course) and talks about the fulfillment of making his first feature film, Brigsby Bear. He also explains why he likes going for human reactions in comedy as opposed to the inherently funny ones, which explains the tone and humor of a lot of his videos. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://markmanson.net/books/everything-is-fucked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Manson's new book Everything is F*@!ed: A Book About Hope</a>, <a href=\"http://turo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turo</a>, <a href=\"http://allbirds.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allbirds</a>, and Starbucks Tripleshot Energy. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
