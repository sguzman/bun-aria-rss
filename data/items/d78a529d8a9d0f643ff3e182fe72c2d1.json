  "description": "<p>Does missionary work scare you? We can help! In Part II, our Fantastic Four (and others, especially Orson Pratt and Edward Partridge) discover the “field is white and ready to harvest.” Dr. Robert Millet shares how we are 11th Hour Workers and the Lord of the Vineyard is with his Servants and this episode will excite and encourage you to “open your mouth” and share the Good News. Additionally, if you know a Bishop, you’ll want to learn how Edward Partridge is a hero we should celebrate for “wasting and wearing out” his life for the Lord. You will never see missionary work or Bishops the same way again.<b><br/><br/></b>Shownotes: www.followhim.co<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FollowHimOfficialChannel<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/followhimpodcast<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/followhimpodcast</p>",
