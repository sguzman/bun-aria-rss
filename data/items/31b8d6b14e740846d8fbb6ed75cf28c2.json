  "description": "Call me, beep me, if you wanna reach me!\n\nSeriously though, we gave you guys the number. This week we opened the floodgates and invited you, the Sloots, to call Sofia for an interactive SOS (Save Our Sloots) session! In todays episode Sofia meets not only her new sister-in-law, but her doppelgänger as well. Things actually became SO personal that Sofia decided to call back one of the Sloots live on air. Which, we are so sorry your peaceful day was disturbed by an abrupt call from the Sloot Media offices, but we just had to get to the bottom of some things. From getting ear-fucked, to an open conversation about substance use and being neurodivergent, about every topic possible was touched on this week. A Mother Sloot even called to chat while her Baby Sloot was in the car! The Sloot’s are truly a DIVERSE crowd and this episode definitely proves it. And for that, we love you all and thank you for calling. Listen close, you may just hear your own voice!\n\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nDipsea: http://www.dipseastories.com/SOFIA for 30 days full access\nAway: http://www.awaytravel.com/SOFIA\nZola: http://www.Zola.com/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
