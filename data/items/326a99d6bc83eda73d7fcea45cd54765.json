  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part Six: Time. </strong></em>Today, we wrap up the first part of our series on 'Imaging,' focusing on the words of <strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong>: <em>\"For it is by </em><em><strong>grace</strong></em><em> you have been </em><em><strong>saved</strong></em><em>, through </em><em><strong>faith</strong></em><em>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by </em><em><strong>works</strong></em><em>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” </em><em><strong>Saved</strong></em><em> </em>is about Space & Time<em>. </em>As Jews thought about the Kingdom Of God, they used two grand eras: <strong>The Old Age</strong>, which was characterized by sin, death and evil, and the <strong>Age to Come</strong>, which was characterized by life, peace, justice and love. The Kingdom Of God was another way of talking about the age to come. In some ways, the two ages have overlapped. This is about <strong>Now and Not Yet</strong>. This is about how we <strong>Have Been Saved, We are Being Saved and We Will Be Saved</strong>.</p>\n<p>As we dig into these ideas, we are encouraged to avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Any theology that separates us from our bodies</li>\n <li>Any theology that is escapist</li>\n  <li>Any theology that privatizes the way of Jesus</li>\n  <li>Any theology that overemphasizes the now or the not yet</li>\n  <li>Any theology that overemphasizes or underemphasizes the reality of wrath and judgment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
