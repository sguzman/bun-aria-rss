    "media:description": "Archery with the with the worst possible bow.\n\nA friend of mine said he needed a expensive new 2018 bow\nto become a better archer!!\nThe next day I went to a building shop and bought a stick and a string and the following weeks I only did archery with my 7 dollar bow.\nToo low power, vibrate, bad to hold etc ..\n\nI love my various good bows, old advanced materials but also modern carbon and I think Holless Wilbur Allen invention of the compound bow is an genius invention for archery.\n\nBut it's definitely an educational experience to try archery with bad equipment and only dependent on own archery skills.\n\nIt is of course more difficult to shoot with a bad bow\n(Beginning must definitely use a good bow)\nAfterwards it was amazing to shoot with my normal good bows.\n\nSincerely\nLars Andersen",
