  "description": "<p>“I’m not sure what it is with society where people with disabilities are always an afterthought,” says Lakshmee Lachhman-Persad. For Lakshmee, a digital marketer with 20 years of experience in the tourism industry, the issue hits home. Her sister Annie was born with cerebral palsy, so Lakshmee knows firsthand how difficult it can be for a person with disabilities to navigate a city, even one as major and modern as New York, which they call home. In response, Lakshmee launched Accessible Travel NYC, a consultancy and website to help those looking to enjoy what New York has to offer by providing information on restaurants, transportation, accommodations, and more. Lakshmee shares her family’s story and also gives advice for those looking to make their businesses, events, or websites more accessible to the millions of people in this country with disabilities. You can visit Lakshmee’s site at <a href=\"http://www.accessibletravelnyc.com\">accessibletravelnyc.com</a>. </p><p>Thank you to Kerrygold for supporting today’s show.</p><p>Plus, tune in to find out why Denise Yamaguchi, the CEO of the Hawaii Food & Wine Festival in Honolulu, thinks Chef Michelle Karr-Ueoka of MW Restaurant in Honolulu is the Bombe!</p>\n",
