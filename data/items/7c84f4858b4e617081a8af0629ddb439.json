  "description": "In the late 1950s a young Frenchman, who now goes by the name Ted Morgan, was conscripted to fight for France against Algeria's independence fighters. He served as an intelligence officer during the Battle of Algiers, and over sixty years later he is still haunted by what he saw, and did. This included involvement in the systematic torture by the French of members of Algeria's National Liberation Front or FLN.  Ted Morgan spoke to Roger Hardy in 2010.\n\n(Photo: French soldiers in the Casbah of Algiers in 1960. Credit: Getty Images)",
