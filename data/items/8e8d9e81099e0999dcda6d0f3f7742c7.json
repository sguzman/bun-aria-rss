  "description": "<p>Happy New Year, everyone! Thank you for listening to Battles and Banter Podcast for their first full year as a show. If you've been with us through the ups and downs, we are eternally grateful for your support. We have a lot of great topics planned for 2021 so stay tuned, but we're going to end 2020 with some Star Wars. On this episode, Avery is joined by Mary Challman of the \"Monster Movie Happy Hour\" Podcast, Julia Wall and Justin Voithofer to discuss the first major engagement of the infamous Clone Wars: The First Battle of Geonosis. The four enjoy some beverages while discussing the chaotic nature of the battle on the red rock planet of Geonosis; the awesome, yet flawed tactics of the Jedi Strike Team, and the lasting ramifications of the Clone Troopers' first engagement with the Separatists' droid army. Keep your fingers crossed for a better year in 2021 and join us as we have some fun at the end of this dumpster fire of a year! Enjoy!</p>",
