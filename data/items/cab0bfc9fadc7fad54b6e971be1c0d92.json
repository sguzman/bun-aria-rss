  "description": "<p>We have the best hospitals, most highly trained doctors, and people come from all over the world to get medical treatments in the US. Yet, we’re lagging behind almost every other country in health metrics, including life expectancy and infant mortality. That’s because we’re not being set up for success: The policies and systems we rely on for healthcare aren’t supporting prevention, education, and accessibility for all our communities. We are spending a massive amount of money on healthcare (1 of every 5 federal dollars) but we’re not spending on the social services to invest in lifestyle wellness that prevents disease in the first place.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This week on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I sit down with Dr. Anand Parekh to talk about solutions to our country’s healthcare crisis and examine what’s already working. Dr. Parekh is the Bipartisan Policy Center’s (BPC) chief medical advisor, providing clinical and public health expertise across the organization, particularly in the areas of aging, prevention, and global health. Prior to joining BPC, he completed a decade of service at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As a HHS deputy assistant secretary for health from 2008 to 2015, he developed and implemented national initiatives focused on prevention, wellness, and care management. He has spoken widely and written extensively on a variety of health topics and is the author of a new book entitled <em>Prevention First – Policymaking for a Healthier America</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market.
