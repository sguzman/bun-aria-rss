  "description": "It's the end for Pinocchio. We left him last week the lead suspect in a murder investigation (no, I'm not joking), and we'll catch up to him on the beach, facing the authorities as he stands over the body with the murder weapon in hand. Also a lot of other stuff happens. Like, way too much stuff, like deep-fried puppets, snail butlers, and sleazy millionaires. And that's just in the first half of the episode. The creature this week is a gentleman who is so polite as to bow at every opportunity...but not so polite that he won't take every opportunity to fart out of his three anuses (still not joking). --- Next week: we're working, but there won't be an episode. Looking to subject yourself to more of my voice? Check out our other show, Fictional, where we adapt stories from classic literature and excellent public domain works.
