  "description": "If you've enjoyed listening to the dulcet Scottish tones of the Radio Lingua presenters, now is your chance to learn some Scottish yourself! Radio Lingua has launched a special three-part series introducing you to contemporary Scottish words and phrases. It's all supposed to be a bit of fun and is in aid of the Comic Relief charity which supports projects around the world. On 13th March 2009, all across the UK, people are encouraged to \"do something funny for money\", so we're launching our Coffee Break Scottish show and making it available for a one-off payment of £3.00, every penny of which goes straight to Comic Relief. Find out more at http://www.coffeebreakscottish.com - Please note that this is supposed to be very silly and is not intended to offend! We're simply trying to raise a bit of money for charity and have a linguistic laugh!",
