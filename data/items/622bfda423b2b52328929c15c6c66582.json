  "description": "<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been studied over decades to incorporate\ntheir biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency.\nThroughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly\nadopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with\ndifferent biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only\nsingle biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their\nexpressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF,\na unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal\nbehaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF,\ngating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused\nbio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable\nmembrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and\nconstantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of\nspiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate\nthat our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply\nchanging their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking\nResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on\nCIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.
