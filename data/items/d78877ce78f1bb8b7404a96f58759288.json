  "description": "As a region, it's very diverse and dynamic, with a lot to experience. Although I'm based in the Beijing office, I have opportunities to collaborate closely with my colleagues in Japan, India, Singapore and Australia. We find synergies and uniqueness in each market, and constantly share ideas and best practices. It's fun, but it's also an enriching learning experience to live and work in such an exciting region.",
