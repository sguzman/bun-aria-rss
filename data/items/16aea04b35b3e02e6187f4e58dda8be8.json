  "title": "Ep. 635 - The Democrats Set Out To Make Everything Worse",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the government is in the middle of an all out effort to find the people who stormed the Capitol and bring them to justice. But no such effort has been made against the BLM and Antifa rioters who have killed dozens and caused billions of dollars of damage. And it is this hypocrisy, inconsistency, and lack of equal justice, that partly leads to rioting in the first place, so it’s worth talking about. Also Five Headlines including the story of a woman who identifies as a fairy and her two lovers, a troll and a leprechaun. Classic love story. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll talk about president Trump’s second impeachment and why impeaching the president this time is an even worse idea than it was the first time. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
