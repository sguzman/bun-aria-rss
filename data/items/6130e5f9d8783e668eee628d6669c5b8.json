  "description": "Over the past year, Akamai Enterprise Threat Research team monitored the usage of one particular phishing toolkit in the wild. We previously wrote about this phishing toolkit  as \"Three Questions Quiz\". The \"Quiz\" toolkit is not new to the threat landscape, as its been used in many phishing campaigns in recent years. Our goal here is to present new insights on the evolution and scale of usage of the toolkit in the wild. The most surprising insight was the variety of commercial brands being abused as part of these phishing scams that were  all using the same toolkit, but wearing a different face.",
