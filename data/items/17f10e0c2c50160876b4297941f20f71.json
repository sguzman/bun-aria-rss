  "description": "<p>The Happy Face Killer. Wow. What a dirtbag! What an especially hate-able dude, even for a serial killer. Keith Hunter Jesperson raped and strangled at least eight women in the early 90s. His crimes were hard to link together because of the spread out location of the bodies - women's remained dumped off the side of various roads as he traveled around the United States, working as a long-haul trucker. Keith wrote to the press during his murders and signed his letters with a smiley face, why he was dubbed the \"Happy Face Killer\" by a journalist for the Oregonian. And we unravel his life and crimes on today's true crime edition of Timesuck!</p>\n<p><strong>Aiden's Heroes</strong>.
