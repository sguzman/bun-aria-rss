    "media:description": "This is the story of one of the important places in the history of the American Fighting Game Community. It’s a spot unlike any other. A hole in the wall. A community hub. A dingy little spot on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that many called home. \n\nToday, we’ll be exploring how one arcade survived and thrived for more than 60 years, and shaped the East Coast Fighting Game community into what it is today. From a tourist attraction to a proving ground for competitive gamers, this is Chinatown Fair.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://patreon.com/akshonesports\nSubscribe to our channel! https://goo.gl/OvCljl\n\nJoin our Discord community: https://discord.gg/ZHeCNJQUpY\n\nBecome a Member to support us: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dI8msF1_I9HuDSvMtk_nQ/join\n\nFollow us to stay up to date with our releases! \n\nWebsite: https://www.akshonmedia.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/akshonesports/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/akshonesports/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/akshonesports\n\n#videogames #gaming #fightinggames",
