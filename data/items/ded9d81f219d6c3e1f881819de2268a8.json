    "media:description": "Jenna has no idea what to do with her life and that's so valid\n\n30 Rock is streaming now on Peacock: https://bit.ly/3E0z4bO \n\nSeason 7 Episode 12, \"Hogc**k\": Liz wrestles with being a stay-at-hom mom and tries to re-enter the work world but Kenneth rejects her ideas for a new show. Jack tries to quantify his happiness by graphing it. Jenna attempts to reinvigorate her acting career and Tracey misses Kenneth's friendship. Jack fakes suicidal tendencies so that he and Liz can make up after they fight. In a final showdown with Liz, Tracey is determined to stop the last eps of TGS so that he can receive 30million per his contract, but it turns out his motivations are deeper than expected. Jenna finds a way to connect to her emotions and Lutz chooses the writers' lunch.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/2wnzhDx \n\n30 Rock Synopsis: Emmy®-winner Tina Fey writes, executive produces and stars as writer Liz Lemon in 30 Rock, an irreverent, wildly funny, Emmy®-winning workplace comedy set behind-the-scenes of a live variety show. The series is told through the comedic voice of Fey and features the inimitable and Emmy®-winning Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, the brash network executive who turns Liz's show (and life) upside down with his meddling ways. Set in New York City, 30 Rock also stars Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Scott Adsit, and Jack McBrayer, and boasts a cavalcade of guest appearances from some of the most respected and recognizable faces in comedy.\n\n#30Rock #TinaFey #AlecBaldwin #Comedy #NBCU #PeacockTV\n\nThis is the official YouTube channel for 30 Rock.
