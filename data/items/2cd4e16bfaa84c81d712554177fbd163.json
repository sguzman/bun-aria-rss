  "description": "<p>We're marking the end of America's longest war with what may be the longest episode of this podcast to date, featuring not one but two interviews. I'm first joined by Mena Ayazi of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sfcg.org/\">Search for Common Ground</a> and Kate Kizer of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://winwithoutwar.org/\">Win Without War</a> (and <em>Foreign Exchanges</em>) to talk about Joe Biden's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan and how the United States could provide actual assistance to the Afghan people in lieu of endless war. Then I'm joined by Fatemeh Aman of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mei.edu/\">Middle East Institute</a> to talk about the effect the withdrawal is likely to have in Afghanistan and throughout its geopolitical neighborhood.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
