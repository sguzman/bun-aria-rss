  "description": "Lieutenant George W. Starks' worst fear came true when his B-17 was shot down over Nazi-occupied<br /><br />France. Earlier that morning, the boyish 20-year-old and his crew were assigned to the most exposed<br /><br />section of the bomber formation: the “coffin corner.” Now, scattered across the countryside of<br /><br />Champagne, each of the B-17’s ten American crew members discarded his parachutes and began a<br /><br />wartime trek. Some were hidden by heroic civilians, a few were saved by the French underground,<br /><br />others fell into the hands of the Nazis, but all miraculously survived.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Carole Engle Avriett, joins me on the podcast today. She is author of the book Coffin Corner Boys:<br /><br />One Bomber, Ten Men, and Their Harrowing Escape from Nazi-Occupied France to tell these<br /><br />stories. She worked with Captain George W. Starks—now ninety-four years old—to bring them to<br /><br />light.",
