  "description": "<p>You are the creator of your mind, body, and universe. Our experience of the world, our identity, and our physical reality are based on our learned perceptions. But when we get aware of our own awareness and ask ourselves some important questions, we can break down false beliefs of our own experience in this life to end suffering and find infinite joy and possibility. If this sounds pretty deep, it is. But as my guest on this week’s episode of The Doctor’s Farmacy explains it can actually be quite simple.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Deepak Chopra is the founder of The Chopra Foundation, a non-profit entity for research on wellbeing and humanitarianism, and Chopra Global, a modern-day health company at the intersection of science and spirituality, is a world-renowned pioneer in integrative medicine and personal transformation. Chopra is a Clinical Professor of Family Medicine and Public Health at the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of over 89 books translated into over forty-three languages, including numerous <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. His 90th book and national bestseller, <em>Metahuman: Unleashing Your Infinite Potential</em>, unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations to access a field of infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Nutpods.
