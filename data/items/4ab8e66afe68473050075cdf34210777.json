  "itunes:summary": "In locking down large segments of society, governments across the world have a responsibility to support the poorest and most vulnerable. This applies to both developed and developing countries alike. In this VoxDev talk, Clement Imbert and Kate Orkin discuss the tools available to policymakers in developing countries that best mitigate the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on societyâ€™s most vulnerable. These include job retention schemes, low interest credit, and unconditional cash transfers. Governments must ensure that nets are cast wide enough in these types of social protection programmes.",
